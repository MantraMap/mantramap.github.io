<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FBI searches home of Kraken founder Jesse Powell in a hacking investigation.</em></li>



<li><em>Allegations involve interference with nonprofit&#8217;s computer accounts.</em></li>



<li><em>Powell not charged, lawyer asserts innocence and unrelatedness to the crypto industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jesse Powell, the founder and former CEO of crypto exchange Kraken, has recently come under the scrutiny of federal authorities as the FBI conducted a search of his Los Angeles home earlier this year.</strong></h5>

<p>This investigation is linked to allegations of hacking and cyberstalking involving the Verge Center for the Arts, a nonprofit organization.</p>



<p>Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office for the Northern District of California have been actively investigating Jesse Powell since at least the fall of last year. The Verge Center for the Arts accused Powell of interfering with its computer accounts, including blocking access to emails and other forms of communication.</p>



<p>According to reports from <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/technology/jesse-powell-kraken-crypto-fbi.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a></em>, law enforcement agents conducted a search of Powell&#8217;s Brentwood residence, seizing electronic devices as part of their investigation. It is important to note that Powell has not been formally charged with any criminal offenses related to the investigation.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-469.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-469.png" alt="FBI Targets Kraken Founder Jesse Powell In Startling Hacking Probe" class="wp-image-200850" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-469.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-469-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-469-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-469-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="FBI Targets Kraken Founder Jesse Powell In Startling Hacking Probe 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>In response to the allegations, Jesse Powell&#8217;s legal counsel, Brandon Fox of Jenner &amp; Block, issued a statement emphasizing that the Verge Center for the Arts had presented a one-sided account and failed to provide the government with the complete picture. Fox stated that Powell &#8220;did nothing wrong&#8221; and asserted that the matter at hand was unrelated to Powell&#8217;s employment or his conduct in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>While Jesse Powell stepped down as the CEO of Kraken late last year, he continues to serve as the chairman of the board. Powell&#8217;s involvement with the Sacramento-based arts group, Verge Center for the Arts, dates back to its founding in 2007, although his LinkedIn profile indicates his role as a founder and board member starting from April 2010.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199312-kraken-requested-irs-for-customer-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a>, in response to the ongoing investigation, clarified that the matter is separate from the company&#8217;s activities and expressed no indication that prosecutors are examining other potential issues related to Kraken.</p>



<p>As the legal proceedings unfold, the focus will be on the outcome of the investigation and any official statements from the involved parties or law enforcement agencies. The case has drawn attention within the cryptocurrency industry, highlighting the increased scrutiny faced by high-profile figures and institutions operating in the sector.</p>

<li><em>Barnbridge DAO faces SEC investigation, suspends operations and liquidity pools.</em></li>



<li><em>Legal counsel advises halting work and compensation related to Barnbridge.</em></li>



<li><em>Regulatory scrutiny casts uncertainty on the future of Barnbridge and highlights industry challenges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a stunning turn of events, BarnBridge DAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, finds itself at the center of an investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover.webp"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-1024x538.webp" alt="Barnbridge DAO Forced To Halt Operations Amidst SEC Investigating" class="wp-image-200827" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-1024x538.webp 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-300x158.webp 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-768x403.webp 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-1536x806.webp 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-2048x1075.webp 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-750x394.webp 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/barnbridge-cover-1140x599.webp 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Barnbridge DAO Receives Regulatory Storm Attack From SEC, BOND Drops More Than 8% 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>The regulatory body is focusing its scrutiny on both <a href="https://coincu.com/148908-barnbridge-dao-migrates-to-arbitrum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BarnBridge DAO</a> as an entity and the individuals associated with the project. As a result, duly legal counsel of the DAO, Douglas Park, has <a href="https://twitter.com/Barn_Bridge/status/1677110787780018176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advised</a> the immediate closure of existing liquidity pools and a complete halt in all activities related to BarnBridge products.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s ongoing investigation remains undisclosed and confidential, limiting the information that can be shared publicly. To mitigate potential legal liabilities, compensation for work related to BarnBridge is suspended until further notice. Furthermore, key figures within the project, including Co-Founder Tyler Scott Ward and Troy Murray, have refrained from making any comments regarding the investigation or matters concerning BarnBridge DAO.</p>

<p>BarnBridge DAO has gained recognition for its innovative approach to DeFi, aiming to tokenize risk and revolutionize risk management within the decentralized finance ecosystem. By allowing investors to customize risk exposure through tokenized investments, the platform attracts both risk-averse individuals and traditional financial institutions. However, the SEC&#8217;s investigation has cast a shadow of uncertainty over BarnBridge&#8217;s future prospects.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-458.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-458.png" alt="Barnbridge DAO Forced To Halt Operations Amidst SEC Investigating" class="wp-image-200826" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-458.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-458-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-458-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-458-750x450.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Barnbridge DAO Receives Regulatory Storm Attack From SEC, BOND Drops More Than 8% 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>The ongoing scrutiny of BarnBridge DAO serves as a stark reminder of the increasing regulatory pressure facing the DeFi industry. As decentralized finance continues to gain prominence, compliance with securities regulations becomes a critical consideration for platforms operating in this space.</p>



<p>Market participants and industry observers will closely monitor developments surrounding the SEC investigation and await official statements from both the regulatory body and BarnBridge DAO. The outcome of this probe will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future trajectory of BarnBridge and potentially shape the regulatory landscape for the broader DeFi industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance leaves the Dutch market due to licensing issues, transferring customers to Coinmerce.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinmerce has become the largest crypto exchange in the Netherlands.</em></li>



<li><em>Dutch Central Bank monitors the secure transition of the exchange&#8217;s customers to Coinmerce.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its departure from the Dutch market. This decision comes after Binance failed to secure a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Dutch authority, which certifies compliance with anti-money laundering regulations. Effective from July 17, 2023, the exchange will no longer be available for trading in the Netherlands.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454-1024x683.png" alt="Binance Abandons Dutch Market, Coinmerce Becomes Largest Exchange In Netherlands" class="wp-image-200816" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454-1140x760.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-454.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Abandons Dutch Market, Coinmerce Becomes Largest Exchange In Netherlands 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Coinmerce, a registered crypto platform, has stepped in to absorb Binance Netherlands&#8217; customers, assets, and offerings. With this transfer, Coinmerce is <a href="https://coinmerce.io/en/news/binance-offers-dutch-users-switch-to-coinmerce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">poised</a> to become the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the Netherlands in terms of products, assets, and user base. The Dutch Central Bank will oversee the smooth transition of Binance customers to Coinmerce, ensuring a secure and orderly transfer process.</p>



<p>The decision to exit the Dutch market is part of Binance&#8217;s strategic plan to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain a trusted environment for its users. <a href="https://coincu.com/200786-binance-in-crisis-executives-flee-storms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> will facilitate the transition by referring hundreds of thousands of Dutch users to Coinmerce. The platform will provide a seamless experience for customers to transfer their digital assets from the exchange to their platform.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s regulatory challenges have been escalating in recent weeks, with the <a href="https://coincu.com/196803-binance-failed-to-register-netherlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netherlands</a> being the latest jurisdiction to reject its application for a VASP license. Similar rejections were faced in Germany, where the exchange&#8217;s crypto custody license application was denied. The exchange is committed to ongoing engagement with German authorities to explore potential solutions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-456.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-456.png" alt="Binance Abandons Dutch Market, Coinmerce Becomes Largest Exchange In Netherlands" class="wp-image-200818" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-456.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-456-300x188.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-456-768x480.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-456-750x469.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Binance Abandons Dutch Market, Coinmerce Becomes Largest Exchange In Netherlands 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Coinmerce, on the other hand, has been recognized for its adherence to European laws and regulations, prioritizing a secure and compliant trading environment since its establishment in 2018. The partnership with Binance reinforces Coinmerce&#8217;s commitment to ensuring a trusted platform for the referred users. The transfer process will be simplified and guided by a step-by-step procedure initiated by Binance, allowing for a secure and hassle-free transition.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-1024x340.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="340" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-1024x340.png" alt="Binance Abandons Dutch Market, Coinmerce Becomes Largest Exchange In Netherlands" class="wp-image-200819" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-1024x340.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-300x100.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-768x255.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-1536x510.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-750x249.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457-1140x379.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-457.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Abandons Dutch Market, Coinmerce Becomes Largest Exchange In Netherlands 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>The decision by Binance to refer its Dutch customers to Coinmerce underscores its dedication to facilitating uninterrupted trading for its users. Coinmerce&#8217;s status as a registered platform, approved by the central bank, played a significant role in the exchange&#8217;s choice.</p>



<p>The exchange has <a href="https://coincu.com/109780-binance-was-fined-3-3-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faced</a> increased regulatory scrutiny in recent times, including the imposition of fines by the Dutch central bank last year for unauthorized operations. The ongoing regulatory challenges, such as the recent raid on Binance premises in France and charges by U.S. regulators, have further highlighted the intensifying regulatory environment faced by the exchange.</p>



<p>As the exchange exits the Dutch market, the focus now turns to Coinmerce, which assumes the mantle of the largest crypto exchange in the Netherlands, catering to the needs of a growing user base seeking reliable and compliant trading services in the country.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Many crypto users discovered that the Multichain cross-chain bridge was transferring large amounts of crypto to the outside world for unknown reasons.</em></li>



<li><em>The incident affects about $130 million in assets on Fantom, Moonriver, and Dogechain chains.</em></li>



<li><em>Multichain has yet to release any information about the above transfers and asked users to stop using the service in conjunction with revoking approvals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nearly $130 million worth of tokens were withdrawn from the Multichain bridge on the Fantom network, and security firms speculated that this could be a security flaw.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-1024x576.png" alt="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause" class="wp-image-200811" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-452.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The tokens transferred include $58 million USDC stablecoin, 1020 WBTC (approximately $30.9 million), 7,200 WETH (approximately $13.7 million), and $4 million DAI stablecoin (valued at around $30.9 million) of the above 4 tokens over $100 million), also includes other tokens such as Chainlink, Curve DAO, YFI, Wootrade Network and almost a quarter of UniDex&#8217;s total supply.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@MultichainOrg</a> you may want to take a look:  <a href="https://t.co/D4GKGpuBtw" target="_blank">https://t.co/D4GKGpuBtw</a> <a href="https://t.co/3qURqGmes8" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3qURqGmes8</a></p>&mdash; PeckShield Inc.

<p>Assets also appear to be moving on Multichain&#8217;s Moonriver bridge, including 4.8 million USDC and 1 million USDT. Dogechain also experienced unusual fund flow. At least 660,000 USDC was sent to the same wallet as Moonriver&#8217;s fund flow.</p>



<p>Security firm Paidun questions whether this could be related to the addition of support for four tokens (USDC, USDT, WETH, and WBTC) on the LayerZero cross-chain platform, which overlaps but is only partially consistent with the tokens being migrated.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-1024x512.png" alt="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause" class="wp-image-200813" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-453.png 1448w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Multichain Bridge Trouble Again, $130M Assets Withdrawn For Unknown Cause 15"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>LayerZero CEO Bryan Pellegrino responded that the issue had nothing to do with the platform and believed it was a hack targeting Multichain. According to Pellegrino, users of the Multichain bridge can withdraw assets, bringing them to LayerZero.</p>



<p>However, Igor Igamberdiev, research director at Wintermute, says that this is likely the job of whoever controls Multichain, as Fantom funds are not destroyed when the transaction occurs. Igamberdiev also noted that oddly enough, the wallet that received the bulk of USDC also made a transaction from the old Binance Smart Chain bridge a few hours earlier.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Bridge Protocol announced that locked assets had been moved irregularly, and users were advised to suspend the use of Multichain services in conjunction with the <a href="https://t.co/fUNafBC0UA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revocation</a> of all approvals chain-related contracts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally. <br>The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating. <br><br>It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals…</p>&mdash; Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677096839731097600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The incident caused great disappointment to the community because the operation of Multichain resumed not long after the incident at the end of May 2023. This project once caused a stir with the news that the CEO <a href="https://coincu.com/191300-multichain-lost-contact-with-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was arrested </a>by the Chinese police and lost access to the bridges, causing all activities to be stopped.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As markets and the global environment for crypto changes, as our organization evolves, and as personal situations change, there is turnover at every company. We thank all of our ex-team members for their contributions to our growth, and wish them all the best.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>CZ also confirmed that it will continue to grow and continue to recruit.</p>



<p>Earlier today, Fortune magazine <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited </a>three Binance executives who resigned this week as Binance General Counsel Han Ng, Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, and Senior Vice President of Compliance. Prime Minister Steven Christie.</p>

<p>Reportedly, their departure is related to the reaction of Binance founder Zhao Changpeng to the ongoing investigation by the US Department of Justice. Hillmann later confirmed his departure on Twitter and said he would &#8220;continue to respect and support&#8221; Changpeng Zhao. According to previous news, Matthew Price, Binance&#8217;s senior director of investigations, recently resigned.</p>



<p>Binance has been under strain for months amid regulatory investigations that have severed many of its key banking relationships globally.</p>



<p>Despite the difficulties, Binance and Coinbase staged a counter-attack by protesting the charges from the SEC and asserting their compliance with US laws. This is a bright spot, helping exchanges focus on restoring user confidence and proving their credibility.</p>



<p>The common point of Binance FUD times is that user assets are massively withdrawn from Binance and other centralized exchanges. Causing the trading volume on CEXs to drop sharply. However, the quick and timely responses of the CEO of Binance can be said to be always quick to stabilize the psychology of users.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Top executives resign from Binance amid regulatory investigations.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange faces multiple regulatory challenges globally.</em></li>



<li><em>Operations and market share of the exchange are affected by the investigations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortune</a></em>, Binance, the renowned cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself in a state of turmoil as key executives step down following CEO Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s handling of the ongoing regulatory investigations.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1024x589.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="589" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1024x589.png" alt="Binance In Crisis When Executives Flee Regulatory Storms" class="wp-image-200792" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1024x589.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-300x173.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-768x442.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-750x431.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449-1140x656.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-449.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance In Crisis When Executives Flee Regulatory Storms 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The departures of senior figures, including the general counsel, chief strategy officer, and compliance SVP, signify a critical management and strategic crisis for <a href="https://coincu.com/200606-binance-unleashes-wallet-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a>, intensifying the pressure as these units are directly engaged with regulatory matters.</p>



<p>The resignation of top executives is expected to complicate Binance&#8217;s defense efforts as it faces multiple investigations from regulators worldwide. Notably, the United States Department of Justice has been conducting a probe into alleged attempts by the exchange to deceive regulators, as well as potential money laundering and sanctions violations on its platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that I am leaving Binance,&#8221; Hillmann <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1677070523740884992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>, adding that he was departing on good terms and continuing to respect and support Zhao.</p>



<p>Alongside lawsuits filed by the <a href="https://coincu.com/200007-sec-v-coinbase-2300-crypto-holders-amici-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), rumors have circulated that the Justice Department is on the verge of issuing criminal charges against both Binance and CEO <a href="https://coincu.com/191314-changpeng-zhao-denies-rumors-of-laying-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>.</p>

<p>The regulatory challenges have already taken a toll on the exchange&#8217;s operations. The exchange&#8217;s U.S. business and international trading arm have been significantly impacted, with U.S. regulators suspecting a deep interconnection between the two. The loss of a major European banking partner and the decision to halt trading in U.S. dollars by Binance.US further illustrate the consequences of these investigations.</p>

<p>Despite being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has experienced a decline in market share recently. This decline is attributed to the mounting regulatory pressures and the severing of banking relationships, restricting the exchange&#8217;s access to fiat currencies.</p>



<p>While there have been speculations about potential succession plans and CZ stepping aside to help Binance navigate the storm, CEO Changpeng Zhao has not shown any intention of relinquishing his position. As a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency industry, his decisions and leadership will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the exchange.</p>



<p>As the situation continues to unfold, it is important to remain updated on the latest developments. Binance&#8217;s response and official statements should be monitored to understand the ongoing impact of these regulatory challenges on the cryptocurrency exchange industry as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Georgian Co-Investment Fund founder George Bachiashvili was charged with cryptocurrency misappropriation and money laundering.</em></li>



<li><em>Allegations claim he obtained a substantial amount of Bitcoin through mining in 2015 using raised funds.</em></li>



<li><em>Bachiashvili could face nine to twelve years in prison; the fund denies involvement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>George Bachiashvili, the founder of the prominent Georgian Co-Investment Fund, is facing serious charges of cryptocurrency misappropriation and money laundering, as reported by Georgian news outlet <em><a href="https://agenda.ge/en/news/2023/2656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Agenda</a></em>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="976" height="661" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445.png" alt="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal" class="wp-image-200781" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445.png 976w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445-300x203.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445-768x520.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-445-750x508.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 976px) 100vw, 976px" title="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Georgia alleges that Bachiashvili, who played a key role in managing the $6 billion private equity fund contributing significantly to the nation&#8217;s GDP, unlawfully obtained a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, particularly <a href="https://coincu.com/200621-bitcoin-waiting-for-the-next-bull-run-at-35500/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>, dating back to 2015.</p>



<p>Investigation findings reveal that Bachiashvili utilized funds personally raised by himself and an undisclosed investor to invest in Bitcoin mining. A foreign firm was contracted for mining services, with the total agreement valued at $6.3 million, with the investor contributing $5 million to the venture.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447.png" alt="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal" class="wp-image-200783" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-447-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="Founder Of Georgian Co-Investment Fund Charged In Cryptocurrency Scandal 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Prosecutor&#8217;s Office claims that Bachiashvili later seized the generated profit of 8,253.13 Bitcoins in 2017, amounting to over $39 million. Only a meager $536,900 was reportedly paid to the investor. Bachiashvili allegedly concealed the details of the misappropriated funds, transferring them to various wallets for undisclosed financial operations, enabling him to freely manage and utilize the illegal proceeds. He is a significant person in Georgia, having formed a private equity business that accounts for around 40% of Georgia&#8217;s GDP.</p>



<p>If found guilty, Bachiashvili could face a prison sentence ranging from nine to twelve years. In response to the charges, the Georgian Co-Investment Fund released a statement clarifying that the organization was not involved in the alleged actions. They further emphasized that Bachiashvili had not served as a director for several years, highlighting a distinction between his individual actions and the activities of the fund.</p>

<p>The adoption of these assets on Fantom will bring much-needed stability and longevity for projects utilizing them as liquidity, collateral, stores of value, and more. LayerZero-powered assets are already widely used as canonical assets across a number of ecosystems, and the introduction of these assets will ensure that the Fantom ecosystem can continue to grow with the trust of its users. The new tokens will be able to be bridged between Fantom and Ethereum via <a href="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989317858889728" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/LayerZero_Labs/status/1676989317858889728" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stargate Finance</a>. </p>



<p>This announcement comes ahead of Fantom&#8217;s next two major milestones, Carmen and Tosca. With over a dozen of the most recognizable teams building on Fantom, the platform is poised for further growth and adoption in the coming months.</p>

As a precautionary measure, users have been warned against clicking on any suspicious links or engaging in questionable activities.</p>



<p>Last month, the Uniswap Foundation <a href="https://coincu.com/195595-uniswap-cross-chain-bridge-assessment/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/195595-uniswap-cross-chain-bridge-assessment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared </a>an assessment report on cross-chain bridges, providing insights into the analysis of various protocols. According to the report, LayerZero did not fully meet all the requirements at the time of evaluation. However, the foundation noted that LayerZero is actively working towards fulfilling these requirements through a planned upgrade to its Oracle and relayer set. The Committee strongly urges the LayerZero team to implement this upgrade swiftly and recommends conducting a reassessment after the new configuration has been operational for at least three months.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Taylor Swift reportedly had a partnership deal with FTX crypto exchange, despite previous denials.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried decided not to proceed with the deal.</em></li>



<li><em>The agreement contradicts earlier explanations, and Bankman-Fried is facing criminal charges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a surprising turn of events, recent reports suggest that <a href="https://coincu.com/149906-taylor-swift-was-on-ftx-sponsor-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift</a> may have been involved in a partnership deal with the now-defunct FTX crypto exchange, despite previous public denials.</strong></h5>

<p>Sources familiar with the matter have disclosed with <em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/06/taylor-swift-agreed-to-ftx-partnership-despite-contrary-public-claims-source.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em> that the popstar had agreed to a collaboration, only for it to be thwarted by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently embroiled in legal troubles.</p>



<p>Contradicting earlier statements made by a class-action attorney, it appears that Swift did, in fact, entertain the idea of a partnership. The signed agreement was allegedly sent to Bankman-Fried&#8217;s email inbox, where it languished unanswered for several weeks. Eventually, a group of FTX executives reportedly convinced Bankman-Fried to abandon the proposed $100 million deal, painting a markedly different picture from the narrative surrounding Swift&#8217;s supposed withdrawal.</p>

<p>The nature of the agreement, which was initially reported by <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/technology/tom-brady-crypto-ftx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a></em>, challenges the public messaging surrounding the failed FTX-Swift deal. Previously, a high-profile attorney had praised Swift&#8217;s due diligence efforts and claimed that she rejected the deal after questioning <a href="https://coincu.com/199738-ftx-announces-to-launch-customer-claims-portal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> about the status of its listed assets as unregistered securities. However, multiple sources, speaking anonymously due to ongoing legal proceedings, revealed that Swift&#8217;s team signed the deal after six months of negotiations, with <a href="https://coincu.com/198247-bankman-fried-pretrial-motions-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a> ultimately halting its progression.</p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s subsequent filing for bankruptcy in November added further complications to the unfolding narrative. Bankman-Fried now faces criminal charges related to alleged fraud and money laundering, while three other FTX executives have pleaded guilty to federal charges and are cooperating with the government&#8217;s prosecution.</p>



<p>The existence of an FTX-Swift partnership was first reported by <em>The Financial Times</em>, introducing an intriguing twist to an already convoluted situation. As the story develops, more information is likely to emerge, shedding light on the true extent of Taylor Swift&#8217;s involvement with FTX and the reasons behind its ultimate collapse.</p>
