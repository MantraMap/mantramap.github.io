										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame is at it again. This time, he’s <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/bitcoin-forecast-crypto-currency-sec-blackrock-gains-tom-lee-fundstrat-2023-6">commenting in a recent interview</a> that the price of bitcoin could reach a whopping $200,000 in the next few years, though he didn’t give a specific date this time around.</p>
<h2>Tom Lee: BTC is Going to $200K</h2>
<p>In the discussion, Lee said he’s been following Cathie Wood. Not long ago, the main madam behind Ark Invest said she thinks bitcoin <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cathie-wood-btc-will-be-priced-at-1-5-million-in-2030/">could reach a price</a> that surpasses the million-dollar mark in the next seven years or so, and Lee doesn’t think she’s that off, clearly complimenting her confidence. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think her idea of network value for bitcoin and scarcity still argues that, if this isn&#8217;t an upcycle, her numbers are correct, you know, something in the $200,000-plus range.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom Lee has always been there to give his BTC predictions. Whether the world’s number one digital asset goes up or down, you can bet that Lee will be there in the shadows deciding or commenting about where it will go next. This would all be fine and dandy except for one thing… He hasn’t been right that often.</p>
<p>For example, at the end of 2018, Lee regularly stated that bitcoin was going to end the year on a high note. Prior to last year, 2018 was considered the worst period on record for bitcoin. During that time, BTC started at around $20K during the first few weeks of January. Over the next 12 months, it wound up in the mid-$3,000 range. It was embarrassing, it was sad, and a lot of traders lost way more than they bargained for.</p>
<p>However, while the currency continued to meander through the doldrums and show the world it wasn’t listening to what people wanted, Lee was there saying the asset was going to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fundstrats-tom-lee-sticks-by-15000-for-bitcoin-year-end-price/">end 2018 at around</a> $15,000. This didn’t occur as we all remember, and the situation was so crippling that eventually Lee commented that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tom-lee-announces-hes-no-longer-predicting-bitcoin-prices/">he wasn’t going to be making</a> any more price predictions and would instead focus on the power and technicality behind BTC.</p>
<h2>Former Statements Clearly Mean Nothing</h2>
<p>This clearly isn’t happening, as here he is again saying bitcoin will rise out of the ashes. He says one big thing that’s happened over the past year or so is that many negative players have either gotten out of crypto or been forced to walk away, but they’ve all been replaced with compliant, positive entities. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s been sort of a stage exit stage left for a lot of players, but then we&#8217;ve replaced them with, you know, some of the traditional players that have a lot of credibility, like BlackRock and the Citadels coming into bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, bitcoin reached $31K, the highest it’s been in about <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/">four months</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wyoming, despite its lack of a population, has been <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/wyoming-regulatory-clarity-and-crypto-friendly-banks-fuel-blockchain-revolution-1032412121">on a mission to become</a> one of the most – if not <em>the</em> most – crypto-friendly regions known to man, and thus far, it’s succeeding.</p>
<h2>Wyoming Still Loves Crypto</h2>
<p>Over the past seven years, Wyoming has passed more than 30 crypto-based laws designed to regulate the industry, grow innovation, and make things safer. Steve Lupien – director of the Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation at the University of Wyoming – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing a lot of companies that are moving to Wyoming. Last time I checked, there were over 3,000 companies that domiciled in Wyoming, and there are probably more now.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of these companies are bringing either crypto or tech-oriented jobs. Lupien has seen a lot of his students graduate and leave Wyoming over the years. It’s estimated that about 70 percent of the graduates of the University of Wyoming leave their home state for “greener pastures,” though he thinks that’s going to change very quickly in the coming months and years given all the big tech-related alterations that are happening within the region’s borders.</p>
<p>Lupien said that the new statistics should be giving a lot of his future students hope that they may not have to leave to find work if they don’t want to. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It gives my university graduates an opportunity to work in the digital asset space and not have to leave the state. [Several] of my graduates are now working for Wyoming companies or [have] started Wyoming companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the big crypto-friendly laws to be passed in the state involves one where crypto is placed on par with cash, so when one needs to file bankruptcy, for example, like the cash in their wallets, they don’t have to forfeit digital assets, meaning whatever bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoin units they have in their pockets will stay there.</p>
<p>However, while things may look positive and clear on the horizon, Wyoming is experiencing a few problems here and there, a big one coming in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-bank-custodia-sees-its-fed-application-denied/">the form of Custodia</a>. The digital financial firm was denied access to Federal Reserve banking services not too long ago, and thus the enterprise has a cloud hovering over its operations.</p>
<h2>The Bank Can Still Win</h2>
<p>But while this may be scary at first, Lupien is confident Custodia will get its way, and all will be resolved in the end. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Custodia prevails, Wyoming will be ground zero for digital assets banking because there are four Wyoming SPDIs standing by ready to operate as soon as the Fed relents, [and] the court will make them.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to all this, the state is headed by the most crypto-friendly <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/cynthia-lummis/">senator in congressional history</a>, and her name is Cynthia Lummis.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap is a crypto firm that started about five years ago. The company <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/uniswaps-hayden-adams-q-a-on-weathering-the-regulatory-storm-what-s-next-for-defi/ar-AA1d4Gf7">introduced the world</a> to the automated market maker (AMM). The tool works to let people swap currencies on various exchanges and networks without the aid of middlemen.</p>
<h2>Uniswap Has Come a Long Way</h2>
<p>The company has grown into something nobody was expecting. Uniswap now processes about $1 trillion in blockchain transactions on various networks. In a recent interview, the company’s CEO Hayden Adams talks about the latest Uniswap updates and about all the public comments the company has gotten since opening itself up to critiques.</p>
<p>Uniswap is now in what’s called the V4 phase. In other words, this is “version four.” There have been enough updates to the platform that the version users see now is the fourth major adaptation. Discussing the latest example, Adams said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, the way that new protocol versions have come out has been almost more like products, in the sense that they&#8217;ve been basically announced when they&#8217;re almost done, and that was sort of, I think, something that made sense at the time, but with where the Uniswap protocol is today, building in public and inviting the community to build alongside us and contribute to this decentralized protocol is a [good] thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the big clinchers of the platform is that it now comes with what are called “hooks.” These are tools that expand upon the functionality of staking pools. Discussing their functions, he mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>What you find in the process of building things like Uniswap is that you make a lot of trade-offs. Hooks are essentially ways of customizing and modifying how liquidity pools work within Uniswap. These are done by the people who create pools. Anyone can create a pool and then choose how to customize it. What we wanted to do with hooks is let people basically make these trade-offs themselves and really choose how their pool works.</p></blockquote>
<p>Adams also talked a bit about the lawsuits the SEC has initiated against <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a>. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t really know too much about those lawsuits. Generally, I think that DeFi and decentralized platforms are quite different from centralized ones. There are different properties, and so I don&#8217;t have a ton to add. Personally, I do think that over time I always expect to see more decentralized platforms over centralized ones. I think there are fundamental benefits of self-custody, transparency that they can offer, provable solvency, all these things.</p></blockquote>
<h2>It&#8217;s All too New</h2>
<p>When discussing the potential regulation of his own company, he mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have lawyers, and we make sure that everything that we do is legal and all of that. I would say that the way I think about the space, though, is DeFi is a new industry.</p></blockquote>

<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $234 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $242 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining below the $242 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could extend losses if there is a close below $220.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price remained in a bearish zone below the $255 and $250 resistance levels. BCH traded below the $242 support level to move further into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $235 zone. The price is now moving lower below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $217 swing low to the $249 high. The bears seem to be in control below $242 and $250.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash is now trading below the $240 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-risk-of-downside-thrust-below-230/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $234 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $232 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The next key resistance is near the trend line and $235. Any more gains above $235 could set the pace for a move toward the $242 level. If there is a move above the $242 resistance, the price could rise toward the $250 zone.</p>
<p>If not, the price might continue lower below $230. Immediate support on the downside is near the $225 zone. The next major support is near the $220 level, below which the bears might aim for $215 or even $205.</p>

<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.7190 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.720 and $0.740 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.720 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.740.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, EOS price saw a fresh decline from the $0.775 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.75 and $0.74 levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The pair even spiked below the $0.705 support. A low is formed near $0.7014 and the price is now consolidating losses. EOS is trading well below $0.725 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-risk-of-more-losses-below-0-73/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.719 level.</p>
<p>There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.7190 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7767 swing high to the $0.7014 low.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $0.74 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7767 swing high to the $0.7014 low. A clear move above the $0.74 level could start a steady increase toward the $0.75 level.</p>

<li>Litecoin is showing bearish signs and trading below $90 against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>LTC price is now trading below $85 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $83.80 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a decent increase if it clears the $85 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Litecoin price is struggling below $85 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to decline if it stays below the $85 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, there was a short-lived recovery in Bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-resume-increase-above-1885/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, Ripple, and Litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC settled below the $90 resistance zone to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The price broke the $85 support zone and started a fresh decline. It even traded below the $82 support. A low is formed near $79.19 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below $85 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $84 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $83.80 on the 4-hour chart of the LTC/USD pair. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $99.60 swing high to the $79.19 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $89 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $99.60 swing high to the $79.19 low. A clear move above the $89 level could pump the price toward the $95 level. The next major resistance could be $100.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $81 level. The next key support is near the $80 level. If there is a downside break below the $80 support, the price could accelerate lower toward the $75 level in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rob Nelson – the anchor of Roundtable – recently hosted a <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/the-global-impact-of-offshore-blockchain-technologies/ar-AA1d44gG">discussion about the</a> impacts of global offshore blockchain companies.</p>
<h2>Is Blockchain Underused in America?</h2>
<p>The discussion primarily centered on the technology itself and on what countries stand to lose if they allow the competition regarding blockchain to become too fierce from other nations. In his opening remarks, Nelson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blockchain technology is so transformative. If we lose it, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re losing semiconductor chips in the mid to late eighties. We lose a key driver for technological growth, not just jobs, but the next generation of tech worldwide technological advancement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jon Najarian – founder of Market Rebellion – also threw his two cents into the mix, claiming that there simply isn’t enough blockchain development happening at the time of writing. He said that this could ultimately lead to less-than-stellar growth in the arena. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s still a semiconductor, but it doesn&#8217;t handle nearly the speed, the number of transactions, and all that sort of stuff. Taiwan, obviously a world leader in the space for that, has operated, and that&#8217;s one of the things that China would love to get their hands on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the countries that really appear to be falling behind when it comes to blockchain is the U.S. For example, the nation’s financial agencies – like the SEC – appear to be utilizing regulation-through-enforcement tactics that are causing lots of problems for crypto companies. Some, like Coinbase, have sought to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-is-now-active-in-bermuda/">open headquarters in</a> other regions to avoid the ongoing lack of regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>The SEC has made it clear it’s not interested in solidifying or stating the rules and laws surrounding crypto use and development in the United States. Rather, it’s taken on an attitude of, “Do what we say or else,” and this is not the way for companies to flourish.</p>
<p>Najarian used the Crypto Valley in Switzerland as a prime example of positive blockchain growth, and he stated that for other countries to take the lead, they need to follow the example laid out by Switzerland. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Crypto Valley in Switzerland flourishes because the Swiss regulators have set down the guidelines. We refuse to do that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alex Mascioli – founder of Trade the Chain – also took part in the blockchain discussion and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know why they&#8217;re focusing so much energy on this. You have bad actors that come into any new space. The internet, crypto, this is nothing that&#8217;s any more disproportionate than anything historically that&#8217;s happened. I don&#8217;t know where the tough guy attitude&#8217;s coming from or who it&#8217;s going to serve.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What&#8217;s the Point to Such a Bad Attitude?</h2>
<p>Nelson agreed with this and asked at the end:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it intentional because there&#8217;s just an anti-crypto bias? Is it just misguided? But either way, what fixes it?</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scratch cards are one of the simplest and most entertaining forms of gambling. They offer instant gratification, low stakes and high rewards. You can find them in many shops, kiosks and online platforms. However, if you are a UK player who has registered with GamStop, you may have trouble accessing some of the online scratch card sites that are licensed by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). GamStop is a self-exclusion scheme that prevents you from gambling online for a period of time that you choose. It is meant to help you control your gambling habits and protect you from harm. However, some players may regret joining GamStop or may want to play scratch cards occasionally without breaking their self-exclusion. If you are one of them, you may be wondering if there are any <a href="https://sitesnotongamstop.net/scratch-cards-not-on-gamstop/">online scratch cards not on GamStop</a> that you can enjoy legally and safely.</p>
<p>The answer is yes. There are many online casinos that offer scratch cards not covered by GamStop. These casinos are not licensed by the UKGC, but by other reputable authorities such as Curacao eGaming, Malta Gaming Authority or Gibraltar Gambling Commission. They accept UK players and offer a variety of scratch card games that are not affected by GamStop. You can play them for fun or for real money, and you can also claim generous bonuses and promotions. However, you should also be aware of the potential drawbacks of playing scratch cards without GamStop, such as the lack of UKGC protection, the risk of addiction and the possible legal issues. In this article, we will review some of the best casinos with scratch cards not on GamStop, as well as some alternative destinations for non-GamStop scratch cards. We will also discuss the benefits and drawbacks of playing scratch cards not on GamStop, and the bonus offers available at scratch card casinos without GamStop.</p>
<h3>Why UK Players Should Consider Scratch Cards Not Covered by GamStop</h3>
<p>Here are some reasons why UK players may opt for playing scratch cards not covered by GamStop, along with the potential risks and challenges associated with it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Play anytime, anywhere: Enjoy scratch cards without worrying about self-exclusion status, offering flexibility and convenience.</li>
<li>Access to a wider game selection: Explore a variety of scratch card games that are unavailable at UKGC-licensed sites, expanding options for entertainment.</li>
<li>Higher payouts and jackpots: Experience the potential for more significant winnings compared to UKGC-licensed sites, enhancing the excitement of playing.</li>
<li>More generous bonuses and promotions: Take advantage of enhanced offers and rewards, surpassing those available at UKGC-licensed sites, boosting gameplay value.</li>
<li>Diverse payment methods: Utilize alternative payment options like cryptocurrencies, e-wallets, or prepaid cards, not supported by UKGC-licensed sites, increasing convenience and privacy.</li>
<li>Enhanced fun and excitement: Immerse yourself in an elevated level of enjoyment and thrill beyond that offered by UKGC-licensed sites.</li>
</ol>
<p>Playing scratch cards not covered by GamStop involves certain risks and challenges. It is crucial to practice <a href="http://begambleaware.org">responsible gambling</a> habits and stay within personal limits. To ensure a secure and equitable gaming experience, it is recommended to choose reputable and trustworthy casinos.

<h3>Benefits of Playing Scratch Cards Not on GamStop</h3>
<p>Scratch cards are one of the simplest and most entertaining forms of gambling. They offer instant gratification, low stakes and high rewards. You can find them in many shops, kiosks and online platforms. However, if you are a UK player who has registered with GamStop, you may have trouble accessing some of the online scratch card sites that are licensed by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). GamStop is a self-exclusion scheme that prevents you from gambling online for a period of time that you choose. It is meant to help you control your gambling habits and protect you from harm. However, some players may regret joining GamStop or may want to play scratch cards occasionally without breaking their self-exclusion. If you are one of them, you may be wondering what are the benefits of playing scratch cards not on GamStop. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Play scratch cards anytime and anywhere, regardless of your self-exclusion status.</li>
<li><strong>Diverse Game Selection:</strong> Access a wider range of scratch card games not available at UKGC-licensed sites.</li>
<li><strong>Higher Payouts and Jackpots:</strong> Enjoy the potential for higher payouts and jackpots compared to UKGC-licensed sites.</li>
<li><strong>Generous Bonuses and Promotions</strong>: Take advantage of more generous bonuses and promotions than offered by UKGC-licensed sites.</li>
<li><strong>Alternative Payment Methods:</strong> Utilize different payment methods such as cryptocurrencies, e-wallets, or prepaid cards, not supported by UKGC-licensed sites.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Fun and Excitement:</strong> Experience more fun and excitement when playing scratch cards not covered by GamStop.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratchcard">Scratch cards</a> are also known as scratch-offs, scratch tickets, scratchers, scratchies, scratch-its, scratch games, instant games or instant lotteries. They are small cards that have a thin layer of opaque material that covers a hidden area with symbols or numbers. You can scratch off the layer with a coin or a fingernail to reveal the symbols or numbers and see if you have won a prize.</p>
<h3>Potential Drawbacks of Playing Scratch Cards Without GamStop</h3>
<p>Playing scratch cards without GamStop may seem like a good idea for some players, but it also comes with some potential drawbacks that you should be aware of. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loss of Protection and Support:</strong> By playing scratch cards without GamStop, you may lose the valuable protection and support that GamStop and UKGC provide to problem gamblers. These platforms offer tools like self-exclusion, deposit limits, reality checks, and self-help resources to assist in controlling gambling habits and preventing harm. Without access to these tools, you may be more susceptible to developing gambling addiction.</li>
<li><strong>Potential Legal Issues: </strong>Gambling online is legal in the UK, but only at UKGC-licensed sites. If you choose to play scratch cards at offshore sites not licensed by the UKGC, you may be in violation of the law. This can lead to potential consequences such as fines, legal complications, and difficulties in resolving disputes or retrieving your winnings from unregulated operators.</li>
<li><strong>Risk of Problem Gambling:</strong> Engaging in scratch card games without GamStop increases the risk of developing problem gambling behaviors. Problem gambling is a serious mental health issue that affects individuals worldwide. It involves an uncontrollable urge to gamble despite experiencing negative consequences. Problem gambling can have detrimental effects on financial stability, social relationships, emotional well-being, and physical health. It&#8217;s essential to be aware of the risks and seek help if needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information on problem gambling and understanding the factors contributing to addiction, you can visit reliable sources such as the this <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-50828086">BBC article</a>. Educating yourself about problem gambling can help you make informed decisions and promote responsible gambling practices.</p>
<h3>Bonus Offers at Scratch Card Casinos Without GamStop</h3>
<p>One of the primary appeals of playing at scratch card casinos without GamStop is the array of enticing bonus offers they provide.
