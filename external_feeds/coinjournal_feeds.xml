										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Katie Haun is the founder and CEO of Haun Ventures and also a former US Department of Justice prosecutor.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In a tweet on Sunday, Haun said the SEC is unlikely to appeal as the agency wouldn&rsquo;t want to lose on appeal.</li>
<li dir="ltr">XRP price rose significantly after the judge&rsquo;s summary ruling.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Katie Haun, the founder and CEO of Haun Ventures and former prosecutor at the US Department of Justice, believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is unlikely to seek an &ldquo;immediate appeal&rdquo; of the court ruling that effectively declared&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/xrp/"><u>XRP</u></a> not a security.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">SEC immediate appeal &ldquo;unlikely&rdquo;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Haun, who sees the win for&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/"><u>Ripple</u></a> after its tussle with the agency as a great outcome for crypto, shared her opinion via tweeted remarks on Sunday. The comments follow last week&rsquo;s summary court ruling that was largely welcome across the industry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;ve spoken with trusted legal colleagues (including @HaunVenturesv advisors Steve Engel and James Burnham) and the consensus is that the court drew a reasonable line&mdash;distinguishing between XRP itself (not an investment contract and thus not a security) and certain XRP transactions in which institutional investors paid money to Ripple directly and Ripple made contractual commitments in exchange, creating an investment contract under Howey</em>,&rdquo; Haun tweeted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to her, the distinction has offered the crypto industry an avenue to explore in cases the SEC has brought against some of the top exchanges. The argument here is that &ldquo;tokens are never &ldquo;investment contracts&rdquo; on their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Only binding contracts imposing post-sale obligations on the seller can constitute investment contracts and hence tokens traded on exchanges or secondary markets would almost never qualify</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On whether the SEC will appeal the court&rsquo;s decision, Haun notes that there&rsquo;s a possibility it could. However, it&rsquo;s unlikely to be an immediate appeal. On why this could be the case, the former a16z fund manager explained:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;&hellip; <em>an immediate appeal seems unlikely both because the agency would have to ask the court to split this decision from the portion going to trial and because I&rsquo;m skeptical the SEC actually wants legal clarity. The Commission benefits from the current confusion and losing these issues on appeal would jeopardize its entire enforcement agenda. So I&rsquo;d be surprised if the SEC tried to appeal now</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Congress needs to step in </h2>
<p dir="ltr">XRP price skyrocketed more than 100% as a result, hitting highs of $0.94. However, the coin&rsquo;s value is hovering near $0.75. &nbsp;The partial win for Ripple could be key in pushing XRP above the $1 supply wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some observers have&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1679904748273532936"><u>opined</u></a> that the court&rsquo;s decision could be reversed on appeal, while some&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1679882709718519808"><u>say</u></a> Ripple faces a significant penalty in case of settlement. The overall sentiment though is that while the ruling delivered a blow to the SEC, what remains to be seen is what it does for the broader question of regulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Can Congress step in? Haun says it&rsquo;s imperative they do so.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Even if the outcome here was positive overall, the complexity of the court&rsquo;s reasoning suggests that existing laws and jurisprudence may be ill-equipped to contend with all the important policy concerns at play. The major questions doctrine seems built for crypto at this moment: major decisions on policy like this are for Congress, not unelected agencies,</em>&rdquo; she noted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Crypto prices are rising sharply, with Bitcoin up 20% in the last three weeks</li>
<li dir="ltr">The filing of a number of high-profile Bitcoin ETFs has pushed optimism in the market</li>
<li dir="ltr">Under the hood, liquidity remains low and some worrisome trends emerge, however</li>
<li dir="ltr">The regulatory woes are still present, with Coinbase and Binance facing a murky future</li>
<li dir="ltr">The macro picture also remains uncertain, with the prospect of a lagged impact via tightening monetary policy looming large</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">It wouldn&rsquo;t be like crypto markets to get overly excited. In the past couple of weeks, positivity has returned to the space, led by the seminal filings for a Bitcoin spot ETF by two of the world&rsquo;s biggest asset managers, Blackrock and Fidelity.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, Fidelity were among a cohort of large trad-fi operators, including Schwab and Citadel Securities, to back the new exchange EDX, which offers trading for Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin is up 20% in the last three weeks, breaching past the $30,000 mark, while Ether is up 16% in the same timeframe, approaching the $2,000 mark once more. A glance at the <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/"><u>Fear and Greed</u></a> index, an interesting metric which gauges overall sentiment in the space, shows it is markedly in the &ldquo;greed&rdquo; sector with a score of 61 (0 represents extreme fear, 100 represents extreme greed).&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/05/1688557574714-e61e6782-a3ef-4b4a-9f4f-a101fbbe3e8d.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="535">And yet, a look under the hood betrays some concern. Firstly, if the filing of the ETFs is the reason for the recent ramp, as it appears to be, is a 20% jump justified? The SEC has declared the recent filings as &ldquo;inadequate&rdquo;, according to the WSJ, informing the Nasdaq and CBOE (who filed the paperwork on behalf of the asset managers) that there is not enough detail with respect to &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreements&rdquo;. The SEC had previously said that sponsors of a Bitcoin trust are required to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with a regulated market of significant size.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the applications can be updated and refiled (and the CBOE did indeed refile theirs since, with Nasdaq likely soon to follow) the development hints at how difficult it has been to get the much-coveted spot ETF over the line. There is no guarantee that these are approved, despite the big names involved &ndash; the SEC even rejected an application from Fidelity in the past, turning it away in January 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In truth, it feels inevitable that Bitcoin spot ETFs will one day be traded freely, but a 20% jump on a mere filing in the last couple of weeks is a massive ramp when considering what else has happened in the space, and the state of markets, which we will delve into now.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Liquidity</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Liquidity continues to lag, a factor which cannot be overstated &ndash; and indeed one which the eventual approval of spot ETFs should help.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Looking at centralised exchanges per data from Kaiko as we close out the second quarter of 2023, volume over the past three months was lower again, coming in at the lowest number since 2020, before Bitcoin and crypto embarked on their inexorable price rises and took the financial world by storm.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/05/1688557591169-492d05de-add9-47cf-86fa-47539ff38e28.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="324"></p>
<p dir="ltr">But with lower liquidity, moves to both the upside and downside are exacerbated. This has perhaps contributed to Bitcoin&rsquo;s steep rise in the past few weeks, and also year-to-date, with it currently up 83%.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But liquidity and volumes being so low should be alarming for market participants. Much of the inroads made during the pandemic, with regard to Bitcoin taking its place next to bona-fide asset classes from a trading perspective, have slowed if not reversed &ndash; at least from a liquidity perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As further evidence of this, in the below chart, I&rsquo;ve presented the total balance of stablecoins across exchanges, which has fallen a staggering 60% in the past six months &ndash; an outflow of $26 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14290288">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Having said that, there are pockets of optimism which hint at a brighter future if/when these spot ETFs do get approved. Looking at volume in derivatives markets, it has been rather consistent. In fact, it is markedly up on the second half of 2022. Perhaps this means the spot market has been greater affected by the regulatory crackdown. Either way, it&rsquo;s a less gruesome picture than what we are seeing in spot markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/05/1688557591126-4dee794c-aab5-4225-8275-f59e55c418c3.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="327"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Regulation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Right now, with regard to crypto-specific risk, it really all comes back to regulation. We have discussed the ETF filings, but June also brought two seminal moments: formal charges brought against Coinbase and Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The two cases are extremely different, mind you. Binance&rsquo;s lawsuit <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/opinion-binance-sued-by-sec-an-inevitable-but-ominous-day-for-crypto/"><u>could not be less surprising</u></a>, with the exchange constantly skirting guidelines and laws. The charges amount to a laundry list of different offences, including trading against customers, manipulating trade volume, encouraging users to circumvent geographical restrictions and securities violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is the latter charge which is the centre of the suit against Coinbase, however, and the most pivotal of the lot. It is also why the Coinbase suit is <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-and-cryptos-fate-hangs-by-a-string-a-deep-dive/"><u>far more intriguing</u></a>. Do not forget that the allegations are coming from the SEC, the same body which presided over Coinbase&rsquo;s IPO in April 2021. Why did the SEC let an unregistered securities exchange float on a US stock exchange? You tell me.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But let&rsquo;s get back to the point: what this all means for crypto markets. While Bitcoin appears to be carving its own place out in the eyes of the law, a slew of other tokens were named as securities by the SEC. Despite this, they have risen sharply since off the Bitcoin ETF news. Does this make sense?&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Conclusion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, crypto is going to crypto. Prices move, and trying to pinpoint reasons is often a fool&rsquo;s errand. The last month, however, feels like we have seen an extremely aggressive price rise despite some bad news on the regulatory front.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the macro picture has not changed much, even with the pause at the last Fed meeting. Fed chair Jerome Powell&rsquo;s comments made it clear that this was a pause rather than an about-turn in policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Looking ahead, nearly all committee participants view it as likely that some further rate increases will be appropriate this year,&rdquo; Powell said when announcing the pause.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The market believes him. I backed out probabilities from Fed futures in the next chart, which show that there is currently an 86% chance of a 25 bps hike at the next Fed meeting in three weeks time, with only a 14% chance of rates being left unchanged again. I have presented this next to the same probabilities conveyed by the market exactly a month ago (Bitcoin is up 20% in the time since), showing softer forecasts do not explain the sharp price (the chance of no hike has actually come down).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14349271">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">As I said, crypto going to crypto. But with assets as notoriously volatile as what we see in this sector, it would be wise to stop and think about whether the sudden wave of positivity is justified. When considering the liquidity picture and the regulatory trouble, there are plenty of reasons to hesitate.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then when one layers in the macro picture, the picture becomes murkier again. Let us not forget that we are in the midst of one of the swiftest rate hiking cycles in modern history, with rates rising all the way from zero to above 5%, and the prospect of them rising even further later this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monetary policy operates with a lag, and the scale of that tightening is enormous. Sentiment may feel like it has flipped dramatically, but there is a long road ahead yet.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is in its second presale phase with huge demand for the tokens.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AI has grown popular, with AltSignals expecting it to increase the quality of trading signals.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">$ASI price could start to rise in the third quarter as the token will begin to list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">There has been a new reawakening in artificial intelligence since ChatGPT was created, and big tech companies started making multi-billion-dollar investments in the sector. One company that has realised this trend is AltSignals, a trading signal service platform founded in 2017. Since launching the&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> of the $ASI token, powering the AltSignals AI platform, investors have been accumulating. The first presale phase sold out quickly, and more than half of the tokens are bought in the second phase.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The power of AI trading and AltSignals iteration</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Trading is becoming automated daily, and AI is becoming integral to that. The trading industry has used automation for enhanced market analysis and predictions. Since starting in 2017, AltSignals has benefited from automation, using the AltAlgo&trade; indicator to generate quality trading signals. That has made it an on-demand platform, attracting over 52,000 members on Telegram and more than 1,400 VIPs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals want to take the game of automation to the next level. Owing to the increasing popularity of AI, the company seeks to incorporate AI to tap into the power of deep machine learning, forecasting, and sentimental analysis. The company expects AI to increase the quality of signals generated.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals also expects AI to revolutionise trading experiences. With AI, traders can make entries with clearer confluences and better risk management. With an already winning strategy that generates signals with average success rates of over 64%, AltSignals expects AI to be a game-changer for its trading community.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What buying $ASI means</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Investors buying $ASI will have access to the AltSignals AI platform dubbed ActualizeAI. The platform confers investors full benefits of trading signals and interacting with other traders. $ASI also decentralises AltSignals governance. Members can vote on issues and determine the directions taken by the AltSignals team.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But AltSignals also want investors to grow with the platform. As such, there will be trading competitions and tournaments. Users participating in the contests will have an additional chance to win $ASI. This could be ideal for investors looking to advance their skills in trading by learning from others and applying their competencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Members of ActualizeAI have exclusive access to presale opportunities and future AI-powered products. The AI Members Club also lets users earn $ASI by giving their ideas and feedback on AlSignals products.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is AltSignals a good investment, and what is its price potential in 2023?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Altsignals powers a demanded service. The platform has a following and is only advancing to the next level. Investing in $ASI means taking a position in an already successful platform. It could be a good investment for investors looking to improve their trading or benefit from quality trading signals to increase their incomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI also carries huge potential given the already successful project and growing application of AI. As the presale has shown, the demand for the token is already high. The token could explode in value and generate returns for investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The price of $ASI could start to rise in the third quarter of 2023 when the token will list on Uniswap. However, the real price potential could be realised when the AI platform launches in early 2024 and more investors join.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a conservative prediction, double or triple-digit price increases should be the minimum by the end of 2023. In 2024, the price could rise by over 1,000%, following similar trends set by newly launched projects and tokens.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you buy $ASI this week?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">$ASI is valued at $0.01875 this week and is in its second presale phase. The price began at $0.015 in the first phase and will rise at each stage. Buying now could be ideal for investors looking to spend less and get more before the price increases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Seychelles, seychelles, July 17th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">As part of Flipster&rsquo;s (formerly AQX) name launch, the business today announced an additional 1,500,000 USD worth of bonus rewards to encourage new users to join and trade on their exchange. Until the rewards are fully distributed, the futures exchange will run at least one campaign per week to encourage new users to signup and trade derivatives on the Flipster platform. Under the old name the exchange has already made available more than 400,000USDT worth bonus in past campaigns.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The first promotion in the series kicked off on the 17th of July, 2023 (running for seven days). A massive 110,000 USDT in bonuses has been allocated. 10,000 USDT to reward new users when completing identity verification with a 10 USDT Bonus. The remaining 100,000 USDT bonus is to incentivise and reward high volume traders that give the platform a chance. The top performer by trading volume will be rewarded with 10,000 USDT in Bonus at the end of the weekly campaign.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Flipster has reimagined futures trading with a mobile-first approach to appeal to casual crypto traders with limited experience in derivatives trading (or, as they say, Flipping).</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The method is to specialize in derivatives trading, stripping back the app experience to make it faster to learn and easier to use. Novice traders can open, close and monitor positions from any location. Potentially meaning some users may make more money on the bus to work, than from their days Labor. Beyond ease of use, the portable experience makes trading fun and feels less like a technical task.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The flip to a mobile-first approach came after initially having a web experience similar to other futures exchanges. The traditional UI for futures trading has a steep learning curve and is considerably more technical, which strongly contrasts with the UI that most contemporary apps users have become familiar with. The data concluded that users new to derivatives were not attracted to this experience as it had been built for experienced traders. The Flipster team discovered a few alternative UIs for future trading and none that have successfully been created to onboard new users to crypto futures trading at scale.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">While the focus is on simplicity, Flipster has features that will spark the interest of experienced traders as well. The exchange regularly adds new perpetual swap contracts, and as of today, over 120 assets can be traded with leverage, making Flipster a competitive exchange for traders to consider. Amongst their assets are tokens not found for futures on other exchanges and some even with low visibility in spot markets.</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Yongjin Kim said, &ldquo;The team has been working very hard on bringing this new vision for futures trading to life, and now is the right time to incentivise users to trade with us. Once users start trading on our platform, they will be coming back again and again. Rather than just copying what every other exchange has done, we are doing something fresh, and I believe the market is ready for some injection of new ideas. To our existing users, I want to thank you for being with us, and to the new guys coming in now, Welcome&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<li dir="ltr">Binance is reported to have dismissed about 1,000 of its employees recently.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The report cites sources close to the exchange and comes at a time Binance is battling regulatory pressure.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The leading crypto exchange celebrated its 6th birthday on July 14.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a>, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has reportedly cut its employee number by 1,000 in recent weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> on Binance&rsquo;s layoffs on Friday, citing a source as saying the crypto exchange could still dismiss more of its workforce in coming months amid staff reorganization. According to the report, the crypto company could lay off up to a third of its workforce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance celebrated its sixth year since it launched today, July 14, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 years ago today, a little exchange called <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Binance</a> launched. Everyone was telling me there is no chance for another exchange. Here are some reflections over the last few years. Thank you for your unwavering support! &#128591;<br> <a href="https://t.co/9O4UnE3G36">https://t.co/9O4UnE3G36</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CZ &#128310; Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679895264654503942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance&rsquo;s employee layoffs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Multiple crypto and mainstream companies have in the past year or so aggressively cut on their headcount, with crypto&rsquo;s situation exacerbated by the debilitating crypto winter. Binance was among those to eye staff reduction as Wu Blockchain revealed in a May 31<a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1663890209526927373" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>tweet</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to the expected employee cut, the Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao led company had an estimated 8,000 employees globally. Reports highlighted plans to send 20% of the workforce home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance remains the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. However, the past month has been tough for the company in terms of the myriad of regulatory challenges it has faced.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The early June lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), came as the exchange exited a number of countries due to regulatory reasons. It included Belgium and the Netherlands, and it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-drops-its-license-application-in-austria/">ended its pursuit of a license in Austria</a>. Menwhile, it also faced scrutiny in France and recently Australia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There have also been exits by top executives, including exchange&rsquo;s former Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Fink did not talk about Bitcoin specifically, noting he&rsquo;s prohibited by virtue of BlackRock&rsquo;s spot ETF filing.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In his interview with CNBC on Friday, Fink mentioned how gold ETF changed the gold investing market.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has yet again shared bullish remarks about <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>, noting in an <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkStreet/status/1679860599780519943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNBC&rsquo;s Squawk on the Street on Friday that crypto has the capacity to transcend any international currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the BlackRock CEO, who recently commented on the potential of Bitcoin as digital gold and an international investment asset, repeated the viewpoint in his latest remarks. In particular, he pointed to the global demand for crypto as something that signifies its potential.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fink on ETFs and crypto&rsquo;s international appeal</h2>
<p dir="ltr">BlackRock filed for a spot <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin ETF</a> last month and together with Fidelity Investments, Ark Invest and others, are convinced they have done everything required to have the SEC approve the first such ETF for the US market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The $9 trillion asset manager&rsquo;s recent outlook of crypto investing, and what its entry into the spot ETF market could mean for the broader industry continues to trigger positive vibes a month since its initial SEC filing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fink said:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I</em><em>&nbsp;can&rsquo;t talk about Bitcoin because we have a SEC filing and I&rsquo;m prohibited, but I can talk about crypto in general and what we have done. We believe we have a responsibility to democratise investing. And we have done a great job and the role of ETFs in the world is transforming investing. I think we&rsquo;re only at the beginning of that</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The BlackRock chief then noted that ETFs industry is set to grow into a multiple trillion dollar market as the fixed income market expands. He also highlighted what has been achieved since the gold ETF debut 20 years ago, especially in democratising gold investing and bringing down the cost of transactions for physical gold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An ETF will democratise the crypto investing space in the same way, Fink opined, adding that BlackRock&rsquo;s clients have over the last five years continually asked about crypto&rsquo;s role. He says he believes crypto is an &ldquo;international asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>It has differentiating value versus other assets. But more importantly, because it is so international, it&rsquo;s going to transcend any one currency and currency valuation</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<li dir="ltr">The ex-Celsius CEO was arrested on Thursday.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Celsius filed for bankruptcy in 2022, alongside other leading crypto lenders.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Mashinsky&rsquo;s bail must be signed by two financially recognizable persons.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Alex Mashinsky, the founder &amp; former CEO of bankrupt crypto lender <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/celsius/">Celsius Network</a>, has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges filed against him by the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mashinsky was arrested on Thursday, with the DOJ charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, and commodities fraud. The ex-Celsius CEO also faces accusations of manipulating the price of the crypto platform&rsquo;s native asset CEL.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mashinsky pleads not guilty</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The DOJ&rsquo;s arrest and arraignment of the ex-Celsius CEO came as the SEC also brought charges against Mashinky. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also filed complaints against him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mashinksy pleaded not guilty to the DOJ charges and was granted a $40 million bail. The personal recognizance bond has to be signed by two persons deemed to be financially responsible.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to court documents published on July 14, the former crypto figure&rsquo;s wife is one of two FRPs, while the second FRP needs to append their signature today. A key date in this development is July 21, which is a court-set deadline for the second FRP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the former Celsius boss will be released without paying the $40 million bond, there&rsquo;s a claim on his bank account and residence in New York. &nbsp;Mashinsky has also been ordered to surrender his travel documents to authorities and is prohibited from opening bank or cryptocurrency accounts unless first approved by Pretrial Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mashinsky is yet another high-profile crypto figure to be arrested following the collapses and bankruptcies that hit crypto companies in 2022. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and Terra founder Do Kwon are others.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies had a great week as the market cap soared to $1.25 trillion.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ripple prevailed when a judge ruled that XRP was not a financial security.</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin and other altcoins bounced back this week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies had a very good week after the weak US inflation data and after the SEC vs Ripple case outcome. Ripple price surged by more than 70% while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to over $1.25 trillion. Here is the weekend prediction for key coins like Cardano, Solana, and ApeCoin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cardano price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano"><u>Cardano</u></a> ADA price made a strong bullish breakout after the SEC vs Ripple news, which we wrote about&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/"><u>here</u></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>It jumped to a high of $0.375, the highest level since June 4th. This rally happened because the SEC had singled out Cardano as a financial security. As such, there is a likelihood that Cardano and its developers would prevail if the SEC brought charges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Ripple case is a monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract it may or may not be part of. Now, let&rsquo;s make it law. &#128071; <a href="https://t.co/FZtO1BzfWX">pic.twitter.com/FZtO1BzfWX</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Turning to the daily chart, we see that the Cardano price was in a consolidation phase before the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/"><u>Ripple news</u></a>. It was consolidating at an important support level of $0.30, which was the lowest point on March 12th.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now, Cardano has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average. It is also trading at the 200-day moving average. Therefore, while the bullish comeback has eased, there is a likelihood that it will continue rising as buyers target the next key resistance level at $0.42, which is about 20% above the current level.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SOL price has jumped above the important resistance level at $25.83, the highest level on April 17th. The coin has also risen above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the overbought level of 80.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stochastic Oscillator RSI has moved above the overbought point. Therefore, the coin could keep rising as buyers target the key resistance at $38.60, the highest level on November 5th.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">ApeCoin price forecast</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/apecoin/"><u>ApeCoin</u></a> price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few months. This decline happened as the volume of Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFTs crashed. APE moved below the key support at $2.60, the lowest level in November last year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token has crashed below all moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the outlook of the ApeCoin token is bearish as demand for NFTs and BAYC tokens dropped.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">US court ruled in favour of Ripple in the case initiated by SEC</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The ruling is positive for crypto, with newcomers like Chancer benefiting</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer could rise by double or triple-digit percentages in 2023</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto is not a security. This was the message the US judge Analisa Torres passed in making a positive ruling on Ripple&rsquo;s XRP classification against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The classification was welcome in crypto quarters as XRP pumped by double digits. The ruling is positive for existing and upcoming digital assets as it clears legal uncertainty. Chancer could ride on this optimism to become a valuable asset, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> quickly selling out in just a month.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SEC loss is a win for crypto</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC&rsquo;s case against Ripple has been a long-standing issue since December 2020. It would have set a precedent for the classification of digital assets, impacting their attractiveness to investors. SEC believed Ripple violated security laws through the issuance of XRP. The court&rsquo;s verdict now clears the legal hurdle and represents a win for crypto as it limits SEC&rsquo;s action against other digital asset entities and issuers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The landmark win is positive for Chancer. Chancer is a blockchain-based predictive markets application that launched a presale on June 13th, 2023. A month later, Chancer raised more than $768,526 from investors in the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors would be excited that the court&rsquo;s ruling creates a transparent market where future entanglements of crypto and the regulator are minimised. Chancer could benefit from the outcome. The enthusiasm that the presale has generated means the positive sentiment created by the ruling could boost demand.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What does Chancer do differently?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer taps into the power of peer-to-peer (P2P) relations to build a blockchain platform for betting. P2P has become popular with crypto and blockchain, as it allows users to exchange value in a decentralised manner across geographies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In its P2P betting model, Chancer allows users to connect with others and bet on their preferred events. Different from the existing betting methods where the bookmakers determine events, odds, and rules, Chancer lets users decide for themselves. Users create P2P markets, determine rules, fix odds, and invite other participants to bet on a decentralised platform. The bets are facilitated by the $CHANCER token, the medium of exchanging value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But it is not just the betting element, as Chancer is designed to be a medium of investment. Users earn from creating Chancer markets, besides making successful bets on them. For investors who love passive income, there is the option to stake the native token and earn yields. Users also earn for sharing the platform with others.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is Chancer a 10x investment in 2023?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies are new asset classes and power innovative use cases. As we have seen in the past, cryptocurrencies can rise by more than 1,000% in a few months after launch. Chancer could be a 10x investment as it powers a user case that has not been exploited in blockchain and crypto. This also reflects the growing popularity of betting.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, a 10x prediction for CHANCER in 2023 could be too early. Chancer is still on presale, and its first listing will occur in the third quarter on Uniswap. It takes a few months for valuable tokens to surge in value 10 times, which this analysis doubts could happen in 2023. Potentially a price increase of 1,000% is likely in 2024. A double or triple-digit percentage price gain is the most realistic scenario for 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you buy CHANCER now?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is in its first presale stage, priced at $0.01. Once the first stage concludes, the price will rise to $0.011 in the second phase. It means buying now is attractive as the price is still low.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CHANCER is also headed for listing in the third quarter. Any explosive price move would occur after listing. Buying now allows investors to ride the price momentum when the token debuts on exchanges.</p>
