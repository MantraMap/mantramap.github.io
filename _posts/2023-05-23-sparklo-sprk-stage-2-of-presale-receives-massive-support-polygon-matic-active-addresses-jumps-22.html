<p>Presently, investors are seeking projects that offer huge potential returns and are backed by tangible assets. While certain altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) have experienced huge price declines, emerging projects like Sparklo have captivated the interest of investors and traders due to its innovative investment approach. This led to the success of Sparklo&rsquo;s stage one presale as the project now thrives in stage two.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPRK TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) opens the precious metal industry to all</p>
<p>Sparklo is building an Ethereum-based platform set that will transform precious metals investment. Users will have the opportunity to invest in these metals by purchasing fractional or full portions represented as NFTs. These NFTs will be backed by physical gold, platinum, or silver bars. Also, Sparklo will deliver the actual precious metal to those who acquire the entire NFT.</p>
<p>Sparklo is currently in the second phase of its token presale and the SPRK token is available at just $0.026 apiece. Meanwhile, Sparklo prioritizes customer security and has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit by the InterFi network and successfully completed its KYC procedure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to foster trust and transparency, the platform's liquidity will be locked for 100 years, while team tokens will be locked for 1000 days. The aim is to prevent any sell-off once the project launches. Besides bars of these precious, Sparklo will also collaborate with jewelry stores to provide investors with early access to some jewelry products before they are made available on the market.</p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC) remains bearish despite active addresses spike</p>
<p>The Polygon (MATIC) blockchain has witnessed a surge in user traction lately, fueled by the introduction of new products and advancements. However, Polygon's (MATIC) price is yet to experience a breakout. According to Santiment, the number of Active Addresses (7d) rose by 22%, from 1.21 million to 1.47 million active addresses, between May 10th and May 22nd. If crypto investors continue staking in Polygon (MATIC) and user activity remains high, holders can anticipate a bullish price reversal.</p>
<p>However, data from IntoTheBlock's IOMAP chart reveals that approximately 52,000 investors purchased 4.5 billion MATIC at an average price of $0.95. Despite the accumulation, Polygon (MATIC) faces a significant hurdle and a key resistance at $0.95. By press time, Polygon (MATIC) is trading at $0.870897, an increase of 0.94% in the last 24 hours and a 0.15% increase over the past 7 days.</p>
