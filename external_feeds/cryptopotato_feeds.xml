            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web3 decentralized domains service provider &#8211; Ethereum Name Service (ENS) &#8211; raked in $235,000 in fees on August 13. The figure is the highest since September 11, 2022.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of years, ENS has stood as a mainstay within the Web3 realm, enabling individuals to generate easily understandable domain names and wallet addresses for cryptocurrencies.</p>
<ul>
<li>According to data from Arkham Intelligence&#8217;s dashboard, ENS DAO (<a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">0xFe…44b7</a>) holds more than $132.4 million in assets, including 10 million ENS (worth $90.63 million), 15,000 ETH (worth $27.72 million), and 14.13 million in USDC stablecoin.</li>
<li>The total active ENS names have also <a href="https://dune.com/ethereumnameservice/ens" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">exceeded</a> 2.6 million as of August 14th across nearly 740,000 unique addresses.</li>
<li>The latest development comes a little over a month after the &#8220;distributed, open, and extensible naming system&#8221; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-name-service-gears-up-for-layer-2-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> plans to tap layer-2 in a bid to enhance scalability and cut costs.</li>
<li>Earlier this year, ENS also launched a new fiat on-ramp for domain registrations via Web3 fiat payment gateway MoonPay.</li>
<li>Its rival, Unstoppable Domains, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/web3-domain-provider-unstoppable-domains-expands-support-to-eth-domains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">extended</a> support to &#8220;.eth&#8221; domains in July, allowing users to purchase via the official website.</li>
<li>With the move, Unstoppable Domains seeks to engage with a fresh audience since the platform typically offers domain endings such as .crypto, .blockchain, .nft, etc., while ENS is the only venue where Ethereum enthusiasts were able to purchase the .eth domain names.</li>
<li>In order to prevent &#8220;naming collisions,&#8221; each .eth domain obtained via Unstoppable&#8217;s website will be recorded through the ENS smart contract with the same full functionality as other .eth domains.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[Binance previously roped in a former prosecutor at the US DOJ to represent the firm in the legal battle against the SEC. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance filed a motion requesting a protective order against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), claiming the regulator is conducting a &#8220;fishing expedition&#8221; instead of seeking the narrow and &#8220;limited&#8221; discovery authorized by the Consent Order to ensure the security and availability of customer assets.</p>
<p>The motion asserts that Binance has already provided the SEC with the necessary information.</p>
<h2>Binance Sees Protective Order Against SEC</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/95/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">filing</a>, Binance called the SEC’s approach &#8220;troubling and inappropriate,&#8221; arguing that BAM&#8217;s asset custody practices have &#8220;nothing to do&#8221; with the underlying claims in this case.</p>
<p>This is in reference to the communications dating back to November 2022 that the SEC has demanded to be produced in court. For the uninitiated, BAM Trading is the holding company of Binance.US and BAM Management.</p>
<p>Binance claimed that BAM implemented numerous measures in accordance with the Consent Order to further ensure that customer assets are secure and have already produced necessary information about customer assets to the SEC.</p>
<p>Pointing to the SEC&#8217;s failure to uncover any trace of evidence indicating any misuse or mishandling of BAM customer assets, Binance urged the court to grant a protective order to restrict the regulator from conducting a maximum of four depositions of BAM employees.</p>
<p>As part of the order, Binance is seeking a ban on the SEC from raising questions during these depositions that fall beyond the boundaries defined by the Consent Order.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the filing also said the depositions of BAM&#8217;s CEO and CFO should be disallowed, along with any requests for communications about different subjects.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;BAM has worked in good faith, but the SEC has been steadfast in its belief that the Consent Order gives it carte blanche to investigate every aspect of BAM’s asset custody practices without any discernible limitation whatsoever.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Binance vs. SEC</h2>
<p>Current US regulations do not accommodate digital assets, which has led the SEC to use its own interpretations to oversee the sector. The approach was met with severe backlash. The US regulators sued Binance and CEO Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao in June this year for allegedly operating a &#8220;web of deception.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-plummets-after-sec-sues-binance-for-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Allegations</a> against the cryptocurrency exchange include actions like inflating trading volumes artificially, redirecting customer funds, neglecting to prevent US customers from using the platform, and providing false information to investors regarding its market surveillance measures.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin is erupting in Argentina after a pro-Bitcoin, anti-peso presidential candidate won the nation’s primary elections.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has tapped a new all-time high against the Argentine peso, shortly after a Bitcoin-supportive presidential candidate came first in the nation’s primary elections.</p>
<p>The asset now trades for $10,258,244.60 ARS, up 21% over the past 5 days.</p>
<h2>Pressure on the Peso</h2>
<p>Compared to the US dollar, Bitcoin has performed remarkably well against the peso over time given that the latter currency’s persistently high inflation.</p>
<p>Last month, the nation’s annual inflation rate skyrocketed to 115% up from 98% in January. Meanwhile, as BTC is up 76% year to date in USD terms, its risen 249% against the peso in that same timeframe.</p>
<p>Yet a large portion of those gains came only after Argentina’s primary elections over the weekend, which saw Javier Milei – leader of La Libertad Avanza (Freedom Advances) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-supporter-javier-milei-wins-primary-presidential-elections-in-argentina/" data-wpel-link="internal">score</a> over 30% of the vote.</p>
<p>A keen critic of inflation, Milei wants to entirely abolish Argentina’s central bank, replacing the peso with the dollar. He’s also pitched solving some of Argentina’s inflationary issues using Bitcoin, which proponents praise as a potential inflation hedge due to its fixed supply of 21 million coins.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What Bitcoin is representing is the return of money to its original creator: the private sector,” the politician has stated in previous interviews.</p>
<p>“Bitcoin has an algorithm that one day it will reach a certain amount, and there is no more, and it can compete with other currencies,” he added.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/argentina-approves-btc-index-futures-contracts-on-matba-rofex-exchange-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Argentina</a> is currently one of the top 20 countries for crypto adoption worldwide, according to data from both Statista and <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Chainalysis</a>.</p>
<h2>Can Argentina Eradicate the Peso?</h2>
<p>Shortly after Milei’s surprise success on Sunday, the Argentine government opted to devalue the peso by another 20% early on Monday – roughly the same amount by which Bitcoin has risen against it since that time.</p>
<p>A devaluing peso only makes life more difficult for locals, who witness the purchasing power of their savings erode in real time.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more the dollar rises, the more expensive things become,&#8221; said Marta Gisela Barrera, a 29-year-old recycler struggling to buy food for her children, to the <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/argentine-peso-plunges-after-rightist-who-admires-trump-comes-first-in-primary-vote-1.6517879" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> Monday morning. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Were Milei to become President following October’s election, he would still need approval from Congress to entirely replace the peso. Alternatively, he’s suggested having a referendum or “non-binding popular vote” on the matter, though it’s still unclear if this would be enough without lawmakers’ support.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[CoinShares found that digital asset investment products saw inflows of $29 million following three weeks of outflows.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investment products for XRP, the native crypto asset of the Ripple network, have recorded the 16th consecutive week of institutional inflows since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>According to data <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-144-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-7d29c8c04df5" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">analyzed</a> by CoinShares in its latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, XRP saw $0.5 million in inflows during the past week.</p>
<h2>XRP Sees Inflows for the 16th Week</h2>
<p>CoinShares found that digital asset investment products saw inflows of $29 million following three weeks of outflows. Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-funds-soak-in-27-million-inflows-following-positive-inflation-data/" data-wpel-link="internal">recorded</a> the highest influx of $27 million, with its short funds experiencing outflows of $2.7 million.</p>
<p>Bitcoin’s dominance was followed by Ethereum’s, which led altcoins with inflows of $2.5 million, Uniswap with $0.7 million, XRP with $0.5 million, and Solana with $0.4 million. XRP’s inflows represent 12% of its assets under management (AUM). The asset’s AUM has spiked by 127% since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>In terms of regional activity, Canada saw the most inflows of $24 million, followed by Switzerland with $8 million and the United States with $0.9 million. Despite Canada’s notable growth, the country is behind others from a year-to-date perspective.</p>
<p>CoinShares deduced that the improved investor sentiment was due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which fell slightly below expectations, raising suspicions that a September rate hike would not happen. The data also suggests that the broader crypto market remains supportive despite low trading volumes.</p>
<h2>XRP Gains Market Dominance</h2>
<p>While XRP records constant inflows, the digital asset is also gaining significant popularity in the crypto space. <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-poised-to-surpass-btc-eth-and-ada-as-the-leading-payment-cryptocurrency/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that a CryptoCompare study found the XRP Ledger (XRPL) to be the fastest and most cost-effective blockchain network for payments, making it a more sustainable choice for businesses seeking quick and affordable payment solutions.</p>
<p>Compared to Bitcoin’s average transaction processing time of 10 minutes, the XRPL handles transactions in 3.3 seconds with a cost of $0.00003. This is also significantly better than Ethereum’s 15 seconds and Cardano’s 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Data from CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">shows</a> that XRP has gained market dominance and is currently the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, a feat the digital asset attained since Ripple Labs <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/has-ripple-xrp-won-or-will-the-sec-appeal-what-will-happen-next/" data-wpel-link="internal">won</a> a partial victory in a three-year-long legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market continues to surprise investors, with Solana ($SOL) being the latest token to experience significant upside.</p>
<p>$SOL has soared 11% in the past week, putting the price just below the crucial $25 level.</p>
<p>However, $SOL isn&#8217;t the only cryptocurrency gaining ground – the new Web3 project Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) is also making waves as its presale phase hits the $1.2 million milestone.</p>
<h2>Bulls Regain Control as $SOL Price Surges</h2>
<p>Solana has posted a bullish close in six of the last seven days, showcasing a level of consistency not seen since mid-June.</p>
<p>After dropping 30% from July’s peak, $SOL has bounced back, with the bulls seemingly in control.</p>
<p>Price has climbed above the 20-day and 50-Day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the daily time frame, indicating that the short and medium-term trends have flipped bullish.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266570" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="284" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-19-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CoinMarketCap</a> shows that $375 million worth of $SOL was traded in the past 24 hours – making it the eighth largest cryptocurrency globally, as measured by trading volume.</p>
<p>This surge in trading activity shows that interest in Solana remains high among market participants.</p>
<p>Coupled with the positive sentiment in the crypto market as a whole, sentiment remains optimistic among many investors about $SOL’s growth trajectory for the remainder of 2023.</p>
<h2>Solana’s Thriving NFT Sector Fuels Token Growth</h2>
<p>One of the main factors contributing to Solana’s recent price rise is the platform’s expanding NFT capabilities.</p>
<p>Solana has become a go-to blockchain for launching new NFT collections, with <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/blockchains" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CryptoSlam</a> showing that it is now only behind Ethereum in terms of daily sales.</p>
<p>Over 890,000 NFT transactions occurred on Solana in the past 30 days, leading to a total sales volume of $75.4 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266568" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="164" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20-300x82.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-20-50x14.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Leading projects like Gruuvies, Tensorians, and Solcasino.io have also chosen Solana due to its speed, low fees, and growing user base – and this influx of activity has prompted additional interest in the network.</p>
<p>Naturally, the more NFT activity on Solana, the higher the demand for $SOL, helping drive the token&#8217;s recent price increase.</p>
<p>As such, the thriving NFT sector on Solana looks poised to fuel further growth for $SOL in the second half of 2023.</p>
<h2>Launchpad XYZ Presale Heating Up &amp; Raises $1.2 Million Ahead of Exchange Listings</h2>
<p>While Solana’s price keeps rising, another crypto asset gaining momentum is <a href="https://shrt.care/11df4205?referrer=solana-price-keeps-rising-while-launchpad-xyz-raises-1-2-million" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ ($LPX)</a>, which recently crossed $1.2 million raised in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>This ambitious project aims to drive mainstream adoption of Web3 assets by simplifying access to cryptocurrencies, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and the metaverse.</p>
<p>During Launchpad XYZ’s ongoing presale, investors can purchase $LPX, the platform’s native token, for just $0.0445 ahead of the planned exchange listings for later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-266567" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="339" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-14-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Many believe this decision could prove fruitful, given the comprehensive nature of the Launchpad XYZ platform.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Logan Paul is gearing up for his next event, a boxing match against Brazilian Dillon Danis scheduled for October 14 in Manchester, England.</p>
<p>Danis, widely recognized as an MMA fighter and Conor McGregor&#8217;s training partner, will be coached by the Irishman for the upcoming fight.</p>

<p>Upon learning about this, Paul launched an explicit rant, accompanied by insults, while offering a one million dollar bet on the match.</p>
<h2>Logan Paul Faces Criticism</h2>
<p>This move has drawn heavy criticism from the crypto community, mainly due to Paul&#8217;s failure to reimburse victims of his CryptoZoo (ZOO) project.</p>
<p>Launched in 2021, CryptoZoo promised a cryptocurrency game featuring the ZOO token and NFTs. Despite initial hype during the bull market, the project has failed to meet expectations. Earlier this year, Paul <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/change-of-heart-logan-paul-apologizes-to-coffeezilla-amidst-fallout-over-nft-project/" data-wpel-link="internal">pledged</a> to rectify the situation for affected investors, but this has yet to materialize. He is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/logan-paul-faces-class-action-lawsuit-over-alleged-cryptozoo-nft-rug-pull/" data-wpel-link="internal">facing</a> a class-action lawsuit associated with regard to the above.</p>
<p>Consequently, his willingness to wager $1 million on a match outcome has left many unamused. In response to Paul&#8217;s outburst, Danis took to Twitter, highlighting that Paul may have money to bet, but has failed to pay off those he scammed.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shiba Inu has shared yet another announcement with its community.</p>
<p>The ecosystem&#8217;s marketing strategist took it to Twitter (now known as X) to reveal that the SHIB Doggy DAO has partnered with a leading digital asset advisory and investment firm.</p>
<figure id="attachment_266593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266593" style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-266593 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg" alt="shiba_inu_img" width="537" height="429" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img.jpg 537w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img-300x240.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/shiba_inu_img-50x40.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-266593" class="wp-caption-text">Source: X</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SHIB Doggy DAO Shakes Hands with ATH</h2>
<p>The new partnership is struck between Alpha Transform Holdings (ATH) and SHIB Doggy DAO. The latter is the decentralized autonomous organization that&#8217;s governed by holders of the SHIB token and funds the projects that are now built on Shibarium.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ATH is a digital asset advisory and investment firm that&#8217;s comprised of a team of veteran leaders from heavyweights like Nasdaq, News Crop, and Disney and has advised projects like Tether and even Ethereum, per the <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/14/2724869/0/en/Alpha-Transform-Holdings-Joins-SHIB-Doggy-DAO-Foundation-as-Advisor.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the matter was Chief Investment Officer and CEO at Alpha Transform Holdings, Enzo Villani, who said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“SHIB continues the incredible trajectory. Shibarium has already seen great momentum. With over 21 million wallets and over 250,000 smart contracts written to their Layer 2 blockchain testnet, there are many brands in entertainment, media, and finance that will be interested in engaging with this vibrant community.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Shibarium Nearly Complete</h2>
<p>In a comment on the partnership, the lead developer behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem &#8211; Shytoshi Kusama &#8211; said that Shibarium is &#8220;nearly complete.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now that Shibarium is nearly complete, and our full structure placed at the feet of the world, we couldn&#8217;t ask for a better partner to help shepherd this next phase of the Shiba global phenomenon. [&#8230;] We look forward to Alpha Transform helping our Foundation swiftly and effectively chart the best course possible for the future of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The SHIB price hasn&#8217;t yet reacted to the news, trading 2% down in the past 24 hours but 11% up for the day, following an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shib-rallies-14-weekly-but-warning-signs-flash-3-things-to-watch-this-week-shiba-inu-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">impressive weekly rally.</a></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust &#8211; a once-leading cryptocurrency custodian &#8211; filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in Delaware approximately two months after the Nevada Financial Institutions Division claimed it operates in an &#8220;unsafe and unsound manner.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The company was among the leaders in its field a few years ago, holding funds on behalf of other fallen behemoths such as FTX and Celsius Network.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest to Go Bankrupt</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the firm&#8217;s </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/X274/12452/PLEADINGS/1245208152380000000024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filing</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, its estimated liabilities (on a consolidated basis) range from $100 million to $500 million, while the number of creditors is up to 50,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being based in Las Vegas, Nevada, Prime Trust filed for bankruptcy protection in the district of Delaware since it had its domicile, principal place of business, or principal assets in this region for 180 days prior to the date of the petition.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The cryptocurrency custodian had regulatory issues with the Nevada watchdogs in June when they issued a cease and desist order, claiming the firm had major liquidity cracks and could not honor clients&#8217; withdrawal requests. Shortly after, the Nevada Financial Institutions Division </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/prime-trust-placed-in-receivership-by-nevadas-regulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a petition to place Prime Trust in receivership.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With consideration of the above, Prime is in an unsafe financial condition and/or is insolvent. Additionally, Prime&#8217;s condition will only progressively worsen as customers continue to withdraw from Prime,&#8221; the agency maintained at the time.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator estimated that the crypto firm owed more than $85 million in fiat currency to customers but had only $2.9 million. It also had $69.5 million worth of cryptocurrency debt, while its digital asset holdings equaled $68.6 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prime Trust was once an industry leader, storing assets and providing services to the defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX and the crypto lender Celsius Network. Both firms filed for bankruptcy last year, adding their names to the long list of entities that collapsed amid the prolonged bear market or some alleged fraudulent actions.</span></p>

<h2>1. Rejection under Key Resistance</h2>
<p>The rally continued until Sunday when the price started to fall. This is the first time in over a week when sellers showed strength and were able to stop the rally. If this continues, then SHIB may enter a correction.</p>

<h2>2. Bearish Divergence</h2>
<p>The daily RSI is showing a clear bearish divergence. The price made a higher high, while the RSI momentum indicator made a lower high. This shows that bulls are starting to lose control over the price.</p>

<h2>3. Momentum Shifting Bearish?</h2>
<p>Similarly to the RSI, the MACD histogram has been making lower highs for four days. This is a clear warning sign that momentum may soon change if buyers don&#8217;t return soon.</p>
<p>While a bearish cross is still some distance away, this price action may encourage sellers to step up their pressure.</p>
