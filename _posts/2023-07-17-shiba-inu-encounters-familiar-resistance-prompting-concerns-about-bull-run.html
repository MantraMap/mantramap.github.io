Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a significant challenge in the form of the December 2022 low. This crucial level has proved a formidable barrier for SHIB bulls, thwarting their attempts to increase prices.  Despite recent upside movements, the resistance at this level has proven to be persistent, creating a precarious situation for the cryptocurrency.  As the price of SHIB hovers in this area, the question arises: Will the selling pressure overpower the bulls&#8217; determination and cause a reversal in the price action? Shiba Inu Faces Bearish Order Block And Potential Liquidity Hunt SHIB faces a significant challenge as its December 2022 low coincides with a bearish order block (OB) ranging from $0.00000785 to $0.00000824. This particular range, as highlighted in a recent SHIB price report, could serve as a stronghold for bearish sentiment in the market.
