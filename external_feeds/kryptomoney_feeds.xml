<p>Creditors of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/celsius-network-ceo-has-revival-plans-post-crypto-crash/">Celsius Network</a> LLC are seeking a subpoena against FTX to obtain information that may identify users involved in suspicious cryptocurrency trades that may have manipulated the price of Celsius’ native token last year. <br /><br />The creditors&#8217; committee said they want to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/celsius-creditors-seek-to-unmask-suspicious-ftx-crypto-trades?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic"> subpoena FTX</a> for information to identify users behind ten cryptocurrency wallets that they allege engaged in suspicious trades of Celsius’ CEL coin between April and August. <br /><br />The committee said they retained blockchain consultant Elementus Inc., which identified 947 transactions over a three-day period <em>“involving a near one-to-one relationship”</em> between CEL token deposits and withdraws between the ten private crypto wallets and wallets on the FTX exchange. <br /><br />The CEL trades in question occurred between the date Celsius paused customer withdrawals on June 12 and the company’s Chapter 11 filing on July 13, when the price of the token was 81 cents.<br /><br />The company has valued the token at 20 cents in its proposed Chapter 11 plan, but a committee representing Celsius creditors alleges that suspicious trades of the token on FTX may have artificially inflated the price to 81 cents between June and July 2020.<br /><br />FTX has not yet agreed to engage in informal discovery, and the bankruptcy case is being heard in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/kraken-secures-regulatory-nod-to-run-operations-in-ireland/">Kraken</a>, the cryptocurrency exchange, is pushing back against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the US, stating that the government agency’s requests for information about the exchange&#8217;s users amount to an <em>&#8220;unjustified treasure hunt.&#8221;</em> <br /><br />After failing to negotiate a narrower inquiry with the IRS, Kraken has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/crypto-exchange-kraken-blasts-irs-summons-as-treasure-hunt">requested</a> a federal court in San Francisco to order the IRS to back off. The IRS is investigating users who might be underreporting their tax liability. <br /><br />In a petition filed in February, the IRS said it wants to identify Kraken accounts that conducted at least $20,000 of cryptocurrency trading in any single year from 2016 to 2020. However, Kraken argues that the IRS has gone beyond the boundaries set by a US District Judge in a similar fight with Coinbase six years ago. Kraken argued in a court filing that <em>&#8220;Rather than abide by Coinbase&#8217;s ground rules, the IRS doubles down, making even more expansive requests and relying on a thinner rationale.&#8221;</em> <br /><br />In the Coinbase case, the IRS reduced its initial request, but Coinbase continued to resist. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ultimately ruled that the summons targeting over 14,000 of the exchange&#8217;s users was legitimate, as the IRS had a legitimate interest in investigating taxpayers who may not be reporting their Bitcoin gains. Kraken&#8217;s lawyers say the IRS <em>&#8220;wants more—and for a much bigger universe of users.&#8221;</em> Kraken agreed to pay $30 million in February to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its staking service was an illegal sale of securities. <br /><br />Corley has scheduled a hearing next month to hear arguments in the Kraken case, which is United States of America v. Payward Ventures Inc., 23-mc-80029, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). Kraken is one of the top crypto exchanges globally, with a daily trading volume of approximately $650 million, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>The HM Revenue and Customs, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-defi-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets--2">taxation</a> division of the United Kingdom, has released a consultation document seeking views on the taxation of lending and borrowing on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. <br /><br />The consultation aims to create a tax regime that aligns the taxation of crypto assets used in DeFi lending and staking with the underlying economic substance while reducing the administrative burden on users. <br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/uk-treasury-reveals-plans-to-propose-stablecoin-regulation/">UK government</a> aims to establish a clear tax and regulatory treatment of the DeFi field to position the country as a leader in safe, sustainable, and rapid innovation in crypto assets and blockchain technologies.<br /><br />The proposed legislative modifications suggest that the crypto used in DeFi transactions would no longer be treated as a disposal for tax. Instead, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) would apply in addition to tax disposal when the crypto assets are economically disposed of in a non-DeFi transaction. <br /><br />This consultation marks the second stage of a five-step process, and the final decision on whether to proceed with legislative changes will be made after the consultation. The other steps include drafting legislation, implementing and monitoring, and reviewing and evaluating the change.<br /><br />Investors, professionals, and firms engaged in DeFi activities, including technology and financial service firms; trade associations and representative bodies; academic institutions and think tanks; and legal, accountancy, and tax advisory firms are invited to submit their views on the matter by 22 June 2023. <br /><br />The Economic Secretary to the UK Treasury, Andrew Griffith, revealed that the authorities are planning to impose a regulatory framework on the crypto industry in the next 12 months. The lawmaker believes that the upcoming regulation will foster the development of the asset class and turn the UK into a global cryptocurrency hub.</p>

The latest increase in hashrate was attributed to the activation of 2,100 new miners and bringing existing miners to full capacity. <br /><br />The company is now targeting a hashrate of 6 EH/s by the end of the year, as it takes advantage of further expansion opportunities. Bitfarms has purchased 6,200 new miners, which are expected to bring its total hashrate to 5.7 EH/s once activated, and <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_88e732cba54d233f2260ca3a643f30d1/bitfarms/news/2023-04-24_Bitfarms_Receives_Permit_To_Power_Up_To_100_MW_In__186.pdf">more orders</a> for new equipment are in progress. <br /><br />With energy costs of less than $0.03 per kWh, Bitfarms has a &#8220;best-in-class average cost of Bitcoin mined&#8221;. The company, which is listed on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange, has ten mining facilities in Canada, the U.S., Paraguay, and Argentina, using hydroelectric power to mine Bitcoin at its other sites and natural gas in Argentina.<br /><br />The Argentina project, announced in April 2021, has an initial contract of eight years.</p>

Starting in May, users will be able to transfer funds to Venmo and PayPal accounts, as well as third-party wallets and exchanges. <br /><br />However, users will need to pay blockchain network fees when transferring funds to an external wallet or exchange, as per separate documentation.<br /><br />The documentation also states that Venmo crypto transfers will not be available to users in New York and that Venmo&#8217;s crypto services are currently unavailable in Hawaii.<br /><br />Although <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/52033-2/">Venmo</a> introduced crypto trading features in April 2021, this is the first time that users will be able to send and receive cryptocurrency through the app. <br /><br />The app&#8217;s previous crypto trading feature allowed users to buy, sell, and hold crypto, but not transact it. Similarly, PayPal launched crypto trading functionality before introducing transfers, launching those services in October 2020 and June 2022, respectively.<br /><br />Venmo and PayPal support Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash.</p>

Tether can be sold on cryptocurrency exchanges or through peer-to-peer marketplaces. You will need to have a Tether wallet and an account with a reputable exchange or marketplace to sell your Tether. Make sure to do your research to find a trustworthy platform to sell your Tether.</p>
<h2>Fees and Charges to Consider When Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>

<h3>Compare fiat currency to crypto prices</h3>

<p>Some platforms allow you to withdraw funds directly to your bank account, while others require you to transfer the funds to a digital wallet first. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid any delays or issues with the withdrawal process.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Investing in Stablecoins Like Tether</h2>
<p>Investing in Stablecoins like Tether can be a great way to hold value and diversify your portfolio in Dubai. Not only is it a secure and reliable form of cryptocurrency, but investing in stablecoins can also provide you with many advantages.</p>
<h3>Low volatility</h3>
<p>Stablecoins such as Tether have low volatility, meaning that the prices do not fluctuate as much compared to other types of cryptocurrencies. This makes it a great choice for those who are looking for less risk when it comes to their investments.</p>

<p><a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/announcing-polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-2">Polygon</a> has announced that the Polygon Bridge is now accessible for Polygon zkEVM, following the launch of the zero-knowledge rollup on Mainnet Beta a month ago. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin conducted the first symbolic transaction on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta.<br /><br />The protocol is intended to be an all-purpose <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/polygon-deploys-zkevm-scaling-solution-compatible-with-ethereum/">Ethereum scaling solution,</a> allowing developers to create on it using Ethereum&#8217;s language and tools. The Polygon Bridge for zkEVM has several new features, including a progress bar, transaction history, and recent transaction panel, all color-coded with time estimates for pending transactions and filtering capabilities. <br /><br />Powered by zero-knowledge technology, Polygon Bridge is governed entirely by smart contracts on Ethereum and Polygon zkEVM. ERC-20 tokens and the advanced features of ERC-777 tokens will also be supported.<br /><br />Polygon zkEVM eliminates the need for mapping, a process that can take hours or even days, by automatically mapping the token being bridged once the bridging transaction is triggered. <br /><br />The protocol has <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/polygonzkevm">attracted</a> $5.4 million in TVL since its launch last month, and Uniswap recently passed a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-staked-matic/">proposal</a> to authorize Polygon Labs to deploy the DEX protocol to zkEVM. Deposits to Polygon zkEVM have also risen significantly, with Quickswap and Sushi now live on the network. <br /><br />Polygon has experienced significant growth this year in terms of developer count and attracting major institutions. Nonetheless, the company behind the development of the layer 2 blockchain, Polygon Labs, announced a 20% workforce reduction in February.</p>

<p>In May, Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will release guidance on the licensing framework for crypto. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/hong-kong-sfc-to-issue-crypto-exchange-license-guidelines-in-may?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reported</a> that SFC CEO Julia Leung announced the ongoing consultation process for the regulatory framework for crypto entities in the city has received over 150 responses so far. <br /><br />The new regulatory framework will be effective from June 1, and it will mandate crypto platforms to register with the authorities in the city. <br /><br />Licensed exchanges can then offer cryptocurrency trading of major cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-rebounds-as-cpi-indicates-falling-inflation/">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, to retail traders. Hong Kong aims to become a financial hub for cryptocurrency in Asia, with two exchanges already offering crypto trading services under the supervision of the Hong Kong SFC. <br /><br />Several other exchanges might follow suit, as the city&#8217;s banking sector also offers <a href="https://www.digfingroup.com/hong-kong-crypto/">support</a> for crypto firms. However, some offshore exchanges have started restricting Hong Kong users due to regulatory demands. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603782171">Bitget</a>, for instance, has announced it will no longer provide services for Hong Kong users and that its Hong Kong users must transition to its subsidiary, BitGetX HK, which will apply for a license under the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) regime.</p>

<p>Circle has <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/usdc-cctp-an-open-dollar-platform-for-developers">launched</a> its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a new product that allows developers to move the USDC stablecoin between Ethereum and Avalanche with ease.<br /><br />The move removes the need for older methods of cross-chain transfers, which require locking and minting assets, and allows users to <em>&#8220;burn and mint&#8221;</em> or<em> &#8220;teleport&#8221;</em> USDC between blockchains. <br /><br />This means customers will be able to transact with USDC without needing to know which blockchain their assets are on, as apps that use CCTP will allow for seamless support of different native versions of USDC. More than 10 apps, including Ethereum wallet Metamask and Solana bridge Wormhole, have reportedly adopted CCTP to date. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/circle-usdc-issuer-hits-back-against-sec-action-with-facts-dispels-fud/">Circle</a> also plans to make CCTP <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/circle-delivers-usdc-interoperability-across-ecosystems-with-mainnet-launch-of-cross-chain-transfer-protocol-301807557.html">available</a> on various other chains throughout 2023. Although USDC is already available on a variety of blockchains, CCTP will allow for easy movement across those blockchains. <br /><br />With a market cap of $30 billion, USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin after Tether. <br /><br />In March, the asset briefly lost its peg with the US dollar, but Circle was able to access the $3.3 billion of USDC backing it had stored with Silicon Valley Bank, and USDC quickly regained its intended $1.00 price peg.</p>
