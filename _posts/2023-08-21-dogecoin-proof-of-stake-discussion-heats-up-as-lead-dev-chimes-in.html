Dogecoin Lead Developer, Mishaboar has expressed his doubts about a possible move to a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain consensus. The developer has stated that the transition to a POS mechanism is not a “sensible approach” and has highlighted several issues that could develop from the change. Mishaboar Objects To PoS Transition Mishaboar took to social media on August 20, to express his concerns about the potential impacts a PoS transformation could have on Dogecoin’s network and decentralized nature. In a recent Twitter post, he staunchly refuted the transition and stated that if the conversion pulls through, he may leave Dogecoin for another cryptocurrency network with a PoW consensus.  Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Avoids Market Crash, Do They Know Something You Don’t? “If this refers to a remote possibility of Doge ever switching to PoS, after what I have seen over the past 2 years, I would probably then move to another PoW crypto and customize the logo in my wallet to have a dog in it,” Mishaboar commented in a Twitter post.  Mishaboar has highlighted the possibilities of power imbalances that could result from a PoS switch since a significant amount of a cryptocurrency’s supply is controlled by exchanges.  He stated that the change to a PoS consensus could increase the control and influence of exchanges over a network. The developer also pointed out that Dogecoin may face increased regulatory challenges with the transition.  Furthermore, Mishaboar explained that cryptocurrencies that have transitioned to a PoS consensus have been overhyped, with most falling short of expectations and failing considerably or becoming so centralized that it contradicts the foundational structure of cryptocurrencies which is in its decentralized system.  Mishaboar concludes that transitioning into a PoS consensus does not align with Dogecoin’s futuristic goals and objectives. He mentioned that the benefits of a PoS consensus which is fast transactions can easily be achieved in the Dogecoin network with other solutions like integration of multiple payment channels.

And these two consensuses have their different advantages and disadvantages.  The advantages of a PoS are seen in its energy conservation and fast transactions. In contrast, a PoW consensus is considered more secure and more decentralized but is energy-intensive.  Related Reading: Elon Musk Shows Public Support For Pro-Crypto Presidential Candidate Some crypto investors argue that a PoS consensus would offer greater energy utilization and scalability. Whereas, others have sided with Mishaboar, strongly refuting the idea of centralization and security risks that follow a PoS transition. Mishaboar has been a prominent part of Dogecoin’s development, yet recent statements made by the enigmatic figure have led to speculations about the impact his rejection of Dogecoin’s possible PoS consensus could have on the project&#8217;s direction and development.
