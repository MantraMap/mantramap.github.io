The global investment bank&#8217;s economists also expect the Fed officials to forego hiking rates at their upcoming meeting. &#8220;We are penciling in 25 basis points of cuts per quarter but are uncertain about the pace,&#8221; Goldman said.</strong></p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs&#8217; Interest Rate Cut Prediction</h2>
<p>Global investment bank Goldman Sachs has predicted that the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates in Q2 next year. Goldman economists, including Jan Hatzius and David Mericle, detailed in a note Sunday:</p>
<blockquote><p>The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target, not by a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason, we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady,” the economists described. They noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are penciling in 25 basis points of cuts per quarter but are uncertain about the pace … We expect the funds rate to eventually stabilize at 3%-3.25%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goldman Sachs is not the only one forecasting a rate cut in the second quarter of 2024. Bank of America, for example, said in June that it expects the Fed to begin cutting interest rates in May next year.</p>

<p>Regarding further interest rate hikes, the Goldman economists anticipate that the Fed will not raise interest rates at its upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next month. They expect Federal Reserve officials to come to the conclusion at their November meeting “that the core inflation trend has slowed enough to make a final hike unnecessary.” The Fed&#8217;s aggressive campaign to combat inflation has pushed the benchmark interest rate to 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level since 2001.</p>
<p>Fed governors, including Michelle Bowman, believe that additional interest rate hikes may be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-governor-hints-at-more-interest-rate-hikes/">needed</a> to get inflation on a path down to the Fed’s 2% target. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said after the Fed&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-federal-funds-rate-by-25bps-amidst-moderate-economic-growth/">latest rate hike</a> that prevailing economic conditions suggest that monetary policy will likely need to be restrictive for longer, emphasizing: &#8220;We’re prepared to further tighten if that’s appropriate.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Coinbase Officially Launches in Canada</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) announced its &#8220;official launch in Canada&#8221; with a series of new offerings on Monday.</p>
<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted announcing the launch, stating that his company&#8217;s Canadian operation has new leadership, new payment rails, new regulatory milestones, and 200 local employees. &#8220;Smart countries are embracing this technology (and creating regulatory clarity) to help update the financial system and drive economic growth,&#8221; he described.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>&#8220;Through its partnership with Peoples Trust Company, part of Peoples Group, Coinbase is now providing access to Interac e-transfers to 100% of Canadian Coinbase users,&#8221; the exchange&#8217;s announcement details, elaborating: &#8220;This will make cryptocurrencies more accessible to millions of Canadians.&#8221; The Nasdaq-listed crypto firm noted that &#8220;Depositing funds to Coinbase using Interac is free and almost instant,&#8221; adding that in the last month, over 50% of deposits have been made through Interac e-transfer.</p>
<p>Nana Murugesan, Coinbase&#8217;s vice president for International and Business Development, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Canada is well positioned to be a global leader in the cryptoeconomy thanks to the high levels of crypto awareness, a passionate local tech ecosystem, and the progress towards a strong regulatory framework.</p></blockquote>

<p>David Furlong, chief operating officer of Peoples Group, opined: “Peoples Group is pleased to partner with industry leader Coinbase, to enable this money movement tool for their Canadian customers and expand payment possibilities.”</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), over 30% of Canadians said they will buy cryptocurrency within the year, more than double those who say they currently own crypto assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the United States, Coinbase is engaged in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/">filed charges</a> against Coinbase in June accusing the company of operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. Despite this, Coinbase has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-disputes-secs-allegation-that-the-exchange-lists-9-crypto-securities/">maintained</a> that the crypto tokens listed on its trading platforms are not securities. However, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler holds the view that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, besides bitcoin, are securities. Coinbase has appealed to the court to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-urges-court-to-dismiss-sec-case-claiming-regulator-overstepped-its-statutory-authority/">dismiss</a> the SEC lawsuit, contending that the regulatory body has exceeded its statutory authority.</p>

<h2>Paul Krugman on Alien Invasions</h2>
<p>Nobel laureate Paul Krugman discussed a variety of topics, including alien invasions and the U.S. economy, on Bloomberg&#8217;s Odd Lots podcast, published Friday. Krugman won the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 2008 for his analysis of trade patterns and location of economic activity.</p>
<p>He was asked: “Do you think there could be life elsewhere in the galaxy?&#8221; The economist replied: &#8220;I would think that it&#8217;s extremely unlikely that there isn&#8217;t.&#8221; Krugman was also asked: “Would an alien invasion be deflationary or inflationary?” The Nobel laureate replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that we can say it pretty almost surely would be inflationary.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Wars almost always are. And uncontested alien invasion, I guess it kind of depends on how they run the occupation,&#8221; he opined. &#8220;But actual wars are always inflationary. I can&#8217;t think of one that wasn&#8217;t. They always involve big government spending. Actually, they always involve a collision between large spending and at least temporarily reduced productive capacity.”</p>

<p>Krugman added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I said that the government should lie and claim that we were facing an imminent alien invasion. And that in order to fight that imminent alien invasion, what we needed was better infrastructure.</p></blockquote>
<p>“So we should have a big public infrastructure platform because things that people would never agree to simply in order to make people&#8217;s lives better, they will agree to in order to fight invasion,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>The economist took to Twitter after appearing on the podcast to clarify his view on alien invasions. &#8220;If there is intelligent life out there, it&#8217;s almost surely thousands or millions of years ahead of us. Not the kind of beings who&#8217;d be interested in invading Earth, let alone beings that Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum could outwit,&#8221; Krugman tweeted.</p>

He stressed that silver is &#x201C;a better bargain&#x201D; as a long-term investment than gold.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Urges Investors to Buy Silver</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has urged investors to buy silver before it&#x2019;s gone, noting that the precious metal is becoming rarer. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Monday that he considers both gold and silver God&#x2019;s money. However, the author pointed out that gold is multiple times more expensive than silver, noting that the latter, being an industrial precious metal, is becoming rarer due to its usage. Kiyosaki expressed his belief that silver is a better bargain as a long-term investment than gold. The well-known author further highlighted the affordability of silver, encouraging everyone to consider purchasing some before its availability diminishes. At the time of writing, the current spot price of silver is $22.70 while gold&#x2019;s spot price is $1,910.50.</p>

<p>In December last year, Kiyosaki explained on Twitter that he became a silver nut in 1964 when he was looking at a dime and saw a copper tinge around the edge. &#x201C;I was only 17 but I knew we were being screwed via our money. Little did I know then that the U.S. government violated Gresham&#x2019;s Law which states fake money drives out gold and silver,&#x201D; the famous author described.</p>

<p>This was not the first time Kiyosaki recommended silver. In July last year, he said silver is the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-discusses-best-investment-value-today/">best investment value</a> today, noting that he does not buy gold or silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) &#x2014; only real silver or gold coins. He also agreed with Andy Schectman, CEO of Miles Franklin Precious Metals, who said that &#x201C;silver is the most undervalued asset of a generation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Besides silver, Kiyosaki often recommends gold and bitcoin. He believes that the three investments are best for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">unstable times</a>. In February, he said that by 2025, gold will be at $5,000 while silver will rise to $500 and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">bitcoin will soar to $500,000</a>. He explained that gold, silver, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will see substantial gains because the faith in the U.S. dollar, which he referred to as fake money, &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-greatest-real-estate-crash-ever/">will be destroyed</a>.&#x201D;</p>

The device, christened the Antminer S21, is being hailed by Bitmain as the market&#x2019;s most proficient machine, marking a pivotal shift in the industry into the 1X joules per terahash (J/T) era.</strong></p>
<h2>Antminer S21: Bitmain&#x2019;s Next-Gen Bitcoin Miner to Debut at Hong Kong&#x2019;s WDMS 2023</h2>
<p>The impending launch of this new mining rig has been detailed in a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/X151JICJh__SqWpIXqxCQg">report</a> by Weixin, which highlights that the device will be revealed at the 2023 WDMS in Hong Kong from September 22 to 23, 2023. The Antminer S21, whose existence was also confirmed by local Chinese crypto reporter Colin &#x201C;Wu Blockchain,&#x201D; is poised to take center stage.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Bitmain announced that it will hold the Summit in Hong Kong from September 22 to 23, 2023 and release the latest Antminer S21 bitcoin mining machine,&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1691076107561558016?s=20">proclaimed</a> the reporter on the social media platform X. &#x201C;It claims that the energy efficiency ratio is lower than 20 J/T for the first time.&#x201D;</p>
<p>While the Weixin report refrains from disclosing the exact ratio, it underscores that the machine will shepherd &#x201C;the global mining industry into the 1X J/T era with unparalleled computing power and performance.&#x201D; Additionally, Bitmain announced at the conference that it will introduce a customer point system for S21 buyers, offering them discounts on the machines. The report, however, also remains silent on the specific terahash output of the new machine or whether the S21 will constitute a series of miners.</p>

<p>Back in May, Bitmain&#x2019;s rival Microbt took the wraps off a hydro-cooling Whatsminer machine, designated the M53S++, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">boasting up</a> to 320 terahash per second (TH/s) and an efficiency ratio of 22 J/T. In comparison, Bitmain&#x2019;s top-performing miners, the Antminer S19 Pro Hydro and the Antminer S19 XP Hydro, achieve 184 TH/s and 257 TH/s, respectively. The XP bitcoin mining machine crafted by Bitmain narrowly approaches the 20 J/T mark, registering at 20.8 J/T.</p>

Market volatility has eased, seemingly as a result of lower trading volumes due to the summer period. Despite this, history shows that bulls tend to return closer to the beginning of September. </strong></p>
<h2>Current Market Status</h2>
<p>Bitcoin rose above the $30,000 level last Tuesday, after Moody&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/moodys-downgrades-banks-list-of-downgraded-banks/#:~:text=Moody%27s%20is%20downgrading%20the%20credit,biggest%20lenders%20for%20potential%20downgrades.">downgraded</a> the credit rating of up to ten U.S. small and medium-sized banks.</p>
<p>Bitcoiners typically see any negative macroeconomic news to the traditional financial market, as a positive sign for future crypto adoption.</p>
<p>However, following this brief rally, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has since declined, and has mostly traded around the $29,000 level.</p>
<p>Despite this, could there be stronger gains in the coming weeks?</p>
<h2>August Outlook</h2>
<p>At the time of writing this, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) is trading at $29,607.50, as traders once again attempted to climb towards the $30,000 level.</p>
<p>These hopes came as an upward crossover of moving averages was on the cusp of occurring for the first time since June 21.</p>

<p>Should the 10-day (red) moving average crossover its 25-day counterpart, momentum will likely turn bullish.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, the relative strength index (RSI) pushed past a ceiling at 53.00, and looks to be heading towards a higher resistance of 58.00.</p>
<p>In the event of this taking place, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will be trading above $30,200.</p>
<p><em><strong>Where will bitcoin end the month? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.</strong></em></p>

After lying in slumber for an exacting 12.9 years, it awoke to spend a staggering 1,005 bitcoin, a sum swelling to an impressive value of more than $29 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Waking Giant: Bitcoin Address Stirs From 12.9-Year Slumber to Transfer $29.7 Million</h2>
<p>In these modern times, bitcoin transactions from the era of 2010 have become a rarity. The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rare-2010-bitcoin-block-reward-stirs-after-13-years-of-dormancy/">last known spending</a> of a dormant 2010 bitcoin occurred on July 24, 2023. On that particular day, a user unlocked a 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block reward, equivalent to $1.4 million. However, the movement on August 14, 2023, was tinged with a more extraordinary flair, as an astonishing 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, worth $29.7 million, was transferred.</p>
<p>The keen eyes of Btcparser.com <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=12vZGymxSfbXmYB6tHYS4oM8kMYYBxDZHx">first caught</a> this monumental movement, while Whale Alert further <a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/bitcoin/4c97e0c9475fd8ef1b14d2e8b79201d2b8fa423e164212c14580da5256d64d81">corroborated</a> the spend. Meanwhile, Blockchair&#x2019;s privacy meter unmasked the transaction&#x2019;s frailty, revealing that privacy was rather low when the 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was expended, and highlighting two critical flaws that undermined the transaction&#x2019;s anonymity.</p>
<p>According to the privacy tool, the 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> was gracefully swept into another address, accompanied by multiple appearances of the same address in the inputs. Blockchair reported that the funds found their new home at the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1q6r4t630f6hgek20lyj0phy8k43s8nl0zcrxsy7">bc1q6</a>,&#x201D; which, at the time of penning this account, comfortably nestles 1,004.99 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the original address harboring the 1,005 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> remained unmoved with respect to the <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/address/12vZGymxSfbXmYB6tHYS4oM8kMYYBxDZHx">corresponding bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> that the owner possesses. Bitcoin.com recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/idle-no-more-11-4-million-in-sleeping-bitcoins-wake-up-after-years-of-dormancy/">chronicled</a> the stirring of $11.4 million worth of slumbering bitcoins from 2016 and 2014, as they awakened this past weekend after years of inertia.</p>

<p>These slumbering bitcoin transactions, particularly the enigmatic ones from 2010, inject a sense of intrigue and speculation. Enthusiasts find themselves captivated by the mystery, endeavoring to unravel the identity of the owner and the narrative intertwined with the coins.</p>
<p>Beyond the allure, this movement stands as a testament to the durability and longevity of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> private keys when safeguarded with diligence.</p>

Addressing the widespread issue of tainted change, also known as leftover unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) remaining from Whirlpool Coinjoins, this could represent a monumental advancement in the cryptocurrency landscape.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tackling the Tainted Change Problem</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/">Samourai Wallet</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1687896997615882241?s=20">unveiled</a> a new capability allowing <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> to <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR/">monero (XMR)</a> atomic swaps, offering a more discreet means of transacting. Atomic swaps enable two parties to exchange different cryptocurrencies without requiring a trustworthy intermediary. Samourai&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> atomic swaps enhance this by integrating a privacy-oriented approach.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once in place, the system will grant users a more efficient way to handle tainted change, essentially UTXOs leftover from Whirlpool Coinjoins. This change or residual fragments of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> can result in diminished privacy and be detected by blockchain surveillance programs. Samourai has collaborated with the <a href="https://monero.observer/pokkst-rebrands-mynero-mysu-wallet-with-v0.4.2.1-release/">Mysu wallet</a> developer, <a href="https://twitter.com/pokkst">Pokkst</a>, on the atomic swap functionality.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tainted or leftover change from Coinjoins has been an acknowledged issue for some time, and major brands supporting the Coinjoin scheme often overlook discussing the problem. Besides Samourai addressing tainted change concerns, the bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-users-have-mixed-millions-of-dollars-since-cashshuffles-launch/">Cashshuffle</a> system was transitioned into <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashfusion-practical-says-data-analyst/">Cashfusion</a> for this specific reason. Some wallets also employ a method called &#x201C;change output inclusion&#x201D; to tackle tainted change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>), a cryptocurrency with a focus on privacy, made its debut on April 18, 2014. Employing the Cryptonote protocol, Monero&#x2019;s use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and bulletproofs conceals the particulars of both the sender and recipient, ensuring transaction confidentiality. This makes <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> appealing to those seeking financial privacy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The potential to facilitate <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a> through atomic swaps offers the prospect of immediate, trust-free exchanges between the two digital currencies, eliminating the necessity for a middleman.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Although Samourai&#x2019;s feature has received praise from the privacy community, several <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> maximalists have critiqued it for utilizing <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR/">monero (XMR)</a>. An X user going by the name &#x201C;Platelicker&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/PlateLicker_21m/status/1687916641391181824?s=20">asked</a> followers if Samourai should be &#x201C;canceled.&#x201D; Unfazed by the criticism, Samourai continues to develop the feature.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&#x201C;No one influences our roadmap but us,&#x201D; Samourai <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1687897001877258241?s=20">posted</a> to X. &#x201C;No one will bully us into submission. You&#x2019;re either along for the ride or you aren&#x2019;t. If you want off the ride, you better jump because we&#x2019;re not slowing down for you. It&#x2019;s as simple as that.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The introduction of Samourai&#x2019;s feature coincides with a period where enthusiasm for privacy features among cryptocurrency advocates has waned in recent years. Increasingly, influencers have compromised privacy to seek state approval or recognition and regulation of digital currencies like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). Anonymity-enhancing crypto tools have been relegated, privacy coins delisted from prominent exchanges, and a significant number of today&#x2019;s crypto influencers and businesses <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1690801896448016384?s=20">embrace regulations and KYC</a> as positive aspects.</p>

The move comes despite the global market cap mostly trading lower to start the week, falling 0.23% as of writing. Dogecoin fell for a second straight session.</strong></p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink snapped a four-day losing streak on Monday, despite the global market cap mostly tracking lower to start the week.</p>
<p>Following a low of $7.32 on Sunday, LINK/USD jumped to a peak of $7.54 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>Monday’s move sees chainlink edge closer to a key resistance level of $7.65, which was last truly broken on July 30.</p>

<p>In addition to this, an upward crossover between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages looks imminent.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a strong possibility that chainlink may not only move past the aforementioned ceiling, but closer to the $8.00 level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, LINK is tracking at $7.49.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum, dogecoin moved lower for a second straight session, following last week’s bull run.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD fell to a low of $0.07409 to start the week, following an earlier high of $0.07615 the day prior.</p>
<p>Since peaking at a multi-week high of $0.0776 on Saturday, dogecoin has mostly traded in the red, which appears to be largely due to profit taking.</p>

<p>This spell of bearish pressure looks to be pushing price towards a key support level around the $0.0730 region.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovered close to its own floor, at the 50.00 mark.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 50.35, with the meme coin now trading at $0.07458.</p>

The month of August, however, has experienced two notable dips, each registering fewer than 100,000 inscriptions per day. These low points in August occurred specifically on August 4 and August 8, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>From Records to Recursive Ordinals</h2>
<p>On August 11, 2023, the Bitcoin blockchain observed the number of Ordinal inscriptions exceeded 23 million. That particular day documented an impressive 252,653 inscriptions, representing more than half of the highest figure in August.</p>
<p>This apex transpired on August 6 as a remarkable 408,810 inscription records were engraved into the chain. This record-breaking feat on August 6 stands as the second-highest daily tally since the introduction of the Ordinal inscription trend.</p>

<p>Since Ordinals&#x2019; inception in December 2022, bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) miners <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">accumulated</a> a total of 1,902.58 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from inscriptions, equating to over $55 million in value. Miners experienced fluctuating daily returns in August, ranging from 1.3 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to just above 4 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> due to inscriptions.</p>
<p>A noteworthy 72.3% of all Ordinal inscriptions utilize the &#x201C;text/plain;charset=utf-8&#x201D; format, whereas 20.9% conform to &#x201C;text/plain&#x201D; encoding. The remaining inscriptions &#x2014; 6.8% &#x2014; consist of various files such as PNG, JSON, webp, SVG, JPEG, HTML, GIF, mp4, mpeg, avif, javascript, pdf, PGP signature, midi, and wav.</p>

<p>For example, August 12 witnessed a total of 279,231 inscriptions added to the Bitcoin blockchain; among these were text-formatted files (277,180), images (546), applications (1,500), and five classified as &#x201C;other,&#x201D; according to Dune Analytics metrics. Furthermore, data dashboard creators @dgtl_assets also emphasize the presence of recursive Ordinals.</p>
<p>Introducing composability and the capacity to invoke other inscriptions&#x2019; content using a unique syntax, recursive Ordinals have significantly impacted the technology. A total of 138,365 recursive Ordinals have been engraved onto the Bitcoin blockchain thus far. With many in text format and a smaller number inscribed in image format.</p>

<p>Non-fungible token (NFT) sales statistics demonstrate 170,165 distinct addresses have traded <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">$300,066,361</a> in value over 682,047 Ordinal transactions. These transactions took place on marketplaces including Okx, Unisat, Magic Eden, Gamma, Open Ordex, Ordinals Wallet, Ordswap, Ordinals Market and Ordinals Market bt.</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin&#x2019;s standing in the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">NFT sales market</a> has significantly declined; out of 21 unique blockchain networks, Bitcoin now ranks seventh in sales over the past week. This trend is consistent with the 30-day sales ranking, where Bitcoin also holds the seventh position.</p>
<p>Once a formidable contender, claiming the second-place spot, Bitcoin has since been overshadowed. In the past month, chains such as Solana, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, Polygon, Mythos, and Immutable X have managed to outshine Bitcoin, reflecting a shift in the marketplace.</p>
