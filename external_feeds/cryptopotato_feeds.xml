			            <description><![CDATA[BlockFi said that the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors have backed the proposal.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bankrupt crypto lender, BlockFi revealed that the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey has conditionally approved its disclosure statement.</p>
<p>The development essentially demonstrated that the reorganization process of BlockFi continues to make gradual progress eight months after filing the voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<ul>
<li>In an official <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230802310688/en/BlockFi%E2%80%99s-Disclosure-Statement-Conditionally-Approved-by-Court" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> on August 2nd, Mark Renzi &#8211; BlockFi’s Chief Restructuring Officer, highlighted the lender&#8217;s aim to maximize recoveries for its creditors.</li>
<li>Renzi added that the conditional approval of its Disclosure Statement moves BlockFi &#8220;one step closer to accomplishing that goal.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are confident that our Plan provides the best path to expeditiously return crypto back to our clients and we strongly urge BlockFi’s clients to vote to accept it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>If the bankruptcy plan is approved, BlockFi plans to focus on recovering funds from other defunct firms, including Alameda, FTX, 3AC, Emergent, Marex, and Core Scientific, in a bid to &#8220;maximize recoveries for clients and defending against claims by third parties, which threaten to massively dilute clients.&#8221;</li>
<li>However, the proposed bankruptcy plans have met with strict <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blockfis-bankruptcy-plans-faces-stiff-opposition-from-ftx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">opposition</a> from the disgraced crypto exchange FTX, fallen hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
<li>The plan presents clients with the option for releases if they choose not to withdraw from a voluntary third-party release, which absolves them from any claims and causes of action that BlockFi may have against them. This release is applicable for most clients, with the exception of those who withdrew $250,000 or more from BlockFi Interest Accounts (BIA) or BlockFi Private Client (BPC) Accounts on or after November 2, 2022.</li>
<li>The scheduled date for voting on the proposed reorganization is September 11.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Matter Labs said that public accusations of a complete lack of attribution go against the ethos of Open Source movement.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>zkSync creator and Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski refuted allegations of plagiarizing code without appropriately crediting zero-knowledge scaling firm Polygon Zero. Gluchowski called the accusations &#8220;unfounded, misleading, and extremely disappointing&#8221; from a team the exec &#8220;highly respects.&#8221;</p>
<p>The comments are in response to Polygon Zero&#8217;s lengthy blog post accusing the developers of Matter Labs of copy-pasting &#8220;a substantial amount of source code&#8221; from performance-critical components of the Plonky2 library.</p>
<h2>Matter Labs&#8217; Feud With Polygon Zero</h2>
<p>Polygon <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x70DF15b0208eFCeFaA541Da9A0ED6C4A884554Fc/gNi8coqXjd1ybFsQBAG7QARUkPHZECu7ihIRkpiVx2Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claimed</a> that Matter Labs&#8217; recent release, Boojum, integrated certain code from Plonky2, a zero-knowledge technology created by Polygon. While the Plonky2 platform is open-source, Polygon raised concerns about Matter Labs&#8217; failure to include the code in Boojum without original copyrights or clear attribution to the original authors.</p>
<p>In addition to the &#8220;directly copied code,&#8221; Polygon claimed that Boojum is extremely similar to Plonky2, highlighting the use of the same strategy of parallel repetition to foster soundness in a small field, similar custom gates to efficiently arithmetic recursive verification, as well as the same lookup argument developed by the scaling firm&#8217;s teammate Ulrich Haböck.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To add insult to injury, the founder of Matter Labs claimed that Boojum is more than 10x faster than Plonky2. Wondering how this is possible, given that the performance-critical field arithmetic code is directly copied from Plonky2? You should be.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Polygon further said that it is &#8220;extremely misleading&#8221; to claim that Boojum is 10x faster than Plonky2.</p>
<h2>Response</h2>
<p>Gluchowski <a href="https://twitter.com/gluk64/status/1687263207860166656" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">maintained</a> that the Matter Labs&#8217; team gave credit to Polygon in the first line of the Boojum module and went on to elaborate that nearly 5% of the Boojum code draws inspiration from the Plonky2 codebase. He also emphasized that both Plonky2 and Boojum stem from the RedShift framework, an initiative pioneered by Matter Labs three years before the unveiling of the Plonky2 paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We could have done it better. The community rightfully pointed out that there is a more standard approach to attributions, which we will wholeheartedly apply from now on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Matter Labs asserted that if the Polygon Zero team wanted additional credit, they could have submitted a pull request which the former &#8220;would have happily accepted.&#8221;</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The trio has given the hackers until August 6 to return 90% of the funds, or the bounty would be offered to the public and given to anyone who would identify them.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized exchange Curve Finance has teamed up with Metronome and Alchemix to offer a 10% bug bounty to the attackers behind the recent exploit that saw more than $50 million siphoned off the platforms’ pools.</p>
<p>According to an on-chain <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc45e47f6e7d3e74763032e2fb991fa9a003d8ed55c13c93c6a5368ff322d7742" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">message</a> on one hacker’s Ethereum address, the protocols are willing to cease the pursuit of the case if the attackers return 90% of the stolen funds, keeping 10% for themselves.</p>
<h2>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix Offer Hacker 10% Bounty</h2>
<p>Recall that four Curve Finance pools were <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/curve-finance-hacker-returns-5-4-million-but-crv-dumps-15/" data-wpel-link="internal">exploited</a> on July 30. The attackers were able to access the pools using Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract programming language Vyper through a malfunctioning re-entrancy lock.</p>
<p>The exploit affected decentralized finance protocols like Metronome, Alchemix, and Ellipsis. While the total amount lost due to the hack remains unclear, the losses are estimated to be above $50 million.</p>
<p>Curve, Metronome, and Alchemix have taken steps toward recovering the funds by reaching out to attackers on-chain, promising no risk of law enforcement issues if they comply with the offer. The trio has given the hackers until August 6 to return 90% of the funds, or the bounty would be offered to the public and given to anyone who would identify them.</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by August 6 at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public, and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law,” the protocols said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Roughly $5.4M Returned</h2>
<p>The platforms proceeded to provide an email address – for the exploiters to contact them for negotiations as soon as possible. They noted that whoever claims to be the exploiter would need to verify their ownership of the addresses holding the stolen funds before any discussions can take place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a white hat hacker named c0ffeebabe.eth already returned 2,879 ETH worth approximately $5.4 million to the protocol deployer address on July 31 after exploiting one of the exchange’s pools to prevent more losses.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are now more live Ethereum futures ETF applications than Bitcoin spot ETF ones.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While anticipation over a potential Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETF has gripped investors, an Ethereum (ETH) ETF approval may also be waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Bloomberg analysts are now assigning 75% odds of one such product being approved in the United States this year.</p>
<h2>Ethereum ETF On The Horizon</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1687437656613924864" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweeted</a> by Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart on Friday, the organization’s approval odds are the same as those it assigned for a Bitcoin futures ETF in early September 2021.</p>
<p>The very first U.S.-based fund of the kind – the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) launched in late October of that year, pulling in $1 billion within two days of its launch.</p>
<p>At the time, many companies were vying to list the product after Gary Gensler – Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – stated that he was confident in the investor protections that a futures ETF framework could provide.</p>
<p>Today there are 13 Ethereum ETF applications knocking on the SEC’s door, from 8 different applicants including Bitwise, Proshares, and Grayscale. Based on the SEC’s deadlines, the first in line for approval or denial is Volatility Shares’ Ethereum Strategy ETF, by October 11.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC appears to be changing its posture towards crypto, based on reports of its back channel messaging to ETF issuers,” wrote the analysts. “We believe the SEC would have a hard time in court defending the denial of Ethereum futures ETFs after approving standard and leveraged Bitcoin futures ETFs. “</p></blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Spot ETF Approval Odds</h2>
<p>As of August 4, there are 9 active Bitcoin spot ETF applications pending review by the SEC, with the latest applicant being from CBOE on behalf of the Global X Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>Like all other applications, CBOE’s latest filing selects <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-to-the-rescue-coinbase-cites-ripple-ruling-seeks-to-end-sec-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a> as a surveillance-sharing partner for detecting market manipulation – a crucial issue for the SEC for which its denied every major spot ETF application so far.</p>
<p>Shares for a Bitcoin spot ETF are backed by actual BTC held under custody by the trust and its partners. By contrast, futures ETFs are backed by Bitcoin futures contracts, which may not perfectly track the price of BTC at any particular time.</p>
<p>Unlike competitors, Grayscale is vying to convert its Bitcoin trust into a spot ETF by battling the SEC in court. The company argues that the regulator’s approval of futures ETFs, but not spot ETFs, demonstrates “arbitrary and capricious” treatment of the latter.</p>
<p>Recently, Bloomberg analysts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bloomberg-boosts-bitcoin-spot-etf-approval-odds-to-65-heres-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> their odds of a Bitcoin spot ETF approval this year to 65%, which they expect will come on the back of a Grayscale court victory.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has gradually declined over the past few weeks after being rejected from the psychological resistance level of $2,000 once more. However, there is a considerable chance to initiate a new bullish leg in the short term.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has recently demonstrated bearish price action. The 50-day moving average, located around the $1,900 mark, was broken to the downside after holding the mark for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The 200-day moving average, trending around the $1,800 area, and the $1,750 support level are likely targets for the market to reach in the coming days. Yet, a rebound from these support elements seems likely, leading to another run toward the $2,000 mark and even higher.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264503" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264503" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-264503 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_0408231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ETHUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264503" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price has failed to hold above the $1,930 level and is currently testing the $1,830 support zone. If this level holds, the market is likely to rally toward the $2,000 level once more, with a high likelihood of finally breaking through it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a breakdown of the $1,830 level would likely result in a further decline toward the $1,750 level in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>Ethereum Taker Buy Sell Ratio</h3>
<p>Over the past few weeks, Ethereum&#8217;s price has been oscillating in a very tight range, leaving investors wondering about the direction of the next move. In this situation, analyzing the futures market sentiment might provide valuable insight.</p>
<p>This chart shows the taker buy-sell ratio, which indicates whether long or short traders are more aggressive. Values above 1 are considered bullish, while values below 1 indicate aggressive selling pressure on aggregate.</p>
<p>As the chart depicts, this metric has been constantly dropping lower below 1, showing little intent to recover. This selling pressure in the futures market is probably offsetting the spot market demand, leading to range-bound price action.</p>
<p>Therefore, investors should look forward to the taker buy-sell ratio rising above 1, which could potentially result in a new higher high in the short term.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price is currently correcting after a significant surge following the win against SEC. However, there is little reason for concern as there are multiple support levels nearby.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></p>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>XRP/USDT Daily Chart:</strong></p>
<p>Against USDT, the price has been constantly declining after being rejected from the $0.9 resistance level. The market is likely targeting the 50-day moving average around the $0.6 support level.</p>
<p>The 200-day moving average trending near the $0.5 mark is also another key support that the price would test in case of a breakdown of the 50-day MA. In any case, the market seems more likely to rebound from these levels and start a new bullish phase.</p>
<figure id="attachment_264505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-264505" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-264505 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_0408231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/XRPUSDT-Daily-Aug-4-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-264505" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>XRP/BTC Daily Chart</strong></p>
<p>Against BTC, XRP&#8217;s price has been decisively rejected to the downside by the 2,800 SAT resistance level. The cryptocurrency is currently on a steep downtrend towards the 2,200 SAT area.</p>
<p>In case the level holds, XRP is likely to attempt the 2,800 SAT area again in the next few weeks. Conversely, a breakout below the mentioned level would result in a deeper pullback, with the 50-day moving average being the probable short-term target.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[That's right - SHIB is the only well-performing altcoin for the past seven days in a market that's otherwise completely stuck for the time being.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say that the price action within the cryptocurrency market this week was underwhelming would be the understatement of the year. Most of the top altcoins are charting losses as Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains completely flat for the past seven days.</p>
<p>In fact, Bitcoin&#8217;s volatility has been so insignificant that on a 10-day average, it&#8217;s about to become less than that of stocks and even gold. That&#8217;s right &#8211; the &#8220;highly volatile&#8221; Bitcoin that&#8217;s unpredictable and &#8220;risky&#8221; has seen less action than &#8230; gold. But it is what it is, and BTC has absolutely failed to produce any substantial movement in the past week, losing a slight 0.2%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the altcoins are bleeding out. XRP is down 7%, ADA is down 5%, SOL &#8211; 5.4%, TRON &#8211; 7.3%, MATIC &#8211; 5.6%, and so forth. This has helped Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance. To those unaware, this is the metric which tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market. It increased by 0.5% in the past seven days, which highlights exactly how weak altcoins are at the moment.</p>
<p>But not all altcoins are made equal, and it turns out that SHIB is the only one from the majors that performed well. The cryptocurrency is up some 5% on the week in a sea of red. It&#8217;s not without a good reason. Binance, the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency exchange, just announced that it will now start accepting SHIB as collateral. This is big news, and it&#8217;s the primary catalyst for the altcoin&#8217;s surge in value.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Coinbase is moving to dismiss the case against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The exchange has cited the ruling in Ripple&#8217;s case against the Commission, where Judge Analisa Torres determined secondary sales of XRP to NOT constitute an investment contract. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how the legal spat will turn out, as that ruling offers a pivotal moment.</p>
<p>All in all, it&#8217;s also worth noting that the ongoing bear market is turning out to be the longest in crypto&#8217;s relatively nascent history. It&#8217;s been going on for more than two years now, and we have yet to see when it will end.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Coinbase said crypto assets fall outside the SEC's delegated authority as set by Congress.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>America&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has submitted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The motion, <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/7eaTxSOvCLrGR2frvCqS3Q/b98f952657b7bc821b218d1f601b9161/CoinbasevSEC12_c_Motion.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, argues that crypto assets are neither investment contracts nor securities and so fall outside the SEC&#8217;s delegated authority as set by Congress.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Seeks to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit</h2>
<p>Recall that the SEC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> Coinbase on June 6, a day after unveiling a slew of charges against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange. The agency accused Coinbase of failing to register as a national securities exchange, clearing agency, and broker, despite functioning as all three.</p>
<p>The U.S. regulator also alleged that Coinbase violated securities laws by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-was-aware-it-violated-us-securities-laws-claims-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">availing</a> unregistered assets that passed the Howey test on its platform for trade while claiming to be legally compliant. The agency named 12 crypto assets, including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-does-ripples-victory-over-sec-mean-for-sol-ada-and-other-alleged-security-tokens/" data-wpel-link="internal">ADA, Matic, and SOL</a>, as securities in the lawsuit.</p>
<p>In addition, the SEC accused the crypto exchange of failing to register its staking-as-a-service product, which is also a security, thereby denying investors crucial information about the program.</p>
<p>In defense, Coinbase argued that the SEC violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws in the lawsuit by ignoring the true definition and application of the Howey Test.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Says it Does Not Offer Investment Contracts</h2>
<p>Coinbase insisted that the SEC can pursue enforcement action only if transactions on its platform constitute investment contracts and, therefore, securities. Citing the SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple Labs, and several others, the exchange asserted that none of them are <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-wanted-coinbase-to-delist-all-crypto-assets-except-bitcoin-before-lawsuit-ft/" data-wpel-link="internal">securities</a> in accordance with relevant laws; hence the agency&#8217;s claims must be dismissed.</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe title="BREAKING: XRP PRICE EXPLODES as RIPPLE WINS HUGE VICTORY AGAINST SEC | CRYPTO WIN!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUTDJAy0Kxs" width="872" height="491" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SEC does not and cannot allege that transactions in the 12 tokens identified in the Complaint that take place on Coinbase&#8217;s secondary market spot exchange, or on other secondary market exchanges through Coinbase Prime, carry such rights. They are asset sales, with the obligations of buyer and seller discharged at the point of sale,&#8221; the crypto exchange said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase further insisted that it does not operate as a broker just because it offers free wallet software that allows users to store and access their digital assets on their devices.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Despite the decline, XRP was still up by more than 80% in the past year.   ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the midst of a lackluster price movement across the wider cryptocurrency market, XRP experienced an unusual downward trend.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency recently became the fifth-largest crypto by market cap owing to Ripple&#8217;s partial but impressive win against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The asset even briefly surpassed BNB as the fourth-largest last month. After posting double-digit gains for quite some time, the bulls appear to have entered a phase of exhaustion.</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest data suggest that XRP lost nearly 10% of its value in the last week and was currently trading at $0.66. The downtrend has been gradual since hitting a yearly high above $0.92 in mid-July. It&#8217;s down over 25% since then.</li>
<li>Traders are dumping their XRP holdings, and experts suggest that the trend could potentially extend further downside action near $0.55.</li>
<li>While the recent ruling in SEC v. Ripple Labs has been rightfully hailed as a huge step forward for the crypto sector, there has been significant development on the blockchain firm&#8217;s expansion front that could boost XRP&#8217;s price.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has gone through a lot in the past few years, giving birth to many sub-niches, perhaps the most prominent one of which is meme coins.</p>
<p>Dogecoin &#8211; the original meme coin &#8211; was developed as a joke. It had no purpose. In fact, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-dogecoin-doge-5-facts-about-the-crypto-that-started-as-a-joke/" data-wpel-link="internal">here are five things</a> that you might not know about it. Despite that, people flocked to buy the meme coin, turning it into a billion-dollar project with millions of holders.</p>
<p>Since then, many other meme coins have tried to achieve the same, but few have had similar success. Shiba Inu (SHIB), for once, came the closest.</p>
<p>Crypto traders and meme coin enjoyers rushed to buy SHIB at the beginning of 2021 &#8211; much later compared to Dogecoin, turning the cryptocurrency into a force to be considered. Unlike its predecessor, though, Shiba Inu’s team had great plans to develop a vibrant ecosystem of usable applications that would bring real value to SHIB holders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many of those plans failed to come to fruition, while others were underwhelming. In any case, SHIB remains the second-largest meme coin, with hundreds of thousands of followers and holders.</p>
<p>One of those holders was a developer that would later become known as Golden Takeishi &#8211; the founder of Golden Inu.</p>
<p><em>CryptoPotato </em>has already had the chance to chat with him, and you can find the full interview <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/challenging-shiba-inu-an-ico-presale-becoming-top-meme-coin-of-2023-an-interview-with-golden-inus-founder/" data-wpel-link="internal">here</a>.</p>

<h2>What is Golden Inu?</h2>
<p>Golden Inu has quickly become one of the hottest topics of conversation in 2023 amid meme coin aficionados. In June 2023, the token that underpins its ecosystem &#8211; $GOLDEN &#8211; outpaced the majority of meme coins in terms of returns on investment, while the team behind it is working on expanding its reach further.</p>
<p>In essence, the project aims to build a vibrant ecosystem of tools that its community to use and benefit from.</p>
<p>$GOLDEN is the token that underpins this ecosystem, and it’s at the forefront of the project. It will be the f0ule of the Golden Inu Ecosystem.</p>
<h2>The Golden Inu Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The vibrant community of Golden Inu is not just one that holds a token in hopes of future growth. Through a series of implementations, the team has found a way to involve community members in a way they can all help create a thriving crypto ecosystem.</p>
<h3>The Golden Quest</h3>
<p>The Golden Quest is a collaboration between Golden Inu and QuestN. It’s designed to allow users to earn money to help build the project’s ecosystem, market it, and so forth.</p>
<p>Through the official <a href="https://app.dework.xyz/golden-inu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">dashboard</a>, or that of <a href="https://app.questn.com/GoldenInuToken" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">QuestN</a>, everyone is free to join the community and start working on various tasks and earn money while also supporting the project.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264481" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.png" alt="Picture2" width="624" height="353" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2.png 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-300x170.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-50x28.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>As seen in the above screenshot (real-time), there are numerous tasks that anyone could pick up. It’s worth noting that the levels of expertise tend to range from primary social media and online marketing skills to more complex levels of coding or design. In essence, there’s room for anyone &#8211; a beginner or novice.</p>
<p>This powerful method of building a solid and united community is also part of the reason why the project was able to raise over $400,000 during its ICO for the two tokens.</p>
<h3>The Golden Dashboard</h3>
<p>To make it easier for users to track everything Golden Inu-related, the team has also created a powerful dashboard &#8211; the <a href="https://goldendashboard.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Golden Dashboard</a>.</p>
<p>It provides detailed information in Layman’s terms for everything associated with the project, spanning from branding, tokenomics, roadmap, and whatnot.</p>
<p>It’s made in a way that even a novice user or a seasoned veteran would understand. It helps build the proper cryptocurrency trading habits with anyone by allowing users to see what a legitimate coin should be doing.</p>
<p>This is what it looks like:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264480" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-9.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="624" height="376" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-9.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-9-300x181.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-9-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, there’s all the fundamental information available, including the performance of the token, the most recent stories associated with the brand, upcoming launches, and much more.</p>
<h3>The Golden Inuverse</h3>
<p>In a clever wordplay, the team has introduced what’s planned to be the first of a few planned play-to-earn (P2E) games that will drive gamers into the Golden Inu universe.</p>
<p>The game’s intended to structure the $GOLDEN tokens subculture and help thousands of people get acquainted with both the tokens and the ecosystem of Golden Inu.</p>
<p>The game will be ever-evolving and immersive, allowing users to both explore and battle. It will start with a number of planets, but more of them will be created as certain milestones are reached with the counts of users that have joined in on the game.</p>
<p>To develop their characters, players will be able to make in-game purchases. These will range from special characters as well as offensive or defensive weapons and cross-planetary travels.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the game, as well as its release timeline, <a href="https://www.goldeninuverse.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, that’s how one of the NFT characters presented on the website look like:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264479" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4.png" alt="Picture4" width="437" height="603" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4.png 437w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-217x300.png 217w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture4-36x50.png 36w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" /></a></p>
<p>Users are able to gain complete access to their profiles as they play in the Inuverse. The more they play, the stronger their character becomes. This allows them to unlock specific weapons and advance further into the world.</p>
<h3>The Golden Bazaar</h3>
<p>The Golden Bazaar will be an e-commerce trading platform that’s inspired by the likes of Amazon and Shopify &#8211; of course, throughout their humble beginnings.</p>
<p>The plan for it is to start as a simple application where users can freely buy and sell various products and services. They will be able to transact in crypto.</p>
<p>However, as time goes on, developers are hoping to integrate a cross-chain swapping application that would allow users to complete transactions with any commonly used cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>More importantly, buyers will be able to use any crypto of choice, while sellers can receive any crypto of choice, and $GOLDEN will be the middle-man token that allows the swap to happen. The fees will be absolutely minimal.</p>
<h3>The Golden Decentralized Exchange (DEX)</h3>
<p>The DEX is yet another product in the pipeline that will further complement the ecosystem of Golden Inu.</p>
<p>The goal is to protect the right to anonymity of users by creating a truly decentralized cryptocurrency exchange. The launch will target Latin America with a clear understanding of the economic challenges that the locals are facing.</p>
<p>Golden Inu developers hope to help lower the gas fees for traders who want to carry out cross-chain trades by using the $GOLDEN token as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the specifics of the $GOLDEN token, please have a look at the journey ahead &#8211; the project’s roadmap.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264478" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-2.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="624" height="196" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-2.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-2-300x94.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture5-2-50x16.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>
<h2>The $GOLDEN Token</h2>
<p>The $GOLDEN token is the beating heart of the thriving ecosystem. It’s purpose is to seamlessly connect Ethereum and the BNB chain.</p>
<p>That’s right &#8211; it’s a dual token that’s deployed on both networks.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the token is to revolutionize the global cryptocurrency landscape in a way that pioneers a bright and interconnected future.</p>
<p>Whenever assessing a token, it’s critical to look at its tokenomics, and for $GOLDEN, there are two sides to it because of its dual nature.</p>
<p>As general information, here’s a chart that summarizes some of the basics:</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture6-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-264477" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture6-1.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="624" height="255" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture6-1.jpg 624w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture6-1-300x123.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture6-1-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px" /></a></p>

<h2>The Golden Inu Team</h2>
<p>A critical part of every project is its team. The founder of Golden Inu has chosen to remain anonymous for the wider audience but has been verified on two separate cryptocurrency verification systems.</p>
<p>He is known as “Golden Takeishi”- a technology whiz that was once a bag holder of Shiba Inu. <em>CryptoPotato </em>has a dedicated fully-fledged interview with him. We encourage you to take a look at the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/challenging-shiba-inu-an-ico-presale-becoming-top-meme-coin-of-2023-an-interview-with-golden-inus-founder/" data-wpel-link="internal">full interview</a> to find out exciting details about both the founder and the project.</p>
<p>Speaking of Golden Inu’s goal, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our goal is to merge the infectious appeal of Inu tokens with robust, branded crypto technology and an effective economic model. A model that ensures sustainable growth, utility, and passive income. We are confident that our actions will speak louder than the perceptions tied to our brand name.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an effort to prevent competitors from reverse-engineering, the entire team cannot be revealed. However, here’s a list of the current members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Founder (French)</li>
<li>Six web application developers (Romanian/Serbian)</li>
<li>1 web application security specialist (Romanian)</li>
<li>3 Contextual Content Creators (US American)</li>
<li>3 Graphic Designers (Asian)</li>
<li>1 NFT specialist (Asian)</li>
<li>1 Media Content Creator (Central European)</li>
</ul>
