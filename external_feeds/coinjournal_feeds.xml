										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitget says it made a bunch of notable achievements in the second quarter of this year &ndash; a few of which it underscored in a <a href="https://www.bitget.com/blog/articles/bitget-sees-second-highest-increase-in-market-shares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transparency Report</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Bitget continued to increase market share in Q2</h2>
<p>According to the quarterly update, its market share climbed further in the three-month period to 8.7%.</p>
<p>That translates to a 1.81% increase &ndash; second highest among the top five centralised exchanges. Spot trading exceeded $60 billion in terms of volume while futures trading surpassed $600 billion.</p>
<p>Bitget is the only CEX that saw an increase in futures trading volume this year following the FTX fiasco, as per Nansen &ndash; a blockchain analytics platform.</p>
<p>These disclosures arrive just days after the Seychelles-based company launched &ldquo;Crypto Loans&rdquo; to debut in lending (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitget-launches-crypto-loans/">find out more</a>).</p>
<h2>Copy trading helped add new elite traders</h2>
<p>Bitget increased its followers by more than 85,000 in the second quarter. Copy trading, it added, helped grow the number of elite traders on the platform by 9,033 as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;BGB&rdquo; &ndash; its native token outperformed peers unlocking a whopping 23% as trading volume hit $1.3 million &ndash; an 80% increase. The Transparency Report also reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand for BGB has been on the rise, with the number of BGB holders rising by 130% to 305,653 in three months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitget remained committed to expansion in the second quarter and successfully registered as a VASP in <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/bitget-registers-as-virtual-asset-service-provider-in-poland-301831988.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Poland</a> and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitget-secures-regulatory-license-in-poland-reserve-funds-up-80m-in-q1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lithuania</a>. It also entered <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitget-formally-enters-turkey-bitget-tr/">Turkey</a> in Q2 with a new website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals&rsquo; stage two presale event is already halfway over, with more investors pouring into the project.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin continues to struggle to defend its price above the $30k level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been bearish since the start of the week. Following last week&rsquo;s rally, prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are currently underperforming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, AltSignals&rsquo; presale event continues to surge ahead, with the second presale event already 50% completed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is an exciting Web3 project that specially targets traders. The development team seeks to solve some of the pain points of traders and make it easier for people to enter the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to their whitepaper, AltSignals is a trading platform that provides trading signals for stocks, forex, indices, cryptocurrencies, and CFDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the biggest concerns for traders is accurately carrying out technical analysis and determining when to enter and exit traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals seeks to solve all that thanks to its use of blockchain technology and AI. The team has raised more than $1.1 million in the second presale stage and will use the funds to develop its trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASI will be the native token that powers the AltSignals ecosystem. It is currently going for 0.01875 per token and could increase ahead of the next presale event.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their whitepaper, AltSignals explained that they would use the funds generated from the funding rounds to develop ActualizeAI, a solution that could make it easier for more people to enter the cryptocurrency trading scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With ActualizeAI, users would have access to a fully automated solution that makes it easier for people to trade cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Visit the official&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals website</u></a> to learn more about their presale.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals continues to generate more buzz</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been retracing following last week&rsquo;s rally. Bitcoin has lost more than 1% of its value over the past few days and is currently struggling to maintain its price above the $30k threshold. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $29,960 per coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other leading cryptocurrencies, including Ether, and BNB, are also underperforming. Despite the recent market retracement, AltSignals&rsquo; presale event continues to attain new milestones.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals&rsquo; stage two presale event has generated nearly $1.2 million, 52% of the total amount required. The project is still in its early days and could serve as an excellent investment for investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the market currently retracing, more investors could be looking to purchase more cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, other investors could be looking to invest in new projects, and&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> could be one of the projects to consider.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in AltSignals now?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the poor performance this week, the cryptocurrency market has outperformed the other financial markets since the start of the year. Bitcoin is up by nearly 50% year-to-date, making it one of the best-performing global assets so far this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Market experts predict that Bitcoin&rsquo;s price could surpass the $100,000 mark over the next few months or years. If that happens, other cryptocurrencies could benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals could be one of the biggest beneficiaries due to its niche-specific product. As a product that targets traders,&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>AltSignals</u></a> could become an important project in a multi-billion dollar industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASI is currently in its presale stage, and its price could soar higher once the token gets listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. Furthermore, if the crypto market embarks on a Bull Run, ASI&rsquo;s price could also appreciate in the medium to long term.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">Shiba Memu sparks gold rush for crypto investors with trailblazing AI protocol</li>
<li dir="ltr">SHMU presale, uniquely tailored to investor interests, is close to hitting $1 million with over $954k raised so far.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The Shiba Memu platform targets becoming the superpower of meme coin marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is the latest meme coin craze in the vast cryptocurrency sphere. But unlike the rival coins that play on the original meme dog theme over and over again, Shiba Memu is looking to ride an innovative strategy powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to change the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The token is currently in presale and is more of a gold rush for investors as the raised token sale amount edges closer to a $1 million just days into the 8-week offering. As seen on their <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">presale page</a>, investors have so far allocated over $954k to the project.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here we look at what Shiba Memu brings to the meme coin battleground and why investors think it could be a winning bet.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">A first in crypto meme and AI</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The question of what happens to crypto next is no longer a vague one, thanks to a global recognition that the industry is here to stay. While meme coins like Shiba Inu and Pepe have exploded and helped create the next crypto millionaires, none commands as much hype and positivity as does Shiba Memu (SHMU).</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ai/">AI</a> is at the center of this outlook for the new token, and as we shall shortly see, could be the differentiator that sends SHMU to the top of the meme list.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is a meme coin project that integrates the revolutionary technology behind AI. By leveraging the best of machine learning and NLP, the project seeks to evolve into a marketing powerhouse that will focus on bringing value to the SHMU ecosystem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project will learn and constantly re-imagine itself with the help of AI capabilities, incorporating all possible marketing strategies that put it ahead of competition and beneficial to SHMU token holders.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the team, AI will make Shiba Memu a genius marketer, capable of extracting juices from a 24/7 presence across social media and other online platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Compared to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, Pepe, and the other so-called Doge killers, Shiba Memu stands out for one thing: the ability to self-market and not rely on human-driven hype to gain traction. It is being designed as the robot meme dog that crypto investors are showing a lot of confidence in.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The SHMU presale is live <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What else is unique about Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The presale offers a unique approach to SHMU pricing. A built-in system allows the price of the token to increase automatically each day at 6 pm GMT. Like an excited Shiba Inu pup, SHMU will spike at this set interval for 8 weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project will provide access to all the key data on an AI dashboard, with SHMU holders having an opportunity not just to see how AI is growing their visibility but also participate in this growth by sharing feedback and proposals. One earning opportunity will be in getting rewarded with SHMU if the system adopts your proposal.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is this a good time to buy Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu is still under development and will have to deliver a working product for its AI dashboard to gain traction. This is the bare minimum if the project has to follow up the success of the presale stage with even more penetration in what could be a crowded AI-powered crypto field. As an investment, it would pay to know that market risks abound.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, with the industry in upbeat mood amid growth across altcoins and AI a big bet even in mainstream tech companies, there could be no other best opportunity to buy SHMU low.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently at $0.01405, the next price jump will see it hit $0.014275 and continue on this trajectory until the token&rsquo;s presale value eventually hits $0.0244. This is when Shiba Memu will look to explode as those who miss out on the presale get to buy it across exchanges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Adding SHMU to an altcoin portfolio today might therefore be both an exposure to what&rsquo;s shaping up to be a huge prospect.</p>

<li dir="ltr">US Judge Analisa Torres referred Ripple vs. SEC case to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Last week&rsquo;s ruling was that XRP was not a security.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The Ripple vs. SEC case continues but Judge Netburn has suggested both Ripple and SEC can agree to possible settlement conference dates if they believe it to be &ldquo;productive&rdquo; at this stage.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/">Ripple news</a> is that US Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn has ordered both Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to agree on possible dates for a settlement conference.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The order came not long after Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York referred the next phase of the Ripple vs. SEC court battle to Judge Netburn.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a court document filed on July 17, Judge Netburn, who will now preside over the General Pretrial, has recommended that the parties come to this agreement 6-8 weeks beforehand, referencing the court&rsquo;s busy schedule. &nbsp;As noted in the judge&rsquo;s order, the parties should agree to three mutually convenient dates.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Will SEC and Ripple want to settle?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The pretrial phase includes aspects of the case around &ldquo;<em>scheduling, discovery and non-dispositive pretrial motions</em>.&rdquo; It is also likely the stage where the parties would want to settle. While the anticipation is that the SEC might want Ripple to settle, the coming days could make it clear whether any of the two sides view this as a route to take.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared the outlook on Twitter:</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#128680;To be clear: Judge Netburn is suggesting that both sides agree on some possible dates for a settlement meeting, *IF* "they believe it to be productive at this time." </p>
<p>This doesn't mean we'll see a settlement in 6-8 weeks. It means that if they do decide on a date, it will have&hellip; <a href="https://t.co/3bxqCGLyPr">https://t.co/3bxqCGLyPr</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1681038538316423168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Last week, Judge Torres effectively declared XRP not a security and sparked a massive rally for the token and the broader crypto market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though the outcome of the rest of the case is anybody&rsquo;s guess, the crypto industry believes Ripple&rsquo;s partial victory provided a watershed moment that could translate into the much needed regulatory clarity.</p>

<p dir="ltr">According to on-data from crypto security platform Arkham Intelligence, Celsius deposited $59.4 million worth of various tokens to institutional crypto trading platform FalconX. Per Arkham data, Celsius transferred $13.6 million worth of MATIC, $10.7 million in LINK, and $7.3 million in AAVE to an address controlled by FalconX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Data Nerd shared details of the transfers:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">The transactions followed earlier transfers involving $8.5 million worth of LINK, $7.8 million of SNX (a Synthetix native token) and $3 million in BNB token. Other tokens sent to the FalconX wallet address include 0x Protocol (ZRX), 1inch (1INCH) FTX Token (FTT) and Tether Gold (XAUT).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain sleuth Lookonchain also<a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1680793627034013696" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>highlighted</u></a> that FalconX had started depositing the received tokens onto Binance &ndash; suggesting the sale was on.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After these transfers, Dune Analytics data&nbsp;<a href="https://dune.com/21co/celsius-addresses" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shows</u></a> the Celsius portfolio still holds over $106 million worth of its native token CEL, $47 million in other altcoins (including $16.5 million in MATIC and $12.7 million in AAVE) and over $29 million in stablecoins ($24 million in USDC and $2 million in USDT).</p>
<p dir="ltr">While Celsius moves ahead with plans to convert the altcoins into BTC or ETH, blockchain firm Kaiko recently&nbsp;<a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/celsius-liquidations-could-pressure-altcoin-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>noted</u></a> that the Celsius team might find it difficult to liquidate a number of tokens due to their illiquidity. One of these is CEL, which has next to zero liquidity.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, analysts at Kaiko say the potential sell-off pressure from the liquidations could impact downward pressure on some of the tokens.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The FSB recommends that authorities ensure adequate disclosures from crypto asset issuers and providers.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Segregation of funds to protect clients and measures to ensure no conflict of interest are also highlighted.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The watchdog also recommends global rules for stablecoins be adopted.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The Financial Stability Board (FSB) said in its latest crypto asset report that the sector needs to see more disclosures on the part of providers and broader cooperation from regulators across the globe.</p>
<p dir="ltr">FSB, tasked by the G20 to come up with a comprehensive framework for <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/crypto-regulation/">crypto regulation</a>, has published two sets of recommendations. The first set relates to the global approach to crypto regulation, including the supervision and oversight of digital asset activities and markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the second set of recommendations focuses on global stablecoin regulation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Our global regulatory framework for crypto-asset activities seeks to ensure that crypto assets and global stablecoins are subject to robust regulation and supervision and do not pose risks to financial stability</em>,&rdquo; the organisation <a href="https://twitter.com/FinStbBoard/status/1680894888806690819" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">FSB recommendations include disclosures, segregation of funds</h2>
<p dir="ltr">A<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2023/07/fsb-finalises-global-regulatory-framework-for-crypto-asset-activities/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>press release</u></a> the organisation published on Monday, July 17, highlighted the two documents, noting that &ldquo;<em>the final recommendations draw on the implementation experiences of jurisdictions and build on the principles &ndash; &lsquo;same activity, same risk, same regulation&rsquo;; high-level and flexible; and technology neutral &ndash; that informed the consultative framework.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The framework comes after a tumultuous year for crypto going back to summer of 2022, and the FSB says it strengthened the recommendations with the events in mind. Among these are the dramatic collapse of TerraUSD and the implosion of cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, three of the key areas with greater focus are safeguarding of client assets, addressing concerns around conflicts of interest and strengthening of cross-border cooperation among regulators.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In total, the watchdog has outlined nine key recommendations for the global framework for regulation of crypto asset activities and markets and 10 for the regulation and oversight of stablecoins. One of the recommendations on regulation of crypto asset activities focuses on disclosures and FSB stated:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Authorities should require that crypto-asset issuers and service providers disclose to users and relevant stakeholders comprehensive, clear and transparent information regarding their governance framework, operations, risk profiles and financial conditions, as well as the products they provide and activities they conduct</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the press release, FSB noted that the final recommendations in the two documents incorporated the lessons picked from events within the crypto market over the past year. They also include feedback collated during the public consultation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The European Union and the UK are among jurisdictions to pursue comprehensive regulation for crypto asset activities and stablecoins. The EU&rsquo;s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is expected to take effect in 2024, while UK&rsquo;s Financial Services and Markets Acts received the royal assent in June following approval by parliament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/uk-could-roll-out-crypto-regulation-within-a-year-says-senior-minister/"><u>reported</u></a> in April, the UK could deploy its crypto laws by early 2024 as it looks to become a crypto hub.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">BTC price is near the $30k mark, which bulls may be desperate to protect.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s &nbsp;historical volatility is at its lowest level in 2023.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Short-term bullish target could be above $34k, while major support is near $28.2k.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>&rsquo;s price remains above $30,000 on Monday, but is seeing &ldquo;remarkably little volatility.&rdquo; According to a key technical analysis indicator for this measure, the prices are tightly squeezed to suggest a breakout in either direction could be big.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price outlook: Bollinger Bands</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to on-chain data and analytics provider Glassnode, the Bollinger Bands are tightly squeezed and a price range of only 4.2% separates the upper and lower bands. The platform notes that this outlook has Bitcoin at its quietest since early January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>The digital asset market continues to see remarkably little volatility, with the classic 20-day Bollinger Bands experiencing an extreme squeeze. A price range of just 4.2% separates the upper and lower Bollinger bands, making this is the quietest #Bitcoin market since the lull in early January</em>,&rdquo; Glassnode analysts<a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1680875530244042752" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>tweeted</u></a>, sharing the chart below.</p>
<div class="fr-img-space-wrap"><span class="fr-img-caption fr-fic fr-dib fr-draggable" style="width: 700px"><span class="fr-img-wrap">
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/17/1689601969484-5658a859-30d0-4fdd-bb34-354c345111c1.jpg" style="width: 700px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="700" height="353"><span class="fr-inner">Bitcoin price Bollinger Bands range. Source: Glassnode on Twitter.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p></span></span>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">In technical analysis, the Bollinger indicator offers a chart outlook where price trends reflect the market&rsquo;s volatility. Traders use the indicator to identify overbought or oversold market conditions.</p>
<p class="fr-img-space-wrap2">Bitcoin recently broke from above the upper bands and currently fluctuates beneath the middle trendline. Support of the lower Bollinger bands is around the crucial $30k level.</p>
</div>
<p dir="ltr">Data shows BTC price has declined from highs of $30,400 late Sunday, touching intraday lows of $30.079 on Monday morning. Currently at around $30,180, the top cryptocurrency by market cap is down about 0.5%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While accumulation around the current prices is staggering, bulls have to hold above this psychological support base. If not, bears could push lower first before a likely short squeeze catapults BTC/USD to potentially news YTD highs of $34k. The key downturn levels to watch in the short term are at $28,200 and $25,600.</p>

<li>At press time, Shiba Memu had sold 30,951,646 tokens raising $902,439.72.</li>
<li>The Shiba Memu presale has continued gathering steam as popular meme tokens stall.</li>
<li>Popular meme tokens including Pepe have seen their value decline in the past 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>A majority of popular meme tokens on Monday saw significant price declines as the <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news">Shiba Memu</a> presale continued to gather steam. <a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/what-is-dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> has dropped by 3.6%, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/shiba-inu/what-is-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> by 3.4%, PEPE by 4.1%, and FLOKI by 4.5%.</p>
<p>Going by the hype that the Shiba Memu (SHMU) is receiving, the new Shiba-themed meme token is slowly putting up a spirited fight to become a major meme token player.</p>
<h2>Shiba Memu could be the next PEPE</h2>
<p>PEPE, a new meme token, has outperformed Shiba Inu and Dogecoin this year although there is a rider as covered in a previous article <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/as-pepe-crypto-price-surges-beware-of-a-bull-trap/">here</a>. Pepe&rsquo;s value has increased by more than 300% in the last three months while Shiba Inu&rsquo;s value has decreased by more than 25%.</p>
<p>Pepe gained support as investors began concentrating on more recent meme coins as more established ones lost favour. In fact, this year has seen pressure on Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Dogelon Mars. As news of new millionaires spread, Pepe, on the other hand, benefited from the fear of missing out (FOMO).</p>
<p>Overall, Pepe has grown from nothing to one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world in a matter of months. The token&rsquo;s daily volume has increased, and its market capitalization has increased to over $605 million. In addition, Pepe is frequently one of the most popular tokens on CoinMarketCap and in social media.</p>
<p>However, the last few weeks have also seen Pepe&rsquo;s popularity dwindle and a new entrant by the name of Shiba Memu could become the next big thing in cryptocurrency. Shiba Memu is currently conducting a presale of its SHMU token and has raised $902,439 in less than three weeks.</p>
<p>The sudden surge in SHMU&rsquo;s popularity is partly because of the fact that its price is rising every few hours thanks to its innovative token sale strategy. At the time of writing, one SHMU was going for 0.013825 USDT and was scheduled to appreciate to 0.014050 USDT in the next four hours. Shiba Memu can be purchased <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that investors are flocking to the Shiba Memu project even as one of its main rivals, Shiba Inu, developers work on the layer-2 network called Shibarium to be released in August.</p>
<h2>What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p>Shiba Memu is a brand-new and ground-breaking meme token. It is a distinctive and alluring investment because of its self-sufficient marketing abilities, which are supported by AI technology.</p>
<p>Shiba Memu will develop its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and advertise itself in pertinent forums and social networks, unlike other meme tokens that depend heavily on human teams&rsquo; marketing efforts to gain traction.</p>
<p>Shiba Memu developers want to build a marketing powerhouse that is unstoppable and self-sufficient. They want to create a platform that can consistently produce more content than a tabloid by utilising AI. A variety of media will publish this content.</p>
<p>The team aims at launching the Shiba Memu token on the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), conclude its native token presale, provide the initial liquidity for trading on a decentralized exchange, and launch a staking program to encourage community participation and engagement by the end of Q3, 2023. This will be followed by the development of its AI Marketing Dashboard in Q4, 2023 before launch in Q1, 2024.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">BNB coin has become heavily shorted in the perpetual futures market.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It has also formed a bearish flag pattern on the daily chart.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/"><u>Binance Coin</u></a> has come under intense pressure in the past few weeks as short bets in the futures market increased. BNB token was trading at $244 on Monday, lower than last week&rsquo;s high of $261. In all, it has dropped by over 31% from the highest level this year.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BNB loses momentum</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Most&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a> jumped sharply last week after the conclusion of the Ripple vs SEC case. BNB coin, on the other hand, remained in a tight range. It jumped to a high of $261.40 and then erased most of those gains.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance Coin has remained under pressure mostly because of the ongoing case, which was brought about by the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-response-to-sec-lawsuit/"><u>Securities and Exchange Commission</u></a> (SEC). The SEC accused Binance of committing over 10 crimes, including operating a broker-dealer in the United States without following the law.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is too early to predict how the lawsuit will develop and how long it will take. Legal experts I have talked to say that the SEC has a relatively solid case against Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another reason why BNB price is struggling is a recent report that Binance had fired over 1,000 employees recently. Like other crypto companies, Binance has gone through major challenges because of the crypto winter.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite this, there is a likelihood that the company&rsquo;s finances are improving as cryptocurrencies recover. Binane has also seen inflows in the past few weeks. According to DeFi Llama, it has had over $2.9 billion in inflows in the past 30 days. Its assets now stands at over $64 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, data shows that many players in the perpetual futures market are short the BNB coin. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that open interest is weighted heavily towards the short-sellers. In a note, an analyst told Coindesk:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The sentiment has worsened due to the recent high-profile staff exits, inconsistencies related to BCH withdrawals from Binance.US and the pending Department of Justice case against Binance&rsquo;s CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BNB price prediction</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/17/1689597732514-fcf7fd11-d135-478a-a972-3f898eb2d3f6.png" style="width: 661px;height: 321.687px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="661" height="321.687"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the BNB crypto price has been in a strong bearish trend in the past few months. Most recently, the coin has formed what looks like a bearish flag pattern. In price action analysis, this pattern is usually a bearish sign.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">BNB coin has moved below the 50-day and 25-day moving averages. Therefore, because of the descending flag pattern, the coin will likely have a bearish breakout in the near term. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $220.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">How to buy Binance Coin</h2>
