<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bybit-introduces-merkle-tree-verified-proof-of-reserves/">Bybit</a>, a crypto exchange headquartered in <a href="https://twitter.com/sumitkapoor16/status/1648377443026345984">Dubai</a>, announced that it will require know-your-customer (KYC) checks on all its services starting May 8, 2023. <br /><br />Existing users who have not completed identity verification by that date will only be allowed to close existing open positions or orders, return loans, or withdraw. <br /><br />The policy shift was hinted at in December 2022, when Bybit introduced KYC requirements for peer-to-peer trading and some NFT services. Bybit has implemented various security measures to protect its users&#8217; funds, including multi-signature cold wallets, DDoS protection, and two-factor authentication. <br /><br />The exchange also regularly performs security audits and maintains an insurance fund to cover any potential losses due to security breaches. By making KYC mandatory for all users, the exchange aims to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities while ensuring compliance with global regulations.<br /><br />The exchange did not offer any explanation for the move, but the decision comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto exchanges worldwide, particularly in the U.S. Bybit is among the many crypto firms based in Dubai, and it<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/crypto-com-bybit-announce-plans-to-set-up-operations-in-dubai"> relocated</a> its headquarters from Singapore to Dubai last year.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/bitcoin-btc-price-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered.html?&amp;qsearchterm=bitcoin">note published</a> by Standard Chartered on Monday, the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and other mid-tier U.S. lenders has strengthened the case for Bitcoin as a decentralized, trustless and scarce digital asset. <br /><br />Analyst Geoff Kendrick believes that the much-touted &#8220;crypto winter&#8221; is finally over, and he sees potential for <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-plunges-below-30000-amid-economic-concerns/">Bitcoin</a> to reach $100,000 by the end of 2024. Kendrick suggests that the current stress in the traditional banking sector is highly conducive to Bitcoin&#8217;s outperformance and validates the original premise for Bitcoin. <br /><br />Furthermore, Kendrick notes that, given Bitcoin&#8217;s advantages, its share of the total digital asset market cap could move into the 50–60% range in the next few months. The cryptocurrency was trading at $27,413 as at the time of this post. <br /><br />Kendrick argues that the stabilization of risk assets and speculation that the Federal Reserve will ease monetary tightening further means the pathway to $100,000 is becoming clearer. Proponents of Bitcoin believe that it is an asset worth diversifying into in times of economic distress. <br /><br />As the theory goes, Bitcoin has a limited supply of 21 million bitcoins, meaning it should appreciate as demand for alternative assets grows to avoid the effects of high inflation. Standard Chartered isn&#8217;t the only one predicting a strong rally in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. <br /><br />Multiple crypto industry insiders forecast Bitcoin to hit a new all-time high in 2023. Some crypto investors are pointing to the anticipation of the next so-called Bitcoin &#8220;halving&#8221; as a potential catalyst for another monster rally in the coin&#8217;s price.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/gemini-announces-support-for-new-7-tokens-including-defi-gaming-and-nfts/">Gemini</a>, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss twins, is launching a new platform called the Gemini Foundation, which will offer its first derivatives contract exclusively to users outside of the US. <br /><br />The platform&#8217;s first contract will be a BTC perpetual contract denominated in Gemini dollars, with an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract to follow. This move is aimed at allowing eligible customers to leverage their crypto assets to manage risk, generate returns, and gain directional exposure.<br /><br />Gemini has <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/introducing-gemini-foundation-a-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform">announced</a> that the platform will be available in several countries, including Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Argentina, Bahamas, Bermuda, Brazil, El Salvador, Israel, Nigeria, South Africa, South Korea, Switzerland, Thailand, and Turkey. Gemini&#8217;s CEO Tyler Winklevoss has also revealed that the exchange has plans to expand outside of the US, with a new CEO for the Asia-Pacific region and an upcoming office in India.<br /><br />The launch of the Gemini Foundation comes at a time when US exchanges are increasingly turning their focus to foreign markets due to the complex regulatory environment in the US. <br /><br />The Gemini Foundation will provide an opportunity for users in eligible countries to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies through a new derivatives platform. Gemini&#8217;s move to expand its presence in international markets is expected to create more opportunities for users globally to access and trade cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Bitcoin and <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ether-sets-daily-record-in-outflow-from-centralized-exchanges/">Ether</a> experienced significant price drops on Friday, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes remained relatively stagnant throughout the day. <br /><br />TradingView data showed that Bitcoin&#8217;s value had declined by 3.5% in the last 24 hours, with a trading value of $27,271, while Ether was down almost 5%. The cause for the downward trend in the volatile digital currency market is not always clear, but some suggest that it could be due to a decrease in excitement among speculators. <br /><br />Matt Klein, a portfolio strategist at Nascent, noted that DOGE&#8217;s rally leading into 4/20 and the meme coin PEPE dominating on-chain activities are signs of euphoria that have started to make speculators risk-off. Daniel Matuszewski of CMS investment firm described the trend as &#8220;pre-selling before May and go away.&#8221;<br /><br />Additionally, the Financial Times<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29c67711-377c-4435-9c90-280852374e93"> reported</a> that the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan would steer clear of future crypto investments after it wrote off a $95 million investment into the failed FTX exchange.<br /><br />The OTPP chief executive, Jo Taylor, said, &#8220;We&#8217;re still working through what exactly happened there and you&#8217;re going to be careful.&#8221; Meanwhile, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has expressed its intention to tighten risk assessment rules for nonbank companies.<br /><br />The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes closed the day with a modest gain of around 0.1%.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1649382189715578882">KuCoin</a>, a crypto exchange based in Seychelles, has ranked XRP as the second-most traded token after Bitcoin (BTC). <br /><br />In the past 24 hours, XRP achieved a spot trading volume of $94 million, accounting for 11.16% of the total trading volume on the exchange. <br /><br />Meanwhile,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-plunges-below-30000-amid-economic-concerns/"> Bitcoin</a> garnered $187 million in spot trading volume, making up 22.18% of the 24-hour trading volume. Notably, XRP was among the top five coins by weekly search popularity on KuCoin, which boasts more than 20 million users across 200 countries worldwide.<br /><br />In other news,<a href="https://twitter.com/bit_castle/status/1649338462083092481"> Bitcastle</a>, a crypto exchange in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, announced a promotion for the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP communities, offering a chance for one lucky winner to win $1,000 each day until April 23.<br /><br />At the time of writing, XRP&#8217;s trading value has dropped by 4.85% in the last 24 hours, trading at $0.467. The crypto market is currently experiencing profit-taking as investors react to the potential interest rate hike. The crypto market is also set to experience its third consecutive day of downturn, resulting in the liquidation of millions of dollars.<br /><br />Although <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-takes-lead-as-most-traded-token-on-this-major-korean-exchange-details/">XRP</a> trading volume has slightly increased by 9%, traders are watching for signals of the next market move. XRP has experienced a 13.63% decrease in April so far after recording a positive 42% surge in March.<br /><br />With the current market volatility, whales are moving their assets, as evidenced by WhaleAlert&#8217;s detection of a lump sum of 119,072,730 XRP worth $56,830,113 transferring between unknown wallets in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ss_friedman/status/1649122957954777099">Susan Friedman</a>, a Ripple executive, has praised the European Union&#8217;s (EU) progressive approach to cryptocurrency regulation following the passage of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) legislation by the EU Parliament. <br /><br />In a tweet, Friedman expressed her enthusiasm for the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eu-report-central-banks-likely-safe-cryptocurrencies/">EU</a>&#8216;s sensible regulatory measures, which stand in contrast to the United States&#8217; enforcement-focused approach. She also highlighted Ripple&#8217;s eagerness to expand in the European market, joining other major <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/new-york-attorney-general-moves-to-shut-down-unregistered-crypto-firms/">crypto firms</a> such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken in welcoming the new legislation.<br /><br />MiCA aims to provide regulatory clarity and harmonization for crypto firms operating across Europe. With a significant majority of 517 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voting in favor and only 38 voting against, the legislation now moves to its final formal vote in the Council of the EU on May 16.<br /><br />According to Circle&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1649014582009110533">Patrick Hansen</a>, the regulation will take effect for stablecoin issuers in June 2024 and for all other crypto-asset service providers in December 2024, upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU.<br /><br />The EU&#8217;s primary objectives with MiCA are to protect consumers engaging in crypto transactions, create regulatory harmonization to allow companies to operate on an EU-wide basis, provide legal certainty for companies and institutions entering the space, and establish a leading role in global crypto regulation. This comprehensive framework offers companies a clear rulebook for various services, including token issuance, exchange, and custody, enabling fair competition and innovation.<br /><br />With the passage of MiCA, the EU is poised to become a global hub for crypto projects due to regulatory clarity and its large single market of 450 million consumers.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-set-to-receive-470k-from-wahi-brothers/">Coinbase</a>, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has announced that it has been granted a Class F License under the Digital Asset Business Act by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Bermuda was one of the first countries to implement full digital asset regulation in 2018, and Coinbase has praised the BMA&#8217;s <em>&#8220;level of rigor, transparency, compliance, and cooperation.&#8221;</em> The company has chosen Bermuda as an international hub due to the BMA&#8217;s world-class leadership and involvement in global regulation.<br /><br />Coinbase is set to launch its offshore derivatives exchange in Bermuda by the end of this month, according to reports from <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/19/coinbase-gets-bermuda-license-plans-to-launch-offshore-exchange-in-coming-weeks/">Fortune</a>. In addition to its expansion in Bermuda, Coinbase has also provided updates on its progress in expanding to Singapore, Brazil, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, and Europe in a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/an-update-to-coinbases-global-scale-to-go-broad-and-deep">blog post.</a><br /><br />Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong had previously stated that the company might consider leaving the US to operate in the UK due to regulatory challenges in the US. Coinbase has faced various actions in the US, including receiving a Wells notice from the Securities and Exchange Commission in March. The company settled with the New York Department of Financial Services on an unrelated issue in January and settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 2021.<br /><br />While the Bermuda license and other expansions do not signify a complete move away from the US or address the aforementioned issues, Coinbase is taking a <em>&#8220;go broad and go deep approach&#8221;</em> to ensure that it can serve users globally. Kraken, another cryptocurrency exchange, has also recently obtained regulatory approval in Ireland, while Binance expanded to Sweden in January, indicating a growing trend of cryptocurrency exchanges expanding their global reach.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several places in Dubai in which there are the best ways to <a href="https://cryptodesk.ae/sell-usdt-in-dubai">Sell USDT in Dubai</a>. As a stablecoin tied to the value of the US dollar, USDT is widely used in financial dealings and investments. But, if you need to sell your USDT in Dubai, you&#8217;ll want to be familiar with the best options available to you. Here, we&#8217;ll go over some of the most effective strategies for selling USDT in Dubai, along with some helpful hints and advice.</p>
<h3>Cryptocurrency exchanges</h3>
<p>The role of cryptocurrency exchanges in buying and selling cryptocurrencies is crucial. These marketplaces allow users to trade and invest in various coins and tokens by exchanging them for fiat currency or other digital assets. Particularly notable is Crypto Desk, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges today to Sell tether in Dubai.</p>
<p>The trading platform provided by Crypto Desk, a registered exchange, is both safe and simple to use. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are some cryptocurrencies accepted on the exchange. One of the most promising features of the crypto desk is that you can sell tether coin, USDT crypto, exchange USDT for cash, and exchange USDT For Dirhams. It&#8217;s easy to purchase, sell, and trade and supports various currency pairs. The security measures at Crypto Desk prevent unauthorized access to customer funds or private data. Its superb customer service is another reason investors and traders should consider it.</p>
<h3>Over-the-counter (OTC) trading</h3>
<p>Trading cryptocurrencies directly between individuals, as opposed to through an exchange, is known as over-the-counter (OTC) trading. The benefits of over-the-counter (OTC) trading benefits include shorter processing times, reduced fees, and higher levels of individual attention. High-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and major trading businesses sometimes engage in off-exchange (OTC) trading when they need to buy or sell substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies without affecting the market price.</p>
<p>In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, OTC trading desks offer access to many other cryptocurrencies. Over-the-counter (OTC) transactions are handled at a trading desk, where parties can discuss pricing and terms of the settlement. Although over-the-counter trading has many benefits, working with a trustworthy OTC trading desk that prioritizes safety and regulation is essential.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking for a trustworthy and safe OTC trading platform, go no further than <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/goldman-sachs-launches-crypto-trading-desk-focused-on-btc-derivatives/">Crypto Desk</a>. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and many other cryptocurrencies and altcoins are all available on the platform. Clients are assigned their personal account managers at the Crypto Desk, who are there to facilitate transactions and offer analysis of the market. Customers may feel at ease knowing their money and data are secure on the platform. In addition, all transactions are done openly and responsibly thanks to Crypto Desk&#8217;s adherence to regulatory regulations.</p>
<h3>Peer-to-peer (P2P)</h3>
<p>Without the participation of a central authority, P2P trading allows users to trade cryptocurrencies directly with one another. Buyers and sellers meet each other online, negotiate a price, and complete the transaction in a P2P trade. Peer-to-peer (P2P) trade benefits include reduced costs, shortened processing times, and enhanced confidentiality. It&#8217;s also a common choice in places with weak or underdeveloped banking infrastructures. For this reason, peer-to-peer (P2P) trading in the cryptocurrency market has exploded in popularity.</p>
<h3>Crypto ATM Machine</h3>
<p>In Dubai, you can use a crypto ATM to purchase and trade cryptocurrencies quickly and easily. Like standard ATMs, crypto ATMs let customers purchase cryptocurrency using cash or a debit/credit card. Due to the increasing demand for easy and quick access to buying and selling cryptocurrency, crypto ATMs have become increasingly popular in Dubai.</p>
<p>In Dubai, you can use cryptocurrencies from ATMs from several providers, including BCB ATM, Bitaccess, and Bitcoin Depot. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are just some of the cryptocurrencies that may be purchased and traded at these ATMs. Several Dubai crypto ATMs also feature stringent Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards that must be met before any transactions can be processed.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency ATMs provide a quick and easy way to purchase and sell digital currency, but their costs exceed regular exchanges. Before utilizing a cryptocurrency ATM, comparing costs is a good idea. To ensure a safe and secure transaction, use encrypted wallet addresses.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>One of the wisest financial moves you can make in Dubai is to include crypto assets in your portfolio. To acquire cryptocurrency, you need only use a trusted and regulated crypto exchange platform, such as Crypto Desk. It won&#8217;t take you more than a few minutes to complete the purchase procedure. A final invoice is issued as evidence of the transaction. Get on the bandwagon now by purchasing or selling USDT in Dubai through Crypto Desk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In its Q1 <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZXSBN8_TSLA_Q1_2023_Update_ABMJPG.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22e826b065-cc14-467c-8c9c-e1feb7189ba8.pdf">report</a>, Tesla revealed that it had not made any changes to its Bitcoin holdings, which remained at around 11,950 BTC, equivalent to approximately $350 million. This news comes after the e-car maker sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in June 2022, converting them into fiat currency and adding $936 million to its cash reserves.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/tesla-completed-bitcoin-sales-worth-936-million-in-q2-2022/">Tesla</a>&#8216;s initial investment in Bitcoin, made in February 2021, was a bold move that significantly impacted the cryptocurrency market. The investment saw Tesla purchase $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, which pushed the price of the cryptocurrency to new heights.<br /><br />However, the bet on<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-above-28000-despite-regulatory-crackdowns/"> Bitcoin</a> did not pay off as Tesla had hoped. The company&#8217;s Q1 earnings report revealed a slight dip in sales, which came in at $23.33 billion compared to the estimated $23.39 billion. Despite this, the company still met earnings per share (EPS) expectations of $0.85.<br /><br />Despite the sales miss, investors seemed unfazed, with Tesla&#8217;s shares trading only marginally lower in after-hours trading. This is likely since Tesla&#8217;s overall financial position remains strong, with the company&#8217;s cash reserves bolstered by the sale of its Bitcoin holdings.<br /><br />It remains to be seen whether Tesla will make any further investments in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the future. While the initial investment had a significant impact on the market, the subsequent sale of the majority of Tesla&#8217;s Bitcoin holdings suggests that the company may not view cryptocurrency as a viable long-term investment option.<br /><br />In any case, Tesla&#8217;s Q1 earnings report serves as a reminder that even the most audacious bets can sometimes fail to pay off and that businesses must carefully consider the risks and benefits of any investment decisions they make.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/SafeMoonSpidey/status/1648319024395169796">SafeMoon</a> community can breathe a sigh of relief as the hacker responsible for last month&#8217;s liquidity hack has agreed to return 80% of the stolen funds, amounting to $7.2 million in tokens. The hacker exploited a smart contract vulnerability on March 28, resulting in a $9 million liquidity drain.<br /><br />In the weeks following the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/robinhood-twitter-account-hacked-as-scammers-trick-investors-into-buying-phony-crypto-2/">hack</a>, the community expressed their frustration over the lack of updates and progress in recovering the stolen funds. SafeMoon CEO John Karony&#8217;s calls for patience were criticized as repetitive and avoidant, while a recent announcement about &#8220;New #SAFEMOON app builds submitted!&#8221; was labeled as a distraction.<br /><br />However, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/SafeMoonSpidey/status/1648320150045704192">@SafeMoonSpidey</a>, a deal was struck between both parties, with the hacker returning 80% of the stolen funds and keeping the remaining 20%, with no charges filed against them. <br /><br />An on-chain message explained that, after careful consideration, it was believed that this was in the best interest of SafeMoon and the community. While some raised concerns that the hacker was being rewarded for criminal behavior, @SafeMoonSpidey called the 20% reward a white hat bounty reward.<br /><br />The resolution of this issue comes as a relief to the SafeMoon community, which has been eagerly awaiting updates and progress on recovering the stolen funds. @SafeMoonSpidey suggested that the team may have been holding out for this resolution before &#8220;updating the app,&#8221; indicating that progress may finally be made toward recovery and improving the platform&#8217;s security. <br /><br />Despite some concerns, the return of 80% of the stolen funds is a positive development, providing some closure to the community and signaling a step forward for SafeMoon.</p>
