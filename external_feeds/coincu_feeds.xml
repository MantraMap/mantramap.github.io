<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Litecoin&#8217;s visibility boosted by the LTC20 standard and hype around upcoming halving.</em></li>



<li><em>LTC price maintained resilience against the downside in the last five days.</em></li>



<li><em>Contrary to top cryptocurrencies which continued slipping lower</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin has two primary reasons behind its recent hype. One of them being the LTC20 standard, which has resulted in an increase in address activity. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="684" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-1024x684.jpeg" alt="Why Litecoins Latest Move is Turning Heads in the Crypto World" class="wp-image-187381" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-1024x684.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-768x513.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-1536x1026.jpeg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-2048x1368.jpeg 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-750x501.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Why-Litecoins-Latest-Move-is-Turning-Heads-in-the-Crypto-World-1140x761.jpeg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Why Litecoin&#039;s Latest Move is Turning Heads in the Crypto World? 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This has created more visibility for Litecoin and has also supported its price action. Another reason is the upcoming halving event which is expected to take place in August.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that Litecoin’s price has maintained its resilience against the downside in the last five days, which is a noteworthy feat. The top cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, have been slipping lower. This has led some experts to question whether Litecoin can continue to sustain this resistance against the downside.</p>



<p>While the upcoming halving event has undoubtedly contributed to LTC’s recent price surge, it is not the only reason behind its upside. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s price action has been trading at a long-term support level, which means that investors are likely to avoid selling. This support level has been instrumental in Litecoin&#8217;s ability to hold its ground at the current price level of $80.95, at press time.</p>



<p>Litecoin&#8217;s recent success can be attributed to its increased visibility due to the LTC20 standard and the hype around the upcoming halving event. Additionally, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price action has been trading at a long-term support level which has helped it sustain its recent price surge. While the hype around the halving event will eventually run its course, Litecoin&#8217;s long-term support level is likely to continue providing stability to its price action.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LTCUSD_2023-05-14_14-24-22-1.png"><img decoding="async" width="1020" height="560" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LTCUSD_2023-05-14_14-24-22-1.png" alt="LTCUSD 2023 05 14 14 24 22 1" class="wp-image-187377" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LTCUSD_2023-05-14_14-24-22-1.png 1020w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LTCUSD_2023-05-14_14-24-22-1-300x165.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LTCUSD_2023-05-14_14-24-22-1-768x422.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/LTCUSD_2023-05-14_14-24-22-1-750x412.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px" title="Why Litecoin&#039;s Latest Move is Turning Heads in the Crypto World? 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: TradingView<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Although Litecoin&#8217;s current support seems to be holding up well, there is still a chance that the price could fall below its current support level. This is because the halving event, which will decrease the supply of Litecoin, is still over two months away. During this time, market momentum could shift and investors may become hesitant, causing the price to decrease. If the price does fall below support, it could lead to a potential buying opportunity for investors who are looking to enter the market at a lower price point. As always, it&#8217;s important to keep an eye on market trends and news that could impact LTC&#8217;s price in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Recently, Twitter user Mike Hassard dug up the case of Roman Sterlingov, accused of operating Bitcoin Fog, a Bitcoin mixing service. While Roman has incorporated mixing into his personal privacy practices when transferring Bitcoin, he is wrongfully accused of operating the service. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roman Sterlingov is wrongfully accused of operating Bitcoin Fog, a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#Bitcoin</a> mixing service. This is the first in a series of threads  I will post in an effort to spread word of this unjust prosecution.</p>&mdash; Mike Hassard (@mikehassard) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikehassard/status/1657808025300639748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 14, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The government has seized all his remaining assets, and he remains trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare at the Northern Neck Regional Jail in Warsaw, Virginia.</p>



<p>Following the thread, Roman moved from Russia to Jönköping with his mother in 2003 and excelled in math and science at school. In 2010, he first heard about Bitcoin and was excited by the new technology. He learned how to set up wallets and funded them with his paycheck. Roman traveled to Bitcoin meetups across Europe, where he met like-minded individuals and helped them set up their own wallets. He purchased Bitcoin in bulk and sold it peer-to-peer to newcomers at the meetups, allowing them begin their own Bitcoin journeys.</p>



<p>At one of these meetups, someone suggested that Roman mix his Bitcoin before selling it to people he didn&#8217;t know. Roman learned that his wallet address became public when he made Bitcoin transactions. He worried that someone could target him and steal his funds. This led him to incorporate mixing into his personal privacy practices when transferring Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Roman created a Kraken account in 2014 and began using it as his daily Bitcoin account. By this time, Bitcoin had appreciated to approximately $475. Roman left his job and lived off the appreciation of his investment. He used Bitcoin Fog to send Bitcoin from his early wallets, through Bitcoin Fog, to a Kraken account held in his real name with KYC authentication. </p>



<p>In 2017, Roman realized that he had spent much of his Bitcoin and had not accumulated any new Bitcoin. He tried his hand at trading and multiple business ventures, including a VPN, a music studio, and a life coaching business, but all his efforts failed.</p>



<p>In April 2021, Roman flew to LAX to enroll in a commercial pilot licensing class in California. However, he was arrested by the FBI and accused of operating Bitcoin Fog for the past seven years. He was confused and shocked to hear that he was accused of creating and operating Bitcoin Fog. A Magistrate judge ordered Roman to be &#8220;detained indefinitely,&#8221; and he was transferred to Northern Neck Regional Jail, where he remains.</p>

<p>The SEC filed a motion on May 12 in a New Hampshire District Court, requesting a change to its original request for remedies in its successful case against LBRY. Instead of the original $22 million, which the SEC claimed LBRY had earned from the sale of its token LBRY Credits (LBC), the SEC is now asking for a fine of $111,614. The SEC cited LBRY&#8217;s &#8220;lack of funds and near-defunct status&#8221; as the reason for the decreased penalty.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Millions of dollars spent for a fine of $111,614.00 and a company financially ruined.

</div></figure>



<p>Moreover, the SEC is asking the court to prevent LBRY from conducting future unregistered offerings of crypto asset securities. In its filing, the SEC recognized and acknowledged LBRY&#8217;s representations that it is defunct, ceasing operations, and without the funds to pay a larger fine, and recognizes that a defendant&#8217;s ability to pay is a factor when imposing a civil penalty.</p>

<p>The SEC initially filed a civil suit against LBRY in March 2021, alleging that the firm&#8217;s LBC sales were unregistered securities offerings. It asked for $22 million in disgorgement and for the court to order LBRY to halt any further LBC sales. In November 2022, the SEC won the case, with the preceding Judge also ruling LBC was a security.</p>



<p>However, in a December filing, LBRY argued that the SEC&#8217;s request for $22 million was unreasonable, as it was &#8220;vastly&#8221; overstated and failed to &#8220;deduct any of LBRY&#8217;s legitimate business expenses.&#8221; According to LBRY, the SEC&#8217;s calculation was &#8220;based on rough, back-of-the-envelope math&#8221; and the amount it sought was &#8220;simply not supported by the record.&#8221;</p>

<p>Acknowledging LBRY&#8217;s concerns, the SEC is now seeking a reduced penalty, which it believes balances the need to deter future violations with LBRY&#8217;s inability to pay. With this in mind, the SEC has requested the court to impose a fine of $111,614 instead of the original $22 million.</p>



<p>LBRY had previously mentioned that it &#8220;will likely be dead in the near future&#8221; due to being &#8220;killed by legal and SEC debts&#8221; in December 2022, around a month after the SEC won the case.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>One million Bitcoin addresses now hold at least 1 BTC, reflecting a growing interest in crypto and a surge in wholecoiners.</em></li>



<li><em>As Bitcoin has dipped in price, the number of addresses holding at least one BTC has surged.</em></li>



<li><em>While one million marks a new record, one Bitcoin wallet.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data from Glassnode, the number of Bitcoin wallet addresses holding one whole BTC or more has recently surpassed the one million mark. </strong></h5>



<p>This milestone was achieved on May 13, and it is noteworthy that many crypto investors have multiple BTC addresses. Additionally, some of the addresses belong to major institutions such as cryptocurrency exchanges and investment firms that typically own large sums of BTC.</p>

<p>As the price of Bitcoin fell over 65% last year, the number of wallet addresses holding one Bitcoin or more spiked. The most notable surges occurred during an acute market crash in June and from November 11, the date that FTX collapsed and subsequently filed for bankruptcy. Despite the price drop, a whopping 190,000 or so wholecoiners were added from early-February 2022, as the price of Bitcoin fell from its November 2021 highs.</p>



<p>Glassnode co-founder, @Negentropic, informed his 54,000 Twitter followers that the best time to buy BTC is when there’s “blood in the streets.” His comments come in the wake of numerous major bank collapses in the United States, as well as the Fed looking to potentially pause interest rate hikes in the coming months. These are some of the reasons why Glassnode said that it “remains confident” BTC can reach a price of $35,000 in the mid-term.</p>



<p>While the round number “one million” marks a new notch in the record books, it’s worth pointing out that one BTC wallet address doesn’t always represent a single person. According to data from crypto analytics provider CoinGlass, of the roughly 19 million Bitcoin currently in circulation, 1.89 million of these BTC — worth $50.7 billion — are held on major centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. Furthermore, a staggering 3 million BTC — worth $80.4 billion and accounting for 17% of the total circulating supply — are “lost forever” according to estimates from Glassnode, which draws the figure from a combination of data including BTC sent to “burn addresses,” wallets with lost keys and large accounts that have remained untouched for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The rapid growth of Bitcoin wallet addresses holding one whole BTC or more is impressive. Although there are factors that could potentially impact the value of Bitcoin such as major bank collapses and the Fed potentially pausing interest rate hikes, Glassnode remains confident in Bitcoin&#8217;s mid-term prospects. It is also important to note that one address does not always represent a single person, and a considerable portion of Bitcoin is held on centralized exchanges and considered &#8220;lost forever.&#8221;</p>

<li><em>Coinbase is reportedly experiencing an increase in canceled transactions for PayPal.</em></li>



<li><em>UK and Canadian users cannot sell or withdraw to Paypal.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange says users&#8217; funds are safe while their teams are working on a fix.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187171-paradigm-secures-50-million-stake-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> is experiencing a problem that prevents customers in the UK and Canada from selling or withdrawing their funds to Paypal.</strong></h5>

<p>5 hours ago, the largest electronic convenience exchange in the United States announced that they had recorded an error that caused a sudden increase in canceled transactions with Paypal.</p>



<p>The issue has prevented users of the exchange in the UK and Canada from making sales or withdrawing to their Paypal. It is not yet clear what caused the incident.</p>



<p>However, Coinbase also assured users that their funds were safe and their team was working on a fix. Paypal also said that they are working to fix the related transactions.</p>



<p>One of Coinbase&#8217;s goals is to add as many funding mechanisms as possible to make it easy to exchange digital currencies. As a step in that direction, the crypto exchange accepted PayPal (to sell bitcoins) and credit cards (to buy bitcoins) in 2016.</p>

<p>Thousands of Coinbase users use PayPal for their fiat currency transactions around the world. This integration allows Coinbase users to sell BTC and deposit their USD coins into a PayPal wallet.</p>



<p>PayPal integration is the third largest spending option besides bank purchases through automated clearinghouses (ACH), also capped at $25,000 daily, and wire transfers, without limits. With just a PayPal login to set up, it can provide users with an alternative to Coinbase&#8217;s cumbersome linking process for credit and debit cards (up to $5,000 weekly) and Bank accounts.</p>



<p>Buying crypto through PayPal ranks among Coinbase&#8217;s most expensive payment options. The 3.99% fee is as expensive as buying a debit card, although the limit is much higher. And it is markedly higher than the bank purchase fee of 1.49%. Sending US dollars from PayPal to Coinbase will trigger a 2.5% fee; ACH transfers are free.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency industry in Russia is undergoing a lot of changes and discussions. Recently, the Deputy Minister of Finance, Alexey Moiseev, revealed that the Federal Tax Service is likely to become the regulatory agency for the cryptocurrency industry in the country. It will be the entry window for market participants, the Federal Financial Supervisory Service, and the Central Bank. The government is also planning to appoint an agency to regulate the industry.</p>



<p>Currently, citizens, both legal entities and individuals, are permitted to mine, sell, or hold cryptocurrency. However, no other transactions, such as buybacks or payoffs, are allowed. All transactions must be declared and taxed as income. Information about wallets and transactions will be monitored by three organizations: the Federal Tax Service, Rosfinmonitoring, and the Central Bank.</p>



<p>The changes in the regulatory environment raise many questions about the future of the cryptocurrency market in Russia. There have been discussions about the legalization parameters and the risks associated with the industry, such as money laundering. A bill submitted to the State Duma proposes the appointment of an agency to regulate the industry, but the details of this department are still unclear.</p>

<p>In addition to the regulatory changes, Deputy Minister Moiseev spoke about the co-financing period under the new long-term savings program and how the marketplace will work for buying state property. These changes will significantly impact the cryptocurrency industry in Russia and its participants.</p>

<p>Previously, OKX also announced that it would be a significant contributor to the bitcoin ecosystem along with <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187046-okx-and-huobi-integrate-unisat-brc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partners</a> such as Unisat crypto wallet and build infrastructure for BRC-20 and ORC-20, including wallet, marketplace, liquidity swaps, and explorer.</p>

<p>So far, OKX has no plans to list these tokens, but the decision to list will depend on the evolution of technology, liquidity, and the community.</p>



<p>The BRC-20 memecoin craze is overwhelming the Bitcoin network. These new meme coins are being minted using the BRC-20 standard.</p>



<p>Daily minting fees on BRC-20 hit a record high of 247 BTC on May 7, according to data from Dune. The total fee for these Bitcoin Orders is 641 BTC. From another perspective, transaction fees on Bitcoin surpassed 400 BTC on May 7, an 18-fold increase from a month ago.</p>



<p>BRC-20 tokens have taken over the Bitcoin network. These tokens reach a market cap of $541 million to date. There are a total of 14,079 BRC-20 tokens, including many memes. One reason meme coins moved to BRC-20 could be because the meme coins have been clogging up the Ethereum network.</p>



<p>The ORDI token is the first BRC-20 token ever created. It was designed as a meme to demonstrate the potential of the new standard. Currently, the market leader token is Ordinals (ORDI) which has gained 40% in the past 24 hours and reached the $14.9 mark.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe has been grappling with currency volatility and inflation for over a decade. In 2009, the country abandoned its currency due to hyperinflation, replacing it mainly with the US dollar. In an attempt to resuscitate the country&#8217;s stagnant economy, the Zimbabwe dollar was reinstated in 2019. Still, in June of that year, the government again declared the greenback legal currency to curb wild price hikes.</p>



<p>Last year, the government decided to use the US dollar again in a bid to curb surging prices in the country. Three weeks ago, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183316-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/183316-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced </a>plans to establish a digital currency backed by gold that would be legal for domestic transactions. The central bank&#8217;s latest plan will allow small amounts of Zimbabwean dollars to be exchanged for the digital gold token, enabling more Zimbabweans to hedge against currency volatility.</p>



<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned Zimbabwe against the plan, stating that a careful assessment should be conducted to ensure the benefits from this measure outweigh the costs and potential risks, including macroeconomic and financial stability risks, legal and operational risks, governance risks, and the cost of forgone FX reserves. </p>



<p>Despite this, the central bank started selling digital tokens to investors on May 10, 2023, for a minimum price of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185346-zimbabwe-launch-gold-back-digital-currency/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/185346-zimbabwe-launch-gold-back-digital-currency/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$10 for individuals</a> and $5,000 for corporates and other entities. This is part of efforts to reduce demand for US dollars that now supersede the local unit as the preferred currency for transactions.</p>



<p>The central bank received 135 applications valued at 14 billion Zimbabwe dollars ($12 million) to purchase the gold-backed digital tokens. It plans a second auction on May 18. Zimbabwe used nearly 140 kilograms of gold reserves to back the first sale of its digital money. It appears the market is testing out the process before committing to converting significant Zim$ reserves into gold tokens, but still, it was a respectable first week.</p>

<p>A recent surge in meme coins, a cryptocurrency inspired by viral images and memes often lacking inherent value, has some investors concerned. Pepe, a frog-themed digital token launched in April, saw its market value peak at over $1.6 billion on May 5 before plummeting by as much as 70%. Bitcoin and Ether, two major cryptocurrencies, also experienced a 10% drop since May 5 due to the memecoin craze.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/GOAOgubDfS" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/GOAOgubDfS</a></p>&mdash; Pepe (@pepecoineth) <a href="https://twitter.com/pepecoineth/status/1654488947785887746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 5, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Long-time crypto traders have seen this pattern before. Memecoin booms typically occur during frothy periods when traders are willing to take additional risks. These speculators often offload some of their Bitcoin or Ether holdings to invest in meme coins, which can lead to a drawdown in the prices of the two major currencies.</p>



<p>Despite these concerns, Bitcoin is still up 60% since the beginning of 2021, and Ether is up 48%. Additionally, many factors impact cryptocurrency prices, including the macroeconomic environment and regulatory climate. For example, Ether&#8217;s price can be significantly affected by expectations related to the network&#8217;s software upgrades.</p>



<p>That said, past memecoin crazes have signaled market tops followed by multi-month drawdowns in BTC. For example, when Shiba Inu-themed Dogecoin led a meme-based boom in May 2021, it was followed by a Bitcoin selloff that lasted into July. Another memecoin rally in October 2021 happened just weeks before Bitcoin reached its all-time high, after which it began a significant retreat that lasted all last year.</p>

<p>Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics platform, analyzed the trading history of a meme coin trader known as 0xSisyphus. This trader traded 21 MEME coins in the past 30 days and lost money on 12 coins, with a winning rate of only 43% and a total loss of 12.62 ETH ($24K). </p>

<p>On top of that, he also spent 2.2 ETH ($4K) on gas fees. These numbers show that investing in meme coins is less lucrative than some think.</p>

<p>In another case, Lookonchain reported that a trader lost 100 ETH ($190K) on LADYS. This trader withdrew 174 ETH ($321K) from Gate.io and bought 2T LADYS at $0.0000001504. Unfortunately, he only sold for 73.5 ETH($130K) at a price of $0.00000006142. These losses are a stark reminder of the risks of investing in meme coins.</p>

<p>However, there are exceptions, and some traders have made significant profits from investing in meme coins. A trader, known as SmartMoney, made 1,219 ETH($2.2M) on PEPE. He then spent 1,173 ETH ($2.1M) to repurchase 1.33T PEPE at a buying price of $0.000001586. He bought 2.24T PEPE with 26 ETH($48K) at $0.00000002166 and sold for 1,245 ETH($2.24M) at $0.0000009985, with a gain of 48x. These gains are impressive but should not be taken as an indication that investing in meme coins is easy or risk-free.</p>

<p>Meme coins have been a hot topic in the crypto world, with many investors looking for the next big thing. However, investing in meme coins is not for the faint-hearted. The risks are high, and most people end up losing money on meme coins and spending a lot of money on gas fees.</p>
