<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin gained 3% on Friday and remains green over the week</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin will start to issue staking rewards on December 12</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency faces resistance approaching the upper limit of descending channel</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin (APE/USD)&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/staking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staking</u></a> functionality is no longer a dream &ndash; it&rsquo;s a reality. Staking rewards are set to begin on December 12. Apes are making merry as the staking service launches with a thud, just like the APE airdrop.</p>
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin staking launched on December 5, much to the excitement of its communities. In just one day after the launch of the staking feature, $32 million worth of APE was deposited in the staking contract. Stakers are now expecting the rewards in a few days, with 175 million APEs expected to be distributed in three years. The number represents around 17.5% of the total ApeCoin tokens in circulation. Will the staking feature launch boost the price of APE?</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal previously <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/apecoin-hits-resistance-after-a-weekly-surge-what-next-as-the-staking-feature-nears/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>, APE was gaining ahead of the staking service. The gains have cooled, in a typical buy the rumours, sell the news scenario. However, it is not that exactly, as APE had gained by an intraday of 3% as of press time. The cryptocurrency has remained at more than 2% in the past week. Will APE continue with the gains as the staking rewards trickle in? That will depend on the technical changes in APE price.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ApeCoin trapped in a descending channel amid a bullish push</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/09/1670613675783-43c0c135-3de3-4c89-adfa-c0c652c1a2b8.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="307"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/APEUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>APE/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">On the daily chart, APE trades on the upper limit of the descending channel. The cryptocurrency has been trading at this level for weeks, with bulls getting rejected. The price action is, however, looking increasingly bullish, as shown by a continued push to break higher.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to watch next for APE?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">A breakout at the upper limit of the descending channel is the key event for ApeCoin next. The breakout will see APE price also overcome a crucial resistance at $4.2.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A breakout at the descending channel and $4.2 resistance will place APE for recovery to the next resistance at $5.0.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">XRP has been trading at or slightly below the $0.4 resistance</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Gene Hoffman expects SEC to win the case against Ripple</p>
</li>

<p dir="ltr">XRP awaits further triggers for a breakout or drop</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/what-is-ripple/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ripple</u></a> (XRP/USD) is still in waiting mode. The cryptocurrency clings to the $0.4 resistance as if buyers are not sure if to break above. They are, however, relentless in letting bears take the price below this level. Who wins?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course, Ripple&rsquo;s case with the SEC is a dilemma yet to be solved. Despite Ripple making small wins and many believing it will triumph against the regulator, a crypto pundit thinks otherwise. Gene Hoffman, the COO of Chia network blockchain company, expects SEC&rsquo;s assertion that XRP is a security to hold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hoffman says that an excerpt from the summary judgement filing of the SEC supports the view. He says Bill Hinman, its ex-director of corporate finance, informed Ripple in 2019 that XRP was a security. Hoffman says apart from the Hinman statement; the court knows that people bought XRP expecting its value to surge. Consequently, the judge is likely to argue that Ripple&rsquo;s sales of XRP made the token a security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In further emphasis, Hoffman says there are no notable differences between the Ripple and LBRY Credits cases. In the latter, the regulator won. He asserts that SEC has never lost a case involving section 5 for a long time.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>XRP holds to the $0.4 resistance&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/09/1670613359093-5ccbdb16-82f9-4e47-9f5c-986331a7ab61.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="307"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>XRP/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From the technical outlook, XRP&rsquo;s trading depicts a wait-and-see approach. Bulls are holding to the $0.4 resistance hoping that Ripple&rsquo;s case will go in their favour. That would see a breakout at the crucial level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flip side, bears are also waiting for an opportune moment to crash XRP. That is shown by a shift of the RSI to below the midpoint, implying that bears are increasing at the resistance. It could also signify the exit of bulls at the crucial level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Which way, XRP?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The next price action for XRP will depend on developments or speculations around the case with SEC. Investors should keep watch of the developments before&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying XRP.</u></a></p>

<p dir="ltr">Ethereum gained 2% to maintain above support</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum has been witnessing whale accumulation at $1,230</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency still lacks a directional bias as sellers remain active</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum (ETH/USD) rose more than 2% on Friday, cementing a position above $1,250 support. The recovery saw ETH trade to a price of nearly $1,300 before falling slightly. However, the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH price</u></a> is not at a level we can consider bullish. It is, instead, consolidating at or above the crucial support. Will buyers help further recoveries?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Going by the Santiment data on December 7, big investors are accumulating ETH. The data shows that whales and sharks had accumulated ETH worth $690 million in the previous two days. The accumulation happened as ETH hovered around $1,230. That emphasises that the accumulation could be behind the recent, however small, recovery for ETH.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The whale accumulation underlines that the price at or around $1,250 is becoming very important for ETH. The level has held ETH since July. Even as the FTX saga happened and the price slipped below, ETH recovered quickly to the level. Clearly, long-term buyers should consider this as an important zone for accumulating the cryptocurrency. Still, buyers may struggle with bears at the crucial level as the price lacks momentum.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>ETH lacks the upside but remains stable above the support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/09/1670613081087-8783ab02-16ea-4bba-9b0d-9c6dda7cf7cd.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="310"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETH/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows bulls firmly holding to the price above $1,250. However, bears are also relentless, as shown by the weak momentum in the price of ETH.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The slight gains recorded in the day take the RSI above the midpoint, suggesting the entry of buyers. The reading is still near the level that equates demand and supply. The MACD remains in the bear territory despite a slightly improved momentum.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for ETH?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers have a slight edge over bears for ETH above $1,250. However, bulls are still facing pressure. ETH may continue consolidating until the cryptocurrency gets a catalyst to push above the support. Should&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying ETH</u></a> intensify, the next level for the cryptocurrency is at $1,400-$1,450.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance has been on a slow decline since touching $315</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has lacked positive catalysts to take the price higher</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">BNB faces a decline to the $266 support zone&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/what-is-binance-coin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance</u></a> (BNB/USD) continues to consolidate but is on a short-term descent after tapping a minor resistance. As of press time, BNB was trading at $289 and looking increasingly bearish. Investors now stare at a possible price bottom at $266.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The decline in BNB comes amid limited fundamentals to support the cryptocurrency. Across the general sector, the market is mixed, with most <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a> consolidating. That underlines that BNB&rsquo;s price action mirrors that of the sector, with investors still reeling from the FTX impacts. While Binance&rsquo;s reassurances of stability have at least supported BNB, the recent slow gains mean investors are cautious.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trading comes even as a bitter exchange ensues between Binance CEO Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao and former FTX head Sam Bankman-Fried. The exchange on Twitter related to an exit by Binance on investment in FTX back in 2021. Bankman-Fried accused CZ of demanding an extra $75 million kickback. Instead, CZ called SBF a &ldquo;fraudster,&rdquo; looking for someone to blame for the FTX implosion. Of course, the exchange harms an already depleted market confidence as investors are unsure which exchange is next.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB trends lower, with weakening momentum</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/09/1670612752838-459f8f98-fa24-4a6f-a5ad-65f7475e68b2.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="304"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Technically, BNB is slightly bearish. The RSI is at the midpoint meaning that bulls are muscling equally with the bears. However, the MACD indicator shows that momentum has weakened. Similarly, the MACD and signal line lies in the neutral zone.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will BNB stay bearish?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">With the limited fundamentals to support&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/#:~:text=The%20price%20of%20BNB%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB price</u></a> and the non-ensuing confidence crisis, the token may fall further. The price action supports a decline to the next support at $266.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buyers are, however, relentless, as shown by the reading on the RSI and MACD. For BNB to maintain the uptrend, the price must recover above $315. However, as it looks, we may have to shelve the ambitions until a further date.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Gnosis blockchain completes The Merge</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">First Ethereum, now Gnosis. Gnosis announced earlier this week that it has&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-gnosis-merge-schedules-for-today-as-the-blockchain-migrates-to-proof-of-stake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>migrated to a Proof of Stake</u></a> (PoS) protocol from its previous Proof of Authority (PoA), completing The Merge.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The migration had seen the number of validators on the Gnosis blockchain increase to over 100k from the previous 20 it had when it maintained its PoA protocol. The migration is expected to boost decentralisation and security of the Gnosis blockchain.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Coinbase expects 2022 revenue to decline by 50% or more</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, revealed earlier this week that the cryptocurrency exchange is expecting its 2022 revenue to&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-fy2022-revenue-to-be-less-than-half-of-fy2021-revenue-says-brian-armstrong/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>decline by 50% or more</u></a> from what it generated last year.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the CEO, the bear market has affected its operations, with most coins down by 70% from their all-time highs. The recent events, including the FTX collapse, have also affected the confidence in the market. However, Armstrong said he would continue to advocate for the crypto industry in Washington DC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase also&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/coinbase-asks-users-to-switch-usdt-for-the-reputable-usdc/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>asked its users</u></a> to switch USDT stablecoins for the more &lsquo;reputable&rsquo; USDC. USDC is issued by Circle, the company co-founded by Coinbase. The crypto exchange said USDC is more truCelsius ordered to return crypto worth $44M to customerssted and reliable, and its users should start using the stablecoin ahead of the USDT issued by Tether.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, Circle, the issuer of USDC, officially announced that it had&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/circle-plan-to-go-public-is-cancelled-what-does-it-mean-for-stablecoin-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cancelled plans to go public</u></a>. The company was expected to go public with a $9 billion valuation, but recent market events forced it to cancel its plans.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Celsius ordered to return crypto worth $44M to customers</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency lending firm Celsius has been&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-lender-celsius-ordered-to-return-crypto-worth-44m-to-customers/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ordered to return</u></a>&nbsp;$44 million worth of cryptocurrencies to its customers. United States Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn said he wants creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Celsius owes billions to its creditors, and the $44 million approved applies to pure custody assets. These are assets that haven&rsquo;t been used in the Celsius Earn accounts but were present in the custody program.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>PayPal begins crypto operations in Luxembourg</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Payment platform PayPal revealed earlier this week that it is&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/paypal-expands-cryptocurrencies-operations-to-luxembourg/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>expanding its cryptocurrency operations</u></a> to capture Luxembourg. The company said its crypto services would soon be available in the European country, allowing citizens to buy, sell, and hold various crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">PayPal added that it is currently working with Luxembourg&rsquo;s regulators and policymakers to create a policy that is excellent for the investors, PayPal, and the country.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Ethereum&rsquo;s Shanghai hard fork to take place in March 2023</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">&Eacute;thereum core developers have set March 2023 as the date for the network&rsquo;s Shanghai hard fork. The hard fork is a crucial one for the Ethereum community as it would allow users to withdraw their staked Ether tokens on the network.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li>Coinbase has encouraged customers to dump Tether for USD Coin by waiving fees</li>
<li>Binance had delisted USDC pairs last September to push its own stablecoin, BUSD</li>
<li>The war between the centralised stablecoins deepens</li>
<li>DAI holds the torch for decentralisation but faces uphill battle for relevancy as model seems unscalable</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The stablecoin war is heating up.</p>
<p>Coinbase, who co-founded the USDC stablecoin, are the latest to go on the offensive. It posted a blog post encouraging its users to swap their USDT over to USDC.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;The events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test, and we&rsquo;ve seen a flight to safety.&nbsp;</em><em>We believe that USD Coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we&rsquo;re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today, we&rsquo;re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I have wondered for a while why Coinbase has not gone on the offensive more and used its exchange to push holders into USDC. Of course, the cynic will say that this decision by Coinbase is to jack up the USDC holdings to reap extra revenue, as these have become a massive earner for the company given the interest rate on T-bills is now 4%.</p>
<p>That makes sense, and that is exactly what it is. But even still, such is the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/im-sick-of-talking-about-tether-but-heres-an-article-about-tether/">constant anxiety around Tether</a>, it may also be a good thing for the ecosystem at large. The best scenario &ndash; as far-fetched as it may seem &ndash; is for Tether&rsquo;s market cap to benevolently trickle down to zero.</p>
<p>Whether Tether is good for it or not, the constant conversation on the topic is negative for the entire industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Binance kicked the stablecoin war up a notch</strong></h2>
<p>Of the five big stablecoins, there has been some serious movement this year.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12116552">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p>Obviously, TerraUSD is the big one, its <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/luna-why-i-sold-my-ust-for-95-cents-on-the-dollar-today/">shocking crash</a> rocking the market. Since then, the decentralised torch has been passed to DAI. But that is beset by its own problems, coming under criticism for being centralised in nature, given its large holdings of USDC.</p>
<p>This led to it voting to move into T-bills, while the latest plan is for it to &ldquo;free float&rdquo;, as there is no other alternative if they want to pursue decentralisation. I&rsquo;ve been vocal in the past of my thoughts on DAI, and they haven&rsquo;t changed: I believe it has no future, as the model simply is not scalable.</p>
<p>Oh, and a stablecoin that free floats is also not a stablecoin, by the way.</p>
<p>Regarding the centralised stables, it was Binance that kicked up this stablecoin war a notch when it announced in September that it was delisting USDC pairs and auto-converting customer holdings into BUSD.</p>
<p>If we plot the market share of the stables since August, we can see that USDT and USDC have pared back significantly, while BUSD has come up.</p>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/12116745">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2>
<p>The above chart shows quite how dominant the top three providers are, with DAI now having a market cap of $5.2 billion, a mere drop in the ocean.</p>
<p>While this presents as a concerning amount of centralisation, the reality is that nobody has cracked the code on how to create a decentralised stablecoin. So like it or loathe it, it&rsquo;s centralisation going forward.</p>
<p>The question now is who wins out between the titans up top. This move by Coinbase is a notable one, as Binance had been making serious gains in the wake of their auto-convert announcement. But Binance still list USDT, as the most controversial stablecoin remains the most entrenched, absolutely vital to the entire ecosystem and the biggest liquidity pair by far.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe that is a good thing, so in the eyes of the market, it&rsquo;s nice seeing USDC make a move here.</p>
<p>The market share will be interesting to track again in a few months time. Hey, maybe we will all be <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/chinas-national-cryptocurrency-is-getting-more-ominous/">using CBDCs</a> before long, anyway.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies were still in a somber mood this week.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">FTX Token rose by more than 30% despite SBF legal woes.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Fetch.ai token surged after a staking announcement by Binance US.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/"><u>Cryptocurrency prices</u></a> remained in a tight range this week as investors focused on macro issues in the United States. Data published last week revealed that the American economy added 284k jobs in November while the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. Therefore, investors believe that the Fed will leave rates at an elevated level for longer than expected. Here are the top crypto predictions for this weekend.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">FTX Token (FTT)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">FTX Token token price soared by more than 31% in the past 24 hours, according to data compiled by&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/"><u>Binance</u></a>. It still remains near its all-time low as Sam Bankman remains in legal limbo. As we wrote&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-to-file-for-bankruptcy-as-metacade-mcade-is-set-to-skyrocket-in-presale/"><u>here</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>American authorities are investigating him on a myriad of crimes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In recent interviews, Bankman has hinted that FTX and Alameda Research did indeed comingle customer funds, which is a crime. Therefore, there is a likelihood that he, and other FTX and Alameda officials will be locked up for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The hourly chart shows that the FTT price went parabolic on Friday. As it rose, it managed to rise above the important resistance at $1.538. It also moved above the 25-day moving average. Still, I believe that this rally is a dead cat bounce, which will see it retreat in the coming days.</p>

                    Buy FTT with Binance today            </a>
    </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fetch.ai (FET)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Fetch.ai price was among the best-performing tokens this week. It rose to a high of $0.1290 after Binance US enabled staking. Historically, cryptocurrencies tend to rally after being offered by a major exchange like Binance or Coinbase.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the hourly chart, we see that the FET price went parabolic this week. Recently, however, it has scaled back and dropped by double-digits from its highest point. It has moved above the moving averages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Fetch.ai price will likely resume the bearish trend as the staking mometum wanes. If this happens, it will likely drop below the important support at $0.100.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Cortex (CTCX)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cortex describes itself as the first decentralized world computer capable of running AI and AI-powered apps on the blockchain. It is a layer-2 network with zero-knowledge features. The CTXC price soared by more than 100% on Friday as the Cortex Army pumped the coin.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the hourly chart, we see that the CTXC price has been in a bullish trend. It has moved above all moving averages, VWAP, and the ascending trendline shown in black. There is a likelihood that the highly illiquid coin will pull back on profit-taking during the weekend. If this happens, it will drop and retest the support at $0.15.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Crypto exchange Coinbase wants its users to switch their USDT for USDC.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The company calls USDC the trusted and reputable stablecoin.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase is a co-founder of Circle, the company that issues the USDC stablecoin.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Coinbase wants users to adopt USDC</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world, has urged its users to swap their USDT stablecoin for USDC. USDT is the leading stablecoin in the world (with a $65 billion market cap) and is issued by Tether.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, USDC is the stablecoin issued by Circle, a company that Coinbase helped founded. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/switch-to-the-trusted-and-reputable-digital-dollar-usdc"><u>blog post</u></a> on December 8th, Coinbase said USDC is the more trusted and reputable stablecoin. Coinbase wrote,</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;We co-founded USDC in 2018 with the vision of creating a more open, global financial system. USDC is unique in that it&rsquo;s 100% backed by cash and short-dated U.S. treasuries held in U.S.regulated financial institutions. It&rsquo;s always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars. Customers are calling for transparency, and USDC delivers via monthly attestations by Grant Thornton LLP, one of America&rsquo;s largest audit, tax, and advisory firms. Plus, eligible customers globally&sup2; earn up to 1.5% APY&sup3; on their USDC holdings with Coinbase.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Recent events prompted Coinbase to favour USDC</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Coinbase explained that events of the past few weeks prompted it to ask its users to switch to USSC. On-chain data indicated that USDT briefly lost its peg against the US Dollars following&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/this-week-in-crypto-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>the FTX collapse</u></a>. Coinbase wrote that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;However, the events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test, and we&rsquo;ve seen a flight to safety. We believe that USD Coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin, so we&rsquo;re making it more frictionless to switch: starting today, we&rsquo;re waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Although USDT remains the leading stablecoin in the cryptocurrency space, it has encountered numerous controversies over the years. There were claims that Tether&rsquo;s USDT stablecoins were not fully backed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In September, the stablecoin issuer was ordered by a U.S. judge in New York to produce financial records associated with the backing of USDT. In 2020, the New York Attorney General&rsquo;s office&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/new-york-ag-asks-bitfinex-and-tether-to-stop-further-delays/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>filed a lawsuit</u></a> to get Tether to release documents regarding its finances.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Staking is great. It offers you a way to earn some extra tokens by simply HODLing your coins like you were already doing. But what&rsquo;s the point in earning some tasty interest if the value of your staked coins drops to $0?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This article outlines the eight of the best staking cryptos to buy that strike a great balance between decent rewards and long-term fundamentals. </p>
<h2 dir="ltr">1. Metacade (MCADE) &ndash; The Best Staking Crypto to Buy</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> is a community hub built for the future of Web3 and Play2Earn gaming. It aims to be the number one platform for connecting with like-minded gamers, discovering the latest Play2Earn games, and earning more from&nbsp;<a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-gamefi-and-how-does-it-work" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>GameFi</u></a>. In the Metacade, you&rsquo;ll find chat rooms, leaderboards, reviews, and the hottest alpha from industry experts that can help you get ahead in the world of Play2Earn gaming.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is more than just a platform for hanging out and playing the latest games, however. It&rsquo;s a place where you can take advantage of several earning opportunities, gain an edge in GameFi, and even participate in the development of groundbreaking Play2Earn titles.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whenever you post a review, offer up some tips, or produce other useful content for the Metacade community, you&rsquo;re rewarded with the MCADE token. There are also regular prize draws and tournaments where you&rsquo;ll go head-to-head against other community members for your chance to win a big cash prize! If you&rsquo;re a gamer who loves to play the latest titles before everyone else, then you&rsquo;ll also be able to earn as a tester for Metacade&rsquo;s developer community by using the platform&rsquo;s native testing environment to offer direct feedback on games in development. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Staking your MCADE tokens means you can win rewards from the project, which are paid in stablecoins to avoid inflating the number of MCADE tokens in circulation. Even if you&rsquo;re not one for staking, you can still use your MCADE tokens to vote on the direction of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE holders can vote on game proposals to decide which games are developed next on the platform. The game developer whose proposal achieves the most votes will be awarded a Metagrant, a source of funding, to support the development of the game. Once the title is ready for launch, Metacade will add it to its virtual arcade for everyone to enjoy. Eventually, Metacade plans to host dozens of the very best Play2Earn games in its arcade, as voted for and backed by the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With all of these incredible features in mind, Metacade is set to dominate the budding GameFi industry by offering a buzzing community space at the forefront of the gaming revolution. Combined with attractive staking rewards and plenty of utility for MCADE holders, it&rsquo;s the top pick as the best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>&gt;&gt;&gt; You can participate in the Metacade presale&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://metacade.co/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=launch" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong><u>here</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">2. Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://polkadot.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Polkadot</u></a> is a solution to the issue of interoperability across different blockchains. It effectively allows two separate chains, like Ethereum and Solana, for example, to communicate with one another and uses parachains (parallel blockchains) to ensure fast and scalable transaction speeds. Its native token, DOT, is used as a governance token and to validate transactions using the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As such, DOT can be staked to realise rewards. By running a validator node, you&rsquo;ll achieve 14.9% returns per year, but you&rsquo;ll also need to lock up 350 DOT, or around $1800 in late November 2022. Alternatively, you can become a delegator, which returns 13.98% per year and requires locking up 80 DOT (approx. $415). The best way to stake DOT is on Binance, which returns 20.98% APR over a 120-day lockup with a limit of 20 DOT available to be staked.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Considering DOT&rsquo;s status as the 11th most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap and the unique solution the Polkadot network offers, it&rsquo;s the second best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">3. Cosmos (ATOM)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://cosmos.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Cosmos</u></a> is a chain similar to Polkadot. It&rsquo;s an interoperability solution that aims to create an &ldquo;internet of blockchains&rdquo; by allowing users to develop custom-built blockchains that can communicate with one another. This allows them to share data and perform transactions quickly and cheaply using the ATOM token. Like Polkadot, Cosmos uses a PoS consensus, meaning that holders of ATOM can stake their tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Cosmos offers the highest rewards out of the top thirty tokens by market cap, with delegators earning 19.03% APR with no minimum lockup amount. You can boost these earnings on Binance, which offers 32.9% APR when you stake up to 5 ATOM tokens for 120 days. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">When accounting for its status in the interoperability space and as a token that&rsquo;s performed exceptionally well during the recent bear market, ATOM&rsquo;s rewards are some of the best on the market. For that reason, it&rsquo;s the third best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">4. Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The world&rsquo;s most valuable smart contract platform,&nbsp;<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ethereum</u></a>, recently upgraded its network to run on proof-of-stake, as opposed to its former proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. The upgrade was carried out to improve scalability, security, and environmental output, with the PoS system promising to drastically boost transaction speeds and reduce fees. This system enables holders of ETH to now stake their tokens and validate transactions on the network instead of setting up a costly mining rig.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, you can earn 6.24% a year by running an Ethereum validator node or 5.11% using a staking pool. However, you will need 32 ETH to stake with either of these methods, which is around $35,400 at today&rsquo;s price of $1100. You can stake on Binance at up to 5.2% APR with no minimum amount, but you will need to lock up your tokens for at least six months until Ethereum&rsquo;s Shanghai upgrade is complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s still one of the most stable and promising tokens on this list despite these high requirements, so it&rsquo;s the fourth best staking crypto to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">5. Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://solana.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Solana</u></a> is a smart contract platform that was developed to address the issues of scalability and speed that affected the Ethereum network at the time. Solana offers blazing-fast speeds of around 3500 transactions per second (TPS) compared to Ethereum&rsquo;s ~30 TPS (<a href="https://ethtps.info/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ethtps.info</u></a>), with a theoretical maximum of 710,000 TPS on a standard gigabit network, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.solana.com/introduction" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Solana&rsquo;s documentation</u></a>. This still beats the expected maximum after the Ethereum upgrade, which should stand at around 100,000 TPS.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Solana offers 7.79% APR as a validator, with just 1 SOL (~$11 today) needed to operate a node, with a minimum lockup of five days. Becoming a delegator is easier and offers 7.04% APR, with the same minimum lockup amount and period as a validator. However, probably the easiest and best way to stake your SOL is through Binance, which offers 16.9% APR when staking up to 5 SOL for 120 days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With low barriers to entry, competitive staking rewards, and a valuable use case, Solana is the fifth choice as one of the best staking cryptos to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">6. Binance Coin (BNB)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.binance.com/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance Coin</u></a> is the native token of the Binance exchange. It was initially used as a trading discount fee token, but has since progressed to power the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a smart contract platform that is used as an alternative to Ethereum. Since its launch in 2020, BSC has grown to become one of largest smart contract platforms in the crypto market, powering over 4,300 decentralised apps (dApps), according to&nbsp;<a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/binance-smart-chain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DappRadar</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While running a validator node is out of the picture unless you have $3 million lying around, you can become a BNB delegator by locking up 1 BNB, or around $250 in November 2022. This will return you 4.09% yearly with a minimum lockup period of just seven days. On the Binance platform, you can stake up to 0.5 BNB for 120 days to earn 6.2% APR.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Given that BNB has remained as one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies and is likely to outperform in the coming bull market, it&rsquo;s the sixth best staking crypto to buy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">7. NEAR Protocol (NEAR)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://near.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NEAR</u></a> is a smart contract protocol that uses sharding to produce incredibly fast transaction speeds at virtually no cost. It uses sharding (breaking data into more manageable pieces) to achieve this, creating a much more efficient and scalable smart contract solution. NEAR Protocol is what&rsquo;s known as a layer 1 solution, meaning that it&rsquo;s built for other developers to build from the foundation it provides. Once development is complete, NEAR is expected to be able to handle up to 100,000 TPS &ndash; a potent rival to Ethereum and Solana.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Like Ethereum and Solana, NEAR uses PoS. However, NEAR offers much better staking rewards than either of these tokens, returning 10.05% per year as a delegator with a one-day minimum lockup period. You can become a validator to realise a 10.83% APR, but it&rsquo;s much easier to become a delegator. Binance offers the best staking rewards out of all major crypto exchanges, returning 30.49% APR with a maximum staking allowance of 20 NEAR.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While its use might not be as widespread as other layer 1 solutions, NEAR is a serious contender in this space and could soon creep into the top ten most valuable projects. Factoring in its excellent staking rewards, NEAR Protocol is a great choice as the seventh best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">8. Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://polygon.technology/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Polygon</u></a> is a layer 2 solution that works with the Ethereum blockchain to achieve faster transaction speeds and lower fees. It&rsquo;s essentially a parallel blockchain running alongside the main Ethereum chain, and has provided a solution for developers looking to use Ethereum&rsquo;s framework without facing significant congestion and high fees. Even after the Ethereum upgrade, Polygon will still provide critical infrastructure to developers looking for more flexibility in their products as one of the most advanced layer 2 solutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By becoming a MATIC delegator, you can earn 5.9% APR with a minimum lockup of 21 days and no minimum token requirement. You could become a validator for 6.37% APR, but according to <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/matic-network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Staking Rewards</u></a>, this is ranked as &ldquo;very hard.&rdquo; You can stake up to 250 MATIC ($195) for 90 days on Binance for a 13.9% APR, which will likely be your best bet if you&rsquo;re just beginning your staking journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MATIC, like ATOM, has performed excellently in the recent bear market. Combined with its status as the best layer 2 solution and attractive staking rewards, Polygon is the eighth best staking crypto to buy.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metacade (MCADE) Is Our Top Choice</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Staking has the power to boost your passive returns from crypto investing, or at the very least, mitigate some losses you might face. Of course, you should only stake projects that you believe have long-term potential. Otherwise, you expose yourself to the risk that the token depreciates more than your annual returns. In our opinion, the token with the greatest upside potential and the least downside is Metacade.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is positioning itself as a leader in one of the fastest-growing industries on the planet: GameFi. The GameFi industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 100% between now and 2025 (<a href="https://content-hub-static.crypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GameFi_Past-Present-and-Future_Overview-with-Comparisons-to-Traditional-Gaming-Industry-2.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Crypto.com</u></a>), and Metacade will be there as the industry&rsquo;s number one community hub that makes it all possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If you want to get in on Metacade before it explodes, there&rsquo;s no better moment than right now. The MCADE token is still in presale, and the sooner you buy, the greater your long-term returns. For example, in presale phase 1, you could get 125 MCADE for just $1. In presale phase 9, you&rsquo;ll get just 50 MCADE for $1. If you want to be one of the earliest investors in the GameFi revolution, then you should start seriously considering the Metacade presale as one of the best investment opportunities in this space.</p>
