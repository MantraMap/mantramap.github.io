					<description><![CDATA[Wyre, a crypto payments company, tweeted that the company will close soon due to market conditions. Users can now withdraw assets until July 14.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto payments company Wyre has announced it will close soon after a difficult year.</em></li>



<li><em>Users can withdraw their funds by July 14, after which the company will announce the process to recover the remaining assets on the platform.</em></li>



<li><em>In January, the company downsized and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158886-wyre-limits-withdrawals-90-of-their-funds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> it was shutting down after restricting customer withdrawals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wyre, a crypto payments company, tweeted that the company will close soon due to market conditions. Users can now withdraw assets until July 14.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1271.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="495" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1271.png" alt="Wyre Closed Soon, Users Can Withdraw Assets Before July 14" class="wp-image-195813" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1271.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1271-300x165.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1271-768x422.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1271-750x413.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Wyre Closed Soon, Users Can Withdraw Assets Before July 14 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Wyre said the decision was made in the best interests of key stakeholders and customers and not because of any guidance from any regulatory body.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your support and the opportunity to serve you throughout this journey.  Please check our blog for further updates.</p>&mdash; Wyre (@sendwyre) <a href="https://twitter.com/sendwyre/status/1669688774782058497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The company emphasizes that it will continue to protect the safety of customers&#8217; assets. Users with assets on the Wyre platform will have until July 14 to withdraw their assets through the company&#8217;s dashboard, after which there will be a separate process for recovering assets remaining on the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you have assets on the Wyre platform, you can withdraw them via Wyre&#8217;s dashboard through Friday, July 14. After then, we will have a separate process to recover assets remaining on the platform. We will post details on the process on our website and blogs.&#8221;</p>



<p>As previously reported, in January of this year, Wyre informed employees that the company would be liquidated but later said that it had received financing from a strategic partner and could continue operating regular operations and remove the customer&#8217;s withdrawal limit.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1272.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="653" height="391" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1272.png" alt="Wyre Closed Soon, Users Can Withdraw Assets Before July 14" class="wp-image-195814" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1272.png 653w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1272-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" title="Wyre Closed Soon, Users Can Withdraw Assets Before July 14 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The reason for this action is attributed to the current crisis in the market. The sudden and rapid collapse of FTX has once again plunged the crypto industry into a cold winter.</p>



<p>At the time, Wyre fired employees and told them the company was shutting down. To continue operating despite financial difficulties and better prepare the company for any future upheaval in the industry, it announced earlier this week that it would limit customer withdrawal.</p>



<p>According to Crunchbase, the company has raised $29 million across nine funding rounds. Its backers include Samsung Next Ventures, Pantera Capital, and the Stellar Development Foundation.</p>

<p>Details are currently scarce, but members of the NFT community speculated that Nike may have built an NFT-related game using Fornite Creative 2.0, which essentially enables users to create their virtual island game maps using Fortnite assets. As @clone_news_cn noted, &#8220;I remember that Fortnite recently launched Fortnite Creative 2.0, which has a strong self-built map mode similar to creating games on ROBLOX. I guess Nike may have used this mode to create a game. Two years ago, Nike also created a game on ROBLOX, but it was not combined with NFT[s] at that time.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="569" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2-1024x569.jpeg" alt="Nikes Airphoria NFT Sneaker Hunt Takes Over Fortnite Join Now 2" class="wp-image-195810" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2-750x417.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2-1140x634.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Nikes-Airphoria-NFT-Sneaker-Hunt-Takes-Over-Fortnite-Join-Now-2.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Nike&#039;s Airphoria NFT Sneaker Hunt Takes Over Fortnite - Join Now! 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>While it is not 100% confirmed if NFTs will be a part of Airphoria, SWOOSH&#8217;s involvement would suggest that it is on the cards, while Epic Games also holds a friendly stance towards NFT gaming. Nike&#8217;s NFT unit has been ramping up its efforts to edge its way into the traditional gaming space of late, and this potential collaboration with Fortnite could be a significant step towards that goal.</p>

<p>In response, ZachXBT announced the establishment of a donation address to defend freedom of speech, which has already received over $400,000 in contributions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The controversy began when ZachXBT published an article on social media platform Twitter, claiming that Jeffrey Huang had allegedly misappropriated 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial in 2018. The article further accused Huang of launching multiple unsuccessful initial coin offering (ICO) and non-fungible token (NFT) projects subsequent to the company&#8217;s collapse.</p>

<p>In light of these serious allegations, Jeffrey Huang has taken legal action, filing a defamation lawsuit against ZachXBT. The lawsuit seeks to address the reputational damage caused by the claims made in the article and seeks appropriate legal remedies. Huang vehemently denies all the accusations made against him and intends to fight for his reputation in court.</p>



<p>ZachXBT, known for his investigative work in the cryptocurrency space, responded to the lawsuit by announcing the creation of a donation address. According to his Twitter post, the donations received thus far have exceeded $400,000. ZachXBT claims that these funds will be utilized to support the cause of freedom of speech and enable him to defend himself in the legal battle with Huang.</p>

<p>The situation has attracted significant attention, with supporters and critics expressing their opinions on social media. Some have applauded ZXBT&#8217;s efforts to safeguard freedom of speech, considering it crucial for investigative journalism. Others, however, have raised concerns about the potential misuse of funds and the need for responsible reporting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Tether issued $11.6 billion in mortgage loans between June 2019 and May 2021 and it was winding down its lending operations during 2023.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tether issued $11.6 billion in mortgage loans between June 2019 and May 2021.</em></li>



<li><em>The documents also show that Tether repaid an $8 billion loan during the period.</em></li>



<li><em>The stablecoin issuer says it will reduce collateralized and over-collateralized loans in its reserves to zero in 2023.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to The Block, the New York Attorney General <a href="https://tether.to/en/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-What-We-Shared-With-NYAG/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released </a>legal settlement documents this week, and stablecoin issuer Tether issued $11.6 billion worth of mortgage loans from June 2019 to May 2021.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1024x576.png" alt="Tether Generated $11.6 Billion In Mortgage Loans Over The Last Two Years" class="wp-image-195789" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1267.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Tether Generated $11.6 Billion In Mortgage Loans Over The Last Two Years 8"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the document, of the 694 loans, 89% have Bitcoin as collateral and 9% have Ethereum as collateral. The remaining 2% is collateralized with Tether Gold (XAUT) and other securities. The USDT issuer received a total of 450,000 Bitcoin and 1.1 million Ethereum as collateral. The documents also show that Tether repaid an $8 billion loan during the period.</p>



<p>In December 2022, the stablecoin issuer announced that it would reduce its collateralized and over-collateralized loans in its reserves to zero in 2023. Previously, crypto firms Bitfinex and Tether settled with the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office (NYAG), ending a legal dispute that began in mid-2019.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, USDT fulfilled its reporting obligations to the New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office under the terms of the 2021 settlement. That agreement requires reporting on Tether&#8217;s reserves every quarter for two years.</p>

<p>That settlement is related to the April 2019 event that the NYAG&#8217;s office alleged that Bitfinex used Tether funds to covertly cover $850 million lost to payment processor Crypto Capital. The lost funds are believed to have caused withdrawal problems for Bitfinex customers in late 2018.</p>



<p>The documents were obtained by the NYAG during its investigation into Tether, which resulted in a settlement in February 2021 and a $18.5 million fine. They were released after a freedom of information request was made by crypto publication CoinDesk, and the Attorney General&#8217;s office provided them to The Block.</p>



<p>The stablecoin issuer <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195550-tether-calls-out-coindesk-not-to-disclose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has urged</a> CoinDesk not to disclose information about its past and current customers. This initiated procedures to prevent the public dissemination of confidential customer data and prevent the use of commercially sensitive information that could be exploited by malicious actors.</p>

<p>The on-chain sleuth has been sued by NFT trader MachiBigBrother, also known as Jeffrey Huang, for defamation. The lawsuit alleges that ZachXBT falsely <a href="https://medium.com/@investigationsbyzachxbt/22-000-eth-embezzled-and-over-ten-projects-failed-the-story-of-machi-big-brother-jeff-huang-a1ad073fcfa8" data-type="URL" data-id="https://medium.com/@investigationsbyzachxbt/22-000-eth-embezzled-and-over-ten-projects-failed-the-story-of-machi-big-brother-jeff-huang-a1ad073fcfa8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused </a>Huang of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of crypto, causing reputational and monetary harm to Huang. The lawsuit requests damages and reimbursement for legal fees.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A year ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@zachxbt</a> published a Medium article about me that damaged my reputation. <br>Today, I have filed a defamation lawsuit against him in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.</p>&mdash; Machi Big Brother (@machibigbrother) <a href="https://twitter.com/machibigbrother/status/1669780922449956864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 16, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The detective gained prominence in the crypto community by publishing original blockchain data analyses exposing the misdeeds of bad actors in decentralized finance and Web3 spaces. His investigations have led to real-world arrests and earned him a spot on Consensus Magazine&#8217;s Most Influential 2022 list. However, his recent allegations against Huang have sparked controversy, with Huang&#8217;s lawyer claiming that ZachXBT did not consider the ruinous effect that public allegations of criminal conduct could have on the accused individual.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Zach responded to the lawsuit on Twitter, calling it a &#8220;David and Goliath story&#8221; and claiming that Huang is using his wealth to silence him. </p>



<p>He lamented that fighting the lawsuit could cost him more than $1 million and asked his followers to donate crypto to a wallet dedicated to his legal costs. As of publication time, the wallet has received almost $95,000 worth of crypto donations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">It is sickening to see it come to this but I knew one day this would happen as the price of telling the truth is sometimes people dislike what you say.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>French authorities are investigating Binance for an &#8220;illegal&#8221; supply of digital asset services and aggravated money laundering.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance is accused of soliciting French clients via its local branch in violation of French law until 2022.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange recently announced its departure from the Netherlands after failing to get an AML license.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Paris prosecutor&#8217;s office stated to it that Binance is being investigated by local authorities for &#8220;illegally&#8221; providing digital asset services and serious money laundering.</strong></h5>

<p>The information <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2023/06/16/binance-principale-plate-forme-mondiale-d-echange-de-cryptomonnaies-visee-par-une-enquete-en-france_6177876_4408996.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> to <em>Le Monde</em> by the Paris public prosecutor&#8217;s office, an investigation relates to acts of illegal exercise of the function of digital asset service provider (PSAN) on the one hand and acts of aggravated money laundering by participating in investment operations, concealment, and conversion on the other, the latter being carried out by perpetrators of offenses that generated profits.</p>



<p>According to the Paris prosecutor&#8217;s office, an in-depth examination of papers and computer parts seized during the search is now required.</p>

<p>Binance, which is being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to register as a trading platform and selling unregistered securities, is also suspected of violating French law governing crypto-asset platforms, which has made a wide range of activities conditional on obtaining the status of digital asset service provider since 2019.</p>



<p>This registration with the Financial Markets Authority (AMF) is especially important if you want to market to prospective French consumers. Nevertheless, Binance, which has been delivering its services in France since 2020, is accused of having purchased ads to boost its presence in the nation prior to registering with the AMF in May 2022. Binance spokesperson explained to <em>Le Monde</em>:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>ApeCoin saw a severe drop in the past week, with almost 30% of its value lost.</em></li>



<li><em>The cause of the decline stemmed from the internal DAO management.</em></li>



<li><em>APE trading volume has decreased significantly, so it is not appropriate to buy altcoins at this time.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>ApeCoin (APE) continues to stutter under pressure, the booming cryptocurrency regulated by ApeCoin DAO is sailing in choppy seas with a 28% loss in value over the previous week, with the alarming salary disclosures of the DAO&#8217;s leadership causing a ruckus among the community.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="500" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259.png" alt="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy?" class="wp-image-195763" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259-300x167.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259-768x427.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1259-750x417.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy? 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>The ApeCoin DAO is not completely decentralized, and many roles within its organizational structure have been established to enable a smooth governance process. According to the ApeCoin website, the Ape Foundation assists the ApeCoin DAO&#8217;s governance process and is in charge of day-to-day administration, accountancy, project management, and other activities.</p>



<p>On June 10, the ApeCoin DAO secretary, known as &#8220;Vulkan,&#8221; <a href="https://twitter.com/PbarNYC/status/1667895998474076165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> an organizational chart on Twitter outlining the DAO&#8217;s top pay. This revealed monthly incomes ranging from $7,000 to $75,000, which shocked some community members and prompted a flood of inquiries from others.</p>

<p>Users expressed particular worry over the six-figure yearly salaries paid to Special Council members.</p>



<p>In the middle of the debate, APE&#8217;s value has dropped by 28% in the last week, trading at $2.08 as of June 16. This drop is most likely a reflection of investor attitude about the continuing saga.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="624" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1024x624.png" alt="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy?" class="wp-image-195760" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1024x624.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-300x183.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-768x468.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1536x936.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-2048x1248.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-750x457.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1258-1140x695.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ApeCoin Loses Almost 30% Of Its Value In A Week, Is Now A Good Time To Buy? 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">APE price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the technical indications offered, APE&#8217;s negative momentum is unquestionably significant. The turmoil seems to have been caused by internal market factors rather than foreign market pressures.</p>



<p>If APE fails to rise and closes below the Fib 23.6 level, traders could expect this level to become immediate resistance. The price area we need to watch here is $2.7.</p>



<p>Also, the trading volume of APE has decreased significantly, with volumes plummeting by more than 43% to a measly $83 million. Therefore, investors should note that buying at this time has many disadvantages.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Haru Invest and Delio investors are planning to file class action lawsuits against the crypto companies as a consequence of the freezing of crypto valued at billions.</em></li>



<li><em>Approximately 400 Haru investors and 150 Delio investors joined in a KakaoTalk group conversation to prepare for litigation.</em></li>



<li><em>Investors are likely to sue cryptocurrency companies for a variety of allegations, including fraud, via the legal firm LKB &amp; Partners.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/biz/2023/06/816_353102.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local media source</a> on June 16, cryptocurrency companies <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195308-haru-invest-hiding-transferring-moneyftx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haru Invest</a> and Delio investors are planning class-action lawsuits after they abruptly froze consumer deposits and withdrawals.</strong></h5>

<p>410 Haru Invest investors and 120 Delio investors formed a Kakao group conversation on Friday to plan for a lawsuit. They are likely to sue the platforms over suspected &#8220;fraud.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="740" height="493" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256.png" alt="Haru Invest, Delio Alleged Scam By Investors Action Lawsuits" class="wp-image-195752" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256.png 740w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1256-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" title="Haru Invest, Delio Alleged Scam By Investors Action Lawsuits 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>Both platforms have provided &#8220;deposit&#8221; services, in which clients may earn interest on their virtual assets if they deposit a particular amount for a defined period of time. Haru Invest and Delio have respectively provided maximum annual interest rates of 12% and 10%.</p>



<p>Haru Invest banned deposits and withdrawals on Tuesday, citing inaccurate information given by its consignment operator, B&amp;S Holdings. Moreover, Haru Invest has filed a criminal complaint against B&amp;S Holdings.</p>



<p>Delio suspended withdrawals owing to market volatility, while Haru Invest suspended deposits and withdrawals. Delio is said to have placed a particular quantity of cryptocurrency at Haru Invest. If the situation worsens, the company intends to host an investor meeting on Saturday.</p>



<p>As the situation worsens, Delio intends to conduct an investors&#8217; meeting on Saturday morning at its offices in Seoul&#8217;s Gangnam District.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I sincerely apologize to the investors who believed in us and used our service. We will report our current situation to investors and discuss feasible ways to recoup investments,&#8221; said Delio CEO Jung Sang-ho.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that Haru Invest might have exposure to the troubled cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Haru Invest, according to OXT Research, uses FTX. If the claim is correct, the corporation has been keeping its investors in the dark for about a year.</p>

<p>South Korea is one of the biggest crypto marketplaces, with billions of dollars transacted every day on the country&#8217;s many crypto platforms. Following the demise of Luna last year, the country has tightened its crypto regulations.</p>



<p>As Coincu reported, Delio formally <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195643-delio-holds-press-conference-on-june-17/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> that it would conduct a news conference on June 17 to explain the withdrawal halt to investors. The news conference was called to apologize to shareholders and explain the company&#8217;s present issues.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, has announced its departure from the Netherlands.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance is departing the Netherlands after failing to get a VASP license from the Dutch regulator.</em></li>



<li><em>Dutch citizens will only be permitted to withdraw monies from the exchange as of July 17.</em></li>



<li><em>The company said that it has engaged in a complete registration application procedure with the authorities as a virtual asset service provider.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/notice-on-changes-of-services-in-the-netherlands-b5a647be31cf469b87fc3337fd461ced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its departure from the Netherlands.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="669" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-1024x669.jpg" alt="Binance Is Leaving The Netherlands From July 17 After Legal Difficulties" class="wp-image-195740" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-1024x669.jpg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-300x196.jpg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-768x502.jpg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-1536x1004.jpg 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-750x490.jpg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal-1140x745.jpg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2-formatOriginal.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Is Leaving The Netherlands From July 17 After Legal Difficulties 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>Binance has announced its exit from the Netherlands market. New users from the Netherlands will not be permitted. Existing Netherlands resident users will only be allowed to withdraw assets from the Binance platform beginning July 17 at 00:00 UTC.</p>



<p>The exchange made the decision after failing to convince the Dutch regulator to grant it a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license, which certifies that it follows anti-money laundering (AML) requirements.</p>



<p>The exchange was previously fined €3,325,000 by the Dutch National Bank (DNB) in April 2022 for offering crypto services in the Netherlands without the legally necessary registration with the DNB.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="665" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251.png" alt="Binance Is Leaving The Netherlands From July 17 After Legal Difficulties" class="wp-image-195741" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251-768x511.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1251-750x499.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Binance Is Leaving The Netherlands From July 17 After Legal Difficulties 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>However, Binance insists it is still compliant with crypto regulations in the EU region. The exchange said that it has been in a complete registration application process with the regulator as a virtual asset service provider and that it would continue to cooperate with Dutch authorities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance is already compliant with EU standards on the prevention of money laundering and financing of terrorism as evidenced by its registrations in other EU countries, including France, Italy, Spain, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania. Binance continues to be committed to working collaboratively with regulators around the world and are additionally focused on getting our business ready to be fully compliant with the new EU rules on crypto-assets (MiCAR),&#8221; the exchange said in the blog post.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Current Dutch resident users will get an email with detailed information on what this implies for their accounts and any assets they presently hold on the Binance platform, as well as any actions they must take.</p>



<p>After legal difficulties with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binance is struggling in the US along with the Coinbase exchange.</p>

<p>The SEC sued the company and its US affiliate for mishandling consumer money and misleading authorities last week. It also attempted to freeze the company&#8217;s assets in the United States, which the exchange said would compel it to shut operations in the country.</p>



<p>Binance.US was also <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195587-binanceus-fires-50-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> to have laid off employees following the crackdown from the SEC, as Coincu previously reported.</p>

<p>Binance has announced that it will exchange 1.25 billion USDT-TRX for USDT-ETH directly with the Tether team to address stablecoin liquidity concerns. The move comes after USDT&#8217;s slight de-pegging yesterday, causing traders to worry about the potential risks associated with this cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Moreover, CoinDesk has obtained USDT&#8217;s client information that Tether did not want to disclose. This development has added fuel to the already burning fire of controversy surrounding Tether, which has been the subject of regulatory scrutiny in recent months. The New York Attorney General&#8217;s Office provided responsive documents to CoinDesk relating to Tether&#8217;s case, and CoinDesk reported an attack on USDT via DeFi and CEX on the same day the documents were released. Tether has asked CoinDesk not to disclose any information about their past or current customers.</p>



<p>However, according to the report, these materials should debunk all the unfounded FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) that has been circulating in the crypto community. The materials are outdated and may not accurately reflect Tether&#8217;s current state of reserves nor account for the transformative changes in their ecosystem.</p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s decision to secure stablecoin liquidity through direct swaps with Tether is a smart move for traders who want to avoid the potential risks associated with USDT&#8217;s de-pegging. Despite regulatory scrutiny, this move also signals confidence in Tether&#8217;s ability to maintain stablecoin liquidity.</p>



<p>Traders need to keep themselves updated with the latest trends and developments in the cryptocurrency market to make informed decisions. While Tether&#8217;s recent actions have raised concerns, it is vital to remember that the materials obtained by CoinDesk are outdated and may not accurately reflect the current state of Tether&#8217;s reserves. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate all available information and make informed decisions based on the latest developments in the market.</p>
