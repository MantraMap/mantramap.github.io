			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale, the world's largest bitcoin-only investment vehicle, has once again attempted to convince the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many and varied are the applications for a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), but despite the carefully lodged protests by some of the applicants, including Greyscale, the SEC has always denied a Bitcoin ETF, stating that investors would not be adequately protected.</p>
<p>According to an article in Proactive Investors, a new Grayscale appeal, termed the SEC&rsquo;s refusal as &ldquo;arbitrary to its core&rdquo; and &ldquo;illogical&rdquo; given that the SEC hadn&rsquo;t had a problem in approving futures ETFs. The Grayscale petition stated that the SEC's decision should be held unlawful and set aside.</p>
<p>The main problem with GBTC is that the shares cannot be redeemed, leaving investors with only one option, of selling them on to a willing buyer.</p>
<p>Over time, the shares have underperformed against the underlying bitcoin, and have shown a very large negative discount. However, with Bitcoin rising over recent times, the gap has narrowed somewhat.</p>
<p>Osprey Funds, the controlling shareholder of Grayscale&rsquo;s parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) has made a bid to take over as the trust&rsquo;s sponsor and has made several recommendations.</p>
<p>These include slashing the management fee to 0.49%, and cleaning up the expense structure of the fund which contains significant conflicts of interest, seeking to implement a redemption program as soon as possible, and pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Valkyrie Investments is also interested in taking over as the sponsor of GBTC, and co-founder Steven McClurg was quoted by Proactive Investor as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what actions Grayscale and DCG will take in response to the pressure they are facing, but it is clear that something needs to be done to protect the interests of GBTC investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital, and crypto exchange CoinFlex, are pitching investors to raise $25 million for a new crypto exchange focused on claims trading. </p>
<p>The founders of the now defunct crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Su Zhu and Kyle Davis, are pitching investors with the hopes to raise $25 million to start a new cryptocurrency exchange called GTX. Zhu and Davis are joined in the venture by CoinFlex co-founder Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam. &nbsp;Two separate pitch decks were obtained by the news agency The Block.</p>
<p>Zhu and Davis are trying to bring GTX to life following the implosion of FTX, which saw millions of creditors lose their funds. GTX aims to take advantage of the FTX situation by offering depositors the ability to transfer their FTX claims to GTX to receive immediate credit in a token called USDG. GTX is a spin on the &ldquo;FTX&rdquo; name &ldquo;because G comes after F,&rdquo; according to one of the pitch decks.</p>
<p>GTX will employ CoinFlex&rsquo;s technology to build the exchange while a legal team will oversee the onboarding of claims for the recent bankruptcies that occurred in 2022 such as Voyager, BlockFi, Mt.Gox, and Celsius. According to the pitch decks, GTX is aiming to launch very soon, possibly in February already, and estimates that the claims market is worth somewhere in the whereabouts of $20 billion.</p>
<p>The GTX pitch deck has not been well received within the crypto community. Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy said on Twitter:</p>

<p>If you are investing into CoinFLEX/3AC[&rsquo;s] &lsquo;exchange&rsquo; you might find it a bit more difficult to work with Wintermute in future (on the relationship building side). Adding, &ldquo;Similarly, we are not going to be participating in venture rounds where these guys are about to enter the cap table, so founders beware.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A California-based cannabis seed bank has turned to blockchain technology and smart contracts to verify the efficacy of its medicinal plants. </p>
<p>Mendocino Clone Company (MCC), a cannabis nursery, has turned to blockchain technology and smart contracts to verify the authenticity of the therapeutic plants they sell. Through blockchain, the company will be able to certify all baby plants, also referred to as clones, with a batch certificate. Mendocino entered a partnership with the EMTRI project, a decentralised cannabis supply chain community, and technology firm Global Compliance Applications to make the project possible.</p>
<p>Cannabis nurseries, or seed banks, are organizations that focus on plant genetics and produce clones, baby plants, and seeds for wholesale distribution. According to a blog post by Global Compliance:</p>

<p>This innovative move allows the nursery to document the beginning stages of a cannabis plant's journey to becoming a premium product for consumers based on the gram weight it flowers.</p>

<p>Jed Davis, CEO of MCC said:</p>

<p>At Mendocino Clone Company, we are always looking for ways to innovate and improve the quality of our products. We believe that by joining the EMTRI decentralized community, we can provide an additional level of transparency and trust for our customers.</p>

<p>The batch certificate is a self-generated smart contract for clone batch and provides each baby plant with its own &ldquo;unique identity block,&rdquo; which is created by the nursery and linked to its Ethereum-based blockchain according to reports by Cointelegraph. The nursery&rsquo;s clients which include commercial farms and retail dispensaries can then use the batch certificates to verify the authenticity of their clones and their genetic lineage.</p>

<p>Stops were also recently elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 20026, 19153, 18448, 17743, 16870, and 16739 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 18513.27 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 20856.77.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18390.99/ 16714.46/ 14500.15 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;21488.32/ 22912.49/ 23127.09 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">XRP is a digital asset designed to bridge the gap between different forms of currency, including fiat and cryptocurrency. It is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, an open-source decentralized payment protocol that enables fast, secure, and low-cost payments.&nbsp;</p>
The Ripple Network
<p dir="ltr">The underlying technology of XRP is based on the Ripple protocol, a payment protocol that is built on blockchain technology. The Ripple protocol consists of a distributed ledger, which is maintained by a network of independent servers. This network is used to store, verify, and transfer payments. The Ripple protocol is built on a consensus algorithm, which allows it to reach consensus without the need for a trusted third party. It is also designed to be highly efficient, so that transactions can be completed in seconds, rather than minutes or hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP enables users to send and receive payments of any size, from any currency to any currency, in a matter of seconds. This makes it ideal for international payments, which require the transfer of different currencies. XRP can be used to make payments, exchange currencies, and facilitate transfers of other digital assets. It is currently used by hundreds of companies and financial institutions, including MoneyGram, American Express, and Santander.</p>
Price Fluctuation Of XRP
<p dir="ltr">The price of XRP, a cryptocurrency created by Ripple, has been volatile in recent years, with significant fluctuations in both directions. This has been caused by a variety of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory changes, and the impact of news events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2017, the price of XRP rose dramatically as the company behind Ripple, Ripple Labs, announced partnerships with banks and other financial institutions. The following year, the price of XRP reached an all-time high of $3.84. However, the price of XRP has been subject to wide fluctuations since then. In 2018, the price dropped sharply as speculation about the potential regulation of cryptocurrencies increased. This caused investors to become wary of investing in XRP, leading to a decrease in the price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2019, XRP experienced another significant price drop after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. This news had a major impact on the price of XRP, as investors began to worry about the future of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite this, XRP has managed to recover somewhat in 2020. This is largely due to the fact that Ripple Labs has managed to reach a settlement with the SEC, and the company is now focusing on expanding its services. The price of XRP has also been supported by a number of positive news events, such as Ripple Labs&rsquo; partnership with MoneyGram.</p>
Steps To Buy XRP&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Are you looking to buy XRP, the cryptocurrency token of Ripple? This article mentions basic and easy steps through which you can buy XRP</p>
Step 1: Choose Your Exchange
<p dir="ltr">Selecting an exchange to utilise to purchase XRP is the first step. Although there are numerous exchanges available, it's crucial to do your investigation and choose one that is safe, dependable, and has reasonable prices.</p>
Step 2: Register And Confirm Your Identity
<p dir="ltr">Once you&rsquo;ve chosen your exchange, the next step is to sign up and verify your identity. This process usually involves providing your name, address, date of birth, and sometimes a government-issued ID.</p>
Step 3: Transfer Funds to the Exchange
<p dir="ltr">Now that you&rsquo;ve signed up and verified your identity, you&rsquo;ll need to transfer funds to the exchange. This can be done via a bank transfer, credit card, or other payment methods depending on the exchange you are using.</p>
Step 4: Buy XRP
<p dir="ltr">Once your funds have been successfully transferred to the exchange, you&rsquo;ll be able to buy XRP. Simply navigate to the &ldquo;Buy/Sell&rdquo; section of the exchange, select XRP, enter the amount of XRP you want to buy, and click &ldquo;Buy.&rdquo;</p>
Step 5: Secure Your XRP
<p dir="ltr">Once you&rsquo;ve purchased XRP, it&rsquo;s important to secure it. You should always transfer your XRP to a secure wallet. Keep in mind that cryptocurrency investing is risky, so make sure you do your research and only invest what you can afford to lose.</p>
Is Investing In XRP Profitable For The Future?
<p dir="ltr">The main argument for investing in XRP is that it is a digital asset with a growing user base and real-world applications. Ripple has established a strong foothold in the financial industry, and its technology has been adopted by major banks, financial services companies, and remittance companies. This has created a strong demand for XRP, which is likely to continue to grow as more companies adopt Ripple&rsquo;s technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP also has the potential to increase in value over time. This means that it can increase in value independent of other currencies. As more companies use XRP to facilitate real-time payments, the demand for XRP is likely to increase, which could lead to an appreciation in the value of XRP. If the demand for XRP decreases or if Ripple&rsquo;s technology fails to gain traction, the value of XRP could decrease.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Simply put, XRP is still in its developing stage. If you really want to invest in it, you can invest for the short term and trade on bitsoft360 to make a profit, but factually, it is not a good investment option for the longer term.</p>
XRP In 2023
<p dir="ltr">In 2023, XRP is a digital asset that is being used by many financial institutions and banks around the world and is becoming a popular choice for those looking to invest in digital assets. This can be done without the need for a third party, which is a major benefit of using XRP. It is secure, fast, and has low transaction fees, making it an attractive choice for many users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2023, XRP is being used by a variety of businesses, from banks to payments companies. This is due to its ability to settle payments quickly and securely, which is a major benefit for many businesses.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP is also being used as a bridge currency between different fiat currencies, making it an attractive option for those looking to transfer money quickly. There are also a number of projects that are being built on the Ripple network, such as cross-border payment solutions and decentralized exchanges. The demand for XRP is increasing, with its price rising steadily over the last few years. It has a secure and reliable network, low transaction fees, and is being used by many businesses. As more businesses and users adopt XRP, it will only become more popular and important in the years to come.</p>
What Uncertainty Does XRP Entail?
<p dir="ltr">The future of XRP is highly uncertain, as cryptocurrency has been mired in controversy and regulatory uncertainty for the past few years. XRP is a digital asset created by the company Ripple, and it was designed to facilitate payments between banks and other financial institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the short term, XRP remains a popular asset among investors. Despite its volatility, it has seen some significant gains in recent months. This is largely due to Ripple&rsquo;s commitment to increasing its use in international payments, as well as the promise of using XRP in the company&rsquo;s xRapid system. xRapid is a payment system that uses XRP to facilitate cross-border payments, and it has been gaining traction among banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The digital asset has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, and its regulatory status has yet to be determined. The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is currently investigating Ripple and its use of XRP, and until that investigation is concluded, the future of XRP remains unclear.</p>
<p dir="ltr">That said, many investors remain optimistic about the future of XRP. The asset has a lot of potential as a payment system, and if the SEC grants it regulatory approval, it could become an invaluable tool for international payments. Additionally, Ripple has been making significant investments in its technology, and if these investments pay off, XRP could become one of the leading digital assets in the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, the future of XRP remains uncertain. The asset has seen some significant gains in recent months, but its long-term prospects are still unclear. Until the SEC resolves its investigation into Ripple and its use of XRP, it is impossible to know what the future holds for this digital asset. However, many investors remain confident that XRP could be a valuable tool for international payments in the future.</p>
Final Words
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, investing in XRP is a potentially profitable venture for the future. XRP&nbsp; is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, an open-source decentralized payment protocol that enables fast, secure, and low-cost payments. You can buy XRP, the cryptocurrency token of Ripple Labs.</p>
<p>XRP is a digital asset that is being used by many financial institutions and banks around the world. As more companies use XRP to facilitate real-time payments, the demand for XRP is likely to increase. If the demand for XRP decreases or if Ripple's technology fails to gain traction, the value of XRP could decrease. The future of XRP is highly uncertain, as cryptocurrency has been mired in controversy and regulatory uncertainty.</p>

Additionally, Ripple has been making significant investments in its technology, and if these investments pay off, XRP could become one of the leading digital assets in the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, the future of XRP remains uncertain. The asset has seen some significant gains in recent months, but its long-term prospects are still unclear. Until the SEC resolves its investigation into Ripple and its use of XRP, it is impossible to know what the future holds for this digital asset. However, many investors remain confident that XRP could be a valuable tool for international payments in the future.</p>
Final Words
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, investing in XRP is a potentially profitable venture for the future. XRP&nbsp; is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, an open-source decentralized payment protocol that enables fast, secure, and low-cost payments. You can buy XRP, the cryptocurrency token of Ripple Labs.</p>
<p>XRP is a digital asset that is being used by many financial institutions and banks around the world. As more companies use XRP to facilitate real-time payments, the demand for XRP is likely to increase. If the demand for XRP decreases or if Ripple's technology fails to gain traction, the value of XRP could decrease. The future of XRP is highly uncertain, as cryptocurrency has been mired in controversy and regulatory uncertainty.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Initiating a zero-knowledge proof system in space seemed like an impossible goal until recently. However, DoraHacks and Cryptosat have shown this can be done. Both teams showcased the viability of this approach aboard the ISS last week.&nbsp;</p>
Zero-knowledge Proof System In Space
<p>Establishing trust in a zero-knowledge proof environment is essential. It allows the sender to prove something is valid to the recipient without sharing any extra information. To make such a setup work, the ZK setup system must be free from tampering, both on the software and hardware side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The International Space Station (ISS) makes for an ideal location. Seven astronauts inhabit it, and no one else has access to the hardware. Moreover, the ISS maintains a radio frequency connection to a ground station. To conduct the experiment, the teams pre-uploaded open-source programs to generate a file with a Common Reference String (CRS). That CRS is used by DoraHacks' Zero-Knowledge proof-powered voting solution protecting user privacy and preventing collusion in governance and voting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DoraHacks CEO and Founder Eric Zhang adds:</p>

<p>"Ultimately, we want to use an isolated computing environment in space to conduct a complete trusted setup for zero-knowledge proof applications, including an &lsquo;in-space ceremony' that produces CRS for multiple proof systems, like PLONK. If we can achieve this goal, we can provide a public good for all zero-knowledge proof powered applications, as well as a new paradigm to initiate cryptographic protocols in general."</p>

<p>DoraHacks partnered with Cryptosat due to its reputation in trusted computing environments in space. Cryposat deploys cubesats and aims to build its fleet of low-orbit satellites for zero-knowledge proof purposes. Although the current setup has limitations, those will slowly be resolved once the satellite fleet becomes vaster. As a result, DoraHacks and Cryptosat can collaborate on future space missions to expand the boundaries of this approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only. It is not offered or intended to be used as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice.</p>
Tremendous Potential For Zero-Knowledge Systems
<p>Conducting an experiment like this aboard the ISS is a major industry milestone. Zero-knowledge proof systems can be used for various purposes, including collusion-resistant governance in DAOs, private ballots, and random beacons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cryptosat Co-founder Yonatan Winetraub adds:</p>

<p>"We are excited to unlock the possibility of running trusted setups for Zero-Knowledge schemes in space. The ability to perform a trusted setup in a completely isolated environment is key in making efficient SNARK schemes much more widely used, secure and easier to iterate on. By having Cryptosat participate in the ceremony, we guarantee there is at least one party out of this world making the ceremony more secure."</p>

<p>In addition, the successful experiment aboard ISS paves the way for satellite-based solutions offering a faster turnaround for project initiation ZK proof systems.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Iran and Russia are reportedly cooperating to jointly issue a new cryptocurrency/stablecoin backed by gold that will avoid having to use the US dollar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Russian Vedomosti news agency, first covered by an article on CoinTelegraph, the goal of this new stablecoin is to enable cross-border transactions instead of fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. The stablecoin is projected to operate in a special economic zone in Astrakhan, where Russia began accepting Iranian cargo shipments.</p>
<p>This news comes amid ongoing international trade sanctions against Iran, which has led the country to look for alternative methods of conducting foreign trade. In August 2022, the Iranian Industry, Mines, and Trade Ministry approved the use of cryptocurrency for imports into the country as a way to mitigate the effects of the sanctions. Iran subsequently placed its first international import order using $10 million worth of crypto.</p>
<p>Russia, too, has been actively working to adopt crypto as a tool for foreign trade. However, according to CoinTelegraph, Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev emphasised that a joint stablecoin project would only be possible once the digital asset market is fully regulated in Russia. The Russian lower house of parliament has promised to start regulating crypto transactions in 2023, following several delays.</p>
<p>This joint stablecoin project between Iran and Russia is a significant development in the world of cryptocurrency. It highlights the growing trend of countries looking to crypto as a way to bypass traditional financial systems and international sanctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the digital asset market continues to mature, we can expect to see more countries exploring the use of stablecoins and other forms of cryptocurrency in cross-border trade.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain and AI each offer us great benefits on their own, such as improved functionality, lower prices, and faster service. Therefore, it's safer to say that the fusion of these two will generate results from an efficient operating system based on supreme operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When these two fields collide, we obtain intelligent augmentation devices and a human-machine interface, which can communicate with a person's brain directly to facilitate learning and knowledge expansion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyday transactions, contracts, the Internet of Things, and even weather patterns can all be accessed by deep machine learning processes running on Blockchain.</p>
Efficiency Wrapped Under Affordable Rates&nbsp;
<p>Blockchain provides a transparent public ledger for recording transactions and storing data. Static information like news and literature coexist with dynamic information like computer codes. Since these programs are included in the permanent record, they can be seen by anybody without cost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there is a cost associated with updating the Blockchain, it would be foolish and economically infeasible to keep uploading new code without some sort of compensation.</p>
<p>Performing data mining uses a lot of power. Google's energy-saving measures have resulted in a 40% decrease in consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This optimization is achieved by feeding historical data from a large number of detectors in a data center into DeepMindAI and having it learn from the data. The same ideas can be used to cut down on hardware expenses in mining.</p>
Blockchain and AI, The Integrity Amplifiers
<p>As a cutting-edge database, blockchain has many benefits over both traditional databases and the Internet.</p>
<p>How to gather specific information to build a neural network is among the most significant difficulties currently limiting data science. Data quality is still an issue despite the fact that people exchange massive amounts of information online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the absence of government regulation, many people are encouraged to spread misinformation. Consider the phenomenon of "fake news," which in the latest days appears to have a wider impact than accurate reporting.</p>
<p>The limitations and scope of technology are taken into account, and data reliability is achieved by improved cryptographic inventions including hashes and digital signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially after the rise of trade assistance systems like the bitcoin loophole This allows us to confidently state that a certain dataset did, in fact, exist at a given period and has not been modified since then.</p>
<p>Integrity, triple entry, safety, and origin can all be strengthened by incorporating Blockchain and AI.</p>
The Imitation Of Quantum Computing Simulation&nbsp;
<p>The deep neural networks serve as technical trainers to make relatively accurate predictions on the data set on which they were trained. Aspects like speech recognition as well as video prediction are often determined by using redundant neural networks.</p>
<p>If you adopt the pay-per-use model, you can educate neural networks offline and then keep them in the blockchain. Users input data through the medium, and as the entity grows larger, it will be able to save that data in a more comprehensive way.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to make a head or tail of the inner workings of a neural network and the procedure by which their results are extracted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several researches have attempted to decode how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) function, however, it may be best approached through solution analysis and simulation of physical ideas.</p>
<p>The computing power of neural networks can be greatly enhanced by implementing them on the Blockchain using similar technology. This is due to the fact that Proof of Work (PoW) protocols utilize a PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generators) engine.</p>
<p>Combining Blockchain and AI allows for the resolution of intractable issues like chaotic systems engineering and deterministic computing.</p>
Placing The Brick Of Smart Cities&nbsp;
<p>By incorporating the data you've requested into the neural network's training process, Artificial Intelligence Agents (AIAs) can outperform taught frameworks. Reaching fitness means that the next submissions will require essentially minimal adjustments.</p>
<p>Code storage is made easier with blockchains. Moreover, AIAs stored on blockchains simplify the development process in several ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tasks like translating across programming languages, finding algorithms that match a given pattern, creating novel algorithms, validating requirements, and translating documentation into code become far less cumbersome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AIAs' dependability and heightened security come from their use of advanced learning algorithms and data mining.</p>
<p>Incorporating the most appropriate AIA plus CNN with the accessible data can yield fruitful results for greater economics and cutting-edge Smart Cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial market analysis, high-definition stellar body imaging for collision prediction, audits, network security, and more can all benefit from the use of AIA.</p>
The Happy-Go-Lucky Data Sourcing&nbsp;
<p>Through the integration of these systems, we can now publish trained neural networks and store program codes on blockchains. Using the trained CNN technique, we may verify our submitted data and conduct new transactions. A sophisticated classification algorithm, such as Sci-kit, helps to streamline operations.</p>
<p>An embedding vector can be used to represent a word. If two words have the same meaning, their vectors will be identical. Ideas that are similar to one another are clustered together, while those that are very different from one another are spread apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the above illustration, the vectors of the girl and the boy will point in the same direction, but the vector of the plate will point in the opposite way.</p>
<p>Assuming that the matrices for Corona and Ebola are similar, machine learning algorithms including deep neural networks programmed on this issue can distinguish between the two diseases based on the similarities between the articles covering them. This makes it simpler for developers to access and utilize the various code repositories.</p>
Wrapping It Up&nbsp;
<p>The integrity of datasets can be achieved by the combination of Blockchain and AI. Because the information is unbreakable, this enables increased safety as well as an accurate and timely forecast of potential breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simultaneously, with greater levels of transparency, we have a greater understanding of the capabilities of AI, and we can run operations more quickly while also lowering our costs.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uncollateralized loans have huge potential to be disrupted by DeFi. Dusk Network has the solution to bring fully regulated under collateralized loans on-chain.</p>
<p>Decentralised Finance (DeFi) continues to evolve, and we see more and more services, tools, and products coming into play to meet the needs of the DeFi community. AMMs, stablecoins, and collateralized loans are but a few examples of these, and each develops the DeFi ecosystem in such a way as to bring a traditional financial service on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges of compliance/regulation remain in this space, the soon to be implemented MiCA regulation for one. Nevertheless, DeFi continues to grow, and evolve, and has become a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Undercollateralized loans are one of the latest concepts to be disrupted by the world of DeFi. It is a key feature of RegFi (Regulated Finance), but in the DeFi sphere, the discovery phase of how to run, deliver and maintain a viable undercollateralized lending market, is still being worked out.</p>
Orthogonal Trading and Its Undercollateralized Loan
<p>Recently it was discovered that Orthogonal Trading had an under collateralized loan from a pool managed by M11, and issued via Maple Finance&rsquo;s tooling. Maple Finance and M11 revealed that Orthogonal misrepresented the state of their finances after the FTX debacle, and like many, had a liquidity issue and therefore requested the loan. Since requesting the loan, the company has become insolvent.</p>
<p>The example of Orthogonal indicates that undercollateralized loans are something that DeFi needs to get right before it can become a realistic option for both on and off-chain finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is imperative to understand that we cannot simply employ methods used in RegFi without adapting them to suit DeFi and its specific needs. The two differ vastly in terms of technology, ways of doing business, and products that are applicable in RegFi cannot simply be replicated in DeFi without tailoring them.</p>
<p>Undercollateralized loans play a role in DeFi and are necessary, and Dusk is one of the only, if not the only, protocols that can successfully introduce this into the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
Understanding Undercollateralized Loans and Why They Are Needed in DeFi
Collateralized Loans
<p>Before getting into the nuances of undercollateralized loans, their opposite, collateralized or sometimes over-collateralized loans, need to be explored. Overcollateralized loans are popular within DeFi and refer to a loan in which you put up your cryptocurrencies as collateral and can borrow against it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example is depositing $10,000 worth of $ETH, and then borrowing $9,000 worth of stablecoins against it. When the borrower repays their loan, they receive their $ETH back. Should a borrower not be able to repay their loan, or the value of the collateral put up falls below a certain threshold compared to what they have borrowed, the collateral is liquidated to repay the loan.</p>
<p>Collateralized loans have been a key in the development of DeFi. Offering loans on-chain is advantageous in that liquidations are executed on-chain by smart contracts, making them much more efficient and straightforward - if a borrower&rsquo;s position falls below 1, the position is liquidated.</p>
Undercollateralized Loans
<p>Undercollateralized loans are loans in which you do not put up the full amount of a loan as collateral before being able to borrow funds. A simple example of this is the mortgage industry. Individuals wanting to buy a house most often do not have the liquidity to pay for it in full and therefore turn to a bank for a loan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks review a prospective buyer&rsquo;s credit history and income and base their decision to award a loan on such data. Banks do however require a certain percentage as a deposit before lending the rest. Should a person fail to repay the loan, the bank would seize the house and sell it to recoup their money.</p>
<p>These types of loans allow the economy to grow by allowing individuals to secure financing. With secured financing, individuals can invest in assets that are expected to appreciate. Over and beyond that, using borrowed funds in many ways encourages economic activity and stimulates growth.</p>
<p>One of the key issues in crypto and DeFi now is that it&rsquo;s not easy to create value. Yes, we can convert fiat into crypto tokens, and we can move assets, swapping between them, but it is limited within the DeFi sandbox. For DeFi to provide a viable alternative to RegFi, it needs to develop and adapt its undercollateralized loan mechanisms instead of just relying on new money coming on-chain from fiat into crypto asset</p>
What went wrong with Orthogonal Trading?
<p>The company was insolvent but was able to misrepresent the state of its financials and take out a loan it was unable to repay. RegFi has many mechanisms in place to support undercollateralized loans such as banks and regulators that do credit checks, and despite these mechanisms, they can still get it wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Orthogonal Trading&rsquo;s case, their &ldquo;misrepresenting their financial position&rdquo; had led to a situation where the lending pool managed by M11 now faces irredeemable debt in which the burden of recouping that debt falls on the lender.</p>
<p>In RegFi, when money is lent to a borrower and the borrower cannot repay that debt, the burden falls on the lender. There are some actions you can take to recover your funds, but it may never happen. Lenders need to consider two externalities when deciding to lend money:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">an asset depreciating</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">a misevaluation or misrepresentation of the asset</li>
</ol>
<p>As the risk lies with lenders, many are conservative when deciding who to lend money to, making it difficult for businesses to access necessary financing, while those who can provide a clean credit history have easy access to liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overcollateralized, on-chain loans reverse this as borrowers must provide collateral in advance and if they are unable to repay the loan or the value of their collateral falls below the value of what they have borrowed, they are automatically liquidated. The risk in this case falls on the borrower and a smart contract will execute a liquidation automatically. Dusk firmly believes that we can have the best of both worlds &ndash; the growth-facilitating effects of RegFi uncollateralized loans but with the efficiency of smart contracts employed in overcollateralized loans.</p>
Dusk Network&rsquo;s Solution
<p>Dusk&rsquo;s goal is to make finance better by bringing regulation to DeFi and one of the ways of doing this is by offering economy-boosting undercollateralized loans, on-chain, in an efficient manner and one that opens the crypto sandbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dusk is a Layer-1 blockchain that has regulatory compliance built in and establishes the new concept of Regulated DeFi (RegDeFi). Regulated DeFi opens the crypto sandbox to the traditional world of finance while providing traditional financial institutions access to blockchain technology. As these two worlds come together, securities, bonds, and other financial products can be tokenized and brought on-chain.</p>
<p>RegFi is currently challenged by a lack of homogeneity between assets. In essence, a house is not the same as a security which is different from fiat. In the world of blockchain, this is not an issue &ndash; they are just byte-encoded data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By tokenizing traditional assets, we can solve this problem. If a value can be put on an asset, it can be integrated on-chain and have the same congruency as all other assets. But what could this offer the financial sector? It means that we can have the capital efficiency of undercollateralized loans with the technological efficiency of blockchain.</p>
<p>RegDeFi &ndash; when applied to the lending and borrowing market &ndash; removes many issues. Externalities lenders face are removed, and the risk for lenders is decreased as the burden of asset recourse falls on the borrower if the borrower is unable to repay the loan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, given the precarious position we find ourselves in in the digital asset world, one of the most important issues it removes is the ability for companies to lie and misrepresent their financial position. Further, and some would argue most importantly, it removes the need for a centralised entity.</p>
<p>Practically, RegDeFi would be applied in the following way:</p>
<p>If you take a loan out to purchase a house, it can be tokenized thereby making on-chain loans for previously off-chain assets possible. The house is now on-chain and linked to a digital identity. Real-world goods and traditional securities are also nominal and can therefore be traded on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lenders are now able to repossess assets linked to a borrower&rsquo;s identities, and in this way, DeFi can progress beyond the world of crypto and become RegDeFi.</p>
How will undercollateralized loans change DeFi?
<p>As it has been previously explained, undercollateralized loans have built the economy by allowing individuals, businesses, and industries to grow based on the promise of future returns. With Dusk Network&rsquo;s technology and regulatory compliance, this can be brought on-chain.</p>
<p>The potential is endless. Could we in the future buy an asset using $ETH as the deposit? How efficient and transparent will traditional financial institutions become? How many businesses will be built thanks to loans obtained via RegDeFi?&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, most importantly, how will borrowers act knowing that their loan is managed by a smart contract &ndash; automatically executed when certain conditions are met &ndash; and not by people who can be lied to and manipulated? Finally, there is a way to bridge the gap between on-chain and off-chain.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Uncollateralized loans have huge potential to be disrupted by DeFi. Dusk Network has the solution to bring fully regulated under collateralized loans on-chain.</p>
<p>Decentralised Finance (DeFi) continues to evolve, and we see more and more services, tools, and products coming into play to meet the needs of the DeFi community. AMMs, stablecoins, and collateralized loans are but a few examples of these, and each develops the DeFi ecosystem in such a way as to bring a traditional financial service on-chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenges of compliance/regulation remain in this space, the soon to be implemented MiCA regulation for one. Nevertheless, DeFi continues to grow, and evolve, and has become a crucial part of the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Undercollateralized loans are one of the latest concepts to be disrupted by the world of DeFi. It is a key feature of RegFi (Regulated Finance), but in the DeFi sphere, the discovery phase of how to run, deliver and maintain a viable undercollateralized lending market, is still being worked out.</p>
Orthogonal Trading and Its Undercollateralized Loan
<p>Recently it was discovered that Orthogonal Trading had an under collateralized loan from a pool managed by M11, and issued via Maple Finance&rsquo;s tooling. Maple Finance and M11 revealed that Orthogonal misrepresented the state of their finances after the FTX debacle, and like many, had a liquidity issue and therefore requested the loan. Since requesting the loan, the company has become insolvent.</p>
<p>The example of Orthogonal indicates that undercollateralized loans are something that DeFi needs to get right before it can become a realistic option for both on and off-chain finance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is imperative to understand that we cannot simply employ methods used in RegFi without adapting them to suit DeFi and its specific needs. The two differ vastly in terms of technology, ways of doing business, and products that are applicable in RegFi cannot simply be replicated in DeFi without tailoring them.</p>
<p>Undercollateralized loans play a role in DeFi and are necessary, and Dusk is one of the only, if not the only, protocols that can successfully introduce this into the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
Understanding Undercollateralized Loans and Why They Are Needed in DeFi
Collateralized Loans
<p>Before getting into the nuances of undercollateralized loans, their opposite, collateralized or sometimes over-collateralized loans, need to be explored. Overcollateralized loans are popular within DeFi and refer to a loan in which you put up your cryptocurrencies as collateral and can borrow against it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example is depositing $10,000 worth of $ETH, and then borrowing $9,000 worth of stablecoins against it. When the borrower repays their loan, they receive their $ETH back. Should a borrower not be able to repay their loan, or the value of the collateral put up falls below a certain threshold compared to what they have borrowed, the collateral is liquidated to repay the loan.</p>
<p>Collateralized loans have been a key in the development of DeFi. Offering loans on-chain is advantageous in that liquidations are executed on-chain by smart contracts, making them much more efficient and straightforward - if a borrower&rsquo;s position falls below 1, the position is liquidated.</p>
Undercollateralized Loans
<p>Undercollateralized loans are loans in which you do not put up the full amount of a loan as collateral before being able to borrow funds. A simple example of this is the mortgage industry. Individuals wanting to buy a house most often do not have the liquidity to pay for it in full and therefore turn to a bank for a loan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks review a prospective buyer&rsquo;s credit history and income and base their decision to award a loan on such data. Banks do however require a certain percentage as a deposit before lending the rest. Should a person fail to repay the loan, the bank would seize the house and sell it to recoup their money.</p>
<p>These types of loans allow the economy to grow by allowing individuals to secure financing. With secured financing, individuals can invest in assets that are expected to appreciate. Over and beyond that, using borrowed funds in many ways encourages economic activity and stimulates growth.</p>
<p>One of the key issues in crypto and DeFi now is that it&rsquo;s not easy to create value. Yes, we can convert fiat into crypto tokens, and we can move assets, swapping between them, but it is limited within the DeFi sandbox. For DeFi to provide a viable alternative to RegFi, it needs to develop and adapt its undercollateralized loan mechanisms instead of just relying on new money coming on-chain from fiat into crypto asset</p>
What went wrong with Orthogonal Trading?
<p>The company was insolvent but was able to misrepresent the state of its financials and take out a loan it was unable to repay. RegFi has many mechanisms in place to support undercollateralized loans such as banks and regulators that do credit checks, and despite these mechanisms, they can still get it wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Orthogonal Trading&rsquo;s case, their &ldquo;misrepresenting their financial position&rdquo; had led to a situation where the lending pool managed by M11 now faces irredeemable debt in which the burden of recouping that debt falls on the lender.</p>
<p>In RegFi, when money is lent to a borrower and the borrower cannot repay that debt, the burden falls on the lender. There are some actions you can take to recover your funds, but it may never happen. Lenders need to consider two externalities when deciding to lend money:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">an asset depreciating</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">a misevaluation or misrepresentation of the asset</li>
</ol>
<p>As the risk lies with lenders, many are conservative when deciding who to lend money to, making it difficult for businesses to access necessary financing, while those who can provide a clean credit history have easy access to liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overcollateralized, on-chain loans reverse this as borrowers must provide collateral in advance and if they are unable to repay the loan or the value of their collateral falls below the value of what they have borrowed, they are automatically liquidated. The risk in this case falls on the borrower and a smart contract will execute a liquidation automatically. Dusk firmly believes that we can have the best of both worlds &ndash; the growth-facilitating effects of RegFi uncollateralized loans but with the efficiency of smart contracts employed in overcollateralized loans.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum scaling solution, Polygon, will undergo a hard fork to its proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain to address gas spikes and chain reorganization. The proposed hard fork is set to take place on January 17. </p>
Fork Will Address Gas Fees and Reorgs
<p>Polygon, an Ethereum scaling project announced in a blog that it will undergo a software upgrade to address gas spikes and chain reorganizations (reorgs).</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">📢 GET READY FOR THE HARDFORK 🔥The proposed hardfork for the #Polygon PoS chain will make key upgrades to the network on Jan 17th. This is good news for devs &amp; users -- &amp; will make for better UX.You will NOT need to do anything differently. Details:https://t.co/RaBWDjEGrI pic.twitter.com/nipa15YQdZ</p>
&mdash; Polygon (@0xPolygon) January 12, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The first part of the hard fork will involve an adjustment of the blockchain sets gas fees. Gas fees are a sort of tax paid out to a blockchain so that one can transact on it. Polygon&rsquo;s goal with the fork is to reduce the spikes in gas prices that sometimes occur when there is a major activity on the chain. In a statement to CoinDesk, Polygon said addressed gas fees and said:</p>

<p>Although gas will still increase during peak demand, it will be more in line with the way Ethereum gas dynamics work now. The goal is to smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.</p>

<p>Polygon said that a reduction in gas fee spikes will be achieved by doubling the value of the &ldquo;BaseFeeChangeDenominator,&rdquo; which the company says will &ldquo;help smooth out the increase/decrease rate is baseFee for when the gas exceeds or falls below the target gas limits in a block.&rdquo; The project believes the modification will be successful as it backtested such changes &ldquo;against historical Polygon PoS mainnet data.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second proposed part of the hard fork will address reorgs, which can occur when a validator node &ndash; a computer operating the blockchain &ndash; receives information that can temporarily create a new version of the blockchain. Reorgs can occur due to network errors or malicious attacks. For as long as a reorg lasts, it can lead to lost or duplicate transactions.</p>
<p>Reorgs occur relatively frequently and to address this problem, Polygon wants to reduce the time it takes to finalize a block to verify a successful transaction, and to achieve this, the hard fork will reduce Polygon&rsquo;s &ldquo;sprint length&rdquo; from 64 to 16 blocks, meaning that a block producer can produce blocks for a much shorter time.</p>
MATIC Holders Will Not be Affected
<p>Hard forks differ from soft forks in that they are not backward-compatible and will require all node operators on the network to update the latest software at a specified time. Before the hard fork takes place, all Polygon node operators will have to upgrade their nodes before the set date to prepare for the update. Holders of the MATIC token, Polygon&rsquo;s native token, will not be affected and do not need to take any action. Decentralised applications such as Web3 games will also remain unaffected and need not take action.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The notorious North Korean-based Lazarus group has moved millions of dollars worth of Ethereum stolen from the Harmony hack over the weekend.</p>
<p>Harmony was attacked on the 22nd of June, 2022, with around $100 million stolen.&nbsp;</p>
Huge Amount Of Stolen Funds On The Move&nbsp;
<p>The notorious hacking collective, the Lazarus Group, has been busy moving millions worth of stolen ETH, capping a busy weekend for the notorious North Korean-backed group. Blockchain and crypto investigator ZachXBT posted details about the movement of the funds on Twitter, with the stolen assets originating from Tornado Cash and then going through Railgun. This smart contract privacy platform uses zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to ZachXBT&rsquo;s post, Lazarus Group moved around 41,000 ETH, worth around $63.5 million, through Railgun, before depositing them on different exchanges. ZachXBT traced the movements of the transactions across over 350 separate addresses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;North Korea&rsquo;s Lazarus Group had a very busy weekend moving $63.5m (~41000 ETH) from the Harmony bridge hack through Railgun before consolidating funds and depositing on three different exchanges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto analyst did not identify which exchanges were used to deposit the stolen funds but stated that the deposited funds were quickly withdrawn from them.&nbsp;</p>
The Harmony Attack&nbsp;
<p>The Lazarus Group has become quite well-versed in moving stolen crypto across platforms and preventing the authorities from tracking their movements. The group was linked with the Harmony Bridge attack, which took place in June 2022. A detailed report of the hack was published by Elliptic. The bridge was hacked for a staggering $100 million, and Elliptic used something called &ldquo;Tornado demixing capabilities,&rdquo; allowing it to trace the stolen funds from Tornado to other wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hackers were able to siphon off various assets from the bridge through eleven transactions, which were then sent to a wallet and swapped for ETH on Uniswap. The hack saw $100 million worth of assets stolen, including Frax (FRAX), Wrapped Ether (wETH), Aave (AAVE), SushiSwap (SUSHI)Frax Share (FXS), AAG (AAG), Binance USD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), Tether (USDT), Wrapped BTC (wBTC), and USD Coin (USDC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Harmony team stated that they are trying to recover the stolen funds, adding that they would not be pressing any criminal charges if the funds were returned, and offered a $1 million bounty. They also appealed to the hackers to share how the hack happened. So far, the team thinks hackers were able to access the funds through compromised private keys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We commit to a $1M bounty for the return of Horizon bridge funds, and sharing exploit information&hellip;Harmony will advocate for no criminal charges when funds are returned.&rdquo;</p>

A Growing Number Of Heists&nbsp;
<p>The North Korean-backed Lazarus Group has become known for several high-profile heists and has stolen over $2 billion through these heists. The group switched its focus to decentralized finance (DeFi) and cross-chain bridges and is also suspected of being behind the $600 million Ronin hack. The group also went after Japan-based crypto exchanges in October 2022, targeting them with a wave of phishing attacks.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are not worth the work and resources required to implement them, says former senior advisor to the Bank of England.</p>
<p>In a Financial Times article published today by Professor Tony Yates, several reasons were given why CBDCs were not the answer, at the same time as central banks around the world are pushing forward with exactly these same digital asset projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>China has already launched its central bank digital currency (CBDC) in several cities and even made it available for use during the Winter Olympics. Other central banks, including the Bank of England, are also considering the implementation of CBDCs.</p>
<p>However, the former professor of economics and senior adviser at the Bank of England argues that this is not a path that central banks should be going down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A CBDC is essentially the digital equivalent of cash, and almost every country already has an electronic version of their currency in the form of "electronic or central bank reserves". These reserves are digital entries in a central bank's ledger that are lent to or borrowed from retail banks, which serve individual customers.</p>
<p>By introducing CBDCs, central banks would be making these reserves more widely available to non-bank intermediaries, households, and companies, raising questions about who should have access to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some argue that CBDCs are the future, while others believe that central banks that don't implement them will lose out in global currency usage. However, the writer argues that these motivations are suspect, and that the race for a dominant global currency is already won by the dollar.</p>
<p>Additionally, the writer argues that CBDCs are not a good solution for addressing the threat of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. They argue that cryptocurrencies are not good candidates for money, as they don't have money supplies managed by humans to generate steady paths for inflation and are expensive and time-consuming to use in transactions. They can also be dealt with through laws and regulations, without the need for a new competitor asset from the central bank.</p>
<p>Some advocates argue that CBDCs can improve financial inclusion, but the writer argues that the most practical way of achieving this - contracting out to banks to provide app-based access - comes with familiar issues such as the need for an association with banks and IT literacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also argue that the most compelling arguments for CBDCs are about payments and settlement efficiency, but these arguments are not clear enough to justify the significant undertaking and resources required to build and maintain a new payments system.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while CBDCs may have some advantages, such as allowing for interest on accounts and sharpening the transmission of monetary policy into the economy, the writer argues that these advantages are not worth the significant undertaking and resources required to implement them.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 16th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>LBank Exchange, the digital asset trading platform, will list Qitmeer Network (MEER) on January 16, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the MEER/USDT trading pair will be officially available for trading at 10:00 UTC on January 16, 2023.</p>
<p>As a high-performance public blockchain powered by the MeerDAG consensus, Qitmeer is creating a decentralized network and a better society where anyone can contribute. The listing of its native token on LBank Exchange will further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p>Qitmeer Network is a public blockchain that supports Islamic finance, with a secure and stable underlying network using BlockDAG &nbsp;(Directed Acyclic Graph of blocks) for data structure. It also features an efficient Layer2 eco-application layer with pluggable virtual machine system driven by MeerDAG consensus. This provides open infrastructure services for Islamic finance, ethical finance, and socially responsible investment, with a focus on delivering financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Qitmeer Network&rsquo;s consensus protocol SPECTRE is a fast-confirmation and high-throughput BlockDAG that guarantees high performance in a payment network. Additionally, Qitmeer utilizes another high-throughput BlockDAG protocol, GhostDAG, for linear transaction ordering. This circumvents SPECTRE&rsquo;s weak liveness and provides an ordering service for a fair reward system.</p>
<p>Simply put, with MeerDAG consensus, Qitmeer has the ability to process transactions quickly, achieving high TPS with low transaction costs. Developers can enjoy these benefits by creating dApps using the MeerEVM, which provides a better user experience than other blockchain VMs..</p>
<p>A decentralized and large-scale full-node network keeps Qitmeer Network highly resilient and secures its ecosystem. To explore Qitmeer, any user can become a Qitmeer miner, taking real control of the accounting and earning system rewards in BlockDAG collaboration mode. This will enable them to verify all blocks and transactions to ensure they comply with consensus rules, thus protecting ecosystem security. Having a complete Qitmeer ledger allows for faster querying and enables companies to parse specific data on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The listing of MEER on LBank Exchange marks another step towards Qitmeer&rsquo;s goal of creating an inclusive financial system that works for everyone.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, has announced that he will be investing in a new crypto firm founded by the former president of FTX US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new crypto software company will allow traders to create algorithmic strategies and access different markets.&nbsp;</p>
A Sizable Investment&nbsp;
<p>The SkyBridge Capital founder has outlined his intention of investing in a new firm founded by ex-FTX US. President Brett Harrison. According to reports, Scaramucci plans to invest his own personal funds into the project to support the new venture, which was announced just weeks after the collapse of FTX. Scaramucci stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anthony has been a true mentor and friend to me since I joined the crypto industry two years ago. I&rsquo;m honored to have him as an investment partner and know his guidance will be invaluable as I begin this new chapter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the amount of investment made by Scaramucci, and any stake received, has yet to be disclosed. Harrison had been looking for investors to invest in his new crypto software company as he looked to raise $10 million for a $100 million valuation.&nbsp;</p>
A New Crypto Software Company&nbsp;
<p>Harrison&rsquo;s new venture was announced barely weeks after the collapse of FTX. However, he had hinted about it on the 27th of September when he announced he was stepping down from his role as the president of FTX US. Harrison had stated that while he was resigning as the president of the exchange, he would remain in an advisory role for the next few months. He also stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait to share more about what I&rsquo;m doing next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The new company, which does not have a name as yet, will offer crypto traders the ability to create algorithmic-based strategies and access centralized and decentralized markets. In a Twitter thread talking about his time at FTX, and the concerns around FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s mental health and addiction, he thanked the new partners, stating he was looking forward to working with Scaramucci.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely honored to have them as partners. The path ahead of me is clear now, and I&rsquo;m excited to move forward together with them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In response, Scaramucci stated he was proud to invest in his new firm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brett, I am proud to be an investor in your new company. Go forward. Don&rsquo;t look back. Wishing you the best.&rdquo;</p>

Looking Back At FTX&nbsp;
<p>In a Twitter thread, Harrison looked back at his time at FTX and revealed why he decided to leave the firm. Harrison stated that he left the firm after his relationship with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried deteriorated, after which he decided to focus on the future and on his own company. Responding to Harrison&rsquo;s series of tweets, Bankman-Fried stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I strongly disagree with much of what he said, I have no desire to get into a public argument with him, nor do I feel like it&rsquo;s my place to litigate his job performance in public unless he were to authorize me to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further went on to add that he felt bad about what happened at FTX and to its employees and wished Harrison the best.</p>
Scaramucci Bullish On Crypto Recovery&nbsp;
<p>Scaramucci is quite bullish on the prospects of a recovery of the crypto markets, describing 2023 as a &ldquo;recovery year&rdquo; for the market. He stated in an interview that he believed Bitcoin (BTC) could rebound back to the $50,000 to $100,000 levels over the next two to three years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are taking on risk but you&rsquo;re also believing in [Bitcoin] adoption. So if we get the adoption right, and I believe we will, this could easily be a fifty to one hundred thousand dollar asset over the next two to three years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He also revealed that SkyBridge could buy back the 30% stake FTX had purchased in the company before going bankrupt. However, given the ongoing situation, he admitted it could take a few months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re waiting for the clearance from the bankruptcy people, the lawyers, and the investment bankers to figure out exactly what we&rsquo;re going to be buying back and when.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto and NFT-influencer NFT God has lost all of his digital assets, described as a &ldquo;life-changing amount,&rdquo; after falling victim to a hack on the 14th of January.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NFT God claims the assets were lost thanks to a sponsored advertisement link that contained malware.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
A &ldquo;Life Changing Amount&rdquo; Lost&nbsp;
<p>An NFT influencer named NFT God claimed that they lost all of their digital assets and NFTs in a hack on the 14th of January. According to the pseudo-anonymous influencer, they lost the NFTs after accidentally downloading malicious software, which they found through a Google Ads search result. NFT God posted a series of tweets describing how his assets came under attack, which included his crypto wallet, which came under attack, along with multiple online accounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Last night, my entire digital livelihood was violated. Every account connected to me, both personally and professionally, was hacked and used to hurt others. Less importantly, I lost a life-changing amount of my net worth.&rdquo;</p>

A Sponsored Malware Link?&nbsp;
<p>According to NFT God&rsquo;s version of events, they were using Google&rsquo;s search engine to download an open-source video streaming software, OBS. However, instead of clicking the link for the original website, he ended up clicking on the sponsored advertisement, thinking it would be the same thing. The NFT influencer only realized their folly after a few hours, after several phishing tweets appeared on two Twitter accounts operated by them, and discovered that the sponsored link had led to malware being downloaded, along with the software.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Wallet Compromised&nbsp;
<p>Following this discovery, a message from an acquaintance led to the discovery that hackers also had access to his crypto wallet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I quickly delete the scam tweets the hackers posted. Caught it 2 minutes after the links went live. Phew. If only that were the last chapter of this story. Unfortunately, it was just the first. Then I get the DM I&rsquo;ve been dreading. &ldquo;Dude, you WETH&rsquo;d your ape?&rdquo; I pop open the Opensea bookmark of my ape, and there it is. A completely different wallet is listed as the owner. I knew at that moment it was all gone. Everything. All my crypto and NFTs ripped from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The following day, the hackers managed to gain access to NFT God&rsquo;s Substack account and sent out phishing emails to over 16,000 subscribers, eroding what he described as years of trust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hackers were sending emails from my Substack to my 16,000 subscribers. The hackers sent 2 emails to my 16,000 closest fans with hacked links. Trust I&rsquo;ve worked over a year to build was gone. Losing a chunk of my net worth is nothing compared to losing the trust of my community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the available data, 19 ETH, a Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT with a floor price of 16 ETH, and a host of other NFTs were siphoned off from the compromised wallet. After stealing the funds, the hacker moved the ETH through multiple wallets, after which they were sent to the FixedFloat decentralized exchange and were swapped for other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
A Critical Mistake&nbsp;
<p>NFT God stated that he made a crucial mistake while setting up their hardware wallet, setting it up as a hot wallet by entering the seed phrase &ldquo;in a way that no longer kept it cold,&rdquo; enabling hackers to access their NFTs and assets with ease. However, since he had no plans to purchase any NFTs soon, he put off purchasing another cold wallet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not buying a new cold wallet immediately was a deadly mistake. But even with a cold wallet, my entire digital world would still be destroyed. Digital security isn&rsquo;t just buying a cold wallet. It&rsquo;s also being careful with EVERYTHING you do on the internet. Everything.&rdquo;</p>

Malware On Google Ads&nbsp;
<p>The crypto community has long been trying to bring attention to the problem of malware targetting crypto in Google Ads. A report published by cybersecurity firm Cyble outlined the threat posed by an information-stealing malware, Rhadamanthys Stealer, spreading through Google Ads. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has also highlighted the threat from Google search results, which he stated were promoting phishing and scamming websites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hackers were sending emails from my Substack to my 16,000 subscribers. The hackers sent 2 emails to my 16,000 closest fans with hacked links. Trust I&rsquo;ve worked over a year to build was gone. Losing a chunk of my net worth is nothing compared to losing the trust of my community.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the available data, 19 ETH, a Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT with a floor price of 16 ETH, and a host of other NFTs were siphoned off from the compromised wallet. After stealing the funds, the hacker moved the ETH through multiple wallets, after which they were sent to the FixedFloat decentralized exchange and were swapped for other cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
A Critical Mistake&nbsp;
<p>NFT God stated that he made a crucial mistake while setting up their hardware wallet, setting it up as a hot wallet by entering the seed phrase &ldquo;in a way that no longer kept it cold,&rdquo; enabling hackers to access their NFTs and assets with ease. However, since he had no plans to purchase any NFTs soon, he put off purchasing another cold wallet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not buying a new cold wallet immediately was a deadly mistake. But even with a cold wallet, my entire digital world would still be destroyed. Digital security isn&rsquo;t just buying a cold wallet. It&rsquo;s also being careful with EVERYTHING you do on the internet. Everything.&rdquo;</p>

Malware On Google Ads&nbsp;
<p>The crypto community has long been trying to bring attention to the problem of malware targetting crypto in Google Ads. A report published by cybersecurity firm Cyble outlined the threat posed by an information-stealing malware, Rhadamanthys Stealer, spreading through Google Ads. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has also highlighted the threat from Google search results, which he stated were promoting phishing and scamming websites.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>India&rsquo;s regulators have yet again made their opinions on crypto known. The latest to reiterate the country&rsquo;s position on crypto is the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, who has called for a complete ban. </p>
<p>The Governor of the RBI, Shaktikanta Das, while addressing the Business Today Banking and Economy Summit on Friday, again made the central bank&rsquo;s stance on cryptocurrencies clear, reiterating the significance of banning the industry. Das described the crypto trade as &ldquo;nothing but gambling&rdquo; adding that the definition of crypto remains &ldquo;very unclear.&rdquo; Das went as far as to say their perceived &ldquo;value is nothing but make-believe.&rdquo; The Governor used very dismissive language while describing cryptocurrencies and argued that there is no valid reason to acknowledge crypto as an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;financial product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Das also asserted:</p>

<p>Since we don&rsquo;t allow gambling in our country, and if you want to allow gambling, treat it as gambling and lay down the rules for gambling. But crypto is not a financial product.</p>

<p>The Governor warned that legalizing cryptocurrencies would lead to more dollarization of the economy adding that crypto masquerading as a financial asset is a misplaced argument. Das also referred to the risk that could see the RBI lose control over the country&rsquo;s money supply. The substantiate this argument he mentioned the fact that &ldquo;20 percent of transactions are happening through crypto,&rdquo; none of which are authorized or regulated by the central bank. Governor Das further made reference to the age-old argument against cryptocurrencies &ndash; their price volatility, noting:</p>

<p>The volatility in prices is based on the make-believe concept where a particular crypto&rsquo;s price can go up or down. So, anything that comes without any underline whose valuations is entirely dependent on make-believe is just 100 percent speculation or it can be bluntly termed as gambling.</p>

<p>The Governor also recently made a bold statement saying that cryptocurrencies should be banned, and if allowed to grow, might cause the next financial crisis.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that 2022 has been an action-packed year for the blockchain market, one that witnessed a wide range of developments associated with public as well as permissioned systems. To this point, the year gone by saw enterprise blockchains being adopted on a wider scale, with many reputable companies harnessing their benefits over tried and tested, conventional solutions. Not only that, the recent slew of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) collapses ushered in notable improvements within the blockchain analytics sector as well as the tracking of everyday transactions.&nbsp;</p>
A quick recap of 2022
<p>As per reports, the total volume of investment having entered the enterprise blockchain ecosystem continued to grow in 2022, with the metric likely to hit the $16 billion mark by the end of this year. To this point, it should be noted that a whopping 77% of the world&rsquo;s top 100 firms &mdash; including Microsoft, Visa, Nestle &mdash; have started incorporating blockchain solutions into their day-to-day operations, with some even utilizing multiple enterprise blockchains for facilitating separate processes.</p>
<p>Similarly, when it comes to public blockchains, their utility and general scope of operations grew exponentially. For example, the idea of sustainable blockchains garnered an increasing amount of mainstream traction last year, especially with green investing and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives growing in importance among today&rsquo;s investors over the last few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the tokenization of real estate assets and the idea of Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) &mdash; an independent audit facilitated by a third party to ensure that a custodian holds the assets it claims to &mdash; also gained a lot of popularity last year.</p>
What does 2023 promise?
<p>From the outside looking in, the future will likely encompass a variety of blockchains interfacing with one another, birthing new use cases that lie outside the realm of their current capabilities individually. To elaborate, the creation of a hybrid multi-chain ecosystem can allow centralized and decentralized applications to expand into untapped niches of the global financial system, thereby relegating the idea of &lsquo;one type of blockchain dominating the market&rsquo; to the background completely.</p>
<p>Moreover, while the recent dissolution of prominent crypto entities &mdash; such as Celcius, Vauld, Voyager Digital, etc &mdash; has greatly reduced investor confidence in the blockchain industry, the coming year will likely see companies beginning to incorporate better transparency tools within their existing governance frameworks. In this regard, ParallelChain Lab, a blockchain technology company, recently organized the International Symposium of Blockchain Advancements 2022 (ISBA) &mdash; a two-day event bringing together industry experts and investors from around the world &mdash; to discuss the future of Web3 and blockchain tech.</p>
<p>With the issue of transparency fast gaining traction within the crypto world, projects like ParallelChain are amalgamating the benefits put forth by blockchain tech and data sciences to help forge a truly decentralized future. The project provides users with complete control over their private information while creating a feedback loop in which the blockchain creates and handles data while the data science models perform the required analysis to accrue meaningful insights while empowering users to make well-informed business decisions.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Web3-enabled tools continue to seep into today&rsquo;s daily societal interactions, it appears as though the future of blockchain will continue to play a crucial role in driving new tech innovations while paving ground-breaking use cases within a plethora of industries. Alice Lim, a distinguished engineer associated with the development of ParallelChain Mainnet, believes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;[In the not so distant future] more dApp developers will realize the performance and cost benefits of building on an L2 (or generally outside a busy mainnet) and start coming up with creative new blockchain applications that were not economically viable before.&rdquo;</p>
The future of blockchain tech looks bright.
<p>As people across the globe gravitate toward the use of blockchain-enabled systems, it stands to reason that the technology will become increasingly more robust, thus maximizing its adoption potential. Also, as these platforms evolve, they can help the blockchain sector become more immune to various extenuating factors, such as fluctuations experienced by the crypto market on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, with blockchain tech starting to strengthen its foothold over the digital infrastructure powering the global digital economy, experts believe that its use cases will grow, expanding far beyond the realm of simple finance and payments. Thus, it will be interesting to see how this space continues to evolve from here on out.</p>
