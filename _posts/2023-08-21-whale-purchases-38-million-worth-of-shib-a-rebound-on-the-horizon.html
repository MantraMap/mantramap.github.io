Shiba Inu (SHIB) token has witnessed high-value transactions again, leading to intrigue among its community. As significant amounts of SHIB change hands, many wonder if these moves signal a forthcoming positive shift in its market position or a rebound, as the asset is currently in a downtrend. Whale Alert, a renowned blockchain tracking platform, disclosed that aÂ transaction of 4.65 trillion SHIB tokens, equating to approximately $38.39 million, moved from Bitvavo to an unidentified wallet. ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ 4,653,778,173,637 #SHIB (38,391,343 USD) transferred from #Bitvavo to unknown wallethttps://t.co/KFZzJIvU5q â€” Whale Alert (@whale_alert) August 21, 2023 High-Value Transactions Coincide With Shibariumâ€™s Developments It&#8217;s worth noting that this isnâ€™t an isolated event.

SHIB Rebound On The Horizon? While it&#8217;s undeniable that there may be growing attention on Shiba Inu, especially after these whale activities and the Shibarium blockchain&#8217;s developments. It may be too soon to forecast the exact trajectory SHIB will take. However,Â analyzing the Shiba Inu price chart suggests there could be a potential rebound, though it might not be imminent. On the 4-hour chart, Shiba Inu displays a pronounced downward wick. This indicates the presence of more liquidity in this downside range, which could suggest further decline as market makers may seek to capture this liquidity. To clarify, a wick refers to the thin line/vertical line above or below the main body of a candlestick. The wick represents an asset&#8217;s highest and lowest prices during a specific time frame, such as the candle marked above.
