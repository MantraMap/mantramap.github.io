Bitcoin, the king of cryptocurrencies, has been crossing multiple crucial resistances since the start of the year. According to CoinGecko, the coin is now up 14% in the weekly timeframe, and trading at $23,008, making BTC break through the $22,000 and $23,000 resistance levels that have limited the crypto&#8217;s ascent.  This year witnessed a complete U-turn in investor sentiment on cryptocurrencies as both Ethereum and Bitcoin reaped massive gains, along with the other top altcoins. This led to the entire crypto market to experience a resurgence in almost all aspects. At the time of writing, the current market cap of the entire cryptocurrency market is at $1.05 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap.  Related Reading: What Is SingularityNET And Why Is Its AGIX Token Exploding By 116%?
