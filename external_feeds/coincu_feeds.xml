<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SlowMist founder believes that there is a risk of private keys being cracked for wallets that are extended using the Trust Wallet browser and created between November 14 and 23 last year.</em></li>



<li><em>The underlying reason was that the MT19937 pseudo-random number generator used by the Trust Wallet browser extension at that time did not provide enough randomness.</em></li>



<li><em>Trust Wallet disclosed this risk, but fortunately, the loss was slight.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The underlying reason was that the MT19937 pseudo-random number generator used by the Trust Wallet browser extension at that time did not provide enough randomness so that the private key could be cracked. Trust Wallet has disclosed this risk, but fortunately, the loss is slight.</p>



<p>This Wallet claims that after the incident, it quickly patched the vulnerability, and all addresses created after these days are safe. However, Trust Wallet still discovered two attacks that cost about $170,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/10 Trust Wallet is built on security &amp; trust. So we&#39;re sharing a vulnerability affecting new addresses created Nov 14-23,22 using the Browser Extension.<br><br>The issue is fixed. Most at-risk funds are secured. Affected users should take actions outlined:<br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/27a1.png" alt="➡" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/X9AEfqWW87" target="_blank">https://t.co/X9AEfqWW87</a></p>&mdash; Trust Wallet (@TrustWallet) <a href="https://twitter.com/TrustWallet/status/1649699428733947906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Over the past months, the wallet platform has actively pushed 1-to-1 notifications to affected addresses, resulting in significant transfers to secure addresses with strong momentum up until recently.</p>



<p>In response, Trust Wallet will cover eligible losses from the hack due to the vulnerability and has created a compensation process for affected users. The total current remaining balance of the affected addresses is approximately $88,000.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Despite our best efforts to minimize loss, we proactively identified two likely exploits with a total loss of $170K. To do right to users, we created a reimbursement process for affected users to make them whole.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The latest versions of Trust Wallet mobile apps and Browser Extensions remain safe and secure to use. It urges affected users to transfer funds as soon as possible. Avoid using addresses provided by others.</p>



<p>If you see a message from the wallet platform, you should create a new wallet address, immediately transfer your assets, and stop using vulnerable addresses. Do not use wallet addresses you did not make to avoid being taken advantage of by scammers.</p>

<p>When Youssef and his co-founders reached an impasse on the company&#8217;s direction, the parties agreed that Srinivas Raju of the law firm Richards, Layton &amp; Finger (designated by court order) would act as the Paxful supervisor throughout the process, was reported. As a supervisor, Srinivas has full power and control over the company, its operations, and management. They will work to stabilize the company while preparing to make recommendations to the court on how to conduct business.</p>



<p>According to Youssef, he set up to commit 99.9% of his shares to the Public Trust and says that the money generated by his stake will be used to help every Paxful user become well-rounded.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I will put 99.9% of my personal shares in Paxful, which accounts for over 45% of the company, into a public trust.

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627-1024x576.png" alt="Pear Protocol Review: New Pairs Trading Platform On Layer 2 Arbitrum" class="wp-image-183223" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1627.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Pear Protocol Review: New Pairs Trading Platform On Layer 2 Arbitrum 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Pear Protocol is an on-chain spread trading platform launched on Ethereum layer-2 <a href="https://news.coincu.com/176860-treasure-dao-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a>. It allows users to create leveraged long and short positions on different assets using the concept of pair trading.</p>



<p>According to information in the Medium article about the project, the founder of the project is the former founder of Reimagined Finance and ReFi Pro. Reimagined Finance is an on-chain active asset management project. Users can deposit stable monetary assets and earn income through the investment plan set forth by the project.</p>



<p>On-chain spread trading platform Pear Protocol has secured $1.25 million in its seed investment round, allowing users to create leveraged buy and sell positions on various assets.</p>



<p>It is backed by investors from Flow Ventures, RNR Capital, Portico Ventures, and JY Capital, among others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is pair trading?</h2>



<p>Pairs trading refers to a market-neutral investment strategy recommended by an analytical team founded by Nunzio Tartaglia, a trader at the Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley in the mid-1980s, whose members are mainly physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists. The strategy tracks the performance of two historically correlated securities. When the correlation between two guards temporarily weakens, i.e., one stock goes up while the other falls in price, a currency pair trade will short the good-performing stock and buy the underperforming stock efficiently, thinking that both &#8220;differences&#8221; between them will eventually converge.</p>



<p>Pairs trading is a well-established trading style in traditional markets. It is seen as an attractive and popular way of trading for retailers and institutions, but we see it a little more in cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Currently, it is highly capital inefficient, difficult to reconcile and report, inconvenient to perform on CEX, and challenging to set up on-chain. Despite innovative liquidity models and robust architecture, DEX volume per DEX represents less than 2% of total crypto futures trading volume. While current protocols are sufficient for basic trading needs, there is an underserved area of the market, so the opportunity on-chain is enormous and with primitive trading like Pear coming soon. market.</p>



<p>According to the developers, daily futures trading volume typically exceeds $50 billion on CEX and $1.5 billion on DEX. The annual fee collected by the DEX alone exceeds $1 billion! They anticipate the CEX to DEX migration to continue, with a convincing opportunity for Pear to capture both existing and new market share.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How Pear Protocol works</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1628.png"><img decoding="async" width="795" height="535" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1628.png" alt="Pear Protocol Review: New Pairs Trading Platform On Layer 2 Arbitrum" class="wp-image-183224" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1628.png 795w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1628-300x202.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1628-768x517.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1628-750x505.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" title="Pear Protocol Review: New Pairs Trading Platform On Layer 2 Arbitrum 10"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Pear establishes the need to trade in pairs. Users will be able to use USDC as collateral, set up long/short leverage pairs with just a few clicks and execute trades in a single trade. The positions on the platform are represented as ERC-721 (NFT token receipt).</p>



<p>According to Pear Protocol, it will not build an independent liquidity pool but will use the liquidity of the existing derivatives platform on Arbitrum, and Pear Protocol only serves as a hybrid product for users. Users can choose to margin and short Ethereum while buying Bitcoin, while Pear will simultaneously open long and short positions in other derivative protocols.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Outstanding Features</h2>



<p>Liquidity Agnostic is one of the key differentiators. This allows the platform to build on liquidity from several leading on-chain sources, ensuring users don&#8217;t have to worry about finding the best pairs to trade. They can instead focus on making informed decisions while Pear Protocol takes care of routing trades to the best sources of liquidity available.</p>



<p>The Pear Trading Engine is designed to manage trades efficiently, from opening to closing positions. The platform utilizes an ERC-721 tokenized position, allowing users to view open positions, visualize their current PnL, and seamlessly move their position to another wallet. This approach paves the way for exciting lending, borrowing, secondary market trading, and derivative products opportunities.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="507" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629-1024x507.png" alt="Pear Protocol Review: New Pairs Trading Platform On Layer 2 Arbitrum" class="wp-image-183225" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629-1024x507.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629-300x149.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629-768x381.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629-750x372.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1629.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Pear Protocol Review: New Pairs Trading Platform On Layer 2 Arbitrum 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Pear Protocol&#8217;s innovative ERC-721 encryption slots represent a significant step forward in the DeFi landscape. By issuing NFTs for each trading position, users can easily visualize their open positions and monitor their PnL in real time, managing their portfolio correctly. The inherent composability of the ERC-721 token opens up many possibilities, including lending and borrowing.</p>



<p>Additionally, Pear NFTs can be listed and traded on secondary markets like DEXs and NFT marketplaces, enabling users to buy and sell open positions without directly interacting with the underlying strategy. This fosters greater liquidity, price discovery, and risk management.</p>



<p>Furthermore, tokenized positions open the door for developers to create innovative derivative products, such as index tokens, leveraged tokens, and inverse tokens, as well as leverage emerging NFT perp and options products from platforms like NFTperp, Hook Protocol, and Wasabi Protocol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">In case of used</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DAO Treasury and Portfolio Manager</strong></h3>



<p>DAO treasury funds in excess of $13.4 billion are a lot of on-chain capital that needs to be actively managed. Feedback from other DAOs about a platform like Pear has been overwhelmingly positive. Active on-chain portfolio managers find value in a single store for leveraged arbitrage. Argument trading, hedging, nuanced risk exposure, and market neutrality are all powered by the pairs trading architecture.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Narrative Trading</strong></h3>



<p>Narrative-based transactions are a penny in the crypto market. Cryptocurrency trading focuses on fast-forming stories &#8211; and often more than one story. The trading communities investigated by the project have spoken to are very interested in a platform that prioritizes the convenience of narrative-based trading.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<ul>
<li>May 2022: $LUNA token price drop as a result of 3AC/Terralabs</li>



<li>November 2022: $FTT token price drops due to the collapse of FTX</li>



<li>November 2022: Token prices of centralized exchanges decrease due to FUD of their proof of reserve following the FTX crash (e.g., Kucoin, Huobi, Bybit, etc.)</li>



<li>January 2023: Token price hike of AI projects due to massive growth in AI narrative</li>



<li>February 2023: Most recent FUD-induced BNB token volatility on Binance operations and reserves</li>



<li>February 2023: Token prices of ZK rollup projects increase due to the growth of ZK rollup narrative</li>



<li>Ongoing Stories: Flippening (ETH vs BTC), Liquid Bet Derivatives (LSD), and growing benchmark yield dialogue</li>
</ul>



<p>Dozens of micro-stories emerge between these. Pairs trading will complement these narratives nicely &#8211; and fortunately, Pear will soon hit the market to allow for sophisticated (and degenerate) speculation on the next wave of stories.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Token Distribution &amp; Emission</h2>



<p>The $PEAR token distribution is designed with fairness and long-term sustainability in mind. Out of the total hard-capped supply of 1 billion tokens, 20% (200 million tokens) are allocated to private and public sale participants. Thus far, 84 million tokens have been assigned to the private sale, with the remaining 116 million to be sold during the public sale at $0.025 per token.</p>



<p>The remaining token distribution is allocated to the Pear Treasury, Liquidity Pool, Team &amp; Development, Trading Incentives/Emissions, and the $REFI Community.</p>



<p>As for the emission schedule, public sale tokens have a 1-year cliff followed by a 1-year linear daily vesting schedule after the Token Generation Event (TGE). This means that 50% of the tokens will be fully unlocked at the first-year mark, with the remaining 50% linearly vested throughout the second year, ensuring a stable token supply and promoting long-term growth.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Public Token Sale</h2>



<p>Pear Protocol is gearing up for an exciting public token sale, with plans to raise up to $2.9 million in funding. The sale will take place on the Arbitrum Network and is set to begin at 12:00 UTC on Friday, April 14th. The public sale token price is fixed at $0.025 per $PEAR token, and the sale will last for ten days, ending on Monday, April 24th.</p>

<p>Participating in the public sale is simple. Prospective investors can use a variety of wallets, including Metamask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, and any Wallet Connect integration. There is no minimum investment amount, making it accessible for everyone, but the maximum investment per wallet is capped at $100,000 USDC.</p>



<p>The $PEAR token will play a pivotal role in the Pear Protocol ecosystem. Token holders who stake $PEAR will receive benefits in the form of USDC yield and fee rebates or reductions. Additionally, token holders will be able to participate in governance decisions, ensuring the platform remains community-driven and responsive to user needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>By revolutionizing pair-to-pair trading and leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Pear Protocol has the potential to create a truly user-friendly and accessible trading platform for everyone. As the Pear Protocol team continues to innovate and build on their platform, the upcoming public token sale offers a unique opportunity for investors to support and participate in the project.</p>



<p>Pear Protocol also says it will roll out more protocol updates in the months leading up to the launch. Tokenomics, our timeline, combined efforts, and roadmap will be detailed in due course.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fears about a probable fall in the NFT market had grown when the BAYC floor price went below 50 ETH.</em></li>



<li><em>This was the highest level reached by the collection since November 2021.</em></li>



<li><em>After a breakthrough year in 2021, blue chip collections are showing a diminishing attraction.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The floor price of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection has dropped to a 16-month low of 44.5 Ether (ETH).</strong></h5>

<p>In an unexpected turn of events, the floor prices of numerous blue-chip NFTs fell below their value for the first time in over a year. For the first time since November 2021, the floor price of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/170137-bayc-floor-price-goerli-reached-45-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BAYC</a> has gone below 50 ETH, raising worries among NFT investors.</p>



<p>The decrease has raised concerns about the market&#8217;s long-term viability for a collection whose floor price peaked at more than 144 ETH. While some experts remain positive about the future, a major pullback like this may be unfavorable for short-term traders.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/bored-ape-yacht-club" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT Price Floor</a>, the BAYC floor price on April 22 was 44.5 ETH and is presently trading at 49.4 ETH.</p>

<p>This indicates that the number of dealers interested in purchasing a portion of the collection has declined. As a result, it has had a negative impact on the market cap.</p>



<p>Not only BAYC but also Wrapped CryptoPunks and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) have lost more than 10% of their value in the last week. NFT prices have fallen due to a variety of causes, including decreased demand, greater supply, and the influence of crypto market swings.</p>



<p>Trading volume across marketplaces has also decreased significantly, and despite Blur and Opensea keeping the NFT industry alive, the total weekly trading volume has been less than $300 million. The biggest reason for falling floor pricing is undoubtedly diminishing demand, as dealers&#8217; weekly presence has decreased to November 2021 lows.</p>

<p>NFTs gained traction around the end of 2021, and by 2022, they were the most popular in the DeFi market. Nevertheless, investors started to lose interest after the Q2 2022 crypto market contagion and subsequent collapses.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Users may now do a variety of Bitcoin activities using Telegram&#8217;s web interface.</em></li>



<li><em>They use Bitcoin to buy, sell, trade, and perform peer-to-peer transactions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Telegram users who use the wallet bot were told today of a new feature that allows anybody to buy, withdraw, trade, and perform P2P transactions using Bitcoin (BTC).</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1624.png"><img decoding="async" width="750" height="394" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1624.png" alt="Telegram Now Allowing Users to Buy, Sell and Exchange Bitcoin From April 21" class="wp-image-183213" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1624.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1624-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="Telegram Now Allowing Users To Exchange Bitcoin From April 21 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to a recent message, users may now do various Bitcoin activities through Telegram&#8217;s web interface, while an app-based upgrade is in the works. This step builds on the existing popular crypto services that are now offered via the chat software. Significantly, according to the announcement:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Bitcoin is now available on the @wallet web interface, along with a new instant exchange. You can now buy, withdraw, exchange, and make P2P transactions with BTC directly through our updated web interface. It is now possible to buy Bitcoin using a bank card or the P2P market in the “Buy &amp; Sell” section of our user-friendly interface.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is worth noting, however, that the Wallet bot and its accompanying services, which enable these functionalities, were built by a third party rather than Telegram itself.</p>



<p>Third-party developers use Telegram&#8217;s open bot API to construct the Wallet bot and related services. This implies that anybody may use the API to create their own cryptocurrency-related bot with no participation from the app.</p>

<p>According to the latest notification from the @wallet account on April 21, users of the @wallet online interface may now access purchase, withdraw, trade, and perform peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions in Bitcoin directly via Telegram&#8217;s web interface.</p>



<p>The announcement also informed users that the platform&#8217;s &#8220;Exchange&#8221; had been updated, allowing them to instantly exchange Bitcoin, Tether (USDT), and Telegram Open Network (TON) with one another.</p>



<p>Telegram is generally acknowledged as a supporter of digital assets and has recently worked to expand its footprint in the cryptocurrency market. Its recent move to introduce peer-to-peer trading for Bitcoin and widen the scope of cryptocurrencies is a significant step forward in the company&#8217;s aspirations to become a prominent player in the rapidly evolving field of DeFi. As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/175669-usdt-conversation-telegram-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Telegram users may transmit USDT to one other through conversation from March 22.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Cyptonauts Collection,&#8217; created by concept artist Bruce Zick, will serve as the foundation for Mandala&#8217;s foray into the Metaverse.</p>

<p>Mandala Metaverse is a multi-chain, multi-media series that combines NFTs with a AAA Unreal Engine MMO RPG and a location-based AR mobile game. Kevin J Foxe, widely known for his work on the legendary horror film The Blair Witch Project in 1999, is participating in the project, which combines television, comic books, and gaming.</p>



<p>It creates the first Enlightenment Simulator in the world, powered by SingularityNet&#8217;s decentralized AGI and compatible with SingularityNet&#8217;s metaverse, Sophiaverse.</p>



<p>Mandala itself provides an interoperable, cross-platform, cross-chain Metaverse that includes TV, comic novels, gaming, and cutting-edge augmented reality. The project is built on the multi-stack Polkadot architecture, which enables it to integrate a variety of its parachains, such as the Astar, Unique, and Talisman networks. Mandala will deploy its perfectly crafted Cryptonauts NFTs over the Astar Network.</p>

<p>The project&#8217;s goal is to create a visually spectacular &#8216;enlightenment&#8217; cosmos using the Unreal Engine to provide a AAA gaming experience. This, in turn, will work in interoperable harmony with SingularityNet&#8217;s Sophiaverse, creating an extraordinary new experience that is much better than the sum of its parts.</p>



<p>Mandala CEO Jon Shanker stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Polkadot has real future-proof NFT applications, such as nesting, staking and the ability to send NFTs over bridges &#8211; plus many other innovative ways to use NFT assets.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Mandala now has access to a number of Polkadot parachains, which are autonomous blockchains linked to the Relay Chain. These parachains provide increased security, scalability, and cooperation with other projects due to Polkadot&#8217;s greater interoperability.</p>

<p>GOMBLE will release its first Game, RumbyStars, as a soft launch on mobile devices in Southeast Asian markets in Q2 2023. It then plans to expand to North America, South America, East Asia, and Europe. Additionally, GOMBLE will work to continue building RumbyWorld, the social infrastructure and GaaS platform that allows existing NFT and GameFi projects to join RumbyStars and create custom games and NFTs.</p>



<p>According to the official introduction, Rumby Stars, a level 3A social game released by GOMBLE, mainly solves the following problems faced by current Web3 games:</p>



<ul>
<li>Many games require users to purchase NFTs to play, creating high barriers to entry and making it difficult for some users to join.</li>



<li class="has-small-font-size">Some games are challenging to play, making it nearly impossible to enjoy with friends and frustrating casual players.</li>



<li>It can take a very long time to reach a high level in some games, causing users to lose interest and stop playing.</li>



<li>Players who already have the best items and equipment can find it challenging to compete, creating an uneven playing field for new users.</li>



<li>These combined issues make it difficult for users to engage in web3 games and enjoy the experience fully.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game&#8217;s goal is to create a game that removes the high barrier to entry caused by pay-to-play and pay-to-win models while providing an immersive and engaging gaming experience for both players.</p>



<p>In light of the above, Rumby Stars aims to create a casual game that is suitable for all ages and skill levels while reducing the high thresholds brought by paid games and, at the same time, giving it to players &#8211; Web3&#8217;s popular obstacle-breaking and role-playing gameplay experience.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Unlike existing blockchain games that focus on core games, GOMBLE aims to target the global market with easy and fun casual games that even non-gamers can enjoy. Starting with RumbyStars, GOMBLE is focused on building to provide users around the world with a pleasant experience and a greater diversity of games in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rumbies come from five different planets, are real troubles in the galaxy, and look like everyday objects like cans, glasses, or bottles. If you happen to come across them, be careful, as they may be hiding their true form. Although Rumbies come in many different shapes, their basic abilities are the same.</p>



<p>You can challenge yourself to be the champion with just your skills. However, since this is a team game, you can have more chances to win when playing with friends and teaming up using voice chat.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Game Modes</strong></h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="197" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1614-1024x197.png" alt="Rumby Stars New Generation Blockchain Game Wins Crypto Capital&#039;s Favor" class="wp-image-183176" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1614-1024x197.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1614-300x58.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1614-768x148.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1614-750x145.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1614.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Rumby Stars New Generation Blockchain Game Wins Crypto Capital&#039;s Favor 30"><figcaption>Rumby Stars New Generation Blockchain Game Wins Crypto Capital's Favor 33</figcaption></figure>

<p>With the upgrade now complete, the network is expected to experience improved scalability and reliability. According to Abhay Kumar, the Helium Foundation’s chief executive, this will be made possible by the faster transaction speeds and new smart contract capabilities offered by the Solana blockchain.</p>



<p>In addition to these benefits, the migration has also freed up the core developers from the task of maintaining a layer-1 blockchain. This, in turn, will enable the Helium Foundation and other contributing organizations to direct more resources towards their shared goals of accelerating the growth of decentralized wireless networks and bringing new applications that create economic efficiencies and close the digital divide.</p>



<p>Helium&#8217;s focus on building out a network for the internet of things (IoT) powered by physical hotspots is one of its unique selling points. This allows IoT devices connected to the network to communicate and share data seamlessly, while also providing a platform for participants to earn HNT tokens for validating coverage and providing wireless hotspots.</p>



<p>HNT is trading at $1.78, down 2.74% in the past 24 hours but up more than 11% in the past seven days. Meanwhile, SOL, the blockchain on which Helium is now hosted, is trading at $21.96, down 5% in the past 24 hours and more than 11.5% in the past week. It will be interesting to see how the migration to Solana affects the performance of HNT going forward.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Yuga Labs defeated Ryder Ripps, who plagiarized the concept from the hit collection BAYC.</em></li>



<li><em>In May 2022, Ripps and Jeremy Cahen developed the BAYC derivative NFT collection RR/BAYC as a parody and protested against Yuga.</em></li>



<li><em>Yuga is now entitled to an injunction as well as monetary damages, which will be established at trial.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Yuga Labs, the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), has won a significant legal fight with Ryder Ripps, the co-creator of the copycat NFT project RR/BAYC.</strong></h5>

<p>In May 2022, Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen produced the BAYC derivative NFT collection RR/BAYC as a parody and protested against Yuga Laboratories. The project makes extensive use of footage from the BAYC NFTs.</p>



<p>Yuga Labs sued content producer Ryder Ripps and the NFT RR/BAYC collection in mid-2022, saying he infringed on intellectual property rights by advertising &#8220;similar&#8221; digital art pieces, such as the Bored Apes Yacht Club (BAYC) collection, in order to fool viewers and benefit themselves.</p>



<p>On February 6, 2023, Thomas Lehman, a smart contract developer and the owner of a website that sells counterfeit collections agreed to a settlement with Yuga Labs to end the legal struggle.</p>



<p>Yuga Labs desires to hold Mr. Ripps and Mr. Cahen responsible for their violation via an evil and unjustified campaign of falsehoods, and Mr. Lehman&#8217;s rejection of their acts is appreciated. Nevertheless, the transaction seems to have failed.</p>

<p>Ripps, for one, sees his acts as a larger type of creative expression than being labeled as &#8220;appropriating&#8221; art. But, the character failed the court&#8217;s &#8220;Rogers test,&#8221; which evaluates &#8220;artistic expression&#8221; based on the link between the topic and the artwork.</p>



<p>A U.S. district court in central California <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.855658/gov.uscourts.cacd.855658.225.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> on April 21 in a pre-trial summary judgment judgement that Ripps and Cahen had violated Yuga Lab&#8217;s trademarks with their RR/BAYC NFT collection.</p>



<p>The Court also found that Yuga Labs is entitled to an injunction and damages, which will be established at trial.</p>

<p>While Bitcoin accounted for the largest liquidation, at $63.03 million, Ethereum was not far behind with $54.20 million in liquidations. Other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Arbitrum, Chainlink, XRP, Litecoin, and Solana were affected less severely, with less than $5.5 million in liquidations.</p>



<p>Liquidations were mainly observed in trading activity on Binance, OKX, Huobi, and Bybit. As a result, the market saw a total of 57,269 traders liquidated, according to site data.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the drop in value of Bitcoin is not an isolated event. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and it is not uncommon to see sudden drops or spikes in value. Despite this, investors continue to show interest in the cryptocurrency market, as its potential for high returns remains enticing.</p>
