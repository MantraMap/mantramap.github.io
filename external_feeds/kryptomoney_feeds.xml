The latest increase in hashrate was attributed to the activation of 2,100 new miners and bringing existing miners to full capacity. <br /><br />The company is now targeting a hashrate of 6 EH/s by the end of the year, as it takes advantage of further expansion opportunities. Bitfarms has purchased 6,200 new miners, which are expected to bring its total hashrate to 5.7 EH/s once activated, and <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_88e732cba54d233f2260ca3a643f30d1/bitfarms/news/2023-04-24_Bitfarms_Receives_Permit_To_Power_Up_To_100_MW_In__186.pdf">more orders</a> for new equipment are in progress. <br /><br />With energy costs of less than $0.03 per kWh, Bitfarms has a &#8220;best-in-class average cost of Bitcoin mined&#8221;. The company, which is listed on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange, has ten mining facilities in Canada, the U.S., Paraguay, and Argentina, using hydroelectric power to mine Bitcoin at its other sites and natural gas in Argentina.<br /><br />The Argentina project, announced in April 2021, has an initial contract of eight years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the demand for cryptocurrencies has grown over the years, it has become increasingly important for traders to understand how to sell cryptocurrencies such as Tether in Dubai.</p>
<p>Tether, a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar, is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in Dubai. If you are looking to sell Tether in Dubai, here are some tips to help you do it the right way.</p>
<h2>Understand the Basics of Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>
<p>Before you decide to <a href="https://sellusdtindubai.com/">sell Tether in Dubai</a>, it is important to understand the basics of the process. Tether can be sold on cryptocurrency exchanges or through peer-to-peer marketplaces. You will need to have a Tether wallet and an account with a reputable exchange or marketplace to sell your Tether. Make sure to do your research to find a trustworthy platform to sell your Tether.</p>
<h2>Fees and Charges to Consider When Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>
<p>When selling Tether in Dubai, you will need to consider the fees and charges associated with the transaction. These fees can vary depending on the exchange or marketplace you use. Some platforms charge a percentage of the transaction amount, while others charge a flat fee.

<h3>Check the markets</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take a look at different exchanges and markets, both local and global, when you buy USDT. By comparing different exchanges, you can be sure that the one you choose offers competitive prices. This can help you avoid overpaying or getting scammed.</p>
<h3>Compare fiat currency to crypto prices</h3>
<p>Price comparison tools can be used to compare prices of fiat currencies and crypto in real-time. This makes it easier for you to identify favorable opportunities when buying USDT on exchanges.</p>
<h3>Look out for discounts and promotions</h3>
<p>Sometimes, exchanges offer discounts or other promotions for buying specific amounts of cryptocurrency. Keep an eye out for these, as they could lower your costs significantly in the long run.</p>

<h2>Comparing the Fees and Exchange Rates</h2>

<h2>How to Withdraw Funds After Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>
<p>After selling your Tether, you will need to withdraw the funds to your bank account or digital wallet. The process for withdrawing funds can vary depending on the exchange or marketplace you use.</p>
<p>Some platforms allow you to withdraw funds directly to your bank account, while others require you to transfer the funds to a digital wallet first. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid any delays or issues with the withdrawal process.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Investing in Stablecoins Like Tether</h2>
<p>Investing in Stablecoins like Tether can be a great way to hold value and diversify your portfolio in Dubai. Not only is it a secure and reliable form of cryptocurrency, but investing in stablecoins can also provide you with many advantages.</p>
<h3>Low volatility</h3>
<p>Stablecoins such as Tether have low volatility, meaning that the prices do not fluctuate as much compared to other types of cryptocurrencies. This makes it a great choice for those who are looking for less risk when it comes to their investments.</p>
<h3>Less expensive transactions</h3>
<p>With some cryptocurrencies, you might experience high costs due to the amount of fees associated with each transaction. Stablecoins like Tether are much cheaper and more economical, making them ideal for people who want to make quick and affordable transactions.</p>
<h3>International payments</h3>
<p>Tether is accepted all over the world, making it one of the most popular options for sending money overseas or across borders. This means that you can easily use Tether to send money to different countries without having to worry about exchange rate fluctuations or high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Overall, if you are looking for a secure and reliable form of cryptocurrency that offers low volatility, low transaction costs, and international payment capabilities, then investing in Stablecoins like Tether could be the perfect option for you!</p>

<p><a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/announcing-polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-2">Polygon</a> has announced that the Polygon Bridge is now accessible for Polygon zkEVM, following the launch of the zero-knowledge rollup on Mainnet Beta a month ago. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin conducted the first symbolic transaction on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta.<br /><br />The protocol is intended to be an all-purpose <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/polygon-deploys-zkevm-scaling-solution-compatible-with-ethereum/">Ethereum scaling solution,</a> allowing developers to create on it using Ethereum&#8217;s language and tools. The Polygon Bridge for zkEVM has several new features, including a progress bar, transaction history, and recent transaction panel, all color-coded with time estimates for pending transactions and filtering capabilities. <br /><br />Powered by zero-knowledge technology, Polygon Bridge is governed entirely by smart contracts on Ethereum and Polygon zkEVM. ERC-20 tokens and the advanced features of ERC-777 tokens will also be supported.<br /><br />Polygon zkEVM eliminates the need for mapping, a process that can take hours or even days, by automatically mapping the token being bridged once the bridging transaction is triggered. <br /><br />The protocol has <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/polygonzkevm">attracted</a> $5.4 million in TVL since its launch last month, and Uniswap recently passed a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-staked-matic/">proposal</a> to authorize Polygon Labs to deploy the DEX protocol to zkEVM. Deposits to Polygon zkEVM have also risen significantly, with Quickswap and Sushi now live on the network. <br /><br />Polygon has experienced significant growth this year in terms of developer count and attracting major institutions. Nonetheless, the company behind the development of the layer 2 blockchain, Polygon Labs, announced a 20% workforce reduction in February.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In May, Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) will release guidance on the licensing framework for crypto. Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-27/hong-kong-sfc-to-issue-crypto-exchange-license-guidelines-in-may?leadSource=uverify%20wall">reported</a> that SFC CEO Julia Leung announced the ongoing consultation process for the regulatory framework for crypto entities in the city has received over 150 responses so far. <br /><br />The new regulatory framework will be effective from June 1, and it will mandate crypto platforms to register with the authorities in the city. <br /><br />Licensed exchanges can then offer cryptocurrency trading of major cryptocurrencies, such as <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-rebounds-as-cpi-indicates-falling-inflation/">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, to retail traders. Hong Kong aims to become a financial hub for cryptocurrency in Asia, with two exchanges already offering crypto trading services under the supervision of the Hong Kong SFC. <br /><br />Several other exchanges might follow suit, as the city&#8217;s banking sector also offers <a href="https://www.digfingroup.com/hong-kong-crypto/">support</a> for crypto firms. However, some offshore exchanges have started restricting Hong Kong users due to regulatory demands. <br /><br /><a href="https://www.bitget.com/en/support/articles/12560603782171">Bitget</a>, for instance, has announced it will no longer provide services for Hong Kong users and that its Hong Kong users must transition to its subsidiary, BitGetX HK, which will apply for a license under the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) regime.</p>

<p>Circle has <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/usdc-cctp-an-open-dollar-platform-for-developers">launched</a> its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), a new product that allows developers to move the USDC stablecoin between Ethereum and Avalanche with ease.<br /><br />The move removes the need for older methods of cross-chain transfers, which require locking and minting assets, and allows users to <em>&#8220;burn and mint&#8221;</em> or<em> &#8220;teleport&#8221;</em> USDC between blockchains. <br /><br />This means customers will be able to transact with USDC without needing to know which blockchain their assets are on, as apps that use CCTP will allow for seamless support of different native versions of USDC. More than 10 apps, including Ethereum wallet Metamask and Solana bridge Wormhole, have reportedly adopted CCTP to date. <br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/circle-usdc-issuer-hits-back-against-sec-action-with-facts-dispels-fud/">Circle</a> also plans to make CCTP <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/circle-delivers-usdc-interoperability-across-ecosystems-with-mainnet-launch-of-cross-chain-transfer-protocol-301807557.html">available</a> on various other chains throughout 2023. Although USDC is already available on a variety of blockchains, CCTP will allow for easy movement across those blockchains. <br /><br />With a market cap of $30 billion, USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin after Tether. <br /><br />In March, the asset briefly lost its peg with the US dollar, but Circle was able to access the $3.3 billion of USDC backing it had stored with Silicon Valley Bank, and USDC quickly regained its intended $1.00 price peg.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During the early hours of Wednesday morning, crypto prices experienced an overnight surge. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-predicted-to-soar-to-100k-by-2024-declares-standard-chartered/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s value rose by 3.7% over the past day, according to Binance data via <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">TradingView</a>, and was trading at $28,722 at the time of this post. Ether also saw a 2.2% increase in value during the same period. The increase in crypto prices coincided with banking issues at First Republic, a U.S. bank that saw $102 billion in deposit outflows during Q1 2023, $72 billion more than expected. The banking woes have also led to broader banking concerns, <a href="https://en.swissquote.com/newsroom#">according</a> to Swissquote.<br /><br />Standard Chartered declared that the recent U.S. banking issues have been the catalyst for Bitcoin&#8217;s rally to above $30,000 and a return to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s core use case. They believe that the <em>&#8220;crypto winter is over,&#8221;</em> a sentiment that has been echoed by other experts, such as Markus Thielen from Matrixport, who <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7056762542936772608/">predicts</a> that the price of Bitcoin could reach $45,000 by year-end.<br /><br />JPMorgan analysts have warned that Ether may face further selling pressure after Binance initiated Ethereum withdrawals this week, which could <em>&#8220;put further pressure on ETH over the coming weeks.&#8221;</em> Despite taking up to 15 days to be fulfilled, the withdrawals could still affect ether&#8217;s value. Additionally, liquid staking protocol Lido Finance plans to enable ether withdrawals in May.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/">Binance</a> also announced its liquid staking token, set to launch on Thursday. The recent dip in the crypto market caused futures traders going long to suffer over $700 million in liquidations, and the recent surge resulted in shorts suffering a similar fate, with about $77 million in short positions across derivatives exchanges being liquidated in the past 24 hours, mostly across Binance, OKX, and Bybit.</p>

<p>South Korean investigators have revealed that approximately $8.6 million<a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2310&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter"> remains</a> in the Sygnum Bank account of Do Kwon, the CEO of Terraform Labs (TFL), while the investigation into his company is ongoing. Sygnum, a crypto bank established in Switzerland, was founded in 2017.<br /><br />Earlier this year, the U.S. <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-congress-to-address-stablecoin-legislation-and-sec-oversight/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) reported that Kwon transferred a large sum of Bitcoins, valued at about $258 million, to a Swiss bank, which was later identified as Sygnum. The head of a financial securities crime investigation team in South Korea recently announced that they are keeping a close watch on the Bitcoin holdings of the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG).<br /><br />It was also disclosed during a press conference, following the indictment of several individuals without detention, that around $100 million had been cashed out and moved to the Sygnum account, as noted in the SEC complaint. <br /><br />Officials explained that the large sum of money had been allocated for various purposes and was not entirely present in the Sygnum account. Some of the funds were transferred to a law firm&#8217;s account as payment for legal services, leaving roughly $8.6 million in the account.<br /><br />Both South Korean and U.S. investigative agencies have requested a freeze on the Sygnum account, but it is still unknown whose appeal will take precedence.<br /><br />Swiss authorities and banks are obligated to present evidence before any decision can be reached. The investigators reiterated their commitment to assisting victims quickly and emphasized the need for Kwon&#8217;s extradition to South Korea.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bybit-introduces-merkle-tree-verified-proof-of-reserves/">Bybit</a>, a crypto exchange headquartered in <a href="https://twitter.com/sumitkapoor16/status/1648377443026345984">Dubai</a>, announced that it will require know-your-customer (KYC) checks on all its services starting May 8, 2023. <br /><br />Existing users who have not completed identity verification by that date will only be allowed to close existing open positions or orders, return loans, or withdraw. <br /><br />The policy shift was hinted at in December 2022, when Bybit introduced KYC requirements for peer-to-peer trading and some NFT services. Bybit has implemented various security measures to protect its users&#8217; funds, including multi-signature cold wallets, DDoS protection, and two-factor authentication. <br /><br />The exchange also regularly performs security audits and maintains an insurance fund to cover any potential losses due to security breaches. By making KYC mandatory for all users, the exchange aims to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities while ensuring compliance with global regulations.<br /><br />The exchange did not offer any explanation for the move, but the decision comes amid increased regulatory scrutiny of crypto exchanges worldwide, particularly in the U.S. Bybit is among the many crypto firms based in Dubai, and it<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-29/crypto-com-bybit-announce-plans-to-set-up-operations-in-dubai"> relocated</a> its headquarters from Singapore to Dubai last year.</p>
