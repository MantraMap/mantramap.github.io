<p>It took Collateral Network only a few weeks to climb the crypto charts. With a growing and supportive community that shares its vision, Collateral Network (COLT) has been an unstoppable force.</p>
<p>Collateral Network is set to transform the crowdlending industry with its innovative peer-to-peer decentralized lending protocol that allows people to put up real-world assets as collateral and unlock liquidity.</p>
<p class="s9">Borrowers send their watches, cars, and other high-value assets to the Collateral Network, where the Collateral Network team uses AI to evaluate the asset and generate a fair price. Collateral Network mints an NFT against the asset and stores it in its highly-secure vault.</p>
<p>Next, Collateral Network further fractionalizes the 100% asset-backed NFT to enable multiple lenders to fund the loan with smaller amounts and receive fixed interest payments. The Collateral Network team calls this fractionalized lending.</p>
<p class="s10">Below are the top reason why crypto experts are buying the COLT presale token:</p>
● It is not a pump &amp; dump project with no real value but a blockchain-powered revolution that will change the lending market.
