<li>Bitcoin price is attempting a fresh increase from the $26,000 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $27,100 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $27,100 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $27,480 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin price is rising from $26,550 against the US Dollar. BTC might eye another increase if the bulls remain active above the $26,650 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-uphill-task-near-27250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">remained well-bid</a> above the $26,000 level. A base was formed and the price was able to settle above the $26,500 resistance zone. The bulls remained active above $26,500 and initiated a decent increase.</p>
<p>There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $29,851 swing high to the $25,811 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance near $27,100 on the 4-hour chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is now trading near $27,100 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-turns-red-below-29k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $27,480 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance might be near the $27,840 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the key decline from the $29,851 swing high to the $25,811 low. A clear move above the $27,480 and $27,850 resistance levels might send the price toward $28,500.</p>
<p>Any more gains might push the price toward the $29,500 zone. If there is no upside break, the price might start a fresh decline below the $27,100 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The first major support is near $27,000. The next key support is near the $26,500 level, below which the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could decline toward the $26,000 level in the coming sessions.</p>
<div id="attachment_78486" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Bitcoin-3.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-78486" class="size-full wp-image-78486" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/05/Bitcoin-3.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-78486" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XBTUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Bitcoin’s price is trading near $27,100 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, the price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $27,480 resistance zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Calgary, Canada is setting <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-ca/news/canada/calgary-police-service-to-host-western-canada-cryptocurrency-investigation-hub/ar-AA19MZ2y" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">up a new training and investigations</a> hub hosted by local police authorities. The purpose is to deal with rising crypto crime that residents have reported. The goal is to keep crime numbers down and make sure people know how to avoid digital scams in the future.</p>
<h2>Calgary Gets Serious About Crypto-Related Crime</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/crypto-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">Crypto scams</a> are nothing new, but they appear to have grown in both size and strength over the past few years. Calgary wants to make sure people are aware of the many red flags that are often made apparent with so many faulty (or fake) crypto investing programs.</p>
<p>The Calgary Police Service (CPS) is now partnering with blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis to ensure proper software, data, and research options are available to members of the Western Canada Cryptocurrency Investigations Center to ensure the program is successful in training citizens on what to avoid and what to do. CPS Chief Mark Neufeld said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>If [the] same person clicks on the wrong link on an email and has thousands of dollars stolen from them, we need to be able to move heaven and earth in the very same way and release those same hounds in the digital world so that we can get that money back.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s confident in the relationship his organization has formed with Chainalysis and believes his associates will be able to get the information they need to tackle more crypto-related investigations. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cyber is quickly becoming a component of criminal activity, and [it] often requires collaboration between law enforcement and other expert industries. We are thrilled to be part of an innovative partnership with Chainalysis where cybersecurity expertise is shared among the Calgary Police Service and private enterprise[s].</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2022, it was estimated that residents of Calgary lost close to $14 million in crypto funds due to thievery and scams. In 2023, just five months in, the number is a reported $3 million. Neufeld says these numbers are inaccurate and likely much larger given how much crypto crime goes unreported due to the technicality behind it. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think once people understand that the Calgary Police Service is committed to keeping businesses and individuals safe in that space, I think you will see people coming forward, and that’s good. The more people that come forward, the better we can understand those trends and what’s happening there and respond to it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>All the Transactions Can Be Seen</h2>
<p>Gurvais Grigg – public safety chief technology officer with Chainalysis – stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the powerful things about the blockchain is it’s a publicly available ledger. So, I like to say, even if you didn’t know who the subject of the investigation is today, those records are going to still be there six years from now.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Zambia is in the process of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/zambia-is-looking-into-potential-crypto-regulation/" data-wpel-link="internal">testing digital currencies</a> like bitcoin. The country recently commented that these tests <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/zambia-to-finish-cryptocurrency-regulation-tests-by-june-minister/ar-AA19Muz2" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">are almost finished</a>, and that the nation is planning to use the results of the tests as a means of doling out solid crypto regulation once and for all.</p>
<h2>Zambia is Almost Done with Its Crypto Tests</h2>
<p>There have been wide calls for crypto regulation over the past six months given the fall of crypto exchange FTX, which occurred in November of last year. Rising to fame in 2019, it took only three years for FTX to be listed as one of the top five digital currency trading platforms in the world, and the man behind it – Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius who was set to endure high levels of success in the coming future.</p>
<p>Sadly, the company quickly fell apart due to an <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">alleged liquidity crunch</a>. Following a failed purchase <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">agreement with Binance</a>, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">entered bankruptcy</a> and SBF left his post, though the aftermath was much worse given all the deceitful practices that allegedly went on behind closed doors.</p>
<p>For example, it’s been reported that Bankman-Fried stole user funds to purchase luxury real estate in the Bahamas and to pay off loans with his other company Alameda Research. He was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftxs-disgraced-founder-has-been-arrested/" data-wpel-link="internal">later arrested</a> and is now awaiting trial at his parents’ <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">home in Northern California</a>.</p>
<p>Because of this, many countries are worried that the crypto space is more vulnerable than ever, and they <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-announces-plans-for-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">want regulations in place</a> to prevent more closures and customer troubles.</p>
<p>The Innovation, Science and Technology Minister of Zambia, a man named Felix Mutati, says his nation is on the verge of implementing rules and laws that will allow safe and controlled crypto transactions for all citizens. In an interview, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our main goal in the area of cryptocurrency is to strike a balance between innovation in terms of digital payments&#8230; against citizens&#8217; safety, particularly given that cryptocurrency is very volatile. The central bank is simulating that to see what would happen in the real world. The results will assist us (in) the formulation of the regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that many residents of Zambia have grown very interested in crypto investing as of late. Africa has long been considered the perfect crypto haven given how vulnerable it is to corruption and weak financial operations, things bitcoin was initially built to assist with. Mutati continued by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>What we are seeing is increased appetite to invest in Zambia.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Africa Has Long Been Considered a Crypto Powerhouse</h2>
<p>Other African nations have made huge headways in recent years when it comes to implementing crypto and digital finance laws.</p>
<p>For instance, in 2022, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/following-el-salvador-the-central-african-republic-declares-btc-legal-tender/" data-wpel-link="internal">Central African Republic</a> (CAR) became the second nation (<a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-fully-legal-in-el-salvador-beginning-september-7/" data-wpel-link="internal">after El Salvador</a>) to list bitcoin as legal tender, meaning it could be used for purchases.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Niagara Falls Planning Board in New York is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/planning-board-prepared-recommend-operating-112000864.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">permitting a crypto mining</a> facility known as Block Fusion to move forward with its blockchain and crypto extraction plans following <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-firm-block-fusion-in-legal-battle-with-niagara-falls/" data-wpel-link="internal">a long legal battle</a>. The company recently applied to set up quarters in the Empire State, and those on the planning board heard no objections to the firm going ahead with its agenda.</p>
<h2>New York and Crypto Can&#8217;t Seem to Solidify Their Relationship</h2>
<p>Block Fusion has received a high-energy use operating permit from the city to ensure that it can operate its energy intensive mining rigs and other machinery, which will ultimately lead to more bitcoin and crypto units being moved from the blockchain and placed in circulation.</p>
<p>The news comes at a rather unusual time given how nasty New York has been towards crypto. The recent headline has a lot of people wondering, “Why can’t the region just make up its mind about crypto, already?” At one moment, it appears to hate crypto with a passion, and it’s hellbent on making sure there’s no innovation within its borders pertaining to the digital currency arena. The next minute, it’s on the verge of bowing down to it and making it a national currency of sorts.</p>
<p>Some of the negative behavior stemming from New York towards bitcoin and crypto resulted in a current two-year <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-signs-crypto-moratorium-into-law/" data-wpel-link="internal">moratorium on crypto mining</a>. This moratorium prevented any digital currency mining businesses from setting up shop within New York unless they operated fully on clean energy. The state expressed concern that the amount of energy utilized for crypto mining was bringing the planet to its knees and taking it down a dark and irreversible path.</p>
<p>In addition, the state’s attorney general Leticia James has made a real name for herself in recent weeks suing practically every crypto company she can, from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-attorney-generals-office-now-suing-ku-coin-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ku Coin</a> to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-sues-crypto-lending-network-celsius-and-its-former-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal">Celsius</a>. She says that these companies engaged in fraud and other illicit behavior, and she’s set on ensuring these companies get the penalties they deserve and that they cannot take advantage of native residents (or their money).</p>
<p>Lastly, the state issued the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitlicense/" data-wpel-link="internal">BitLicense</a> back in 2015. This document called for heavy regulations to be imposed on crypto companies along with high documentation fees. It all proved too much for several companies, which merely packed up their bags and left the Big Apple for good.</p>
<p>All this (and more) would suggest the Empire State doesn’t care for crypto and wants nothing to do with it, but the news related above says otherwise. Also, it was recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-considers-crypto-as-a-method-of-payment/" data-wpel-link="internal">mentioned that New York</a> is now looking into crypto for payments, something nobody saw coming in any way, shape, or form.</p>
<h2>Set in Stone?</h2>
<p>Planning Board Chairman Tony Palmer said:</p>
<blockquote><p>At our last meeting, we were told this is pretty cut and dried. There&#8217;s not much we can do.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies are facing another potential issue which is undermining the verification process. Rumors are floating through the industry that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wants to ban cryptocurrency staking. Unfortunately, staking is at the core of some of the most widely traded cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/02/08/coinbases-ceo-cites-rumors-the-sec-may-ban-crypto-staking-for-retail-customers/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">such as Ether</a>. The focus of the SEC seems to be on banning cryptocurrency staking for U.S. retail customers. In past comments, the head of the SEC Chairman, Gary Gensler, has remarked that cryptocurrencies that allow retail customers the ability to perform staking should be designated security even though it&#8217;s currently classified as a commodity by the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission. A significant amount of money is at stake if the SEC moves forward with the idea that they will ban staking. The notional value of the assets that undergo staking was above <a href="https://6693156.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6693156/State%20of%20Staking%20Q1%202023%20by%20Staked_Kraken-1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">$42 billion in Q4 2022, with rewards from this process of $3 billion</a>, according to a report from Staked.</p>
<p><strong>What is Crypto Staking?</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.iforex.in/instruments/crypto-currencies" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Cryptocurrency trading</a> staking is lending your cryptocurrency assets for a period to help support the blockchain operation. When you stake your cryptocurrency, you earn interest in additional cryptocurrency. The process is similar to putting your money in a savings account and making interest. The bank will use your money to lend to others and continue to help build their operation. Some popular cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-staking-in-crypto/#:~:text=Staking%20is%20when%20you%20lock,proof%20of%20stake%20consensus%20mechanism." data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Solana and Ethereum</a>, use staking as part of their process.</p>
<p><strong>Proof of Work and Proof of Stake</strong></p>
<p>Staking can play a pivotal role in helping the verification process. Two main methods are used to prove that a cryptocurrency transaction is verified. The most common is called proof of work. During this process, individuals called minors will work to solve a complex problem using high-caliber computers. The first miner to solve the problem will be the one that verifies the transaction and receives a reward for the verification process. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work#:~:text=Bitcoin%20is%20a%20proof%2Dof,computing%20function%20used%20by%20RPoW." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bitcoin is a proof-of-work digital currency</a>. Before a block is verified and placed on the Bitcoin blockchain, the protocol involves a mechanism that is proof of work. Miners solve a problem to validate the transactions providing a decentralized mechanism to the process.</p>
<p>An alternative to proof of work is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">proof of stake</a>. Someone staked in the enterprise can verify the transaction in this verification mechanism. The process enables the blockchain to process new transactions using a consensus mechanism to validate transactions. The proof of stake methodology will enable owners to validate block transactions based on the number of cryptocurrency coins they own. The process was created as an alternative to proof of work and is considered less risky when it comes to an attack on the network as its structures the compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous.</p>
<p>Proof of stake reduces the amount of computation that is needed to verify blocks. The owners of the coins are essentially offering their coins as collateral for the chance to validate transactions. The validators in the proof of stake process are selected randomly to confirm the transaction and earn coins. Instead of racing to solve a problem to become the verifier of the record, the random process allows anyone who wants to stake to become a transaction verifier. The lack of computation power needed significantly reduces the amount of energy required to verify a transaction. The proof of stake method aims to reduce network congestion and the environmental concerns surrounding the energy needed to run a proof of work process.</p>
<p><strong>How Does Staking Work?</strong></p>
<p>If you own specific cryptocurrencies, you can <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/in/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-staking-in-crypto/#:~:text=Staking%20is%20when%20you%20lock,proof%20of%20stake%20consensus%20mechanism." data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">participate in staking on a blockchain</a> that uses proof of stake as a verification method. Staking locks up your assets for a particular period to help maintain the security of the blockchain. Similar to a certification of deposit at a bank, you cannot take your money back without incurring a penalty. The lockup ensures the system can work properly if there are any issues. If you have coins in your wallet that are stakable, you can designate those coins for staking. You can then pick a validator. The token commingled with others who want to stake increases your chances of receiving rewards.</p>
<p>A stake program will provide information about the staking reward you can receive from participating in the process. Some cryptocurrency exchanges have offered 5-20% ranges for Ethereum 2.0 staking. Some benefits include receiving passive income on your cryptocurrency, especially if you plan to use a buy-and-hold strategy and not trade actively in that particular cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>You can stake a cryptocurrency with a digital wallet to perform these transactions. If you are trading futures contracts on cryptocurrency or contracts for differences, you cannot stake.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Trading Strategies that are Geared for Staking</strong></p>
<p>When combined with staking, the most effective strategies are trading strategies where you plan to own cryptocurrency that can be staked for a defined period. Stocking will be less effective if you want to set risk limits and use risk management tools such as a stop loss level. <a href="https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/investing-insights/buy-and-hold-long-term-investment-strategies.html#:~:text=Instead%20of%20trying%20to%20time,them%20regardless%20of%20market%20fluctuations." data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Buy-and-hold</a> strategies or long-term trend-following strategies will likely keep you in the market long enough to benefit from staking.</p>
<p><strong>Why Can&#8217;t You Stake with Futures and CFDs</strong></p>
<p>Cryptocurrency staking is relatively straightforward when you use a digital account to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency. If you are trading a security that tracks the movements of a cryptocurrency, such as a CFD or futures contract, you are not eligible to stake a cryptocurrency. Since a futures contract and CFD tracks the movements of specific cryptocurrencies, you do not own a cryptocurrency, and therefore you cannot lend that cryptocurrency as proof of stake.</p>
<p><strong>Why does the SEC think About Banning Staking?</strong></p>
<p>The focus of the SEC is that by allowing investors to earn income from a cryptocurrency, the product resembles a security that receives either income or dividends. According to sources, on February 13, the SEC issued a Wells Notice to Paxos Trust Company. This entity issues the Binance USD stablecoin. The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wellsnotice.asp" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Wells notice</a> is a document sent to a company or individual likely to be sued by the SEC. The movement by the SEC has led to rumors that the SEC will try to stop companies from using staking as a way to incentivize ownership as a way to earn passive income.</p>
<p><strong>How Would a Ban on Staking Impact Cryptocurrency Advancement?</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of staking include decreasing the carbon footprint that is evident in proof of work cryptocurrency verification and has <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/coinbase-ceo-concerned-sec-crypto-staking-ban-7107542" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">helped build scale</a>. According to a quote from Coinbase Chairman Brian Armstrong, he does not believe that staked cryptocurrencies are security. The SEC is also investigating Kraken for the sale of unregistered securities. While it&#8217;s unclear which cryptocurrencies at Kraken the SEC is investigating, it is known that Kraken allows investors to stake cryptocurrency and earn rewards from the process. There now appears to be a coordinated movement by prominent cryptocurrency community members to push back on the idea that the SEC would consider banning the staking of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact of a Staking Ban</strong></p>
<p>The rumors of a staking ban would only impact retail investors and allow institutional investors to stake cryptocurrencies. You would need to be an <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accreditedinvestor.asp" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">accredited investor</a> to participate, which in theory, works against the concept of decentralization. An accredited investor is a business or individual allowed to trade securities that might not be registered with financial regulators. Under regulation D, accredited investors are financially savvy and therefore have a reduced need for protection by the SEC.</p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>Staking a cryptocurrency is attractive, mainly if you use a buy-and-hold strategy. The process of staking is similar to owning a stock and receiving a dividend. Staking means owning a stake in the digital coin and receiving rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. Because the concept is similar to owning a stock and receiving a dividend, the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States wants to ban staking for retail investors. The agency believes staking can remain an unregulated asset if institutional investors participate.</p>
<p>Currently, cryptocurrencies and activities that pertain to their own are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and are treated like a commodity. You can not receive a stake in a digital coin if you trade derivatives such as futures or contracts for differences. You must own a digital coin and apply for staking using your wallet at the exchange where your cryptocurrency is transacted and stored.</p>

<p>Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,880 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2,020 swing high to the $1,737 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,920 zone. A clear move above the $1,920 level could send the price toward $2,000.</p>
<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,150 resistance zone or $2,200 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,800 level. The next major support is now near the $1,750 level.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,750 support could push the price to $1,600. Any more losses could lead the price toward $1,550 or even $1,500 in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been on a roll since the beginning of the year. The world’s number one digital currency has recently reached a price <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">of about $30K per</a> unit (for the first time in about ten or 11 months), and it seems like 2023 is set to be a year of healing for the asset. Now, Mike Novogratz – a bitcoin bull and billionaire hedge fund manager – <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/13/fed-sweet-spot-could-be-about-to-trigger-a-200-billion-bitcoin-price-boom/?sh=29b30bbf138d" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">believes the currency</a> is going to see a major price boom in the final months of the year.</p>
<h2>Mike Novogratz Predicts Big Things for BTC</h2>
<p>2023 is shaping up to be the exact opposite of 2022. The latter year was one of the worst on record for BTC. The currency lost more than 70 percent of its value after hitting a new all-time high in November of 2021. During that time, the currency was trading at a whopping $68,000 per unit, though by the time the end of 2022 came around, the currency had fallen into the mid-$16K range. It was a sad and ugly sight.</p>
<p>In his recent discussion, Novogratz said he’s confident the Federal Reserve is going to initiate maneuvers that ultimately help bitcoin. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The clearest trades have been and will continue to be long gold, long euro, long bitcoin, [and] long Ethereum. These assets should do well with the Fed stopping hiking and then cutting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long ago, the Federal Reserve hinted that 2023 could be a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rates-again-what-will-happen-to-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">year of continued</a> rate hikes, though they don’t expect them to be as aggressive as they were in 2022. In addition, the federal agency said there’s a likelihood of a “mild recession” towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Fed initiated so many rate hikes as a means of fighting inflation (which continues to be a problem in America having recently hit a 40-year high), that it ultimately caused problems for bitcoin and other assets, though Novogratz doesn’t think that’ll be the case this time around. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin had a huge run. We can consolidate here before moving towards $40,000 so long as the Fed plays out the way I think it’s going to play out.</p></blockquote>
<h2>$30K was a Big Turning Point for the World&#8217;s Leader in Digital Assets</h2>
<p>He believes that in the final months of 2023,  bitcoin will reach a price of about $40K, which will ultimately add about $200 billion to the crypto space. Alex Kuptsikevich – a senior market analyst at FX Pro – also stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The $30,000 mark was significant for bitcoin in 2021 and the first half of 2022, acting as a market mode switch. Last year, bitcoin consolidated around this price for about five weeks before plunging sharply. There is a greater chance of a mirror dynamic, with the bulls taking a long time to gather their strength before making a decisive move higher.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>April saw the next big Ethereum update take place, and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ethereums-highly-anticipated-network-upgrade-is-here-heres-how-the-change-will-impact-the-worlds-2nd-biggest-cryptocurrency/ar-AA19OTBz" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">analysts are weighing</a> in on what it can do for the world’s second largest digital currency by market cap (and the primary competitor to bitcoin) in the long run.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Endures Its Second Major Upgrade in 7 Months</h2>
<p>This is the second major upgrade to Ethereum in about seven months. The first took place in September and was known as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/" data-wpel-link="internal">the Merge</a>. That upgrade moved Ethereum from a proof of work (PoW) to a proof of stake (PoS) module, thus allowing it to become greener and less energy intensive.</p>
<p>This new upgrade, called Shapella, will allow the withdrawals of staked ETH. Brian Fakhoury – a junior partner of venture firm Mechanism Capital – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to tell [the impact] in the short term as there will be a lot of reshuffling in the [ether] staked. These flows could be bearish or bullish for the [decentralized finance] ecosystem and the Ethereum network itself. In the long run, the Shanghai upgrade brings native [ether] yield to a truly free market, which I believe is a requirement for real growth. As the withdrawal queue clears out, liquid staking protocols will be able to compete on more even terms as outflows from worse to better opportunities can be acted upon by market participants.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the Shapella upgrade is slated to assist the Ethereum network in the long term, there are likely to be short-term problems in that such a vast amount of staked ETH suddenly becoming available could lead to people selling their units as a means of making quick profits. This could ultimately affect the network for a little while and result in Ethereum price dips, though it’s not expected that this will last terribly long.</p>
<p>Constantin Guggi – CEO and co-founder of blockchain solutions provider Swisstronik – threw his two cents into the mix by saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>The staked tokens unlock is significant, and it may cause temporary volatility on the market. Due to the ever-changing nature of the industry, including its regulatory aspect, some validators had legal and financial difficulties during the lockup period. Now that they [have] gained access to their tokens, they will urge to sell them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Price May Be Affected Short Term</h2>
<p>Ben Caselin – vice president at crypto exchange Mask EX – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shapella is beneficial to the Ethereum project and should be regarded as a bullish event. Overall, we could expect some volatility around the event as is often the case when Ethereum goes through another upgrade, mostly because crypto markets are still primarily sentiment driven… Nonetheless, macro-conditions are more important at this stage, and we cannot isolate changes on the Ethereum chain from the wider economic context within which investors determine their risk appetite.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not long after the upgrade occurred, Ethereum shot up to the $1,900 range.</p>
