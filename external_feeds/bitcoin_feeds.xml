<h2>US Lawmakers Form &#8216;Congress&#8217; First Ever Digital Assets Subcommittee&#8217;</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services has created a subcommittee on &#8220;Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion.&#8221; Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m proud to announce Congressman French Hill as the chairman of Congress&#8217; first ever Digital Assets Subcommittee and vice chair of the full Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tasks of the new subcommittee include &#8220;Providing clear rules of the road among federal regulators for the digital asset ecosystem, developing policies that promote financial technology to reach underserved communities, [and] identifying best practices and policies that continue to strengthen diversity and inclusion in the digital asset ecosystem,&#8221; the House Financial Services Committee explained.</p>
<p>McHenry believes that Congressman Hill (R-AR), a former community banker and U.S. Treasury official, has the necessary experience and expertise to tackle this undertaking. &#8220;There is no one I trust more with one of my top priorities,&#8221; he emphasized.</p>
<p>&#8220;I look forward to working with him to provide clear rules of the road for this ecosystem that protect consumers, while allowing innovation to thrive here in the U.S.,&#8221; McHenry added, noting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fintech — particularly digital assets — holds immense promise as a tool to build a more inclusive financial system.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Digital assets are something that need oversight and need consumer protection and need the right framework,&#8221; Hill detailed on CNBC in reply to a question about whether cryptocurrency should be legal in the U.S. or whether it is a Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want innovation for fintech and the use of blockchain to be available in the United States,&#8221; he continued, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to have the U.S. to be a leader so we want to create a regulatory legal framework for digital assets, including digital payments, that makes America a leader from an innovation point of view but also protects consumers and investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement issued Thursday, Hill said: &#8220;I am delighted that in the 118th Congress, I will serve in the pioneering role of the chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion of the House Financial Services Committee.&#8221;</p>

He has urged investors not to &#8220;get caught up in the FOMO, the fear of missing out,&#8221; emphasizing that crypto is a highly speculative, non-compliant asset class. </strong></p>
<h2>Gary Gensler Expects Most Crypto to Fail</h2>
<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler gave some advice on cryptocurrency investing Wednesday during a Twitter spaces discussion hosted by the U.S. Army.</p>
<p>Calling crypto a &#8220;highly speculative, volatile asset class,&#8221; Gensler stressed that most cryptocurrencies &#8220;are not complying with securities laws, but they should be.&#8221; Noting that crypto is &#8220;the Wild West,&#8221; he also questioned the use cases of most tokens.</p>
<p>The SEC chief warned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of these 10,000 or 15,000 tokens will fail.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;That’s because venture capital fails, new startups fail, but also because history tells us that there’s not much room for micro currencies, meaning, you know, we have the U.S. dollar and Europe has the euro and the like,&#8221; he explained.</p>
<p>Emphasizing that crypto is &#8220;non-compliant generally,&#8221; Gensler proceeded to advise investors:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t get caught up in the FOMO, the fear of missing out. Please don&#8217;t get caught up in that.</p></blockquote>

<p>This was not the first time Gensler has cautioned about crypto tokens failing. In May last year, following the collapse of the terra/luna ecosystem, he similarly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-warns-a-lot-of-crypto-tokens-will-fail-luna-ust-collapse/">warned</a> that a lot of crypto tokens will fail.</p>
<p>The SEC chief has been criticized by lawmakers and industry participants for taking an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmakers-sec-commissioner-slam-chair-gensler-for-focusing-on-crypto-enforcement/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto industry. In November last year, Gensler affirmed that the securities regulator&#8217;s enforcement division will remain <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">focused on crypto</a>.</p>
<p>This week, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">charged</a> two prominent crypto firms — Gemini and Genesis — &#8220;for the unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors through the Gemini Earn crypto asset lending program.&#8221;</p>

According to the team, the network upgrade will &#8220;reduce the severity of gas spikes&#8221; and &#8220;address chain reorganizations (reorgs) in an effort to reduce time to finality.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon Team Outlines Network Upgrades to Improve User Experience</h2>
<p>On Jan. 12, 2023, the Polygon team <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygon/status/1613615306198614016?s=20&amp;t=pgUTkHQQC2yzFAa661nwGg">told</a> the community to &#8220;get ready for the hard fork&#8221; as developers have plans to upgrade the chain on Jan. 17, 2023. &#8220;The proposed hard fork for the Polygon PoS chain will make key upgrades to the network on Jan. 17,&#8221; the team tweeted. &#8220;This is good news for developers and users and will make for better user experience (UX). You will not need to do anything differently,&#8221; the developers insisted. Polygon (MATIC) developers have been <a href="https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pre-pip-discussion-addressing-reorgs-and-gas-spikes/10623/25">discussing</a> the upgrade since Dec. 2022.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/hardfork-incoming-upgrading-polygon-pos-chain-to-boost-performance">V0.3.1 Hard Fork</a> aims to reduce gas spikes and address blockchain reorganizations (reorgs). A reorg is an occurrence in which a new chain&#8217;s branch emerges and supersedes the previously accepted blockchain branch. Reorganizations can cause previously confirmed transactions to be invalidated and replaced with new ones. In order to alleviate the reorg problem, Polygon plans to decrease the network&#8217;s sprint length from 64 to 16 blocks. &#8220;Doing so will decrease the depth of reorgs,” Polygon developers declare.</p>

<p>In order to reduce gas spikes, Polygon aims to change the &#8220;basefeechangedenominator&#8221; from the current value of 8 to 16. &#8220;This will help smooth out the increase/decrease rate in basefee for when the gas exceeds or falls below the target gas limits in a block,&#8221; according to the Polygon team&#8217;s blog post about the subject.</p>
<p>Polygon&#8217;s native token, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/MATIC/">MATIC</a>, has recently entered the top ten standings in terms of crypto assets ranked by market capitalization. MATIC is up 23.4% over the last week against the U.S. dollar. However, Polygon&#8217;s current $0.987 per unit value is down 66.2% since the digital asset&#8217;s all-time high of $2.92 per unit on Dec. 27, 2021.</p>

After a brief spike in volume in Nov. 2022, dex trade volumes have been lackluster for the past 44 days. As of Jan. 14, 2023, Uniswap version three (V3) has the highest trade volume during the past 24 hours at $1.9 billion and the second-highest total value locked (TVL) at $3.57 billion. Metrics show that Curve holds the second-largest trade volume on Saturday with $399 million in 24 hours and the highest TVL in terms of assets locked in dex platforms, with $4.19 billion locked.</strong></p>
<h2>Uniswap V3 Dominates Dex Trading as Decentralized Exchange Volumes Remain Flat</h2>
<p>After the first two weeks of Jan. 2023, and as of Jan. 13, 2023, metrics indicate that there has been <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/decentralized-finance/dex-non-custodial/dex-volume-monthly">$15.33 billion</a> in global swaps settled among decentralized exchange (dex) platforms. Last month, dex protocols recorded roughly $43.65 billion in swaps, meaning that during the first two weeks of the new year, 35.12% of last month&#x2019;s volume has been reached.</p>
<p>With the recent spike in global cryptocurrency market prices, jumping 6.24% in the last 24 hours, dex trade volume has been fueled over the last few days. Uniswap V3 has captured the most volume during the last 24 hours with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/decentralized">$1.9 billion in swaps</a>.</p>

<p>Uniswap is followed by Curve ($399 million), Balancer ($190 million), Pancakeswap ($176 million), Uniswap Polygon ($164 million), Uniswap Arbitrum ($142 million), Sun.io ($132 million), Uniswap V2 ($91 million), and Uniswap Optimism ($77 million).</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform">top five</a> smart contract platform tokens have captured double-digit gains during the last week. Ethereum jumped 20.6%, Binance Coin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>) rose 16.6%, Cardano increased by 25.4%, Polygon has risen by 23.2%, and Solana jumped 68.5% higher against the U.S. dollar over the last seven days.</p>

<p>The entire smart contract platform coin economy has gained 8.5% against the U.S. dollar in 24 hours. Data also shows that the dex Curve is the top decentralized finance exchange with the most total value locked on Saturday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Curve commands a <a href="https://defillama.com/protocols/Dexes">$4.19 billion</a> total value locked (TVL) and Uniswap is just below the protocol with $3.57 billion. Both Curve and Uniswap are followed by Pancakeswap ($2.46 billion), Balancer ($1.61 billion), Sun.io ($578.83 million), Sushi ($448.9 million), and Biswap ($232.3 million).</p>

<p>Out of the 671 dex platforms or protocols that allow a user to swap or trade cryptocurrency, there is $17.4 billion total value locked among the decentralized finance (defi) protocols. Non-custodial exchanges have become a mainstay in the world of crypto assets by allowing users to trade tokens without the need for an intermediary.</p>
<p>While dex platforms have seen trade volumes decline, centralized spot market exchanges have also seen <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/spot/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly">volumes slide</a> during the last few months. The crypto winter has taken no prisoners as far as centralized and decentralized exchange trading volumes are concerned, and Dec. 2022 was especially disappointing.</p>

Yellen stressed that the country would reach its statutory debt limit on Jan. 19, 2023. She warned that &#x201C;failure to meet the government&#x2019;s obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Yellen Warns of Approaching Debt Limit, Urges Congress to Act Swiftly</h2>
<p>On Friday, Jan. 13, 2023, the United States Treasury published a <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy1188">press release</a> featuring a letter written by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-us-financial-stability-risks-could-materialize-cites-dangerous-and-volatile-environment/">Janet Yellen</a>, the 78th U.S. secretary of the Treasury. The letter is addressed to the House of Representatives and the newly appointed 55th speaker, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biden-vows-to-veto-house-republicans-fair-tax-act-proposing-elimination-of-irs/">Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-CA).</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Debt-Limit-Letter-to-Congress-McCarthy-20230113.pdf">letter</a>, Yellen warns of an approaching debt limit and urges Congress to act swiftly before the nation&#x2019;s massive borrowing authority of $31.4 trillion is depleted, to avoid defaulting on the country&#x2019;s obligations. Although, a temporary solution could be utilized to prevent default on U.S. obligations.</p>

<p>The Treasury secretary insists that leveraging a process known as &#x201C;extraordinary measures&#x201D; could buy Congress more time to increase the U.S. borrowing authority. The process, which is like moving money from one account to another to make sure bills are paid on time, allows the Treasury Department to shuffle money around to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. However, Yellen notes that this can only be done for a limited time.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The period of time that extraordinary measures may last is subject to considerable uncertainty due to a variety of factors,&#x201D; Yellen wrote. She added, &#x201C;It is unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June.&#x201D; The secretary of the Treasury continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>I respectfully urge Congress to act promptly to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.</p></blockquote>

<p>During a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2023/01/13/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-senior-advisor-for-public-engagement-keisha-lance-bottoms/">press briefing</a> on Friday, White House press secretary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indicted-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-discussed-pandemic-prevention-with-biden-administration-officials/">Karine Jean-Pierre</a> was questioned about the approaching debt limit, and she stated: &#x201C;We believe, when it comes to the debt limit, it has been done in a bipartisan way over the years and decades,&#x201D; Jean-Pierre told reporters. &#x201C;And it should be done in a bipartisan way. And it should be done without conditions. This is important here.&#x201D;</p>
<p>U.S. stock markets ended Friday in the green, as the four benchmark stock indexes in the U.S. &#x2014; the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Russell 2000 all closed higher. Additionally, the top three traded precious metals in the world &#x2014; <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">gold, silver, and platinum</a> &#x2014; have been rallying in recent times.</p>
<p>The New York spot price for gold on Friday was approximately $1,921.60 per ounce, up 1.26%, and silver&#x2019;s price per ounce was around $24.38 at the end of Friday. The global cryptocurrency market cap also rose 4.1% higher on Friday, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> jumping above the $21,000 per unit zone. On Saturday, Jan. 14, 2023, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin&#x2019;s price</a> is coasting along just below the $21K range.</p>

<h2>Osprey Proposes Management Changes to Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust in Open Letter to Digital Currency Group</h2>
<p>On Jan. 12, 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-genesis-and-gemini-winklevoss-says-regulators-lawsuit-is-super-lame/">filed charges</a> against the crypto exchange Gemini and crypto lender Genesis Global Capital. The crypto lender Genesis Global Capital is a Digital Currency Group (DCG) subsidiary. The regulator claims that the two organizations took part in an &#8220;unregistered offering.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SEC said that roughly three years ago, Gemini and Genesis gave investors the opportunity to loan crypto assets in exchange &#8220;for Genesis&#8217; promise to pay interest.&#8221; The SEC charges followed two letters written by Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/geminis-cameron-winklevoss-insists-digital-currency-group-needs-to-resolve-liquidity-issues-in-open-letter-to-ceo-barry-silbert/">letter 1</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-co-founder-accuses-digital-currency-group-of-misrepresentation-demands-ceo-resignation/">letter 2</a>) and a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-currency-group-ceo-barry-silbert-responds-to-accusations-by-geminis-cameron-winklevoss-with-shareholders-letter/">shareholders letter</a> by Silbert denying the accusations.</p>

<p>The following day, the crypto investment manager <a href="https://ospreyfunds.io">Osprey</a> published an <a href="https://ospreyfunds.io/wp-content/uploads/Open-Letter-to-Barry-Silbert-regarding-Grayscale-Bitcoin-Trust-from-Osprey-Funds-CEO-Greg-King-1.pdf">open letter</a> to Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG). Osprey wants to take over the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GBTC:OTCMKTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GBTC</a>) as the fund believes &#8220;Osprey is the best-positioned third party to manage GBTC at this point.&#8221; DCG is the parent firm of Grayscale, and Osprey is not the first digital currency fund to offer help; the Tennessee-based crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments is also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/valkyrie-reveals-intention-to-sponsor-grayscales-bitcoin-trust-as-gbtc-discount-to-nav-widens/">vying to take over GBTC</a>. Like Osprey, Valkyrie published an open letter to DCG stating that it is &#8220;uniquely qualified&#8221; for the role.</p>
<p>In its letter, Osprey detailed that if it were to take over GBTC&#8217;s management, it would change a few things associated with the Bitcoin Trust. &#8220;We would slash the management fee to 0.49% and clean up the expense structure of the fund, which contains significant conflicts of interest,&#8221; Osprey said on Friday. &#8220;We would also seek to implement a redemption program as soon as possible.&#8221; The digital currency fund manager added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would pursue a listing on NYSE immediately but from a position of collaboration with regulators. For example, we would not engage in any lawsuits against the SEC, but instead, would work directly with Congress to enlighten the SEC as to the rationale of approving the fund as an exchange-listed, ETP.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company thinks that it is extending a hand in order to show continued commitment to shareholders. Osprey insists that DCG and Silbert should allow the fund to take over as soon as possible. &#8220;We urge you to install Osprey Funds as the sponsor of GBTC immediately, both to protect GBTC holders and provide confidence to the non-DCG-affiliated stakeholders of GBTC and Grayscale who have an interest in the preservation of value,&#8221; Osprey said.</p>
<h2>Tron&#8217;s Justin Sun Offers to Invest $1 Billion in Digital Currency Group Assets Amid SEC Charges Against Gemini and Genesis</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Tron&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/huobi-layoffs-spark-controversy-and-speculation-justin-sun-claims-everything-is-fine/">Justin Sun</a> has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-investor-justin-sun-says-willing-spend-up-1-bln-dcg-assets-2023-01-13/">told Reuters</a> that he too is also willing to lend a hand. Sun said that he would consider investing $1 billion into Digital Currency Group (DCG) assets, but it depends on the &#8220;evaluation of the situation.&#8221; Sun also offered to help FTX the day before the exchange filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11, 2022.</p>

<p>At the time, Sun <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1590540071559909382?s=20&amp;t=c2T8OIqzDcjFZY9afJMGjQ">said</a> his team was working around the clock to help alleviate the situation with FTX, and he also <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1590586174313488384?s=20&amp;t=c2T8OIqzDcjFZY9afJMGjQ">remarked</a> that he was taking steps to help FTX. However, none of the promises came to fruition and the following day, FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> stepped down as CEO.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s uncertain whether or not Digital Currency Group (DCG) or Genesis will accept help from organizations and individuals within the crypto industry. The company did not respond to Valkyrie&#8217;s attempt to sponsor GBTC over Grayscale during the first week of the new year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Grayscale has been involved in an <a href="https://grayscale.com/gbtc-lawsuit/">ongoing legal dispute</a> with the SEC over denying GBTC being converted into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Grayscale believes if the SEC allowed them to convert GBTC into an ETF, it would allow them to issue and redeem Bitcoin Trust shares. Grayscale has <a href="https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Reply-Brief-of-Respondent-SEC-12092022.pdf">criticized</a> the commission&#8217;s reasoning greatly and stressed that the U.S. regulator&#8217;s &#8220;central premise is illogical.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the ongoing legal disputes and the potential management changes proposed by Osprey and Tron&#8217;s Justin Sun&#8217;s investment offer? Do you believe it&#8217;s a step in the right direction for the crypto industry or could it lead to more complications? Share your thoughts in the comments below.</strong></em></p>

The move comes as cryptocurrency markets were significantly bullish to start the weekend, with the global market cap 8.28% higher as of writing. Shiba inu was trading at its strongest point since November.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was easily one of the biggest movers to start the weekend, with prices skyrocketing by as much as 30%.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16.52 yesterday, SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $22.37 earlier today.</p>
<p>As a result of today’s rally the token hit its strongest point since November 9, when price was at a top of $24.60.</p>

<p>From the chart, the move commenced after yet another burst beyond a resistance point on the 14-day relative strength (RSI).</p>
<p>On this occasion, the index moved above a ceiling at the 80.00 level, and is now tracking at 85.44.</p>
<p>Although solana bulls will have their eyes set on $25.00, there could be a cooling off of the earlier rally as the day matures.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) was once again a notable gainer in crypto markets, as the meme coin rose by over 10% today.</p>
<p>SHIB/USD hit a peak of $0.00001081 to start the weekend, after ending the working week at a low of $0.000009462.</p>
<p>Like with solana above, this resulted in prices climbing to their highest level since early November.</p>

<p>Overall, shiba inu has now risen for a third consecutive session, and is up 24% in the last seven days.</p>
<p>Earlier gains have already begun to show signs of easing, with price now trading at $0.00001039.</p>
<p>This comes after the RSI failed to break out of its long-term resistance point at the 80.00 mark.</p>

<h2>Bitmex Co-Founder Accuses Former FTX CEO of Avoiding Transparency</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes">Arthur Hayes</a>, co-founder of the cryptocurrency derivatives platform Bitmex, criticized Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX, following a recent blog post. In the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disgraced-ftx-co-founder-awaits-trial-passes-time-playing-video-games-and-blogging-on-his-new-substack-newsletter/">blog post</a>, Bankman-Fried said &#8220;Alameda failed to sufficiently hedge its market exposure&#8221; and &#8220;an extreme, quick, targeted crash precipitated by the CEO of Binance made Alameda insolvent.&#8221; Hayes, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitmex-co-founder-arthur-hayes-says-bitcoin-could-drop-to-30k-amid-a-stock-market-rout/">prominent member</a> of the cryptocurrency community, has significant knowledge about cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, as Bitmex was one of the largest since its inception in 2014.</p>
<p>“The exchange should never lose money if a customer gets liquidated,” Hayes <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1613944637504516097?s=20&amp;t=LCkaVE4DulYcgxogBZ6VhQ">tweeted</a> on Friday. “There is no excuse [for] giving [your] hedge fund Alameda an account with liquidation turned off. All this talk about what Alameda did is misdirection. It doesn’t matter how they hedged or didn’t hedge, or what dogsh** was in their portfolio,” the Bitmex co-founder added.</p>
<p>Hayes then told Bankman-Fried if he truly wanted to explain what happened, he should tell the community why he thought it was a good idea to give his hedge fund an account with the liquidation feature turned off. Former Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">statements</a> explain that she fully &#8220;understood that executives had implemented special settings on Alameda&#8217;s FTX.com account that allowed Alameda to maintain negative balances in fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Alameda’s Negative Balance Account: An Enigma Wrapped in a Mystery</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/document-claims-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-ftx-margin-position-was-negative-1-3b-in-may-2022/">reviewed</a> a document that allegedly belonged to Ellison that shows the former Alameda CEO had a leveraged FTX trading account that was in the red by negative $1.3 billion in May 2022. Hayes emphasized that if Alameda was removed from the equation through a legitimate liquidation, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s now-defunct exchange could still be operational. “If you had liquidated Alameda like any other FTX punter, FTX would still be operational. It’s just that simple,” Hayes <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1613944661760176129?s=20&amp;t=LCkaVE4DulYcgxogBZ6VhQ">tweeted</a>. The Bitmex CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1613944669536399360?s=20&amp;t=LCkaVE4DulYcgxogBZ6VhQ">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So stop talking about Alameda and tell us how you approached risk management at the FTX level. Why were some clients treated differently than others. I am keen to understand why you thought turning off liquidation on a $bn notional position was prudent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people responded to the Twitter thread written by Hayes, and one person <a href="https://twitter.com/Galois_Capital/status/1613948722274078733?s=20&amp;t=LCkaVE4DulYcgxogBZ6VhQ">wrote</a>: &#8220;Users paid for Alameda&#8217;s negative account equity. Shameful.&#8221; Others repeated Hayes&#8217;s sentiment, <a href="https://twitter.com/depression2019/status/1613945227928305664?s=20&amp;t=LCkaVE4DulYcgxogBZ6VhQ">saying</a> &#8220;it really is just that simple.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s really the most basic question SBF keeps skirting around. At least he said he was sorry,&#8221; another person <a href="https://twitter.com/SpacBobby/status/1613959099447922691?s=20&amp;t=LCkaVE4DulYcgxogBZ6VhQ">added</a>.</p>

The world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency jumped above $21,000, as prices rallied for a sixth straight day. Ethereum traded above $1,500 to start the weekend, also hitting its strongest point since November.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) rose for a sixth straight session to start the weekend, as prices moved above the $21,000 level.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD climbed to a peak of $21,054.38 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes after prices were at a bottom of $18,793.66 on Friday.</p>
<p>This spike in price saw bitcoin add as much as 10% to its value in the last 24 hours, hitting its strongest point since November 5 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the rally came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to surge. It is now tracking at 89.22.</p>
<p>Typically, a reading of 70.00 is seen as overbought, and with this print, which is its highest point in two years, we are deep in bear territory.</p>
<p>When price becomes overbought, many expect bearish sentiment to grow, as traders begin to short the market.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also hit a two-month high in today&#x2019;s session, with price staying in the green for a seventh consecutive day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,404.82 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved to an intraday high of $1,558.25 on Saturday.</p>
<p>As with bitcoin, this rally sent the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency to its highest point since November 5.</p>

<p>Overall, ethereum is now trading over 23% higher in the last seven days.</p>
<p>The move comes as the 10-day (red) moving average extended a crossover of its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>Despite this bullish momentum to start the weekend, many still expect some reversals over the next few days.</p>

According to CEO at DMCC Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the &#8220;record-high&#8221; number of overall new company registrations indicates the extent of investors’ &#8220;confidence in the emirate.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>New Milestone for DMCC</h2>
<p>According to the United Arab Emirates-based Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), the demand for space at its &#8220;Crypto Centre&#8221; grew significantly, and this can be evidenced by the over 500 blockchain and Web3 firms that were registered with the Crypto Centre by the end of 2022. The surge in the demand for space at the DMCC centre came against the backdrop of a 23% year-on-year increase in the number of registered members from 2,485 in 2021 to the 3,049 seen by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on what is seen as a new milestone for the commodities centre, Ahmed Bin Sulayem, the executive chairman and CEO at DMCC, <a href="https://www.dmcc.ae/news/dmcc-attracts-3049-businesses-dubai-2022-reaching-22000-member-companies-through-another-record-year">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Backed by a strong regional macroeconomic landscape, DMCC has been efficiently accelerating its growth strategy throughout 2022, focusing on supporting its member companies in high-impact sectors such as web3 and blockchain technologies, commodities and global trade. The unprecedented performance this year reflects this growth acceleration and highlights the significant value that DMCC adds to each of its members.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CEO also suggested that the &#8220;record-high&#8221; number of new company registrations could well indicate the extent of investors’ &#8220;confidence in the emirate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, Feryal Ahmadi, the chief operating officer (COO) at the DMCC suggested that his organization would seek to &#8220;build on its position of strength by further enhancing its services and offerings&#8221; and by forging new alliances around the world.</p>
