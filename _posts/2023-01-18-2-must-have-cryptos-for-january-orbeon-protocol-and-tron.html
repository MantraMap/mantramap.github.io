<p>2023 has started with a win for the crypto market. As many fan-favorite cryptocurrencies have increased in price, new projects like Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) have taken the market by storm with regular price increases since October 2022. </p>
<p>With the market bouncing back, investors are asking which investment options will be the best for the new year. Here&rsquo;s why Tron (TRON) and Orbeon Protocol are must-haves for 2023. </p>

<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol Forecasted For a 6000% Increase During Presale</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) first made headlines in October 2022 after a strong first-round presale, despite the declining crypto market. 3 months later and Orbeon Protocol has continued to rise in price, with one ORBN being worth $0.0435. </p>
<p>So how is Orbeon Protocol beating market trends?</p>
<p>Firstly, Orbeon Protocol has a unique use case. Unlike many new projects which build on the hype of the market, Orbeon Protocol has created its own path, looking to tackle issues in the crowdfunding industry.</p>
<p>The crowdfunding market is currently monopolized by venture capitalists, who demand huge percentages of startups for funding. Orbeon Protocol offers a funding alternative with its multi-chain DeFi launchpad. </p>
<p>With the Orbeon Launchpad, startups can raise funds using NFTs. Here&rsquo;s how it works. </p>
<p>A vetted business starts by creating equity-backed NFTs representing shares in their business (for example, 1 NFT = 1 share.) These NFTs are sold directly to investors and held in decentralized Orbeon Wallets. </p>
<p>Startups are required to set funding targets before selling NFTs, which are used as part of OrbeonProtocols' &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; security mechanism. If a startup hits its target, the contract is &ldquo;Filled,&rdquo; and funds are released. However, if targets are missed, the contract is &ldquo;Killed,&rdquo; and investors are refunded. This creates a solution that supports startups while protecting investors. </p>
<p>To guarantee investor safety, Orbeon Protocol has locked ORBN liquidity for a decade and team tokens are locked for one year to prevent any risk of a rug pull. The Orbeon Protocol smart contract has also been audited by Solid Proof to guarantee the legitimacy of the project. </p>
<p>ORBN has a total supply of 888 million, and 40% of its supply will be sold to the public during the presale. The additional supply will be used for exchange listings, team tokens, reserve tokens, marketing, legal advice, and the Orbeon foundation.</p>
<p>Investors who get in early will have access to a number of bonuses, including staking rewards, governance rights, priority access to funding rounds, and access to an exclusive VIP investor group known as the &ldquo;Winners Circle.&rdquo; With so much to offer, experts speculate Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could surge 6000% from its initial price of $0.004, hitting highs of $0.24 before the end of its presale.</p>
<p class="s9">Tron Community Rallies After Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Tron is a unique blockchain-based project in that it didn&rsquo;t bring anything new to the market upon release in 2017. Instead, Tron combined the best tried and tested features to enhance user experience and design. </p>
<p>Predominantly focused on the Asia market, Tron heavily advertised its founder, Justin Sun, to build a community of supporters with great success. So much so that in 2018, the Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer content-based platform. </p>
<p>Tron's native token, TRON, remained stable over the past month with a 0.24% price increase. Now, investors speculate that TRON could bounce back in price in 2023, reaching its previous all-time high of $0.2317. </p>
