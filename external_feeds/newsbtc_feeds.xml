					<description><![CDATA[Since the Bitcoin price reached a new yearly high of $31,840 last week, only to invalidate the bullish breakout within a few hours and fall towards $30,000, there has been a strange tranquility in the market. Already since June 23, BTC has been in the trading range between $29,800 and $31,300, with every breakout attempt to the upside and downside having failed within a very short period of time. However, one of the most prominent technical indicators, the Bollinger Bands, predict that this calm may soon be over. Created by the esteemed trader John Bollinger, these bands provide invaluable insights into market volatility and potential price levels. Bollinger Bands Predict Big Move For Bitcoin The Bollinger Bands consist of three distinct lines on a price chart: the middle band, the upper band, and the lower band. The middle band is a simple moving average (SMA) that represents the average price over a specified period. The upper and lower bands are derived from the middle band, with the upper band usually set two standard deviations above the SMA, and the lower band set two standard deviations below it. Related Reading: $18 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin Accumulated At $30,200 – BTC Bull Run Incoming? The primary purpose of the Bollinger Bands is to measure market volatility. When the price of an asset experiences significant fluctuations, the bands widen, indicating increased volatility. Conversely, during periods of reduced price movement, the bands contract, indicating lower volatility. This contraction is commonly referred to as a &#8220;squeeze,&#8221; where the upper and lower bands come closer together, forming a narrowing price channel. When the Bollinger Bands squeeze, the potential for a significant price movement looms. The squeeze suggests that the market is in a state of temporary equilibrium, akin to a coiled spring ready to release its stored energy. The direction of the breakout determines whether it&#8217;s a bullish or bearish signal. Up Or Down? Glassnode, a respected on-chain data provider, highlighted today the current state of the Bitcoin market, noting a remarkably low volatility environment. The 20-day Bollinger Bands are experiencing an extreme squeeze, with a mere 4.2% price range separating the upper and lower bands. This suggests that Bitcoin is currently in a period of limited price movement, “making this the quietest Bitcoin market since the lull in early January.” As Bitcoin investors may remember, the Bollinger Bands squeeze in January marked the end of a lengthy downtrend. After the FTX collapse, the BTC market was in a state of shock paralysis, which was ultimately resolved by Bollinger Bands squeeze, leading to a 42% price increase in 26 days. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin &#38; Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery The Bollinger Bands&#8217; squeeze, combined with diminishing trading volumes, creates a scenario of mounting pressure in the Bitcoin market. As trading volume declines, the potential energy stored in this coiled spring intensifies. According to the analysts at CryptoCon, the bullish scenario is the one to be favored at the moment. &#8220;When Bitcoin volatility gets low in a bear market, it&#8217;s very bearish. When volatility gets low in a bull market, it&#8217;s insanely bullish,&#8221; the analysts say. As Bitcoin is unanimously seen to be at the start of a new bull market, a strong move to the upside could be in store. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A record 592,000 Bitcoin, or roughly $17.8 billion, was accumulated when the coin was trading at $30,200, recent Glassnode data indicates. At this accumulation rate, suggesting possible demand, more entities bought more coins at the second fastest pace in the network&#8217;s history. This record was only broken when 637,000 BTC were bought at an average price of $16,500. 592,000 Bitcoin Bought At $30,200 The spike in Bitcoin accumulated at this price point preceded the decision by a United States court to rule that XRP, an altcoin issued from the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is a commodity, just like Bitcoin. The ruling on Friday, July 14, was received positively by the crypto community and temporarily lifted prices, sustaining Bitcoin above the psychological $30,000 mark. According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted Economic Ratio Per Day (ERPD) is a metric designed to assess economic activity within the network, considering the number of entities participating. This metric is calculated by dividing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio by the entity-adjusted on-chain volume. In on-chain analysis, the NVT ratio represents the relationship between the market capitalization and the recorded on-chain trading volumes at a specific price point.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A record 592,000 Bitcoin, or roughly $17.8 billion, was accumulated when the coin was trading at $30,200, recent Glassnode <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1678357739905400832" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data</a> indicates. At this accumulation rate, suggesting possible demand, more entities bought more coins at the second fastest pace in the network&#8217;s history. This record was only broken when 637,000 BTC were bought at an average price of $16,500.</p>
<h2><strong>592,000 Bitcoin Bought At $30,200</strong></h2>
<p>The spike in Bitcoin accumulated at this price point preceded the decision by a United States court to rule that XRP, an altcoin issued from the XRP Ledger (XRPL), is a commodity, just like Bitcoin. The ruling on Friday, July 14, was received positively by the crypto community and temporarily lifted prices, sustaining Bitcoin above the psychological $30,000 mark.</p>

<p>According to Glassnode, the Bitcoin Entity-Adjusted Economic Ratio Per Day (ERPD) is a metric designed to assess economic activity within the network, considering the number of entities participating. This metric is calculated by dividing the Network Value to Transactions (NVT) ratio by the entity-adjusted on-chain volume. </p>
<p>In on-chain analysis, the NVT ratio represents the relationship between the market capitalization and the recorded on-chain trading volumes at a specific price point. A higher NVT ratio indicates a greater value than recorded trading volumes.</p>

<p>While the NVT reading can be useful, it can also be misleading if the entities, or clustered addresses, involved in transactions are not accounted for. To correct this error, the ERPD integrates addresses involved at that price point, used in taking account of the market cap. This way, it can be easy to gauge the entities and total coins involved.</p>
<h2><strong>Shifting Sentiment?</strong></h2>
<p>The surge in Bitcoin ERPD development will also likely impact altcoins. Considering its liquidity and support across the board, Bitcoin sets the tone for other altcoins in crypto.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) has faced a significant challenge in the form of the December 2022 low. This crucial level has proved a formidable barrier for SHIB bulls, thwarting their attempts to increase prices.  Despite recent upside movements, the resistance at this level has proven to be persistent, creating a precarious situation for the cryptocurrency.  As the price of SHIB hovers in this area, the question arises: Will the selling pressure overpower the bulls&#8217; determination and cause a reversal in the price action? Shiba Inu Faces Bearish Order Block And Potential Liquidity Hunt SHIB faces a significant challenge as its December 2022 low coincides with a bearish order block (OB) ranging from $0.00000785 to $0.00000824. This particular range, as highlighted in a recent SHIB price report, could serve as a stronghold for bearish sentiment in the market.

					<description><![CDATA[In the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the recent order granting in part and denying in part the motion for Summary Judgment by Judge Torres has left many XRP investors eagerly awaiting the next steps. To shed some light on the situation, prominent attorney Jeremy Hogan has shared his thoughts on the matter, offering valuable insights into the potential appeal process with deadlines and its implications for both parties involved. Ripple Vs. SEC: The Next Possible Deadline Hogan, a seasoned attorney with experience in appeals, cautions that appeals are typically pursued after a case is completely finished. “After the final judgment is entered, either party has 60 days to appeal,” says Hogan who emphasized that the Ripple case is not yet finalized, any potential appeal at this stage would be considered an &#8220;interlocutory appeal.&#8221; Related Reading: XRP Explodes With 1,300% Surge In Trading Volume As crypto Exchanges Jump On Board “As far as I can see in the Rules, you have 10 days to notice an interlocutory appeal”, states Hogan. Since the Summary Judgment was issued on July 13, an appeal by the SEC or Ripple Labs would have to be filed by July 23 at the latest (or by July 24 if the deadline does not start until the following day). This means that next Monday at the latest it will become public whether one of the parties files an appeal. But an interlocutory appeal is rarely granted and generally requires compelling reasons, such as the release of significant information that could impact the case. However, Hogan points out that Judge Torres did not certify her ruling for immediate review, indicating that an interlocutory appeal might not be granted in this scenario. This suggests that the SEC and Ripple would need to wait for a final judgment before pursuing an appeal. Hogan believes that both parties might ultimately choose not to appeal for various reasons. According to the lawyer, the SEC might hesitate to appeal because, even if successful, it could potentially jeopardize their overall case. Winning the appeal would retract some unfavorable aspects of the trial-level case. However, if the SEC were to lose at the appellate level, it could set a precedent that all courts in the 2nd DCA (Second District Court of Appeals) would have to follow, amplifying the impact of their loss. Related Reading: Large Exchanges Relist XRP Following Ripple Victory Over SEC On the other hand, Hogan believes that Ripple may opt not to appeal if it can afford to pay the fine and if the ruling&#8217;s effect on its business, particularly the aspect concerning the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) feature, is manageable. These factors, combined with the fact that Ripple secured a favorable outcome in the ruling, might dissuade them from pursuing an appeal. When considering the potential difficulties in winning an appeal, Hogan emphasizes that Judge Torres is the one who has meticulously reviewed the entire case record. This makes the appellate process inherently challenging for either party, further reducing the likelihood of an appeal. Regarding the SEC&#8217;s challenge in appealing the secondary market sales aspect, which presents a problematic area for the regulatory body, Hogan admits that he hasn&#8217;t solidified his thoughts on the matter yet. XRP Price The XRP price has taken a breather after the stunning rally following the Ripple summary judgment. After being rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.93, the XRP price is currently trading at $0.7481. After a possible retest of the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.68, the impulsive move may see a continuation. The final verdict in the Ripple v. SEC case and possible appeals will certainly continue to have a strong impact on the price. Featured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The value and popularity of TerraUSD Classic, or USTC, the algorithmic stablecoin of the Terra Classic (LUNC) ecosystem, have skyrocketed recently. Today, the stablecoin makes a surprise rally, sparking a great deal of interest among investors and cryptocurrency aficionados. The sharp growth in USTC could be an indication of a sharp rise in demand and emphasizes the market&#8217;s rising confidence in this stablecoin. Data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows USTC trading at $0.0186, notching a 24-hour increase in value of 21.4%. In the last seven days, the stablecoin registered an impressive 58% rally, causing its trading volume to balloon to a solid 409%. Source: Coingecko USTC Organic Growth Pushes Stablecoin Up Despite the fact that the causes of this upswing are yet unknown, the recent spike in USTC&#8217;s value shows organic growth. &#8220;Organic growth&#8221; refers to the increase in value of USTC that occurs naturally, without the influence of external factors or artificial means. Related Reading: Dogecoin Engagement Fails To Impress, Raising Concerns About Broader Interest It suggests that the growth is the result of the company&#8217;s internal operations, strategies, and market dynamics, rather than being driven by external factors such as acquisitions, mergers, or financial manipulations. After it was de-pegged more than a year ago, USTC saw a huge price decline. Since USTC is a stablecoin with a 1:1 tie to the USD, its price should always be $1. The stablecoin has since traded at lower prices, reaching a 52-week high of $0.06 during that time. There are signs, nevertheless, that USTC could revisit the $1 level and recoup its worth. Total market cap of cryptocurrencies as of today stood at $1.17 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com The TerraUSD Classic de-pegging caused major difficulties for the larger digital currency ecosystem, and its effects are still being felt today. A few Web3.0 firms with exposure to its parent company Terraform Labs went out of business in addition to the more than 99% decline in price of its linked cryptocurrency, Terra Classic.

The implosion of FTX Derivatives Exchange was finally driven by the bankruptcies of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which prolonged the crypto winter even further. Meanwhile, in order to expand supply and rekindle interest in the stablecoin, the Terra Classic community is launching projects like staking and burning LUNC tokens while also working to improve infrastructure. Source: Coingecko Will The Terra Classic Stablecoin Retest $1? There is growing consensus that the TerraUSD Classic token is steadily approaching a retesting of the significant $1 price level. Among investors and enthusiasts alike, this strong rising trend has spurred new optimism. As the TerraUSD Classic token gains momentum, it boosts community members&#8217; faith in its capability to uphold its pegged value and function as a dependable digital asset. The community may become excited and eager in anticipation of a probable retest of the $1 price level, which would improve the outlook for TerraUSD Classic&#8217;s long-term prospects.

<h2><strong>USTC Organic Growth Pushes Stablecoin Up</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the fact that the causes of this upswing are yet unknown, the recent spike in USTC&#8217;s value shows <a href="https://thegww.com/huge-surge-in-value-and-trading-volume-of-terrausd-classic-delights-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organic growth.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Organic growth&#8221; refers to the increase in value of USTC that occurs naturally, without the influence of external factors or artificial means.</p>

<p>It suggests that the growth is the result of the company&#8217;s internal operations, strategies, and market dynamics, rather than being driven by external factors such as acquisitions, mergers, or financial manipulations.</p>
<p>After it was de-pegged more than a year ago, USTC saw a huge price decline. Since USTC is a stablecoin with a 1:1 tie to the USD, its price should always be $1.</p>
<p>The stablecoin has since traded at lower prices, reaching a 52-week high of $0.06 during that time. There are signs, nevertheless, that USTC could revisit the $1 level and recoup its worth.</p>

<p>The TerraUSD Classic de-pegging caused major difficulties for the larger digital currency ecosystem, and its effects are still being felt today.</p>
<p>A few Web3.0 firms with exposure to its parent company Terraform Labs went out of business in addition to the more than 99% decline in price of its linked cryptocurrency, Terra Classic.</p>

<p>The implosion of FTX Derivatives Exchange was finally driven by the bankruptcies of Celsius Network and Voyager Digital, which prolonged the crypto winter even further.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in order to expand supply and rekindle interest in the stablecoin, the Terra Classic community is launching projects like staking and burning LUNC tokens while also working to improve infrastructure.</p>

<h2><strong>Will The Terra Classic Stablecoin Retest $1?</strong></h2>
<p>There is growing consensus that the TerraUSD Classic token is steadily approaching a retesting of the significant $1 price level. Among investors and enthusiasts alike, this strong rising trend has spurred new optimism.</p>
<p>As the TerraUSD Classic token gains momentum, it boosts community members&#8217; faith in its capability to uphold its pegged value and function as a dependable digital asset.</p>
<p>The community may become excited and eager in anticipation of a probable retest of the $1 price level, which would improve the outlook for TerraUSD Classic&#8217;s long-term prospects.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[SNX, the native token of the Synthetix Network, has been on the rise, gaining more than 35% in the past week. The cryptocurrency continues to exhibit strong bullish momentum, having registered a positive market performance over the past few weeks. SNX’s recent price surge has been linked to the positive sentiment surrounding the Synthetix network. A few days ago, the protocol announced its plan to release a new decentralized exchange (DEX).

US District Judge Annalisa Torres delivered a landmark judgment declaring the XRP token as non-security, thereby granting a decisive triumph for Ripple. However, unlike other cryptocurrencies, the price of SNX barely reacted to this piece of news. The token’s value increased by a mere 5% following the announcement of the court’s decision. SNX did experience a surge of its own the following day. On Friday, July 14, the token’s price jumped by nearly 40%, touching the $3 level before retracing back to $2.5. As of this writing, the Synthetix token is valued at $2.82, with an 8% price increase in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $903.4 million, SNX ranks as the 47th-biggest cryptocurrency, according to CoinGecko data. SNXUSD trading at $2.738 &#124; Source: SNXUSD chart from TradingView The recent increase in SNX&#8217;s price is believed to have been triggered by the announcement of a new Synthetix trading product. In a blogpost released on Friday, the protocol&#8217;s founder Kain Warwick unveiled plans to introduce a new derivatives front-end called Infinex. What Is Infinex? Infinex is a new derivatives front-end to the decentralized trading infrastructure of Synthetix. The exchange is expected to be an improvement on the already-existing Kwenta, Synthetix’s derivatives decentralized exchange on Optimism. According to Kain Warwick, Infinex will remove the impediments to the growth of Synthetix&#8217;s decentralized trading ecosystem. Firstly, it will address the inconvenience of acquiring sUSD, Synthetix’s stablecoin, to begin trading on Kwenta. Also, it will eliminate the need to sign every action on the current platform. Warwick claims that the purpose of Infinex is to provide competition for centralized exchanges (CEXs) while eliminating any uncertainty surrounding decentralized perpetuals (Perps). The blogpost also revealed that Infinex will cater to users familiar with CEX platforms, providing its trading services through a username and password. With this, users would be able to generate a public-private key pair, which will be locally stored in the browser. It is worth noting that this key pair is not designed for fund withdrawals. Instead, it would be used to sign trades on the upcoming decentralized exchange. While the blogpost didn&#8217;t reveal the exact launch date of Infinex, it disclosed that the project’s introduction should come alongside the release of Synthetix’s Perps V3.  Related Reading: Stablecoin TrueUSD To Be Fully Controlled By Asian Owner Featured image from Adobe Stock, chart from TradingView]]></description>
