										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ethereum Layer 2 network Starknet launched on the Georli test network for voting on Starknet v0.12.0 on July 4.</em></li>



<li><em>Deployment to the mainnet is expected on July 12 after a frozen period on July 11.</em></li>



<li><em>The upcoming release focuses on improving network performance and reducing transaction latency.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On July 4, the Ethereum Layer 2 network Starknet was launched on the Georli test network to commence voting for <a href="https://coincu.com/199386-starknet-0-12-0-upgrade-better-ux-lower-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Starknet v0.12.0</strong>.</a></strong></h5>

<p>The test voting period has started and will finish on July 6. After that, the formal voting for Starknet v0.12.0 will begin, and it is slated to conclude on July 10. According to the vote results, Starknet v0.12.0 is likely to be deployed to the mainnet on July 12 after the frozen period on July 11.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/194137-why-is-starknet-ecosystem-explosive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StarkNet</a> is an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that takes the shape of a ZK-Rollup. Because of StarkNet&#8217;s dependency on the STARK system &#8211; StarkWare&#8217;s technological development &#8211; any dApp may run, function, and expand endlessly without jeopardizing Ethereum&#8217;s capacity to aggregate and protect.</p>

<p>The network contract and operating system are developed in the Cairo programming language, which allows for the deployment and scalability of Dapps or smart contracts independent of business logic.</p>



<p>Starknet had announced that the new mainnet would be available in a matter of weeks. Moreover, the Starknet literature states that the future Starknet v0.12.0 release will concentrate on boosting network performance to increase scaling and transaction latency.</p>



<p>A new Rust implementation of Sequencer will be created to do this. The Sequencer incorporates more efficient local storage and critical route logic to drastically cut transaction confirmation wait times and alleviate network congestion.</p>



<p>The suggested architecture for the Starknet Alpha v0.12.0 upgrade plan is as follows, according to the Starknet governance page:</p>



<ul>
<li>Integration period: the stable version is integrated during the first 7 days.</li>



<li>Testnet period: deployment on the Goerli testnet in the first three days, followed by five days of voting, and finally one day of waiting (Freeze period).</li>
</ul>



<p>Install the main network the next day for a total of 17 days.</p>

<p>Yesterday, ParaSpace announced its decision to<a href="https://coincu.com/199951-paraspace-temporarily-suspend-azukis-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> temporarily suspend</a> Azuki&#8217;s team, including deposits, withdrawals, and liquidations. This measure is intended to give users more time to replenish liquidity, repay debt and improve health.</p>



<p>The decision was made in connection with the recent Azuki ecosystem collections that received a lot of criticism from the community for disappointing them with the new Elemental collection.</p>

<p>After the crisis of confidence broke out in Azuki, the price collapsed by more than 50% within 7 days. Amid insufficient liquidity, NFT lending platform ParaSpace abruptly suspended the liquidation of Azuki&#8217;s collateral yesterday, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in bad debt.</p>



<p>While the official stated that the move is intended to give users more time to replenish liquidity, repay debt, and improve health, the liquidation will continue after that. And the lending platform says any shortfall at the end of the suspension will be covered by ParaSpace&#8217;s reserves. But it should be noted that ParaSpace&#8217;s losses could continue to spread without stabilizing Azuki&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>At a time when the market is facing major challenges from the sharp decline in market prices, lending contracts need to prove their worth for an illiquid asset like NFT.</p>



<p>ParaSpace is a Lending project that the community notices in the NFTFi array. Although it has only just launched the mainnet version, the platform has surpassed BendDAO to lead the TVL ranking of NFT Lending projects.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data analytics firm Lookonchain, the Storj Team has deposited 2.5 million tokens, equivalent to $1.22 million, on Binance. Investors need to pay attention to the bull trap.</strong></h5>

<p>Looking at this token&#8217;s spike in price chart and the project&#8217;s questionable behavior, it may be necessary for investors to question whether this rally can continue or is just a bull trap and can disappoint investors with the upcoming downtrend.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>However, Against Bitcoin, after trading over the past few days, the bulls have shown great commitment to STORJ trading by following the recent positive sign. Furthermore, the current market trend could continue to move upwards if buyers can sustain further pressure.</p>



<p>Of the 30 assets in the computing sector, Storj holds 1.14% of the market cap at $211,934,048. Currently, the circulating supply 408,576,965 STORJ and total supply 424,999,998 STORJ.</p>



<p>The reason for the latest price action in STORJ is attributed to Koreans being the STORJ/KRW trading pair on the country&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, Upbit, currently accounting for 57.78% of the total volume of assets.</p>



<p>Storj, the platform runs on the Ethereum blockchain and allows anyone to store files without having to navigate a centralized data center. It will enable users to rent excess space and reliably store and return data for a low fee.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cardano&#8217;s TVL in DeFi reaches an all-time high, indicating a growing interest in Cardano&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem.</em></li>



<li><em>Cardano stands out as one of the few protocols with a positive development trajectory in the DeFi space.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite positive growth, ADA faces regulatory challenges from the US SEC, which classified ADA as a security token.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano (ADA) is seeing its positive growth towards decentralized finance (DeFi), while the current price movement remains largely unchanged.</strong></h5>

<p>According to data from the <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Cardano?currency=ADA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFiLlama</a> aggregator, ADA Total Value Locked (TVL) across DeFi ecosystems has risen to an all-time high, with the increase being maintained steadily from the start of 2023 to present. </p>



<p>At the present time, TVL on DeFi platforms reaches over $210 million, representing 2% of the current total supply of <a href="https://coincu.com/199869-what-will-cardano-do-at-the-0-3-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADA</a>. It is still one of the coins with the highest market capitalization in the crypto market.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-1024x306.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="306" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-1024x306.png" alt="Exciting: Cardano Total Value Locked In DeFi Hit All-Time High" class="wp-image-200109" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-1024x306.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-300x90.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-768x230.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-1536x459.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-2048x613.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-750x224.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-05-at-10.16.45-1140x341.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Exciting: Cardano Total Value Locked In DeFi Hit All-Time High 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Although this amount is not being supplemented in Dollar terms because of the token&#8217;s price drop, it does demonstrate how much interest investors have in the Cardano DeFi universe.</p>



<p>The statistics revealed that although many blockchain protocols paint a rosy picture of a booming DeFi world, real-world facts suggest that Cardano is one of the only protocols with a positive development trajectory.</p>



<p>If the measure just tracked the number of mentions, a thread with a high number of mentions may boost the count on its own, even if mentions were low elsewhere on social media. As a result, to gain a more accurate reflection of the trend in the larger market, the social volume only takes into account unique postings.</p>



<p>However, in terms of macro factors, <a href="https://coincu.com/195399-cardano-saw-the-biggest-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano</a> is facing unfavorable factors from the US authorities, namely the U.S. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has designated ADA as a security token in its lawsuits with US exchanges, which caused its price to plummet in early June.</p>

<p>Revolut is also moving to delist ADA in the United States after the token were listed as securities by the <a href="https://coincu.com/199277-sec-says-bitcoin-etf-inadequate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC</a> last month, causing a decline in ADA trading volume on centralized exchange platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The STORJ token has increased by more than 46% in the past 24 hours.</em></li>



<li><em>Upbit STORJ/KRW, Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, contributes 57.04% of the total spot trading volume of about $259 million.</em></li>



<li><em>On Binance, STORJ/USDT is trading at $0.4917, while on Upbit, the price is $0.5022.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The STORJ token has increased by more than 46% in the past 24 hours. STORJ/KRW on <strong><a href="https://coincu.com/199044-bitcoin-cash-bch-price-skyrockets-to-325-driven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Upbit</a></strong>, Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, contributes 57.04% of the entire spot trading volume.</strong></h5>

<p>In the midst of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price decline due to the strong influence of Bitcoin and Ethereum, STOJI emerged as one of the most muscular bulls, with a significant price increase in the past 24 hours. Currently, the token is trading at $0.50, up 46.2% in the last 24h and up 91% in the previous 7 days.</p>

<p>The reason for the latest price action in STORJ token can be attributed to the fact that Koreans are the STORJ/KRW trading pair on the country&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, currently accounting for 57.04% of the total volume of crypto assets, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>



<p>In fact, on Binance, STORJ/USDT is trading at $0.4917, while on Upbit, the price is $0.502. For those unaware of South Korea&#8217;s crypto scene, the country&#8217;s retail traders are known for driving up coin prices.</p>

<p>STORJ is the native token of Storj, which uses blockchain technology and peer-to-peer protocols to provide private, encrypted, decentralized, and secure cloud storage.</p>



<p>The project&#8217;s white paper was first published in 2014, and the latest version of Storj was released in 2019. Shawn Wilkinson and John Quinn co-founded Storj Labs, the company behind the Storj platform, in 2014. Originally, Storj was launched on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, but in 2017 it switched to Ethereum.</p>



<p>That same year, Storj Labs raised 910 BTC (about $460,000) in a public sale. Then in 2017, the company raised $3 million in seed funding only to raise $30 million in a token sale later that year. The project has the backing of venture capital firms such as Google Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures, and Techstars Ventures.</p>



<p>Out of a total supply of 424,999.998 million STORJ tokens, currently, 408,576,965 million STORJ tokens are circulating in the market with a market capitalization of $205,380,775.</p>



<p>Powered by blockchain technology, decentralized storage solutions like Filecoin, Storj, and Arweave slice your data into small pieces and then store the packets on linked pseudo-computers (nodes) with a decentralized network. Here, files are protected by a network that includes many different stakeholders instead of a single company.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Delio transferred $7 million in virtual assets before suspending deposits and withdrawals.</em></li>



<li><em>CEO Jeong Sang-ho&#8217;s lack of disclosure sparked controversy.</em></li>



<li><em>The company is being investigated for fraud, and victims have filed a case against the CEO.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=3283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Digital Asset</em></a>, Delio moved all of its virtual assets worth 9.2 billion won (about $7 million) 7 hours before it ceased accepting deposits and withdrawals on June 14, according to Digital Asset, a crypto lending service.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-249.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="813" height="457" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-249.png" alt="BREAKING: Delio Transferred All $7 Million In Crypto Right Before The Incident" class="wp-image-200096" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-249.png 813w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-249-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-249-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-249-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px" title="BREAKING: Delio Transferred All $7 Million In Crypto Right Before The Incident 17"></a></figure></div>


<p>Controversy is predicted since Deliona CEO Jeong Sang-ho did not alert anybody about the purchase. For instance, on June 14, shortly after the suspension of deposits and withdrawals, he stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;All rumors floating around in the community, such as customer virtual asset withdrawal, fraudulent accounting, and cashing using the employee&#8217;s personal name, are not true.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The victims acquired the Delio deposit wallet address. The circumstances behind the company&#8217;s transfer of all virtual assets prior to the suspension of deposits and withdrawals, as well as the purpose of their subsequent usage, will only be revealed via a mandatory inquiry by the prosecution.</p>



<p>On June 14, 125 Bitcoin and 719 Ether were moved from the Delio wallet, and 4.97 million XRP was taken to three anonymous wallet addresses, according to the complete transfer information. Soon after the withdrawal, 0.98 Bitcoin, 4.66 Ether, and 9980 XRP were transferred back into the wallet, although this was a relatively minor sum in comparison to the withdrawal amount.</p>



<p>As of June 30, the firm was <a href="https://coincu.com/199209-delio-under-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under investigation</a> by the country&#8217;s Financial Services Commission (FSC). The FSC charged <a href="https://coincu.com/198064-delio-resumes-deposits-and-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delio</a> with fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust in connection with its unilateral decision to stop consumers&#8217; deposits and withdrawals on June 14.</p>

<p>On June 16, the Delio victims filed a case with the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, accusing CEO Jung Sang-ho of fraud and other offenses.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/195747-haru-invest-delio-action-lawsuits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haru Invest</a>, Delio&#8217;s sibling company, halted withdrawals and deposits on June 13, alleging a problem with a consignment operator. Delio followed suit the next day, most likely owing to counterparty exposure. Haru Invest is said to have laid off the bulk of its employees after the announcement. According to the firm, it is presently pursuing legal action against its service provider.</p>

<p>CEO Jeong lied on the day of the Haru Investment deposit and withdrawal ban, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We have nothing to do with the Haru deposit and withdrawal suspension.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MakerDAO announced on Twitter that their DeFi Spark Protocol lending protocol would be extended to multiple chains.</em></li>



<li><em>The steps and processes for implementing Spark in specific domains (each blockchain network) are also shared.</em></li>



<li><em>Block Analitica will assess collateral and recommend risk parameters for collateral in Spark on the new domain.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://coincu.com/199466-makerdao-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MakerDAO </a>announced on Twitter that their DeFi lending protocol <strong>Spark Protocol</strong></strong> <strong>would be extended to multiple chains and announced the steps and process of implementing Spark Protocol in specific domains (each blockchain network).</strong></h5>

<p>To implement Spark Protocol in a new domain, you must create a Maker forum post in the SubDAO TWO category (basics, technical info, collateral info, info required, liquidity, etc.).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is your opportunity to contribute to the multi-chain future of the Maker ecosystem.<br><br>Spark Protocol is going multi-chain, and preparing for its deployments across diverse domains.<br><br>If you&#39;re interested in deploying Spark Protocol in a specific domain, follow these steps:<br><br>↓ <a href="https://t.co/w6A7ao5fQ4" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/w6A7ao5fQ4</a></p>&mdash; Maker (@MakerDAO) <a href="https://twitter.com/MakerDAO/status/1676277546856628224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Domain refers to various blockchain networks, including sidechains and layer 2 solutions.</p>



<p>Phoenix Labs will evaluate submitted proposals and provide MakerDAO with recommendations for new domain names and collateral information to include. In addition, Block Analitica will perform collateral assessment and recommend risk parameters for collateral in Spark on the new domain.</p>



<p>Domain and collateral reviews will be published on Maker Forums. These reviews will provide valuable insight to MKR owners when making decisions regarding Spark deployment on a new domain.</p>



<p>MakerDao, a decentralized autonomous organization operating on the Ethereum blockchain and issuing stablecoin DAI, recently <a href="https://coincu.com/185919-makerdao-spark-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch of its latest DeFi product, Spark Protocol.</p>



<p>The news was shared via MakerDao&#8217;s official Twitter account, which states that Spark Protocol will be available to all DeFi users starting May 9, 2023.</p>

<p>Spark is a DAI and end-user-focused DeFi product that will be deployed on Ethereum. The product must offer lending features for ETH, stETH, DAI, and sDAI. The first version of Spark Protocol, Spark Lend, will be a lending marketplace specifically designed for providing and borrowing cryptocurrencies, focusing on DAI.</p>



<p>Spark users can interact directly with Spark&#8217;s user interface, which will connect Maker liquidity to a complete DeFi solution. MakerDAO has stated that Spark is one of many enhancements that the Endgame Era will bring to the MakerDAO ecosystem, enabling a groundbreaking solution that can only arise from the connection between the DeFi product and Maker Protocol.</p>

<p>ERC-6551 is a new Ethereum standard that allows any ERC-721 token to possess a smart contract account in order to construct a Token-bound account (TBA). This enables ERC-721 coins to own assets and interact with apps without altering current ERC-721 smart contracts or infrastructure.</p>



<p>The ERC-6551 standard is a considerable improvement over the ERC-721 standard, allowing the NFT to have more functionality and compatibility. The standard NFTs, for example, may host other NFTs, engage in DeFi applications, and interact with smart contracts.</p>



<p>ERC-6551 is still in the works, but it has the potential to transform the NFT sector in the future. It may increase the value and use of NFTs by enhancing their functionality.</p>



<p>This standard offers several advantages, some of which are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Increasing NFT functionality: This standard allows NFTs to own other NFTs, engage in DeFi applications, and interact with smart contracts. This expands the use cases for NFTs, making them a more valuable asset.</li>



<li>Increased security: Since smart contracts safeguard token-bound accounts, they are more secure than conventional wallets. This makes NFT storage even more secure.</li>



<li>Improved interoperability: The NFT ERC-6551 may be utilized on a variety of systems and applications. As a result, they are more adaptable and accessible to a wider variety of users.</li>
</ul>



<p>Despite several infrastructural and security concerns, ERC-6551 is nevertheless seen as a crucial step forward for NFT, making NFT more relevant to Web3 consumers rather than only being a trading asset.</p>
