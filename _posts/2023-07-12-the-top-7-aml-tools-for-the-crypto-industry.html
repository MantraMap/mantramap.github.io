<p>With industry-wide crackdowns from the likes of the SEC and exacting regulatory demands coming into force in Europe, it&rsquo;s never been more crucial to implement proper AML procedures.</p>
<p>The crypto industry has received bad press from various mainstream media sources citing how crypto can be used for all kinds of nefarious practices, money laundering in particular. Be that as it may, cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology, and therefore transactions are inherently transparent, and the trail of a suspected wrongdoer can usually be followed.</p>
<p>However, there are always ways and means that a bad actor, who wishes to circumvent anti-money laundering (AML) processes, can employ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key aspect of AML compliance is the implementation of transaction monitoring systems, such as Know Your Transaction (KYT). KYT involves real-time monitoring of individual transactions to identify suspicious activities, while the verification of addresses helps assess the legitimacy of wallet addresses involved in cryptocurrency transactions, mitigating risks associated with high-risk entities.</p>
<p>In a September 2022 article, the World Economic Forum (WEF) reported a 1,964% increase in cryptocurrencies that are laundered by way of decentralised finance (DeFi). This percentage was equivalent to around $900 million in laundered value.</p>
<p>To combat this type of activity, blockchain analytics tools and experts have made their niche in the market and are being used by companies in their struggle to become and remain compliant. Companies that provide this kind of service normally also offer the ability for a client to be able to fully investigate blockchain transactions as part of their AML responsibilities.</p>
<p>As the crypto sector seeks clarity in the regulatory environment in order to become a more accepted part of the financial system, complying with AML requirements will surely be a non-negotiable item on this path.</p>
How Does Funds Tracing Work On The Blockchain?
<p>Blockchain analytics is a form of data science focused on the analysis, identification, and clustering of data on the blockchain, which is a digitally distributed public ledger. In other words, blockchain analytics is a method that companies use to investigate blockchain transactions and flag potentially fraudulent or illicit activities.</p>
<p>Blockchain analytics involves scraping data from crypto transactions, analysing wallets, and clustering wallets with similar typologies. Analytics providers can create a database and group wallets with similar typologies into clusters. This is an integral step when discovering both the source and destination of illicit funds. Law enforcement agencies and businesses utilise blockchain analytics to combat fraud, enhance compliance, and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>According to the US-based security website CSO Online a crucial part of the puzzle is identifying various addresses that might be linked to the same wallet, and then finding out who owns it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Knowing the exact entity behind a batch of addresses can be crucial, and blockchain intelligence companies have ways of finding that. They aggregate information from multiple sources, often using off-chain data to enrich their understanding of transactions. They look at dark web forums, social media posts, and court papers among others.&rdquo;</p>

How to Choose the Right Analytical and Business Protection Tools for Effective AML
<p>When it comes to selecting analytical and business protection tools for effective anti-money laundering, 4 key parameters should guide your decision-making process.</p>
<p>Firstly, prioritize a comprehensive and extensive database. The effectiveness of your AML or analytical solution relies on accurate risk identification and detection of suspicious activities.</p>
<p>Secondly, accessibility is essential, ensuring that businesses of all sizes can easily integrate the solution. The onboarding process should be user-friendly and the pricing structure should be affordable. This allows businesses to leverage AML services without facing significant barriers or excessive costs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, consider blockchain support. Your chosen provider should be compatible with a wide range of blockchains, including popular ones, enabling comprehensive monitoring and analysis across multiple networks.</p>
<p>Lastly, visualisation and user-friendliness play a vital role in selecting an analytics tool. The system should provide clear and intuitive visualisations of checks and analysis results. This simplifies the interpretation of data and facilitates informed decision-making.</p>
<p>Considering these 4 parameters when choosing analytical and business protection tools for effective AML will help businesses combat money laundering and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>
A comparison of the top 7 AML tools
<p>For crypto projects looking to become properly compliant as regards AML it behoves them to do their research into the leading proponents of blockchain investigation. To this end, the top 7 tools in this industry niche are compared below. Both compliance and analytics tools are considered.</p>
Chainalysis (https://www.chainalysis.com)
<p>Probably the most prominent transaction monitoring and investigation tool out there is Chainalysis, used by government and private agencies to trace and understand blockchain activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis uses its Reactor investigation software that seeks to connect the transactions with the entity behind them. In its transaction monitoring product called &ldquo;KYT&rdquo;, Chainalysis puts its identifications through a rigorous process and offers an API to access this data.</p>
<p>Accessibility for Different Businesses&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expensive and inaccessible for small companies. Chainalysis is known to be costly, making it unaffordable for small businesses to access their services. The entry barrier for smaller companies is high, limiting their ability to utilize Chainalysis effectively.</p>
<p>Database&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chainalysis boasts one of the most extensive and top-tier databases among all AML providers. Their database is known for its completeness, enabling thorough analysis and investigation of transactions.</p>
<p>Supported Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wide range, including popular blockchains.</p>
<p>Chainalysis offers a broad set of cross-chain visibility, covering a diverse range of blockchains. They support and analyse some of the most popular and widely used blockchains, enhancing their ability to track transactions across different networks.</p>
<p>The possible drawback of the Chainalysis offering is the lack of cross-chain visibility and an inability to view all address connections in EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<p>Visualisation and User-Friendliness</p>
<p>When it comes to visualisation and user-friendliness, Chainalysis falls within the average range. While their tools and interfaces are functional, they do not offer the highest level of user-friendliness compared to some other AML providers in the market.</p>
<p>It's important to note that Chainalysis is primarily used for transactional AML/CFT checks (&ldquo;KYT&rdquo;) Chainalysis also offers address screening; however it only shows a direct* exposure (meaning that it analyzes only direct transactions of a wallet).&nbsp;</p>
<p>*KYT transaction monitoring shows both direct and indirect exposure, while address verification is only for direct exposure.</p>
<p>Advanced tracing techniques include automatic peel chain detection and cross-chain graphing, all of which provide a comprehensive solution for de-anonymising wallet addresses.</p>
AMLBot (https://amlbot.com)
<p>AMLBot&rsquo;s one-stop solution includes the screening of all a client&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing transactions, plus wallets screening for AML compliance through integration of its API, with developers on hand to make sure the setup is seamless and conduct blockchain investigations in the case of discovered theft.</p>
