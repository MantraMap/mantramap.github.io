					<description><![CDATA[Mystic Stealer appeared recently that could target 40 browsers, 70 browser extensions, and electronic wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Binance, Rabby Wallet, OKX Wallet, OneKey]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The new Mystic Stealer malware is increasingly being used in attacks with a rental fee of $150/month.</em></li>



<li><em>According to reports, it can quickly attack 40 browsers and 70 browser extensions, and crypto-wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>Its first version was released in April but was quickly upgraded to version 1.2 at the end of May.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new information-stealing malware called &#8216;Mystic Stealer&#8217;, promoted on hacking forums and darknet markets since April 2023, quickly gained attention in the criminal community life by its devastation.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="610" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434.png" alt="New Software Mystic Stealer Can Attack 40 Browsers And 70 Browser Extensions" class="wp-image-196392" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434-300x183.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434-768x468.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1434-750x458.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="New Software Mystic Stealer Can Attack 40 Browsers And 70 Browser Extensions 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This malware can target all versions of Windows, including XP to 11, supporting 32 and 64-bit operating system architectures. It doesn&#8217;t need any dependencies, so its traces on infected systems are minimal, while it works in memory to avoid detection by anti-virus products.</p>



<p>SlowMist&#8217;s Director of Information Security tweeted that a new crypto-stealing software, Mystic Stealer, appeared recently that could target 40 browsers, 70 browser extensions, and electronic wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Binance, Rabby Wallet, OKX Wallet, OneKey, and other famous wallets are currently the most popular malware, be aware of the risks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr"><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />新的加密货币盗窃软件Mystic Stealer出现:针对40款浏览器、70款浏览器扩展、加密货币钱包进行攻击,如 MetaMask、Coinbase Wallet、Binance、Rabby Wallet、OKX Wallet、OneKey等知名钱包。它是目前最流行的恶意软件，注意风险。<a href="https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@SlowMist_Team</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Foresight_News?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Foresight_News</a> <a href="https://t.co/6o28zoRwVs" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/6o28zoRwVs</a></p>&mdash; 23pds (@IM_23pds) <a href="https://twitter.com/IM_23pds/status/1670973586667106305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Besides, this software also targets 21 crypto apps, 9 MFA and password manager apps, 55 crypto browser extensions, Steam and Telegram logins, and more.</p>



<p>The Mystic Stealer reports, published almost simultaneously in a joint report between InQuest and Zscaler and a separate report by <a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/outofband/mystic-stealer-evolving-stealth-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyfirma</a>, warn of the emergence of new malware and its level of sophistication, and an increase in sales brought in many new online campaigns.</p>



<p>It is known that Mystic Stealer released version 1.0 at the end of April 2023 but was quickly upgraded to version 1.2 at the end of May, showing that the project is in active development. It is currently rented at $150/month.</p>

<p>The project also operates a Telegram channel (Mystic Stealer News) where development news, feature requests, and other related topics are discussed.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the creator of the new malware accepts feedback from long-standing members of the underground hacking community and openly invites them to share suggestions for improving Mystic.</p>

<p>Cyfirma reports that space veterans have verified the effectiveness of the malware and confirmed that although in its early development state, it is a powerful information stealer.</p>



<p>While the future of Mystic Stealer is still up for debate, given the volatile nature of illegal MaaS projects, its emergence signals an increased risk to users and organizations.</p>

<p>Bitcoin began last week in a fairly lethargic fashion, trading at around $26,000. All eyes were on the United States as the CPI data and the Fed&#8217;s next FOMC meeting, both of which were due to be revealed and held this week.</p>



<p>The inflation numbers, which were released on Wednesday, showed a small decrease. Yet, this had little impact on BTC&#8217;s price movement. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve, rather predictably, chose to stop its monetary strategy of rising interest rates.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance last approached 50% in June 2022, when the whole crypto market crashed due to consistently rising inflation in the United States, prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy aggressively.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin&#8217;s market domination has increased by more than 10.5% since November 27, 2022, owing mostly to investors seeking a safe haven in the aftermath of the FTX crisis and rising governmental scrutiny of crypto assets in the United States.</p>



<p>As Bitcoin fell substantially at the moment, currencies like Ethereum (ETH) fell even more precipitously, with the ETH/BTC pair plunging to a ratio of only 0.05.</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s market valuation is a little more than $520 billion, but its dominance over altcoins is over 50%, the greatest level in over two years.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, BTC is trading at nearly $27,000.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Insolvent crypto firm FTX used $121.8 million to pay out lawsuits between February and April.</em></li>



<li><em>Of those, the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell collected $37.6 million in fees for the period, representing 30.9% of total fees and expenses.</em></li>



<li><em>The cost of the bankruptcy process is prompting some old customers to restart the exchange under new leadership to bring value to the customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to information collated by The Block Research, FTX advisers&#8217; filings from June 15 indicate fees and costs between February 1 and April 30 totaling $121.8 million.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Of those, the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell collected $37.6 million in fees for the period, representing 30.9% of total fees and expenses. Investment bank Jefferies charges as low as 0.6% of total fees and expenses.</p>



<p>Restructuring consultants at Alvarez and Marsel charged $37 million with over $1.1 million in expenses, including $51,225 in meals, $149,155 in accommodation, and other miscellaneous up to $1,995.</p>



<p>Rising costs due to the bankruptcy of FTX are prompting some old customers to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182345-ftx-exchange-rebooted-tribe-capital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunch</a> the exchange under new leadership to bring value to customers. One potential option discussed is for FTX creditors to convert part of their holdings into shares in a reopened exchange.</p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s lead attorney said that if that route were to be taken, the plan would need to raise significant capital and said there had been internal debate over whether that funding should come from FTX real estate&#8217;s capital or third-party capital.</p>



<p>In an unexpected twist, FTX was able to return money to its customers thanks to an explosion of AI.

<p>While it&#8217;s unclear if that specific number is accurate or the Anthropic market share it constitutes, the reality is that the business is currently valued at $4.6 billion &#8211; with the potential to soar due to the frenzy has taken over the industry after the boom started with the launch of ChatGPT 3.5 in the fall of 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Jeffrey Huang chittered to refute the previous accusations made by on-chain detective ZachXBT.</em></li>



<li><em>He said ZachXBT&#8217;s allegations that he misappropriated funds were false and unsubstantiated.</em></li>



<li><em>In response to the accusation about &#8220;Squid DAO,&#8221; Huang Licheng stated that he did not push up or sell or have any improper behavior.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeffrey Huang, a tech entrepreneur, former musician, and one of the largest NFT Bored Ape Yacht Club holders, warbled to contradict the prior round of claims made by on-chain investigator ZachXBT.</strong></h5>

<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/machibigbrother/status/1670819142050652160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that ZachXBT&#8217;s charges of misappropriation of money were untrue and baseless. First and foremost, he did not steal 22,000 ETH from Formosa Financial. He has no access to the multisig that sends the vault ETH, and none of the receiving addresses are his. CEO Ryan Terriblini and CTO Lorne Lantz are multi-signatories for Formosa Finance.</p>

<p>Second, in 2020, he turned up Cream Finance to other teams before it was assaulted again in August and October 2021. In February 2022, he re-administered the protocol and recovered monies for users harmed by the hack.</p>



<p>Moreover, in response to the &#8220;Squid DAO&#8221; charge, Huang Licheng declared that he did not push up, sell, or engage in any unlawful activity. He is associated with Squid DAO. He backed a plan to refund DAO money in January 2022, resulting in the return of nearly 12,000 ETH to Squid DAO members.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In a fresh development in the Ripple-SEC litigation, pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton contends that the SEC fails to apply the Howey Test to each transaction and that secondary XRP sales do not qualify as securities.</em></li>



<li><em>He cites the Second Circuit, stating that securities legislation does not apply when a purchaser intends to use or consume the acquired object.</em></li>



<li><em>The Ripple vs. SEC dispute, which has gone on for much too long, is anticipated to be resolved shortly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent step in the continuing legal dispute between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States (SEC), John Deaton, the founder of CryptoLaw and a pro-XRP lawyer, has made a bold remark hinting that the SEC cannot explain secondary XRP transactions as securities.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1024x576.png" alt="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities" class="wp-image-196358" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1536x864.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1420.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Deaton provided a hypothetical scenario of a progressive migration of XRP as a form of payment from Ripple down to four other businesses in response to a Twitter post made by Marc Fagel, a former partner with the law firm of Gibson.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If an investment contract remained one in perpetuity it would nullify the common enterprise factor moving forward. <br>Hypothetical: <br><br>Ripple sells XRP to Johnny Crypto’s business who pays his employees in XRP. His employees have never heard of Ripple and use XRP on their debit…</p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1670861872549986315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>He pointed out that secondary XRP sales are not securities. Additionally, the CryptoLaw founder cited the 2nd Circuit, which provides that securities legislation does not apply when a purchaser is motivated by a desire to utilize or consume the thing acquired.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-1024x768.png" alt="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities" class="wp-image-196360" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-1024x768.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-300x225.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-768x576.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-750x563.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422-1140x855.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1422.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>Deaton has previously questioned SEC head Gary Gensler on the Howey Test and his attitude to crypto. According to him, Gensler has a different idea about how cryptocurrencies should be classed and regulated, which has caused him to deviate from the court&#8217;s definition of securities from 1946 in relation to the Howey Test.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="530" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423.png" alt="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities" class="wp-image-196361" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423-300x199.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423-768x509.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1423-750x497.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Ripple vs. SEC Lawsuit: 2nd Circuit Of XRP Sales Are Not Securities 14"></a></figure></div>


<p>A transaction is security, according to the Howey Test, if it is an investment of money in a common business with a reasonable expectation of benefit obtained from the labor of others. Deaton said that the four other businesses that acquired XRP tokens cannot logically be in the same business as Ripple Labs.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;If you don’t apply Howey at the time of each transaction and XRP is a security per se b/c Ripple sold to a guy named Johnny Crypto then, in effect, Johnny Crypto, his employee, the employee’s friend, Jeremy Hogan, Uphold, and TapJets are all in a common enterprise w/Ripple,&#8221; Deaton explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Ripple vs. SEC litigation concerning the selling of XRP as unregistered securities has dragged on far too long and should be resolved in the next months. The publishing of the Hinman speech, despite the regulator&#8217;s opposition, has proved to be a major changer in the ongoing case.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CertiK uncovered a flaw in the freshly released Sui blockchain that threatened to shut down the network.</em></li>



<li><em>An infinite loop problem in the Sui code caused the blockchain&#8217;s nodes to run in an unending cycle, thus halting the network.</em></li>



<li><em>Sui received a $500,000 award for the crucial discovery.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blockchain security company CertiK has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/19/2690488/0/en/CertiK-is-Awarded-500K-Bounty-for-Discovery-of-Major-Security-Threat-on-Sui-Blockchain.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> a vulnerability that could put Sui at risk of shutting down blockchain operations.</strong></h5>

<p>The &#8220;HamsterWheel&#8221; threat has the ability to interrupt the whole Sui Layer 1 chain. Unlike typical assaults that disrupt chains by crashing nodes, the HamsterWheel attack keeps all nodes operating indefinitely without processing new transactions as if they were on a hamster wheel. This method has the potential to paralyze large networks, essentially making them useless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>XRP has formed a hard support area in line with the previously created bullish trend line.</em></li>



<li><em>The $0.5 price zone is a confluence between buyers and sellers, so investors need to pay attention.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent events between Ripple and the SEC make XRP a big bet.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This week&#8217;s XRP price pullback found instant support at an ascending support trendline. Currently, this is a very good-performing altcoin if investors bet on it.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1414.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1414.png" alt="XRP Takes High Bets Amid SEC Lawsuit, Pay Attention To The $0.5 Price Zone" class="wp-image-196335" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1414.png 1000w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1414-300x200.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1414-768x512.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1414-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="XRP Takes High Bets Amid SEC Lawsuit, Pay Attention To The $0.5 Price Zone 18"></a></figure></div>


<p>The SEC&#8217;s case against Ripple was one of the first significant legal fights in the crypto sector, but subsequent actions against Coinbase and Binance proved the regulatory agency is in for a protracted struggle with numerous firms.</p>



<p>It is widely assumed that the Ripple XRP litigation gets relevant since the court might set a precedent for other current crypto lawsuits. But, analysts caution that the SEC may claim that the Ripple litigation was isolated and had nothing to do with the broader crypto industry.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416-1024x576.png" alt="XRP Takes High Bets Amid SEC Lawsuit, Pay Attention To The $0.5 Price Zone" class="wp-image-196337" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416-1024x576.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416-750x422.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416-1140x641.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1416.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="XRP Takes High Bets Amid SEC Lawsuit, Pay Attention To The $0.5 Price Zone 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>Meanwhile, XRP holders are awaiting the Summary Judgement from Judge Analisa Torres, who gave the Daubert motion judgment more than 100 days ago. Yet, the extended wait for the final decision has had little impact on the XRP price, as the currency remains in sixth place among prominent cryptocurrencies with a market worth of $25.5 billion.</p>



<p>Buyers recently pierced the immediate barrier of $0.456 and gained fresh footing to move higher. Besides, this is the confluence of the bracing price zone that preceded the sell-off of XRP, causing it to create a new low higher than the old low in February, or more specifically, a bullish trend line.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="563" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-1024x563.png" alt="XRP Takes High Bets Amid SEC Lawsuit, Pay Attention To The $0.5 Price Zone" class="wp-image-196336" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-1024x563.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-300x165.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-768x423.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-1536x845.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-2048x1127.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-750x413.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1415-1140x627.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="XRP Takes High Bets Amid SEC Lawsuit, Pay Attention To The $0.5 Price Zone 20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">XRP price chart. <em>Source: TradingView</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>This dynamic support has helped purchasers maintain a persistent bullish trend over the last three months. Also, the lengthy lower price rejection candle on June 16th demonstrates purchasers soliciting this currency during troughs, suggesting a greater positive turnaround.</p>



<p>If the daily candle closes above the $0.5 barrier, the positive momentum will increase, and the rebound rally may continue to the $0.55 resistance. Therefore, it can be said that $0.5 is an important confluence between buying and selling that investors need to pay attention to.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Etherscan has announced &#8220;Code Reader,&#8221; a unique AI tool backed by OpenAI&#8217;s powerful language model.</em></li>



<li><em>The tool seeks to help users obtain a better knowledge of the source code behind any smart contract.</em></li>



<li><em>Etherscan has posted a caution to their website, informing visitors that the AI service on their website needs an OpenAI API key with acceptable use restrictions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Etherscan, an on-chain data tracker, has adopted OpenAI&#8217;s model integration tool, which allows users to learn about the source code of smart contracts.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409-1024x538.png" alt="Etherscan&#039;s Users Can Now Analyze Smart Contract With AI-powered Code Reader" class="wp-image-196326" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1409.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Etherscan&#039;s Users Can Now Analyze Smart Contract With AI-powered Code Reader 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Etherscan claims that the &#8220;Code Reader&#8221; tool will assist users in evaluating and learning specifics about the products and functionalities contained in the contracts. According to this unit, the responses will be implemented using AI technology to assist people in grasping the nature of the lines of code.</p>



<p>According to a <a href="https://info.etherscan.com/code-reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> on Etherscan&#8217;s website, the tool, which is built on AI technology created by <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184654-openai-attracts-300m-from-top-vc-firms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI</a>, enables users to request an explanation of the whole or sections of a smart contract&#8217;s source code.</p>



<p>Users may also get a smart contract&#8217;s &#8220;read&#8221; and &#8220;write&#8221; functionalities, allowing them to make educated choices about how to engage with them and investigate potential uses for them in decentralized apps, according to the article.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Code Reader&#8217;s use cases include acquiring a better knowledge of contracts&#8217; code via AI-generated explanations, collecting complete listings of smart contract operations connected to Ethereum data, and comprehending how the underlying contract interacts with decentralized apps (dApps).</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Once the contract files are retrieved, you can choose a specific source code file to read through. Additionally, you may modify the source code directly inside the UI before sharing it with the AI,&#8221; according to the blog post.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-1024x628.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="628" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-1024x628.png" alt="Etherscan&#039;s Users Can Now Analyze Smart Contract With AI-powered Code Reader" class="wp-image-196329" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-1024x628.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-300x184.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-768x471.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-750x460.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412-1140x699.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-1412.png 1386w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Etherscan&#039;s Users Can Now Analyze Smart Contract With AI-powered Code Reader 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>Nevertheless, Etherscan included a user caution stating that the AI service on their website needs an OpenAI API key with acceptable use restrictions. Also, users should not assume that all AI-generated replies are accurate. To begin using Code Reader, users must first provide their API key, contract address, and source file to interact with and then ask their queries.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Binance is being investigated by authorities in Europe following tensions with the SEC.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC has requested information about the exchange&#8217;s actions from multiple European countries after the exchange was prosecuted and charged with trading coins earlier this month.</em></li>

<p>For some time, the SEC has been requesting information on Binance&#8217;s actions from many European nation-states and a number of them have been prompted to act after the exchange was indicted and accused of commingling money earlier this month.</p>



<p>Several European agencies are currently examining the complexities of Binance&#8217;s case and have yet to respond to the SEC&#8217;s disclosure demands.</p>



<p>On June 5, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance, its CEO and founder, Changpeng Zhao, and Binance.</p>



<p>The agency in the United States claims that Binance artificially inflates its trading volumes, diverts client money, fails to prohibit U.S. customers from its platform, and misleads investors about its market surveillance procedures.</p>



<p>As a US district court signed off on a consent decree issued Saturday, Binance and the SEC struck an arrangement to avert a complete asset freeze of the platform in the US and retain customer funds in the US.</p>

<p>The accord came as the SEC launched a broad, continuing complaint accusing the business of operating an unlawful securities exchange, which could take months, if not years, to settle.</p>



<p>Binance has dozens, if not hundreds, of businesses registered worldwide, many of them in Europe. Aside from holding a license to operate as a cryptocurrency exchange in France and Cyprus, as well as in Spain via its subsidiary MoonPay, it has or has additional firms registered in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, and a number of other EU nations.</p>



<p>The majority of firms incorporated in these nations recorded minor amounts of income ranging from a few thousand Euros to €500,000, although others declared as much as €200 million each year.</p>



<p>Several companies have even received loans from the enigmatic Guangying Chen, a corporate stakeholder. The substantial stacking and dispersion of information across many nations seem to be meant to make Binance&#8217;s activities opaque and difficult to comprehend.</p>



<p>Guangying Chen is the only and sole stakeholder of many Binance registered firms in Europe, although CZ is seldom, if ever, the expressly proclaimed owner. Chen has a Chinese passport and a registered residence in Singapore, but the exchange says he also has a European passport and resides in Europe.</p>

<p>Binance has faced difficulties in two European countries after announcing intentions to leave the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195731-binance-is-leaving-the-netherlands/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netherlands</a> and becoming the subject of a <a href="https://news.coincu.com/195767-binance-under-investigation-in-france/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probe</a> by French authorities.</p>



<p>CZ maintains that recent French police inspections of Binance&#8217;s headquarters in the nation were regular. But, according to the French daily <em>Le Monde</em>, the exchange has been under investigation by French authorities since February 2022 for serious money laundering violations in its own investing operation and by its own customers. Binance is also relinquishing its Cyprus crypto exchange license.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Mastercard seems to have restarted its crypto-related efforts.</em></li>



<li><em>The company has submitted a trademark application to provide crypto and blockchain transaction software.</em></li>



<li><em>Mastercard announced the extension of its crypto payment card program in late April.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/184631-mastercard-user-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastercard</a> will extend its efforts crypto sector with a trademark application, even as authorities and banks become leery of the area.</strong></h5>

<p>According to information <a href="https://twitter.com/KondoudisLaw/status/1670759516172951553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> by trademark attorney Michael Kondoudis on June 19, the payment processor has recently filed a trademark application to introduce software for cryptocurrency and blockchain transactions, as well as create links between virtual asset service providers for crypto transactions.</p>



<p>Specifically, the application, submitted on June 12 with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) under serial number 98038563, consists of three international classes (IC) that relate to distinct identifying categories of the products and services covered by the filing &#8211; 009, 036, and 042.</p>

<p>Yet, the aforesaid filing is only one of many recent moves made by Mastercard to return to its crypto road after its management, like Visa&#8217;s, opted to take a vacation from the crypto push due to weak market and regulatory circumstances.</p>



<p>This is not the first time the world&#8217;s largest payment business has revealed cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>In certain regions, Mastercard has already worked with cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Nexo, and Gemini to provide crypto-linked payment cards. Users may use the Binance cards to make payments in conventional currencies using monies from their crypto holdings on the exchange.</p>

<p>When asked whether Mastercard is thinking about limiting the amount of money that may be sent to crypto exchanges through its payments network, Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard&#8217;s head of crypto and blockchain, responded:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;re not here to pick winners. We&#8217;re not here to pick which transaction should happen or shouldn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Bybit announced the launching of a debit card issued by Moorwand that is enabled by the Mastercard network and enables users to quickly move between the crypto and fiat worlds and make purchases or withdraw cash from ATMs in early March.</p>
