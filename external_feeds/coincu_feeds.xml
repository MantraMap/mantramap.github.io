<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In decentralized finance (DeFi), a new and promising story, known as LSDfi, has emerged. LSDfi refers to a set of protocols based on Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSD) that cover various aspects of the DeFi ecosystem.</strong></h5>



<p>The rapid increase in popularity of the LSDFi protocol can be attributed to its ability to address critical weaknesses in the DeFi sector. LSDFi offers users enhanced flexibility and capital efficiency by combining liquidity sensitivity with derivative farming. Investors are flocking to the protocol, realizing its potential to optimize their earnings while minimizing the risks associated with decentralized finance.</p>



<p>As the DeFi landscape continues to evolve, the growing prominence of LSDFi highlights the ever-increasing need for sophisticated yield farming options. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/190419-lsdfi-protocol-records-historic-inflow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$25 million</a> in single-day inflows hitting a record high for the protocol demonstrates a strong belief in its potential for long-term success. It is anticipated that LSDFi will continue to attract both seasoned DeFi enthusiasts and new investors looking for innovative ways to maximize their returns.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is LSDFi?</h2>



<p>LSDfi refers to a set of protocols based on LSD. It covers many projects, ranging in capabilities from classic DEXs and lending protocols to more complex protocols built using unique LST properties.</p>



<p>With the widespread adoption of LSD, these protocols will play an essential role in DeFi, laying the foundation for the DeFi ecosystem, while projects building more complex products on top of LSD will be at the next layer.</p>



<p>LSD has become the dominant category in TVL Locked Total Value, with Lido being one of the most significant projects. Not only that, LSD has become a standard in any Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ecosystem and has been one of the important trends in DeFi. LSD provides a consistent, low-risk source of passive income and contributes to the maintenance of the blockchain.</p>



<p>Therefore, LSD plays an essential role in driving the growth of the entire DeFi ecosystem. LSDfi serves as a logical extension of LSD, generating economy as an whole that generates substantial income while simplifying interactions with LSD projects.</p>



<p>The total locked value (TVL) of LSDFi exceeds $396 million. This proves that the integration of DeFi and the LSD industry is a significant trend and LSDfi is the result of this evolution. As this trend develops, LSD is becoming one of the main forces in DeFi. Currently, LSDfi has grown into an independent field in DeFi and is making positive strides. It includes classic DeFi protocols and more complex protocols like Basket Protocol, Stablecoins, Profit Strategy, and more.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lybra Finance(LBR)</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The appeal of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/189739-lybra-finance-earn-income-from-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lybra Finance</a> is that it allows holders to receive stablecoin $eUSD automatically bearing 7.2% APY interest in real-time. It will give you a stablecoin and it will multiply in your wallet as long as you hold it.</p>



<p>To mint $eUSD, you need to deposit ETH or stETH, and the protocol distributes the proceeds generated by stETH to $eUSD holders. In other words, by depositing ETH or stETH into the protocol and minting $eUSD, you can earn about 8.3% APY.</p>



<p>Due to the recent popularity of Lybra Finance on Twitter, the price of $LBR has skyrocketed, and it is also attracting more and more people to receive rewards by minting $eUSD.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>unshETH (USH)</strong></h3>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/191359-unsheth-lsdfi-promoting-eth-staking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unshETH</a> is a decentralized, on-chain movement to improve validator decentralization. The matrix prevents monopolies from growing so large that it stifles innovation and jeopardizes the economy by becoming a central point of failure through the creation and enforcement of antitrust laws.</p>



<p>UnshETH&#8217;s mission is simple &#8211; decentralization through incentives. Through incentive engineering, UnshETH aims to distribute capital across the LSD ecosystem in a way that prioritizes the decentralization of validators.</p>



<p>unshETH is more profitable for smaller validators, and Bettors get higher yields, and ETH is more decentralized. Think of it as a decentralized preferred profit aggregator.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pendle (PENDLE)</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Recently, Pendle&#8217;s TVL hit an all-time high of nearly $100 million. Pendle&#8217;s idea is to allow users to use their assets and earnings separately.</p>



<p>In Pendle, the profit asset is divided into Master Token (PT) and Profit Token (YT). PT represents the principal of the yielding investment and YT represents the yield of the yielding asset. YT and PT can be traded on Pendle AMM.</p>



<p>For example, sending 1 stETH will generate 1 PT-stETH and 1 YT-stETH, where, 1PT-stETH can be exchanged for 1 stETH and 1 YT-stETH can allow you to receive 1 ETH (stETH) when depositing into Lido All the proceeds.</p>



<p>If you are a low-risk investor pursuing stability, you can buy PT with income removed for a fixed income; if you are an interest-rate trader and think an asset could go up in price, you can buy YT.</p>

<p>0xACID is a protocol that aims to maximize the return of LSD assets (such as stETH, rETH, frxETH, etc.) at 4-5% APR. It will significantly impact the entire Ethereum L1 and L2 with the rise of the treasury&#8217;s ETH-related assets.</p>



<p>The protocol holds LSD-related assets (equivalent to the long-term upside potential of ETH) and continuously earns real income from Ethereum nodes. All protocol values are in ETH, focusing on ETH growth only, as we firmly believe ETH will reach above $10,000 in the near future. The treasury will liquidate ETH when it comes $10,000 and ACID holders will receive a massive profit in USD.</p>

<p>Gravita Finance is an interest-free lending arrangement with LST as collateral, much like the LSDFi version of Liquity Protocol.</p>



<p>After collateralizing ETH in LSD protocol to receive rETH, wstETH and other LST, deposit it in Gravita, and in return, you can get stablecoin GRAI. The GRAI stablecoin can also be loaned through Graivta for consumption or deposited into the stablecoin fund to purchase liquidated LST collateral at a discounted price.</p>



<p>If the user repays the loan within six months (approximately 182 days), the interest is prorated, and the minimum interest is only equivalent to one week&#8217;s interest.<br>To reduce the volatility of GRAI, a redemption mechanism similar to Liquity has been developed, allowing GRAI holders to exchange 1 GRAI for $0.97 worth of collateral, incurring a purchase fee practically. 3% back.</p>

<p>Index Coop is a DAO-managed protocol that primarily provides users with structured DeFi products and strategic tokens.</p>



<p>With the current evolution of the LSD and LST protocols, Index Coop offers ETH holders two index tokens to simplify the earning process: ETH Diversity Staking Index ($dsETH) and Compound ETH Index ($icETH).</p>



<p>With more and more LSD protocols appearing, it is difficult for some bettors to choose in terms of profits. Since these LSD and LST protocols are based on the Ethereum mainnet, it can be expensive to deposit ETH into multiple LSD protocols or buy multiple LSTs from the secondary market to diversify investments.</p>



<p>Index Coop addresses this difficulty by pooling popular LST into a single ERC20 token, dsETH.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Above are our shares about LSDFi and outstanding LSDFi projects. In a nutshell, the LSDFi protocol&#8217;s one-day historical cash flow of $25 million, with Lybra Finance leading the charge with a cash flow of $24 million, is a testament to the platform&#8217;s growing importance in the DeFi space. With a diverse range of participants and a robust Total Locked Value, LSDFi is poised to shape the future of decentralized finance, providing users with a powerful tool to optimize farming strategies and their productivity.</p>

<p>In May, 93 publicly announced investment projects related to the cryptocurrency industry, according to statistics from RootData. This number represents a 13% decrease compared to the previous month and a 40% decrease compared to last year.

The total financing amount in May was $760 million, a 7% decrease compared to the previous month and a 66% decrease compared to May 2022.</p>

<p>Various companies raised funds in May, with the funding rounds exceeding $20 million, including the technology company Tools for Humanity, Auradine, Cryptocurrency wallet company Magic, Bitcoin technology and financial services company River Financial, emerging Bitcoin mining firm Cormint, Web3 startup Story Protocol, cryptocurrency infrastructure company Anoma Foundation, and Web3 payment and fiat aggregator Transak.</p>



<p>These companies raised a significant amount of funds, which they will likely use for the development and growth of their respective projects. Each company has its unique focus, from creating a global identification system using iris scanning technology to developing cutting-edge technologies like privacy, zero-knowledge proofs, and artificial intelligence.

<li><em>The lack of transparency regarding Huobi&#8217;s ownership raises concerns about the exchange&#8217;s credibility and trustworthiness, potentially driving away customers.</em></li>

<p>Huobi, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, is shrouded in mystery when it comes to its ownership. In October 2022, Hong Kong-based investment firm, About Capital Management announced that it had acquired Huobi. However, it soon became clear that the mysterious party responsible for acquiring the exchange was none other than TRON and Poloniex founder Justin Sun. Despite persistent tweeting about the company and his appointment to the Huobi Global Advisory Board, Sun denies controlling ownership of the exchange.</p>



<p>According to PROTOS, About Capital Management, which announced the acquisition of Huobi in October 2022, said in May of the following year that it was &#8220;no longer involved with Huobi in any way.&#8221; The company refused to elaborate further.</p>

The Need For Clarity In The Cryptocurrency Industry 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Hong Kong corporate documents for numerous Huobi and Justin Sun-related entities, along with information about ACM, were obtained by Protos. The documents do not point to who or what entity currently holds a controlling interest in the company. In February, a new director was appointed to HBIT, representing Huobi under its FINCEN registration. </p>



<p>The individual in question, Wang Shuchi, appears to be the director of numerous shell companies and the owner of Huobi Digital Limited. Additionally, Li Qi was appointed as a director of &#8220;New Huo Technology Holdings Limited&#8221; in March of the same year.</p>



<p>The need for more transparency regarding Huobi&#8217;s ownership raises concerns about the exchange&#8217;s credibility and trustworthiness. Customers may be hesitant to trade on an exchange with unknown ownership and may choose to take their business elsewhere. The current situation also highlights the importance of transparency in the cryptocurrency industry and the need for regulation to protect investors and consumers.</p>



<p>As of writing, it remains to be seen who owns Huobi and what the future holds for the exchange. Nevertheless, the situation highlights the need for transparency and regulation in the cryptocurrency industry to protect investors and consumers.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Uniswap&#8217;s proposal to collect fees from LPs has been met with community resistance.</em></li>



<li><em>The vote resulted in a close match between the two proposals, with 45% of the vote expressing opposition to a fee. Meanwhile, 42% of the vote was in favor of charging 1/5 of the team fee on all Uniswap v3.</em></li>



<li><em>Protocol fee advocates can link together after a certain percentage of fees, they can win.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Uniswap decentralized exchange community members are facing chaos in voting for the platform&#8217;s plan to charge fees from LPs.</strong></h5>



<p>Proposal voting results showed that 45.32% voted against charging, 42.34% supported charging 1/5 of liquidity provider fees, 12.3% voted in favor of charging 1/10, and 0.04% of votes favor 1/6 Charge being imposed.</p>

<p>Although support for a fee outweighs opposition for a charge (55% vs. 45%), no individual category has received greater support than the &#8220;free&#8221;. If protocol fee advocates can link together after a certain percentage of fees, they can win.</p>



<p>Devin Walsh, executive director of the Uniswap Foundation, said on Twitter that the poll was published for feedback and was not part of a formal governance process.</p>

<p>These results will not necessarily prevent further votes on the proposal. The polling site suggests that the poll data will be used to prepare for a more formal &#8220;temperature check&#8221; vote. However, the opposition to a fee is substantial.</p>



<p>As per previous news, GFX Labs <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186644-uniswap-to-charge-liquidity-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has launched</a> a proposal in the Uniswap community to &#8220;implement liquidity pool fees&#8221;, proposing that all Uniswap v3 pools implement agreement fees equal to 20% of pool fees and open charge conversion for Uniswap v2.</p>



<p>The proposal&#8217;s scope is to implement fees on the Uniswap liquidity pool, implement a fee-for-earning system, and sell designated assets to the UNI community in a trustless manner. In subsequent proposals, the UNI community can decide how to manage, distribute or use the assets to be credited to the treasury.</p>

<li><em>Binance requests the Ontario Securities Commission, Canada, to drop its investigative orders regarding the exchange&#8217;s securities violations.</em></li>

<p>According to a document filed with the Capital Markets Court, the Securities Commission of Ontario, Canada, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191286-binance-pressured-by-canadian-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an investigative order against Binance last month, and Binance will be investigated to determine if it is intentionally circumventing securities laws.</p>



<p>According to the petition, the OSC&#8217;s submission requested a particularly extensive examination of whether the exchange may have attempted to evade Ontario securities laws and compliance procedures related to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities laws or the public interest.</p>



<p>A few days later, Binance announced it was leaving the country due to &#8220;new guidance regarding stablecoins and investor restrictions.&#8221; When asked why it chose to leave the Canadian market, its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), a Canadian citizen, said in a Twitter post that he no longer thinks running a company has interest there is possible due to the new regulations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png" alt="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation" class="wp-image-191591" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation 25"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Binance subsequently asked the Ontario Securities Commission to drop its investigation, arguing that it was &#8220;extremely broad&#8221; and &#8220;not based on any factual facts.&#8221; Binance added in its May 18 filing that the &#8220;investigation order has no legitimate purpose&#8221; and that the exchange has withdrawn from Ontario and Canada.</p>



<p>According to Capital Markets Court filings,<a href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2023-05/rad_20230529_binance-holdings-ltd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a hearing</a> on whether to drop the investigation is set for June 2.</p>



<p>Binance isn&#8217;t the only crypto company that finds Canada a difficult place to do business. After, digital asset exchange Bybit said it was leaving the country, and OKX in March announced their withdrawal, citing the inability to withstand the new regulations.</p>

<p>The past decade has witnessed a tumultuous journey for the financial industry, with the collapse of large financial institutions and the concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a few individuals. These challenges have highlighted the risks associated with centralized systems. However, amidst the turbulence, decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a beacon of hope, offering new opportunities and empowering investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>DEX vs CEX</strong></h2>



<p>Following the centralized exchange FTX collapse in November 2022, DEX trading volume surged, indicating a significant shift in investor preference towards decentralized platforms. The ongoing debate between centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) is a pivotal discussion in the crypto community:</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, set to take place on April 28, 2024, is a significant milestone in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly within the Trendy DeFi ecosystem. Occurring approximately every four years, the halving event involves a reduction of the block reward given to miners by half. As these halvings progress, the creation of new Bitcoin decreases, ultimately leading to the attainment of the maximum supply.</p>



<p>Within the Trendy DeFi pool, this reduction in new Bitcoin creation has an impact on the price of MATIC. Consequently, it fulfills one of the conditions of the investment pool, enabling participants to exercise their voting rights. Through the implementation of a DAO mechanism, investors can vote on whether to close the pool or determine the monthly profit. In cases where the voting rate surpasses 51% agreement among the investors, the development team will adjust the interest rate percentage accordingly.</p>



<p>As of July 2019, there have only been <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" rel="noreferrer noopener">two previous </a>Bitcoin halving events. These occurred on the 28th of November, 2012, and the 9th of July, 2016. At the time of the first halving event, the price of Bitcoin was $12.31, and at the time of the second halving event, the price of Bitcoin was $650.63.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/halving" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://academy.binance.com/en/halving" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance Academy</a>, the Bitcoin halvings timer is calculated using the following formula:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(Halving block – Next block height) * Average time between blocks – estimated time until the next block.</code></pre>

<p>Trendy DeFi distinguishes itself from traditional financial projects by embracing the principles of DeFi and empowering investors. Unlike projects where decision-making power is centralized, and funds can be misused, Trendy DeFi prioritizes transparency, fairness, and user control. The platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem where users can engage in buying, depositing, exchanging, and, most importantly, earning monthly passive income based on investors&#8217; voting percentages.</p>



<p>At the core of Trendy DeFi is a shared wallet system built on Smart Contract technology, ensuring the security of funds and preventing unauthorized transfers. The platform operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling all participating members to make decisions through voting collectively. This decentralized governance model eliminates centralized control and empowers investors to shape the project&#8217;s future. The system&#8217;s funds can only be used to adjust interest rates through voting, and any modifications require a 51% majority agreement from members through vote.</p>

<p>As a Polygon-based platform, Trendy DeFi leverages MATIC as the staking token in its investment pools. MATIC, listed on numerous exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, offers stability during market downturns and exhibits steady growth during market upswings. With more than <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-crosses-53-000-dapps-mark-in-a-major-adoption-milestone" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-crosses-53-000-dapps-mark-in-a-major-adoption-milestone" rel="noreferrer noopener">53,000 active DApps</a> on the MATIC platform, it serves as a robust foundation for developing decentralized applications, making it an ideal choice for Trendy DeFi&#8217;s technology stack.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Use $MATIC deposit token to invest 25% to pay system commission, 75% push to pool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trendy DeFi ensures appropriate and safe interest rates for its users, ranging from 7% to 10.5%. The combination of market dynamics, the investor community, and the AUTO DCA (Cost Averaging) feature guarantees the safety of the investment pool. The project provides a clear roadmap for investors, outlining entry and exit points, profit rates, and risk management strategies. </p>



<p>Additionally, the condition-based approach ensures that investors receive interest for a defined period and allows voting to close the pool if specific criteria are met:</p>



<ul>
<li>Condition 1: Investors receive 7 &#8211; 10.5% interest over 2 years.</li>



<li>Condition 2: Once the price of Matic reaches $1.6, all system members will receive a voting notification to determine the pool&#8217;s closure. If a majority of 51% or more votes agree to end the pool, it will be officially closed. In such a scenario, the development team will collaborate to adjust the interest rate, ensuring investors can claim the remaining benefits from their investments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>Staking</strong></h2>



<p>Trendy DeFi provides the potential to earn an annualized rate of return (ARP) ranging from 85.1% up to 127.75% for staking MATIC. All funds belonging to members are held within the Staking Pool, which is meticulously crafted using a Smart Contract. To instill an additional layer of trust, the Staking Pool undergoes a comprehensive audit by Certik, a reputable auditing firm.</p>



<p>Additionally, Trendy DeFi offers pool ranking rewards for those who meet the minimum requirements. Since active members staked a certain amount of tokens, they can earn additional rewards and move up in the pool rankings as table below:</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A MakerDAO vote ending Thursday approved the proposal to invest up to $1.28 billion in US Treasuries.</strong></h5>



<p>Following the proposal submitted on the MakerDAO governance forum earlier this month, the Andromeda Project was launched by Blocktower Capital Advisors LP under MIP90. According to the asset purchase schedule posted on the admin forum, 1/6 (16.67%) of the total DAI stock will be allocated to the US Treasury in 0-1 month. Equal allocations have been listed for 1-2 month bonds, 2-3 month bonds, etc.</p>



<p>MakerDAO Governance will instruct trading parties to mint Dai, exchange Dai for other stablecoins held in PSM, and buy US Treasury bonds evenly over maturities ranging from 0 to 6 months.</p>



<p>Voters unanimously supported opening a new real-world asset vault (RWA) called BlockTower Andromeda. MakerDAO will pay a 0.15% sorting fee to BlockTower, which amounts to over $1.9 million. Celadon Financial Group will act as the broker, and Wedbush Securities will custody the assets.</p>



<p>The voting page shows that the community approved the proposal with an overwhelming majority, with 99.99% of the votes in favor of Project Andromeda.</p>

<p>The approval to buy $1.28 billion worth of US Treasury bonds comes just months after the Maker community approved a proposal to<a href="https://news.coincu.com/174264-makerdao-approved-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> increase</a> its US Treasury bond portfolio holdings to 150%, from $500 million to $1.25 billion. The latest approval comes just a day after Circle, a fellow stablecoin issuer, removed all US Treasury bonds from the reserve that backs their USDC stablecoin.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the DeFi Protocol also purchased $1.1 billion in government and corporate bonds earlier this year through a vault led by asset manager Monetalis Clysdale.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20230601a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> the order on Wednesday as part of Silvergate&#8217;s shutdown process. Although the bank voluntarily declared liquidation with a plan of &#8220;full refund of all deposits.&#8221; Banks must preserve cash and other resources to compensate depositors.</p>



<p>The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation must approve Silvergate&#8217;s plan to liquidate assets. This bank announced it would be shutting down in March of this year.</p>



<p>The Fed&#8217;s order notes that recent Silvergate audits by state regulators and officials from the San Francisco Fed &#8220;discovered many deficiencies in its safety, soundness, and compliance. &#8220;It linked the bank&#8217;s failure to its transactions with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>



<p>Fed said the failure of FTX and Alameda, combined with Silvergate&#8217;s business strategy tied to the digital asset industry and a banking run prelude to similar higher-impact operations in the Valley Silicon and Signature Bank &#8220;has led to the funding and liquidity stress for the bank and a decline in processes that are the primary source of revenue.</p>



<p>The Fed statement noted that Silvergate executives voluntarily consented to all elements of the enforcement action. The regulator must approve any bonuses, promotions, or severance packages for executives as part of the order.</p>

<p>Silvergate was the first central crypto-friendly bank to close operations, followed by Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Many digital asset companies – including Coinbase, Paxos, Gemini, Bitstamp, and Galaxy Digital – previously had financial ties to Silvergate but announced that they would be leaving following allegations that the bank was involved in the collapse of FTX.</p>

<p>According to a Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and?__cf_chl_f_tk=NmaRfdZR.g9jCW9aKem0kQOFhQFs9V42_c0.JHl5oH0-1685665472-0-gaNycGzNDVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, institutional contacts will be 1 BTC and 10 ETH, allowing derivatives exchange customers to manage their exposure to crypto assets.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTI) and Ether (ETI) futures contracts will be made available to customers through third-party institutional futures commission traders (FCM) and leading brokers. Institutional clients who are early adopters of new derivatives may be eligible for various incentive schemes.</p>



<p>Two new futures contracts to enable investors to precisely manage risk and target attractive returns at lower fees than other US-regulated derivatives exchanges.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;With the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts, we look to empower institutional participants with greater precision in managing crypto exposure, expressing directional views, or tracking Bitcoin and Ether returns in a capital-efficient way. Coinbase Derivatives Exchange is committed to delivering innovative solutions that cater specifically to the needs of institutional investors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new crypto offerings come less than a year after the derivatives exchange launched its nano Bitcoin and nano Ether derivatives. In addition to lower exchange fees, eligible institutions may qualify for various incentive programs if they are early adopters of these contracts.</p>



<p>The new derivatives will be offered in the form of USD-settled index futures and will expire every month. Each BTI and ETI contract represents 1 Bitcoin and Ether, respectively. In June 2022, Coinbase Derivatives Exchange launched Bitcoin nano futures contracts for its retail clients. Followed by the launch of nano Ether futures in August 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SKALE has published the Levitation Protocol, a ZK rollup designed to give Ethereum developers with a new scaling alternative.</em></li>



<li><em>To supplement Levitation, the core team wants to develop a standalone decentralized Layer 1 blockchain.</em></li>



<li><em>A public testnet will be launched later this year, with a mainnet deployment scheduled for Q4 2023.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The &#8220;Levitation Protocol,&#8221; a new, fully-decentralized ZK scaling solution, has been <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/skale_announces_the_levitation_protocol_a_web3_gateway_for_decentralized_zero_knowledge_proofs/prweb19364286.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> by SKALE, the leading Ethereum scaling blockchain.</strong></h5>

<p>The Levitation Protocol will expand the possibilities of the ecosystem by allowing any operator of Zero Knowledge Proofs to provide a decentralized ZK solution to application developers through a SKALE Chain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SKALEverse is entering a new frontier!<br><br>Introducing the Levitation Protocol, a fully-decentralized, Zero-Knowledge (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#ZK</a>) scaling solution, built on the world&#39;s fastest and most expansive EVM blockchain network.<br><br>The future of ZK scaling is built on SKALE. <a href="https://t.co/s5uqwde42S" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/s5uqwde42S</a></p>&mdash; SKALE (@SkaleNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkaleNetwork/status/1664306586200752131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>SKALE is an ecosystem of over 20 application-specific sidechains that run alongside Ethereum. These chains have the potential to give scaling advantages by deploying ZK-Rollups, which, together with Optimistic Rollups, are the most extensively used Layer 2 solutions.</p>



<p>The introduction of SKALE G (G for Ganymede, the biggest moon in the solar system), which promises to be the world&#8217;s fastest and most scalable decentralized Layer 1 blockchain, will help with levitation. This blockchain will be particularly created for publishing Levitation-derived Layer 2 ZK proofs back to Ethereum, with the goal of increasing Ethereum&#8217;s scalability by employing off-chain computing while maintaining the primary blockchain&#8217;s security.</p>



<p>SKALE Labs CEO and co-founder Jack O&#8217;Holleran stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Levitation Protocol will take SKALE to the next level, offering even more options for developers and businesses to build and scale their decentralized applications. We&#8217;re excited to see the impact Levitation will have on the future of the blockchain industry.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="526" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75.png" alt="SKALE Launched New Decentralized ZK Scaling Solution" class="wp-image-191555" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75-300x205.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75-750x514.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" title="SKALE Launched New Decentralized ZK Scaling Solution 50"></a></figure></div>


<p>A public testnet is expected later this year, with the mainnet launching in the fourth quarter of 2023. This, according to SKALE contributors, indicates that the network is aiming towards a thorough scaling-centric strategy.</p>



<p>As ZK projects scramble to build decentralized app-chain networks, the chain already has the world&#8217;s most robust and has completed over 70M transactions, making it naturally capable of integrating the best-in-class ZK EVM solutions.</p>



<p>The Dartmouth Blockchain Group just named SKALE the fastest blockchain in the world. The network has already established itself as one of the top ten blockchains in terms of daily transaction volume, with 86% month-over-month growth and over 400,000 unique users served in the previous 6 months. By providing app-specific chains, Layer 1, and Layer 2 alternatives, it takes a giant step ahead as a full-fledged blockchain scaling platform with the Levitation Protocol.</p>
