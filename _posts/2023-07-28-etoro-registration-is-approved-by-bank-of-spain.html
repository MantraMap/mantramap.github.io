Bank of Spain Registers eToro as a Virtual Asset Exchange
<p>eToro, a social investment and multi-asset brokerage company based in Israel, is expanding its connections worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, July 29, the company announced that a month ago, on June 29, the Bank of Spain had approved the registration of eToro as &ldquo;a service provider of exchange of virtual currency for fiat currency and electronic wallet custody services&rdquo;. eToro (Europe) Digital Assets Ltd. is now registered in the Virtual Asset Service Provider Register maintained by the Bank of Spain under code number D848.</p>

<p>Tali Salomon, eToro&rsquo;s Regional Manager for Iberia and LatAm, commented on the news: &ldquo;This registration is a testament to our commitment to operating a growing business which prioritises consumer protection while also nurturing innovation and ensuring access for individual investors. As a multi-asset platform which has been a long standing supporter of crypto and blockchain technology, we are proud to have received this registration from the Bank of Spain. We will continue to empower our Spanish users by providing them with access to a diverse range of asset classes, investment tools and educational resources to enable them to grow their knowledge and wealth.&rdquo;</p>
