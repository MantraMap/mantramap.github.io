					<description><![CDATA[The crypto rally that greeted the new year has definitely brought gains to the world of altcoins. According to CoinMarketCap data, most huge gains were made by altcoins in the past 30 days. AVAX, native token of the Avalanche blockchain, is one of them with gains of up to 32% in the seven days.  The rally came as major cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum all registered gains and increased investor sentiment. Although the fear, uncertainty, and doubt of the last year’s bear market is still present, the increasing chance of a recession still gives investors some worry. As of writing, AVAX is trading at $15.96, up 28% in the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko show. What Supported The Avalanche Rally?  The Avalanche ecosystem has been bullish. Recently, Shopify partnered with Avalanche to allow Shopify merchants to sell their NFTs. According to public information, users don’t need to handle any cryptocurrencies to buy NFTs.  Venly, one of the numerous blockchain partners of Shopify, created a no-code tool for sellers to create NFTs. In a recent interview, Venly co-founder Tom Dierckxens said that this evolution in NFT technology is an evolution which can be adopted in the mass market.  Latest news update in the @avalancheavax ecosystem!$AVAX #AVAX #Avaxholicnews pic.twitter.com/naTV2YpjtT — Avaxholic 🔺 (@avaxholic) January 3, 2023 This is only the most previous on-chain development for the ecosystem. On a previous tweet by Axaholic, a Twitter account dedicated to Avalanche updates, the ecosystem partnered up with Re Protocol which tokenizes the reinsurance industry, empowering business through blockchain solutions.  On-chain developments also led to Avalanche experiencing a strong uptick in development activity and price as seen on data provided by Santiment.  Also, the world&#8217;s largest cloud provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ava Labs to speed up and broaden the use of blockchain across different types of industries.

					<description><![CDATA[XRP has been on the front lines of crypto news for the past couple of weeks as Ripple’s lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) heats up. The increased attention has translated to more market movement, and whales are looking to take advantage of this. Whales Move Into XRP XRP’s trading volume saw a spike on Tuesday following the upward rally in the crypto market. This saw an increase in the price of the digital asset but perhaps most important for the day was the fact that Binance Smart Chain whales were actually more interested in the coin. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Whales Go On 20,000 BTC Buying Spree Whale tracking website WhaleStats reported that XRP had become the most traded token among the top 100 BSC whales for the day. It dethroned AAVE which had previously dominated the attention of these large whales to achieve this feat. 📰 JUST IN: $XRP @Ripple flipped $AAVE for MOST TRADED token among top 100 #BSC whales Check the top 100 whales here: https://t.co/0SYnjw0xQs (and hodl $BBW to see data for the top 4000!)#XRP #AAVE #whalestats #babywhale #BBW pic.twitter.com/MhK4A1ATd3 &#8212; WhaleStats &#8211; the top 1000 BSC richlist (@WhaleStatsBSC) January 10, 2023 Now, the increased interest from these whales has not died down yet because while XRP is not currently the most traded token, it is still a top 10 token for them. It features in the fourth spot of most purchased tokens for the largest BSC whales. Additionally, the XRP smart contract is one of the top 10 most used smart contracts among the top 100 BSC whales. Price sitting at $0.37 &#124; Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com Jumping In Front Of Crypto Market Gains There are still residual market gains from the Monday price surge in the crypto market and XRP is one of the tokens soaking up the gains. It is currently one of the top gainers over the last 24 hours, placing third on the Coinmarketcap list of gainers with a 4.34% increase in the last day. XRP in the top five gainers &#124; Source: Coinmarketcap This increase in price has now pushed the price of XRP above its 20-day moving average. The breakpoints to a short-term bull trend for the digital asset, at least for the week. The most important now is for the digital asset to break the resistance at $0.037, as this will propel it above its 50-day moving average of $0.379. Once this is achieved, then a rally above $0.4 will be locked in for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains? An event that could likely prove volatile for the XRP price is another hearing set for January 19 in the Ripple v. SEC case. Both parties involved are required to file any objections to the non-parties&#8217; motions by January 18.  As for the final verdict for the case, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and lawyer Stuart Alderoty both expect a decision from Judge Analisa Torres sometime in the second quarter of 2023.

<p class="p2">Additionally, the XRP smart contract is one of the top 10 most used smart contracts among the top 100 BSC whales.</p>

<h2 class="p2">Jumping In Front Of Crypto Market Gains</h2>
<p class="p2">There are still residual market gains from the Monday price surge in the crypto market and XRP is one of the tokens soaking up the gains. It is currently one of the top gainers over the last 24 hours, placing third on the Coinmarketcap list of gainers with a 4.34% increase in the last day.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-515760 aligncenter" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers-460x247.png" alt="XRP gainers" width="460" height="247" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers-460x247.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers-860x461.png 860w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers-768x412.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers-750x402.png 750w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers-1140x611.png 1140w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/XRP-gainers.png 1466w" sizes="(max-width: 460px) 100vw, 460px" /></p>

<p class="p2">This increase in price has now pushed the price of XRP above its 20-day moving average. The breakpoints to a short-term bull trend for the digital asset, at least for the week. The most important now is for the digital asset to break the resistance at $0.037, as this will propel it above its 50-day moving average of $0.379. Once this is achieved, then a rally above $0.4 will be locked in for the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class="p2">An event that could likely prove volatile for the XRP price is another hearing set for January 19 in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-execs-predict-utility-key-driver-2023/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ripple v. SEC case</a>. Both parties involved are required to file any objections to the non-parties&#8217; motions by January 18. </p>
<p class="p2">As for the final verdict for the case, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and lawyer Stuart Alderoty both expect a decision from Judge Analisa Torres sometime in the second quarter of 2023.</p>

Howard Wright, the VP and Global Head of startups at AWS, stated: Looking forward, web3 and blockchain are inevitable. No one can call the time or date or quarter that it’s going to happen and it’ll be mainstream, but we’ve seen the cycles of growth before.

Through the partnership, individuals will find it much easier to launch and manage nodes on Avalanche; additionally, it will strengthen and make the network more flexible for developers to work on. This new development has positively affected the altcoin&#8217;s price, but it is yet to be seen if the coin can sustain this price sentiment. Avalanche Technical Analysis The news of AWS being incorporated into the Avalanche ecosystem has instantly spiked investor interest. The daily chart of AVAX displays a 6.6% gain, which can be termed a rally. This has made the coin break past the $13.60 resistance level, and now AVAX is valued at $14.40. It is yet to be seen if the coin manages to breach the $15 mark, acting as a resistance mark for the coin. A fall from the current price will bring the altcoin down to $13.70. The Relative Strength Index was overbought, which means the asset was overvalued. The overvalued condition can be attributed to the newest development. Usually, once the asset is overbought, the price corrects itself. Due to bullish sentiment, AVAX shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), indicating that buyers have been driving the price momentum in the market. Not just the 20-SMA, the altcoin was parked above the 50-SMA due to excessive demand. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence suggests price momentum and a trend reversal. The indicator formed a few green histograms, which are buy signals for the coin. The most recent histogram increased in size, anticipating the rise in the price of the asset. Investors could quickly take this as a signal for entry as the price would increase over the next few trading sessions before it started to retrace.

					<description><![CDATA[The Cardano price has rallied significantly over the past week and secured more than a 24% gain. Over the last 24 hours, the coin slipped 2%, indicating that it could not sustain its weekly gains. Following a significant price increase, the technical outlook indicates that the altcoin&#8217;s price will trend lower. This correction might continue over the subsequent trading sessions; however, the ADA daily chart has pointed towards a bullish pattern. This translates to the reading that ADA could attempt to rise on its chart after a brief retracement. Related Reading: Will Solana Price Continue To Surge After The Explosive Price Rally? As Bitcoin continues to post appreciation in the last 24 hours, many altcoins are attempting to rise on their charts, but some altcoins are also struggling under their crucial resistance levels. The accumulation of Cardano took a dip on the daily chart, indicating a fall in demand for the altcoin. This fall in demand is a result of the Cardano price correcting itself. Despite a fall in demand, buyers continued to have the upper hand. The market capitalization of Cardano increased, indicating that the bulls were still around. For Cardano to stop its downward movement, the coin has to sustain itself above the $0.28 price line. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart ADA was trading at $0.30 at press time. The coin recently fell from the $0.31 mark due to the daily loss on its chart. Overhead resistance for the Cardano price was at $0.33; a move above will help ADA recover significantly. On the other hand, ADA has to remain above the immediate support level of $0.28. Failing to stay above the $0.28 mark will drag the altcoin down to $0.24. ADA might trade close to $0.28 before it starts to recover. The altcoin displayed the cup and handle pattern, which is considered to be a bullish price pattern. In this pattern, the asset descends slightly before moving north. The amount of Cardano traded in the last session was green, pointing towards more buyers. Technical Analysis The technical outlook for ADA remained bullish, with buying strength declining slightly. Cardano&#8217;s price was no longer overbought, but buyers still exceeded sellers in the market. The Relative Strength Index recorded a multi-month high. The indicator was above 60 despite the downtick, meaning buying strength was greater than selling. On that same note, the ADA price shot past the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), suggesting that buyers were driving the price momentum. Cardano was also above the 50-SMA line as the bulls were still around. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence that tells the price momentum and reversals was bullish with green signal bars.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana&#8217;s price has achieved an unexpected week-long rally, causing it to significantly outperform almost all other cryptocurrencies. As the price of the centralized smart contract token stabilizes, investors are showing interest in how high it can go. In the first week of 2023, the price of Solana (SOL) soared in value, going from $9.7 to $17.50. As a result, trade volume in SOL has increased, and Wallet Investor predicts that SOL will hit new highs in 2023. The current Solana price, as reported by CoinMarketCap, is $15.87. The value has decreased by 0.50% over the past 24 hours. There are currently 370,184,196 SOL in circulation, which gives it a market cap of $5,915,802,434 and a position in the top 12 of CoinMarketCap&#8217;s rankings. Related Reading: Solana Moves On From FTX Calamity, Sparkles 46% In Last 7 Days SOL Dominates The Market In the weeks following the FTX crash, the price of SOL had taken numerous beatings, eventually falling to single-digit values for the first time in two years. However, Solana beat the market by coming back from the dead and seeing a price hike again.  With daily volume near its average of $6 million, the price of SOL has settled at the new rally&#8217;s top boundaries. This indication is bullish, as buying and selling have not yet grown in a bearish direction. As a result of these considerations, the next bullish goal is the $20 level, as it touched $17.50, representing a 30% increase from the current price. The historical correlation between an overbought RSI and buyer exhaustion has led many traditional investors to view an overbought RSI as a probable sell signal. So, to get the RSI back below 69, the price of SOL may go through a correction or a sideways consolidation phase. Related Reading: Will Solana Price Continue To Surge After The Explosive Price Rally? Messari Outlines Solana&#8217;s Growth Factors A recent tweet from Vitalik Buterin and the enthusiasm in the protocol&#8217;s meme coin Bonk (BONK) are just two of the many variables that have contributed to the rise of SOL, according to crypto analytics service Messari. And when more individuals buy than sell, the value of digital currency increases. Despite its rising transaction volume, SOL&#8217;s declining gas fees were cited by Messari&#8217;s senior analyst Tom Dunleavy as one of the two most likely fundamentals fueling the coin&#8217;s continuous growth. According to the update released by Messari, the protocol no longer appears to be facing the outages it had been experiencing. The price of Solana&#8217;s native coin dropped last year due to a couple of factors, including multiple network disruptions and the harsh crypto winter. The downtime was bad enough to get Cardano&#8217;s founder, the outspoken Charles Hoskinson, to criticize the protocol publicly.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solana&#8217;s price has achieved an unexpected week-long rally, causing it to significantly outperform almost all other cryptocurrencies. As the price of the centralized smart contract token stabilizes, investors are showing interest in how high it can go.</p>
<p>In the first week of 2023, the price of Solana (SOL) soared in value, going from $9.7 to $17.50. As a result, trade volume in SOL has increased, and <a href="https://walletinvestor.com/forecast/solana-prediction-data" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wallet Investor</a> predicts that SOL will hit new highs in 2023.</p>
<p>The current Solana price, as reported by CoinMarketCap, is $15.87. The value has decreased by 0.50% over the past 24 hours. There are currently 370,184,196 SOL in circulation, which gives it a market cap of $5,915,802,434 and a position in the top 12 of CoinMarketCap&#8217;s rankings.</p>

<h2>SOL Dominates The Market</h2>
<p>In the weeks following the FTX crash, the price of SOL had taken numerous beatings, eventually falling to single-digit values for the first time in two years. However, Solana beat the market by coming back from the dead and seeing a price hike again. </p>
<p>With daily volume near its average of $6 million, the price of SOL has settled at the new rally&#8217;s top boundaries. This indication is bullish, as buying and selling have not yet grown in a bearish direction. As a result of these considerations, the next bullish goal is the $20 level, as it touched $17.50, representing a 30% increase from the current <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price.</a></p>
<p>The historical correlation between an overbought RSI and buyer exhaustion has led many traditional investors to view an overbought RSI as a probable sell signal. So, to get the RSI back below 69, the price of SOL may go through a correction or a sideways consolidation phase.</p>

<h2>Messari Outlines Solana&#8217;s Growth Factors</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1612826681051615235" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tweet</a> from Vitalik Buterin and the enthusiasm in the protocol&#8217;s meme coin Bonk (BONK) are just two of the many variables that have contributed to the rise of SOL, according to crypto analytics service Messari. And when more individuals buy than sell, the value of digital currency increases.</p>
<p>Despite its rising transaction volume, SOL&#8217;s declining gas fees were cited by Messari&#8217;s senior analyst Tom Dunleavy as one of the two most likely fundamentals fueling the coin&#8217;s continuous growth.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://messari.io/asset/solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">update</a> released by Messari, the protocol no longer appears to be facing the outages it had been experiencing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that altcoin volume dominance is now at the highest level since January 2021, while Bitcoin&#8217;s is at its lowest. Altcoin Dominance By Volume Recently Touched A High Of 64% As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance is just at 16% now. The &#8220;dominance by volume&#8221; is an indicator that measures the percentage of the total crypto market trading volume that&#8217;s being contributed by a specific coin. When the value of this metric goes up for any crypto, it means that particular crypto is observing a higher amount of activity relative to the rest of the market currently. This suggests that the coin is garnering more interest from investors right now. On the other hand, low values can imply that the crypto is losing mindshare at the moment as its volume percentage is going down. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the dominance by volume for the entire altcoin sector combined (minus Ethereum), as well as for Bitcoin, over the past couple of years: The two metrics seem to have gone opposite ways in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance by volume has sharply decreased recently and has touched a value of just 16%. This is the lowest value BTC has observed during the last couple of years. The altcoins (other than Ethereum), on the contrary, have observed their dominance shoot up in the last week or so, as the metric now has a value of 64%. This suggests that BTC has lost its market share to these alts recently. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bullish Signal: Whale Withdraws $34.7M In SHIB From Binance The quant finds this trend &#8220;very concerning,&#8221; however. The reason behind that is the fact that whenever rallies have kicked off with altcoins being on top, they haven&#8217;t usually lasted for too long, and the prices have quickly come back down. This can be very clearly seen in the chart. For example, the tops of both the bull rallies of 2021 (the ones in the first and second half of the year) took formation while the altcoins had a higher trading volume dominance than Bitcoin. The latest FTX crash also took place while alts were dominating the market. It would appear that generally any sustainable and healthy price rallies have only started with the dominance of BTC being higher than these alts. One prominent example is that the July 2021 bottom, which kicked off the second-half bull run of 2021, took place with the Bitcoin volume percentage being higher than altcoins.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has evolved from the unending devastating bear market to a more green and overwhelming market. Cryptocurrencies are moving from the initial stagnant, and lower lows state to a rallying to the top.  Among the number of cryptocurrencies moving upward and making significant higher highs is Bitcoin, the largest crypto by market cap. So far, Bitcoin has broken multiple resistance and continued in a bullish trend carrying the whole crypto market with it.  Bitcoin Taps Above $17,000 For The First Time In One Month Since the FTX crash happened and the bear market deepened, we saw Bitcoin crashing to lower lows and slipping below the 17,000 zones. After it fell below that, Bitcoin stayed there for a long while. However, over the past few weeks since the new year began, the Bitcoin market has been making some positive moves. After ranging around the $16,000 zone from late last year, Bitcoin tapped into and above $17,000 for the first in almost a month, trading at $17,500. Tuesday was when BTC made a significant move of about 1.5%, the highest daily gain since December 20, 2022.  Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Whales Go On 20,000 BTC Buying Spree And since Bitcoin tapped into the $17,000 zone, the coin hasn’t budged or even fallen out of that zone. However, it has lost a couple of hundred dollars and now trades at $17,409 at the time of writing. Despite the retrace, its market capitalization is still above $335 billion, which is higher than the market cap seen on BTC late last year.  BTC Begins To Lose Dominance  Though Bitcoin is still considered the big dog among cryptocurrencies, it’s beginning to lose its dominance against altcoins in the crypto space as whale investors have registered low participation in the BTC market. According to the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, altcoin trading volume dominance is now above 50% as opposed to Bitcoin&#8217;s 39% dominance. Maartunn, a contributor to CryptoQuant, wrote in a blog post, “Usually when traders get bored on BTC, they start trading altcoins which are, in general, further on the risk curve. This makes them very fragile and easy to squeeze.” He added, “altcoin dominance is again above 50%. Be aware: when altcoins continue to dominate, there is a potential risk for further downside,” he added. Furthermore, according to a recent report from Arcane Research, BTC&#8217;s 30-day volatility has plummeted to June 2020 levels as the asset has been trading relatively flat with low volatility through the first 10 days of 2023, making it even more stable than gold, the dollar strength index, Nasdaq, and the S&#38;P500 measured through 5-day volatility. Related Reading: Analysts Recommend: Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Meanwhile, with altcoins gaining more dominance, large investors are now turning to assets other than BTC. Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) have made significant moves over the past 7 days, with three of them up by over 50% combined.

		<title>Crypto Market Will See A Bloodbath If Ripple Loses To SEC, Gasparino Says</title>

					<description><![CDATA[In recent days, a heated discussion has arisen between prominent journalist and Fox Business host Charles Gasparino and the Ripple / XRP community. Gasparino voiced that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had legitimate reasons why they targeted and sued Ripple prior to FTX. Even Ripple&#8217;s legal counsel Stuart Alderoty took a stand and rejected the arguments, as Bitcoinist reported. Meanwhile, the Fox Business host did clarify that he has no idea who will win the lawsuit. He even admitted that the judge&#8217;s comments &#8220;initially indicated she would side with Ripple,&#8221; but at the same time, he warned that this was before the &#8220;whole SBF FTX implosion.&#8221; Ripple Victory Is Crucial For The Entire Crypto Industry In his two most recent tweets, Gasparino paints a dark future scenario for the broader crypto market and shared his view on what consequences the industry could face if the SEC wins against Ripple. Gasparino wrote via Twitter: Crypto community sees a bloodbath if SEC prevails against Ripple in the form of more regs/oversight that will impact nearly every sector including the exchange biz given Gary Gensler&#8217;s desire to force registration of every coin but BTC. Gasparino is not entirely alone in this opinion either. Even Ripple has expressed in previous statements that the company is fighting not just for itself, but the entire crypto industry, to avoid an overreaching regulation by the SEC. Related Reading: XRP Price Primed For Future Rally Following Ripple’s MENA Expansion Noteworthy is also Gasparino&#8217;s latest tweet which refers to the largest American crypto exchange. The journalist asserts that Coinbase is already developing a plan to survive a regulatory crackdown by the SEC: Coinbase tells Fox Business it&#8217;s developing a plan to survive an SEC regulatory crackdown on digital assets using broker-dealers to trade coins registered as securities. Move comes as SEC case v Ripple looms; SEC win could force coins aside from BTC to register. What Might A Bloodbath Look Like For The Crypto Market? The Fox Business host does not define what he means by a bloodbath. However, a look at history helps to understand the thesis. When the SEC sued Ripple on December 22, 2020, the price dropped a whopping 68% in one week. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently down 74.74% and 72.62% from their all-time highs, respectively, XRP is 89.31% below its all-time high of $3.40, which was reached on January 07, 2018. Thus, XRP is showing significant underperformance. Related Reading: XRP Price Prediction: Bulls Could Aim $0.4 or Higher The outcome of the court battle remains on the razor&#8217;s edge, with the XRP community, of course, seeing plenty of arguments in favor of a Ripple victory. In a recent blog post, Ripple&#8217;s general counsel Stuart Alderoty revealed that he expects a &#8211; positive &#8211; outcome for the lawsuit in the second quarter of 2023. At press time, the XRP price was trading at $0.3640. With yesterday&#8217;s upward movement, XRP was able to break through the key resistance at $0.3560. This opens up the possibility to attack the next resistance at $0.3740, possibly as early as tomorrow, Thursday, when the CPI data for December is released.

<p>Even Ripple&#8217;s legal counsel Stuart Alderoty took a stand and rejected the arguments, as Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-denies-allegations-as-sec-case-sees-filings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a>. Meanwhile, the Fox Business host did clarify that he has no idea who will win the lawsuit. He even <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1612849423477792770" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">admitted</a> that the judge&#8217;s comments &#8220;initially indicated she would side with Ripple,&#8221; but at the same time, he warned that this was before the &#8220;whole SBF FTX implosion.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ripple Victory Is Crucial For The Entire Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>In his two most recent tweets, Gasparino paints a dark future scenario for the broader crypto market and shared his view on what consequences the industry could face if the SEC wins against Ripple. Gasparino <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a> via Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Crypto community sees a bloodbath if SEC prevails against Ripple in the form of more regs/oversight that will impact nearly every sector including the exchange biz given Gary Gensler&#8217;s desire to force registration of every coin but BTC.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Gasparino is not entirely alone in this opinion either. Even Ripple has expressed in previous statements that the company is fighting not just for itself, but the entire crypto industry, to avoid an overreaching regulation by the SEC.</p>

<p>Noteworthy is also Gasparino&#8217;s latest tweet which refers to the largest American crypto exchange. The journalist asserts that Coinbase is already developing a plan to survive a regulatory crackdown by the SEC:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Coinbase tells Fox Business it&#8217;s developing a plan to survive an SEC regulatory crackdown on digital assets using broker-dealers to trade coins registered as securities. Move comes as SEC case v Ripple looms; SEC win could force coins aside from BTC to register.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Might A Bloodbath Look Like For The Crypto Market?</h2>
<p>The Fox Business host does not define what he means by a bloodbath. However, a look at history helps to understand the thesis. When the SEC sued Ripple on December 22, 2020, the price dropped a whopping 68% in one week.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin and Ethereum are currently down 74.74% and 72.62% from their all-time highs, respectively, XRP is 89.31% below its all-time high of $3.40, which was reached on January 07, 2018. Thus, XRP is showing significant underperformance.</p>

<p>The outcome of the court battle remains on the razor&#8217;s edge, with the XRP community, of course, seeing plenty of arguments in favor of a Ripple victory. In a recent <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-execs-predict-utility-key-driver-2023/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Ripple&#8217;s general counsel Stuart Alderoty revealed that he expects a &#8211; positive &#8211; outcome for the lawsuit in the second quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>At press time, the XRP price was trading at $0.3640. With yesterday&#8217;s upward movement, XRP was able to break through the key resistance at $0.3560. This opens up the possibility to attack the next resistance at $0.3740, possibly as early as tomorrow, Thursday, when the CPI data for December is released.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows Bitcoin has been more stable than gold, DXY, Nasdaq, and S&#38;P 500 recently, here&#8217;s what history says could follow next. Bitcoin 5-Day Volatility Has Fallen Below That Of Gold, DXY, Nasdaq, And S&#38;P 500 According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, BTC has been more stable than these assets for a record duration already this year. The &#8220;volatility&#8221; is an indicator that measures the deviation of daily returns from the average for Bitcoin. When the value of this metric is high, it means the crypto has been registering a higher amount of returns compared to the mean, suggesting that the coin has involved a higher trading risk recently. On the other hand, low values imply there haven&#8217;t been any significant fluctuations in the price in recent days, showing that the market has been stale. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day volatility for Bitcoin over the course of its entire history: The value of the metric seems to have plunged in recent days &#124; Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - January 10 As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin 30-day volatility is at very low levels currently as the price has been trading mostly sideways in recent weeks. The current values of the indicator are the lowest since 2020, but they are still higher than some of the lows during previous bear markets.

To compare these assets&#8217; volatilities against each other, the report has made use of the 5-day volatility (and not the 30-day or 7-day one). The below table highlights the periods in BTC&#8217;s lifetime when the crypto&#8217;s 5-day volatility has been simultaneously lower than all these traditional assets. Looks like such occurrences have been a very rare event &#124; Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - January 10 As the table displays, there have only ever been a handful of instances where the Bitcoin 5-day volatility has been lower than that of gold, DXY, Nasdaq, and S&#38;P 500 at the same time. The report labels such occurrences as &#8220;relative volatility compression&#8221; periods. It seems like, before the latest streak, the highest duration of this trend was just 2 consecutive days. This means that the current relative volatility compression period is already the longest ever in the coin&#8217;s history.

<h2>Bitcoin 5-Day Volatility Has Fallen Below That Of Gold, DXY, Nasdaq, And S&amp;P 500</h2>
