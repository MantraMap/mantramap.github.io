<p class="s7">Despite Aptos (APT) experiencing a 12.84% price drop in the last week following the Node v1.2.4 release, experts are shifting their focus towards a new, innovative crowdlending platform. It has made headlines as the first blockchain platform for peer-2-peer Lending tapping into the trillion-dollar lending market. In comparison to Aptos (APT), Collateral Network is set for greatness, as Web3 meets asset-backed lending.</p>

<p class="s3">Aptos (APT)</p>
<p class="s7">Aptos (APT), dubbed the &lsquo;Solana Killer,&rsquo; is a Layer 1 blockchain that integrates Block-STM Technology. Despite the latest Node v1.2.4 release, Aptos (APT) has dropped 12.84% in the last week. Aptos (APT) has maintained VC interest because of its relationship with Diem, a project by Meta. Former Meta researchers, engineers, UX designers, and strategists make up the Aptos (APT) team.</p>
<p class="s7">Currently, 84% of Aptos (APT) tokens are locked, and each Aptos (APT) unlocking event is likely to result in an Aptos (APT) price drop. However, a 4.5 million Aptos (APT) token, worth about $50 million, was unlocked on April 12, increasing the circulation supply by 0.5% to 186 million Aptos (APT). As a result, the token&rsquo;s price decreased to $9.01 the same day.</p>
<p class="s7">Despite Aptos (APT) delivering mainnet support for high-precision integers, which are critical for DeFi applications, anxiety and uncertainty continue to plague Aptos (APT) holders.</p>
<p>Aptos (APT) is now trading at $10.80 per share, with a 24-hour trading volume of $439.99 million and a market size of $2.02 billion. Aptos (APT) peaked at $19.86 on January 30, 2023, and is currently down 45.59%. Aptos (APT) still has room for development and innovation within the blockchain sector.</p>

<p class="s3">Revolutionizing The Lending Process Leveraging The Blockchain</p>
<p>The debut of Collateral Network (COLT), a Web3-based crowdlending network, is intended to transform the worldwide credit market. Collateral Network (COLT) allows users to borrow against off-chain physical assets. As collateral, the platform turns real-world assets into asset-backed NFTs, which are subsequently fractionalized.</p>
<p>Lenders, on the other hand, may contribute to fund loans on the platform by buying NFTs&rsquo; fractions in exchange for a set weekly income and various other incentives. This way, lenders can fund several loans with small amounts, building their own diversified portfolios. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Collateral Network (COLT) Provides Liquidity Like No Other</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) accepts real estate, fine art, luxury watches, rare whiskeys, jewelry, gold, and many more off-chain assets. </p>
<p>To bring these assets on-chain, Collateral Network (COLT) mints an NFT 100% backed by the asset in question, which the owner can use to access crowd-sourced liquidity on the platform.</p>
<p>Fractionalized NFT lending means that lenders can earn passive income on Collateral Network (COLT), and borrowers can access liquidity in assets they already own without selling them and thus can still benefit from long-term appreciation.</p>

<p>With the big 40% deposit bonus available right now, you can get some Collateral Network (COLT) for only $0.014. &nbsp;</p>
