<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Despite Bitcoin&#8217;s decline, MakerDAO&#8217;s Maker (MKR) spiked 26% in a week as the token buyback program went live.</em></li>



<li><em>A series of whales and organizations compete to transfer tokens to exchanges to take profits.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Some MakerDAO Maker (MKR) whales are taking advantage of the massive price rally to move large amounts of MKR to exchanges, possibly taking profits.</strong></h5>



<p>MakerDAO&#8217;s MKR token rose to near a one-year high on Friday after the introduction of a token buyback program took place. MKR briefly rallied above $1,200 early Friday, for the first time since last August, then dropped some of its gains to change hands at around $1,148. This token has gained 26.55% in the past week.</p>

<p>The price action occurred as the lending protocol triggered a token buyback program on Wednesday, removing the supply of Maker token from the market. A governance proposal explains that the so-called Smart Burn Engine periodically allocates excess DAI stablecoins from Maker&#8217;s extra cache to purchase MKR from the UniSwap team.</p>



<p>The token&#8217;s total market cap is around $1 billion, so a buyback would reduce the supply by 0.7% per month at current prices.</p>



<p>The notable increase in value is mainly related to recent activities involving venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and CMS Holdings. Andreessen Horowitz, known for his substantial investments in various technology companies, has been observed<a href="https://coincu.com/201514-a16z-sends-5-9m-mkr-transfer-to-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> depositing</a> Maker tokens on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, presumably to sell them.</p>



<p>The number of MKRs reported by a16z is 12,864, worth about $12.6 million. A private transfer of 6,900 Maker tokens ($8 million) was made to a new address, hinting at potential plans to deposit more funds on an exchange. Currently, a16z holds 12,396 tokens worth about $14.4 million.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>At the same time, CMS Holdings, a private investment firm specializing in blockchain and decentralized finance, has reduced its recently accumulated holdings of MKR. Just before the spike, the company sent 525 token (worth around $614,000) to Binance.</p>



<p>Previously, CMS Holdings withdrew 1,325 tokens ($1.54 million) from Binance and Bitget, with an average price of $793. The company&#8217;s Maker holdings are 800 tokens, with an approximate value of $936,000. This abrupt correction in the holdings of these influential market players could play a role in the price increase of MKR.</p>



<p>Furthermore, another whale decrypted the amount of 4,210 tokens ($4.85 million) and deposited it all on Binance 12 hours ago. This whale amassed 4,210 tokens (worth $3.19 million at the time) from Binance at $758, making a profit of ~$1.66 million.</p>

<p>Maker is one of the largest and oldest DeFi lending protocols and also issued $4.6 billion worth of DAI stablecoins. It is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), where MKR holders vote on governance proposals.</p>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a response to the court ruling in Terra Exchange LLC v. Ripple Labs Inc. on July 21, 2023.</p>



<p>In response to the court&#8217;s decision, the SEC argued that the court erred in deciding to dismiss the case. The agency argued that the court failed to consider the evidence presented by the SEC and failed to apply the law properly. The SEC also argued that the court failed to consider the potential harm to investors if Ripple Labs was allowed to continue operating without registering the XRP token as a security.</p>



<p>The SEC has been investigating Ripple Labs since late 2020, alleging that the company and its executives violated securities laws by selling unregistered securities.</p>



<p>However, on May 16, the community stirred up with US District Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://coincu.com/203108-ripple-ceo-rejoices-landmark-court-ruling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">siding with</a> Ripple Labs that nearly half of its XRP sales did not violate investor protection laws. Torres&#8217; ruling has given hope to other defendants fighting the SEC over the sale of cryptocurrencies, which the SEC says are often securities sold illegally.</p>



<p>SEC lawyers previewed an appeal that could potentially overturn portions of Ripple Labs last week in a separate enforcement lawsuit against TerraUSD and Luna creators Do Kwon and Terraform Labs.</p>

<p>Do Kwon, the jailed co-founder of crypto firm Terraform Labs, is one of the defendants trying to use Torres&#8217; decision to defeat the SEC lawsuit. The agency charged Kwon with fraud and other law violations in a complaint filed in Manhattan federal court in February.</p>



<p>In its statement, the SEC wrote that the judge in Kwon&#8217;s case should not cite the Ripple case as a precedent. The SEC said Torres&#8217; decision &#8220;adds baseless claims&#8221; to testing when an asset is a security. The agency plans to seek &#8220;further review,&#8221; which could mean an appeal.</p>

<p>Reportedly, since the opening of the inquiry portal, a total of 30,000 customer complaints have been resolved, with a claim value of US$78 billion. The court will approve the settlement at an August 10 hearing.</p>



<p>The Wall Street Journal added that a confirmation hearing on Celsius&#8217;s restructuring is scheduled for October and that customers could start receiving crypto and other assets later this year.</p>



<p>While Celsius&#8217; lawyers argue that Celsius owes customers no more than their deposits, some users have filed claims for misconduct by former management.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit in federal court against Celsius and its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, accusing it of raising billions of dollars through <a href="https://coincu.com/204802-celsius-network-a-story-of-greed-and-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fraudulent</a> and unregistered sales, defrauding investors, and manipulating the price of its native token.</p>



<p>The company recently announced a $4.7 billion settlement with US government regulators over allegations of fraud. The charges against Mashinsky, filed by federal prosecutors, include securities fraud, merchandise fraud, wire fraud, and various other allegations of securities fraud and manipulation.</p>



<p>However, the company insists that the settlement will not have any impact on ongoing reorganization efforts or the amount it wants to recover for its customers. Celsius, which at one point held $30 billion in assets, filed for bankruptcy about a year ago.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Worldcoin&#8217;s World ID SDK is now open to global developers for seamless integration.</em></li>



<li><em>World ID protocol ensures privacy and supports open identity standards like OAuth 2.0 and OIDC.</em></li>



<li><em>SDK&#8217;s permissionless architecture offers secure human verification and privacy across apps.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant move, Worldcoin, the cryptocurrency project backed by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/product/wait-over-worldcoin-world-id-sdk-publicly-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened</a> up its World ID SDK to developers worldwide. The World ID SDK, which was initially accessible through a limited waitlist, has already seen more than 100 projects being built with it, including prominent integrations like Okta&#8217;s Auth0 and Talent Protocol in Europe.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/173604-worldcoin-makes-a-new-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World ID</a>, introduced by <a href="https://coincu.com/191968-worldcoin-is-creating-excitement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldcoin</a> in March 2023, serves as a revolutionary privacy-preserving digital identity protocol that allows individuals to verify their humanity in the digital realm. Powered by the Orb, a specialized biometric imaging device, the protocol employs proof of personhood (PoP) to ensure accurate identity verification.</p>



<p>As of today, the World ID SDK is publicly available, streamlining web, mobile, and on-chain integrations for developers. The SDK offers a range of tools and features, such as web widgets (JS), a Developer Portal, and a development simulator, as well as examples and guides, making integration fast and straightforward. One of the most remarkable aspects of World ID&#8217;s architecture is its permissionless nature, enabling developers from all corners of the globe to integrate with the protocol at no cost.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="493" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-1024x493.png" alt="Worldcoin&#039;s World ID SDK Is Now Available For Global Developers" class="wp-image-204884" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-1024x493.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-300x144.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-768x370.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-1536x739.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-750x361.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526-1140x549.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1526.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Worldcoin&#039;s World ID SDK Is Now Available For Global Developers 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>An essential characteristic of the World ID is its adaptability to support existing open identity standards. Currently, it is compatible with OAuth 2.0 and OIDC (OpenID Connect), and future updates will extend support to Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE).</p>



<p>One of the prominent advantages of the World ID SDK is its ability to safeguard against bots and provide human verification for users. Developers using the &#8220;Sign in with Worldcoin&#8221; option can collect only essential information from users, ensuring their service remains privacy-focused.</p>



<p>Moreover, World ID prioritizes user privacy by dissociating a person&#8217;s World ID, app accounts, PoP verifications, and wallets from being linked together. This means that neither Worldcoin contributors nor app developers can track users across different websites or gain access to personal information, making it a robust privacy-oriented solution.</p>

<p>The implications of global proof of personhood (PoP) are far-reaching, opening the doors to a new generation of products and services across various domains. These include enhanced security measures for social networks with better bot protection and community moderation, transparent voting mechanisms through DAO governance and online polls, fraud prevention and compliance measures in financial services, customer incentives like loyalty programs, referrals, and free trials, as well as improved marketplaces with enhanced reputation systems and prevention of fake reviews and transactions.</p>



<p>World ID&#8217;s general availability has arrived hot on the heels of Worldcoin&#8217;s announcement that the project has <a href="https://coincu.com/198954-worldcoin-creates-new-breakthrough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amassed</a> over 2 million World ID sign-ups during its beta phase. Surpassing this milestone in half the time, it took to verify the first million World ID holders showcases the growing interest and trust in this groundbreaking identity protocol.</p>



<p>With the World ID SDK now open to developers worldwide, the future holds immense potential for a privacy-focused and user-centric digital identity verification system that could reshape the landscape of online interactions and transactions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DOJ strengthens cryptocurrency crime combat with NCET-CCIPS merger.</em></li>



<li><em>Increased resources to tackle cybercrime, money laundering, and ransomware.</em></li>



<li><em>Claudia Quiroz to lead NCET, ensuring robust prosecution efforts.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is intensifying its efforts to combat cryptocurrency-related crimes by consolidating its National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) into the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/principal-deputy-assistant-attorney-general-nicole-m-argentieri-delivers-remarks-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">move</a> is aimed at enhancing the DOJ&#8217;s capabilities in tackling cybercrime and money laundering involving cryptocurrencies.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1523.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="830" height="553" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1523.png" alt="DOJ Unleashes Full Force: Merges Crypto Crime Team To Combat Threats" class="wp-image-204878" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1523.png 830w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1523-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1523-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1523-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 830px) 100vw, 830px" title="DOJ Unleashes Full Force: Merges Crypto Crime Team To Combat Threats 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>NCET, which was launched in October 2021, has been successful in investigating and prosecuting criminal misuses of cryptocurrencies, including those committed by virtual currency exchanges and money laundering infrastructure actors. By merging NCET into CCIPS, the number of criminal division attorneys working on crypto matters will more than double, and the team will have greater resources and authority to handle complex cases.</p>



<p>The merger recognizes the crucial role of cryptocurrency work within the Criminal Division, putting it on equal footing with computer crime and intellectual property work. NCET&#8217;s mission will continue within CCIPS, investigating and prosecuting criminal offenses involving cryptocurrency abuse, money laundering, and digital asset seizures.</p>



<p>With ransomware being a significant concern for national security, the new CCIPS, together with NCET, will focus on investigating ransomware crimes and tracing cryptocurrency payments associated with such attacks. By collaborating with other government agencies and the Justice Department&#8217;s National Security Division, they aim to disrupt ransomware operations and prevent illicit funds from reaching ransomware hotspots.</p>



<p>The arrest of <a href="https://coincu.com/161642-sec-charges-avraham-eisenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avraham Eisenberg</a> for his involvement in the exploitation of the decentralized exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/164566-mango-markets-hacker-denied-bail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mango Markets</a> last year is a notable example of the DOJ&#8217;s commitment to holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>As part of the recent merger between the NCET and the CCIPS, Claudia Quiroz, a seasoned assistant U.S. attorney with extensive experience in digital currency matters, has been appointed as the acting director of NCET. Her expertise in prosecuting complex cases involving cryptocurrencies will undoubtedly play a crucial role in the team&#8217;s future endeavors.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Eun Young Choi, who has led the NCET team since February 2022, will continue to serve at the <a href="https://coincu.com/201799-doj-arrests-senior-security-engineer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOJ</a>, ensuring a seamless transition and continuity in addressing cryptocurrency-related criminal activities.</p>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s efforts to expand its capabilities in handling cybercrime and cryptocurrency-related offenses, coupled with the dedication of experienced prosecutors like Quiroz and Choi, underscore the department&#8217;s determination to safeguard the integrity of the digital financial landscape and protect the interests of the public and the nation as a whole.</p>



<p>The DOJ&#8217;s dedication to combating cybercrime and cryptocurrency-related offenses remains steadfast, with a focus on addressing the challenges posed by blended threats, where nation-states and criminal groups join forces to perpetrate cyberattacks.</p>

<p>The consolidation into CCIPS and the continued partnership with the National Security Division show the DOJ&#8217;s commitment to disrupting cyber threats and bringing cybercriminals to justice. As cybercrime continues to be a serious problem, the DOJ is determined to execute its responsibility to protect public safety, national security, and economic prosperity through rigorous investigations and prosecutions.</p>



<p>The announcement of the merger marks a significant step forward in the DOJ&#8217;s fight against cryptocurrency-related crimes, aligning resources and expertise to better address the evolving challenges posed by the digital landscape. The department remains vigilant in its pursuit of justice and safeguarding the interests of the public and the nation in the face of cyber threats.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DeFi protocol Conic Finance suffered an exploit, allowing attackers to grab over 1,700 ETH worth over $3.2 million from its Omnipool.</em></li>



<li><em>The root cause of the attack was a &#8220;re-entrancy attack&#8221; resulting from a wrong assumption in the Curve Meta Registry for ETH in Curve V2 pools.</em></li>



<li><em>Conic Finance is actively addressing the issue, deploying a fix for the affected contract, and ensuring the safety of user withdrawals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the latest announcement from Conic Finance, the DeFi protocol provided a detailed status update regarding the recent exploit that led to the loss of over 1,700 Ether (ETH), valued at over $3.2 million.</strong></h5>

<p>The root cause of the attack was <a href="https://twitter.com/ConicFinance/status/1682385605668241408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identified</a> as a &#8220;re-entrancy attack,&#8221; which exploited a wrong assumption about the address returned by the Curve Meta Registry for ETH in Curve V2 pools.</p>



<p>The re-entrancy attack is a well-known vulnerability in smart contracts that allows attackers to repeatedly call a protocol, tricking it into transferring assets. In this case, the attacker took advantage of a discrepancy in the price data provided by the oracle, enabling them to manipulate the pricing system and withdraw the stolen funds.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204773-conic-finance-3-2-million-attack-on-eth-omnipool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conic Finance</a> has been proactively addressing the issue and is deploying a fix to the affected contract to prevent further exploits. The protocol has confirmed that the exploit cannot be performed again on the ETH Omnipool, and user withdrawals are secure. Additionally, they assured the community that no other Conic Omnipools were affected by this particular issue.</p>

<p>The incident highlights the significance of oracle systems in DeFi, as they provide real-time price data for various assets. However, they also present a potential attack vector for hackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.</p>



<p>This exploit came shortly after another DeFi platform, <a href="https://coincu.com/194236-sturdy-finance-was-attacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sturdy Finance</a>, suffered a similar oracle manipulation attack that resulted in an $800,000 loss. These incidents underscore the importance of ongoing vigilance and security measures within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<p>Conic Finance aims to provide a more detailed post-mortem analysis of the exploit soon, shedding light on the specific factors that allowed the re-entrancy attack to occur and the measures taken to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://coincu.com/200342-surge-in-defi-exit-scams-certik-report-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi</a> space continues to evolve, ensuring the security and integrity of protocols remains a top priority to safeguard user funds and foster trust in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Recent reports have accused former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of paying millions to his defense lawyers using stolen funds. The accusations have been made on behalf of the now-collapsed crypto exchange, with lawyers claiming that Bankman-Fried used $10 million of misappropriated money to pay for his defense.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-defense-lawyers-with-ftx-funds-lawsuit.html#:~:text=A%20lawsuit%20against%20Sam%20Bankman,Joe%20Bankman%2C%20FTX%20lawyers%20say." target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-defense-lawyers-with-ftx-funds-lawsuit.html#:~:text=A%20lawsuit%20against%20Sam%20Bankman,Joe%20Bankman%2C%20FTX%20lawyers%20say." rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC </a>has reported on the initial accusations against Bankman-Fried. Furthermore, lawyers allege that the FTX founder “engineered a gift” of $10 million to his father, Joe Bankman. The FTX legal team is now suing the former CEO in Deleware bankruptcy court over the stolen funds.</p>



<p>This latest legal dispute adds to the list of offenses that Bankman-Fried is facing. He has been accused of fraud, bribery, and campaign finance violation charges. The once-revered cryptocurrency exchange was found to be fraudulent, and Bankman-Fried is a con man.</p>

<p>The FTX lawyers are attempting to recover the funds Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives misappropriated throughout their tenure. Lawyers claim that Bankman-Fried pilfered money by sending a $10 million gift to his father, Joe Bankman. The lawsuit further states that gifts had been tracked from the former CEO’s Morgan Stanley and TD Ameritrade accounts since early 2022, and those funds are now allegedly paying for his defense.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried has yet to comment on this latest legal dispute. However, the controversy surrounding FTX and its former CEO is one of the most thoroughly horrible in the young history of the digital asset industry. The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed almost instantly, and now, its executives are facing a barrage of legal troubles.</p>

<p>The couple, Heather Morgan and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein, were initially arrested in February 2022 and are scheduled to appear for a plea hearing on August 3 before Senior Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, according to court records.</p>



<p>Heather Morgan, also known as &#8220;Razzlekhan&#8221; in the hip-hop community where she promoted her music, and Ilya Lichtenstein are accused of conspiring to launder over 100,000 bitcoin stolen in the hack of Bitfinex. At the time of the hack, the stolen bitcoin was valued at $71 million, but its value had appreciated to more than $4.5 billion by the time of their arrest. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of assets worth approximately $3 billion, including various cryptocurrencies and cash from bank accounts, according to the charging document and current spot prices of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The couple, who had active public profiles, are facing charges of money laundering conspiracy, with Morgan facing an additional count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, as per an updated charging document filed recently. Their case has drawn significant attention, particularly due to Morgan&#8217;s unique music videos and public persona, which added a touch of comic relief to the otherwise serious affair.</p>

<p>The emergence of the plea agreement marks the conclusion of one of the most sensational criminal cases in the cryptocurrency space, an industry that has witnessed its fair share of scandals. The couple&#8217;s alleged involvement in laundering the stolen cryptocurrency raised eyebrows in the crypto community and brought attention to the need for stronger security measures in the industry.</p>



<p>The seized Bitcoin, totaling 94,000 BTC, was successfully recovered by federal officials upon the couple&#8217;s arrest in early 2022. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had previously implied that the couple may have been linked to the original hackers, but did not formally make such claims. The couple was accused of laundering around 25,000 BTC, with access to an additional 94,000 BTC stolen during the Bitfinex exploit in 2016.</p>



<p>Initially, Morgan and Lichtenstein had planned to fight the charges, pointing out deficiencies in the government&#8217;s evidence against them. However, signs of a potential plea deal emerged in March 2022 when prosecutors indicated that they were in talks with Morgan&#8217;s attorneys regarding a possible resolution that wouldn&#8217;t involve a trial.</p>

<p>As part of the plea agreement, the couple has agreed to forfeit various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, stablecoins, and cash, from their bank accounts. The precise length of their potential sentencing remains unclear, and their sentencing hearing is expected to take place before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington.</p>



<p>The case has shed light on the need for heightened security measures and increased vigilance in the cryptocurrency space to prevent such incidents and protect the integrity of the industry. With the plea agreement, the fate of the couple and their involvement in the Bitfinex hack is likely to be determined soon.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Paradigm, an institutional liquidity platform for crypto, launches Paradex, a decentralized perpetual platform on Starknet&#8217;s Layer 2 appchain.</em></li>



<li><em>Paradex combines CeFi liquidity with DeFi transparency and self-custody, addressing trust issues and fragmented risk engines in traditional finance.</em></li>



<li><em>Collaboration between Paradigm and StarkWare brings scalability and customization, ushering in a new era of hybrid derivatives exchanges in DeFi.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Paradigm, a prominent institutional liquidity platform for cryptocurrency, is making its entry into the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena with the unveiling of <a href="https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1682409806076735488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradex</a>, an innovative decentralized perpetual platform.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1024x536.png" alt="Paradigm Unleashes Paradex: A Revolutionary Hybrid CeFi-DeFi Derivatives Exchange" class="wp-image-204848" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1536x804.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Paradigm Unleashes Paradex: A Revolutionary Hybrid CeFi-DeFi Derivatives Exchange 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>Blending the best of both worlds, Paradex aims to offer a seamless trading experience by combining the liquidity prowess of centralized finance (CeFi) with the transparency and self-custody features of DeFi.</p>



<p>The birth of Paradex is the result of a productive six-month collaboration between <a href="https://coincu.com/152165-paradigm-crypto-derivatives-reduces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradigm</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/165000-starkware-will-power-eth-layer-2-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StarkWare</a>, the visionary company behind Ethereum&#8217;s layer 2 network, Starknet. As a testament to its versatility, Paradex will operate as an independent chain within Starknet&#8217;s developer stack, effectively positioning it as a Layer 2 appchain.</p>

<p>The choice of Starknet as the platform for Paradex comes as no surprise, given its capacity for scalability, control, and customization. Nafaa Hendaoui, Head of Product at Paradex, expressed enthusiasm for Starknet&#8217;s private instance, <a href="https://coincu.com/204036-starknet-starknet-appchains-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appchain</a>, which provides a robust solution to accommodate Paradex&#8217;s ambitious vision.</p>

<p>One of Paradex&#8217;s primary aims is to address the trust deficit that has emerged in the realm of centralized finance, with FTX&#8217;s multi-billion-dollar collapse due to a liquidity crisis caused by management decisions serving as a poignant example. By integrating the transparency and trustlessness of DeFi, Paradex endeavors to furnish users with a secure and reliable trading platform.</p>



<p>Beyond enhancing trust, the platform seeks to tackle the challenges posed by fragmentation within legacy CeFi risk engines. Such fragmentation adversely affects capital efficiency and liquidity levels, prompting Paradex to devise an all-encompassing solution.</p>



<p>Paradigm, with its wealth of experience in catering to both institutional crypto derivatives traders and the DeFi sector, is confidently venturing into the Layer 2 domain with the introduction of Paradex. By leveraging Starknet&#8217;s capabilities, the platform aims to offer an unparalleled trading experience, fostering greater adoption of DeFi within the institutional sphere.</p>



<p>As Paradex takes flight, the industry eagerly anticipates how this hybrid derivatives exchange will shape the future of decentralized finance and redefine the landscape of crypto trading.</p>

<p>Utopia Labs has launched USDC stablecoin bank transfers for businesses in an effort to accelerate crypto payment adoption. This new offering will allow entities from almost all over the world to send <a href="https://coincu.com/203389-circles-usdc-suffers-100m-loss-as-usdt-dominates/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/203389-circles-usdc-suffers-100m-loss-as-usdt-dominates/" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDC</a> to any U.S. bank account without needing to go through centralized exchanges.  </p>



<p>Utopia said that the U.S. banking system has failed to support crypto organizations, and its solution addresses this shortfall head-on. Businesses that make, raise or send money in crypto can pay service providers, office rent, or &#8220;literally anyone who has a U.S. bank account&#8221; via USDC, according to the firm.</p>



<p>Businesses interested in using the service can apply by submitting their know-your-business (KYB) and know-your-customer (KYC) verification details to Utopia Labs, which says it can approve applications in under two business days. Once approved, businesses can start off-ramping USDC at a guaranteed 1:1 conversion rate with the U.S. dollar for a 0.3% fee. The USDC transfers are exclusive to the Ethereum blockchain with no limits and are compliant with ACH (automated clearing house) transfers, received in less than three business days, according to the firm.</p>

<p>While the service is available to most countries worldwide, companies in Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Belarus and Russia are not supported, Utopia added. Utopia&#8217;s roadmap includes providing off-ramping for any token, not just USDC, expanding to other blockchain networks, and introducing on-ramps to get fiat into crypto. Beyond crypto payments, Utopia Labs also offers treasury management for Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) users, enabling token swaps with liquidity across more than 100 decentralized exchanges through its integration with 0x Protocol.</p>



<p>Utopia Labs raised $23 million in a 2022 Series A funding round led by Paradigm, with participation from Circle Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. The firm&#8217;s roadmap includes more offerings like off-ramping for any token, expanding to other blockchain networks, and introducing on-ramps to get fiat into crypto.</p>
