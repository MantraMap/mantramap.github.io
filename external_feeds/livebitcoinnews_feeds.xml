										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Louis and Arlene Byrd are a married couple that bought a home a few years back. The trouble was that their purchase didn’t satisfy them. This led <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/husband-wife-bought-home-lemon-164228206.html">them to create</a> their own real estate company on the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a>.</p>
<h2>Louis and Arlene Byrd Establish Blockchain Real Estate Firm</h2>
<p>Known as Kataba, the company came about after the couple said their home was too “racially segregated.” They dealt with several bad contractors and other issues that caused them to sell the property at a huge loss. Louis Byrd commented in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We also ended up dealing with one of the nation’s largest mortgage servicers that violated a lot of things related to that loan product, and we’re in an ongoing litigation with that right now as we speak. We were able to sell that house in the ‘as is’ condition, meaning that we weren’t able to actually benefit from the housing.</p></blockquote>
<p>They eventually bought a separate home which they felt was solid, but within two weeks, the property had turned into a nightmare for the couple. Louis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Long story short, we ended up buying a lemon. We did everything right. We did the inspections. We toured the house. We looked at the seller’s disclosure. The seller basically said that they did all this work, and we ended up finding out two weeks in we had a major leak coming from our third floor. It turned out to be a simple repair that could have easily cost about $15, and maybe 20 minutes of time to fix, but [it] turned into a $2,500 repair.</p></blockquote>
<p>After six months, the pair had spent over $10K on repairs. This led them to believe that the real estate industry was in desperate need of change, and they had the initiative to create that change. Louis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We said there has to be a better way to do real estate with more transparency and more honesty in the process.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal of their new firm Kataba is to erase all doubts about a property’s state or condition. The company also seeks to make homebuying considerably easier. The closing process can be completed within mere minutes instead of hours. There are also larger opportunities for financing granted someone can’t pay for a home in cash.</p>
<h2>Boosting Access for All</h2>
<p>Louis said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our digital ledger, that’s probably the most important part because the goal for Kataba is for it to be doing the full experience for home buying where you can shop, buy, sell, and then upkeep. We’re launching with the upkeep aspect because since it is a marketplace, you [must] have people there for people to come and buy. So, we’re starting with existing homeowners so they can have this ledger block system where they can go in and input this data.</p></blockquote>

<li>The pair could start a major increase if there is a clear move above the $0.1420 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading above $0.1250 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XLM price must clear $0.1420 to start a fresh increase.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>This past week, Stellar lumen price saw a major rally above the $0.10 resistance against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair rallied above $0.150 before it started a downside correction.</p>
<p>It traded as high as $0.1970 before the price dipped below $0.1500. A low is formed near $0.1254 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading above $0.120 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-eyes-another-increase-above-0-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.134 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.134 zone and the trend line. The next major resistance is near the $0.1420 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1970 swing high to the $0.1254 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.1420 level might send the price toward the $0.160 level. It is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1970 swing high to the $0.1254 low.</p>
<p>Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.180 level or even $0.1950. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1250 level. The main support is near the $0.120 zone. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.1085 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.100.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is consolidating near $0.750 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-restart-rally-above-this-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price must stay above the $0.70 support to start a fresh increase.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ripple price started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-could-struggle-above-0-485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major rally</a> above the $0.50 resistance. It even rallied toward $1.00 before it saw a downside correction against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair declined below the $0.850 level.</p>
<p>There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4681 swing low to the $0.9479 high. However, the price found support near the $0.70 zone. It is now trading above $0.650 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $0.775 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair. The bulls seem to be protecting the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.4681 swing low to the $0.9479 high.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.775. The next major resistance is near the $0.780 level. A clear move above the $0.780 resistance zone might start a strong increase.</p>
<p>In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.80 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.850 resistance.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.7250 level. The next major support is near the $0.70 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.650 level, below which the price might even test the $0.580 support zone in the near term.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance – the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange in the world – has announced it’s pausing all <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/binance-shuts-down-privacy-coins-is-this-the-end-of-cryptocurrency-anonymity/ar-AA1bXmEN">trading of privacy-centered cryptocurrencies</a> indefinitely.</p>
<h2>Binance Says No More Privacy-Focused Trading</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Binance customers will no longer be able to trade or invest in a wide array of anonymous coins focused on full user privacy. The names include Decred, Secret, Verge, BEAM, Monero, Firo, and Zcash, to name a few. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/binance/">Binance</a> explained in a recent statement that the decision was made following new regulatory concerns in several European countries including France, Poland, and Italy.</p>
<p>The news comes as a shock and raises several questions, a big one being, “Is this the end of the crypto space as we know it?” While the industry is still in play and still has lots to offer, one of the big clinchers was that individuals could flock to it in the hopes they could engage in financial activity without being spied on.</p>
<p>Right now, the world of centralized finance (banks, etc.) requires that third parties, middlemen, and prying eyes constantly monitor what customers are doing. If you’re looking to open a standard checking account, for example, you cannot do so unless the offering institution agrees with the terms and circumstances surrounding your situation. It will look at your job history, financial history, and several other elements of your life to decide if providing services or products to you is “risky.”</p>
<p>If it feels you’re not a threat, you’ll get access to the account. Otherwise, you may be denied and shoved unceremoniously out the door. With crypto, assets don’t care about your past. They don’t care if you haven’t always had a high-paying job or if you’ve missed a bill payment here and there. All it cares about is if you have access to the internet. From there, you can download a wallet and begin trading or investing in certain cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>What Does This Mean for Crypto?</h2>
<p>This has been the main idea behind the crypto arena, and there have been many anonymous and privacy-focused digital assets that have come along since then as a means of taking this ideology to the next level. However, with the ceasing of trading these assets on the world’s most prominent crypto exchange, the outlook isn’t great, and one can’t help but wonder if other exchanges and similar platforms will follow suit, thus leading these assets to their doom.</p>
<p>The death of privacy and anonymity in the crypto arena will mean the death of the original ideals of crypto. While it can be said that these assets have been used to engage in illicit activity, these cases are arguably in the minority, and one must believe that most of the people who use these coins are simply doing so because they don’t want vultures breathing down their necks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, it was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-secs-case-against-ripple-could-result-in-a-massive-win-for-the-crypto-company/">announced that crypto</a> firm Ripple (XRP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) were duking it out in court.</p>
<h2>Ripple is in the Fight of Its Life</h2>
<p>The agency alleged that the company had violated securities laws by issuing XRP without going through the proper licensing and registration requirements. In contrast to other companies’ strategies, Ripple chose to fight back and agreed to go to court with the SEC, and at the time of writing, it appears Ripple may be in a winning position.</p>
<p>While it’s unclear if Ripple will come out at the end of the tunnel unscathed, the company is setting a solid example for how you handle a bully. There’s also good news in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ripple-fans-push-the-cryptocurrency-up-as-they-hope-for-a-positive-outcome-in-court-case-with-sec/ar-AA1bTztV">that the price of XRP</a> is shooting through the roof as people anticipate what will happen following the case.</p>
<p>The SEC has acted like a schoolyard bully. The agency goes around picking on and beating up all the little crypto companies out there that are allegedly weaker than it, and the SEC clearly gets off on this type of behavior. It also hasn’t limited itself to only unknown firms and has chosen to go after big names whenever the opportunity to do so arrives.</p>
<p>For example, the SEC has chosen to attack firms like Kraken and Coinbase, two of the largest (and oldest) digital currency exchanges out there. With the former, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">company was forced</a> to cease all its staking activities and services and part with a $30 million penalty fee.</p>
<p>With Coinbase, the company is not necessarily facing charges yet. However, it received a Wells notice a few months back letting executives know it would likely be <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">facing charges soon</a>, and that it should prepare. Those at the top took issue with the letter in that they allegedly made sure to meet with SEC reps many times over the past nine years to keep the company fully in compliance.</p>
<p>A schoolyard bully can only remain strong granted those around him give in to his antics. This verifies his strength in everyone’s eyes and allows him to keep acting like a jerk to everyone around him. However, the moment somebody stands up to him – as Ripple is doing now – the tides can turn.</p>
<h2>So Many Companies Caved</h2>
<p>Prior to this moment, many companies chose to <a href="https://milkroad.com/regulation/sec">settle with the</a> SEC. This ultimately gave the agency the power it has now, and it made it feel invincible. It’s clearly gone around hurting every crypto company it can since then thanks to its false sense of pride and strength, but Ripple is putting a dent in that narrative and offering the company some resistance.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is what needs to be done to give the SEC the idea that it should tone its aggression down.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> has become a huge arena over the past few years, there are several blockchain companies that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zengernews/2023/05/31/archways-new-tokenomic-incentive-model-empowers-blockchain-developers/?sh=5cb6438c4e2d">don’t seem to last that long</a>. This has not helped the industry reach mainstream status.</p>
<h2>Blockchain Companies Are too Much in Fantasy Land</h2>
<p>Will Cong – faculty director of fintech at Cornell University – says the problem lies with the tokenomics of these many blockchain companies. Many of them don’t have their priorities straight. They don’t have necessary reserves in play, and don’t have what it takes to stay afloat for long. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Platforms also can’t even write down a logical objective for their token supply and allocation policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan Edlebeck – director of ecosystem at Archway’s core contributor Phi Labs – also threw his two cents into the mix, saying these companies are not realistic about what’s required to remain in operation. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s understandable that growth for the sake of growth and getting users above all else became the most dominant early days’ metric. Things were just so new, and all this stuff is Greek to most people. Today, however, when we’re on the edge of commoditization, projects will have a much harder time selling one-dimensional value propositions that have to do purely with performance tech specs of a chain, like time to finality and such.</p></blockquote>
<p>He continued by saying that too many of the firms are also operating in the past and employ strategies that would have worked nine years ago but may not work today. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>When most chains compete equally in those areas, give or take, both users and investors will want to understand actual key differentiators in operational models. Is there an equitable financial model for all stakeholders over the long run? Does the team sustain business functions and cycles? If not, I predict an eventual extinction event for even some of the most dominant projects of Q2 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>Griffin Anderson – CEO of Phi Labs – says his firm Archway is working hard to address the many problems blockchain enterprises are facing. One of the company’s big priorities is to help redefine the blockchain landscape and reward developers that contribute to further activity. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Archway is addressing the economic incentive problem for developers by giving them a portion of network rewards, providing them a sustainable business model to build off. The community feels this issue is so important that it’s the overriding driver of virtually everything they work on.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Asking the Right Questions</h2>
<p>He concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most of the web3 community is focused only on scaling… building a faster mousetrap. We’re at a critical crossroads in blockchain where it’s prudent for any participant to look around at all the factors, consider where the lion share of upside goes in any ecosystem, and ask yourself, ‘Am I involved with a single cycle chain?’</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several strategists at JPMorgan are quite <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/31/jpmorgan-reveals-900-billion-gold-based-implied-bitcoin-price-alongside-an-ethereum-upgrade-prediction-warning/?sh=49753f002010">bullish on bitcoin even</a> though their boss – JP Dimon – hasn’t always been kind towards the asset.</p>
<h2>JPMorgan Document Suggests Gold-BTC Correlation</h2>
<p>In the past, Dimon has said some <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/jamie-dimon-is-clearly-not-a-btc-fan/">rather disparaging things</a> about the world’s leading crypto asset. However, this hasn’t stopped JPMorgan from cashing in on the digital currency and publishing regular reports about its price upheavals and volatility. In a recent document, the strategists made the claim that bitcoin will strengthen its ties to gold.</p>
<p>They also believe that the latter is going to surge beyond the $2K mark, and this will lead to BTC reaching $45,000. They stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the gold price rising above $2,000, the value of gold held for investment purposes outside central banks is currently valued at around [$3 trillion]. In turn, this implies a $45,000 price for bitcoin under the assumption that bitcoin equalizes gold in private investors&#8217; portfolios in risk capital or [volume]-adjusted terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>They were also quick to discuss the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-next-btc-halving-is-a-year-away-whats-going-to-happen/">upcoming halving</a>, which is set to occur in April of next year. Halvings have constantly been good for bitcoin in that the asset becomes rarer following such an event. Block rewards are literally cut in half for miners who solve equations that ultimately add BTC units onto the blockchain and place them in circulation.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan strategists were quick to say that this upcoming halving will present similar circumstances for bitcoin, and that the asset could potentially jump much higher. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is because bitcoin&#8217;s production cost has historically acted as an effective lower bound. Indeed, the previous halving events of 2016 and 2020 were accompanied by a bullish trajectory for bitcoin prices that had accelerated post the halving event.</p></blockquote>
<p>In contrast to bitcoin’s incoming success, the strategists mentioned that they foresaw Ethereum facing horrible selling pressure over the next few months thanks to April’s Shanghai upgrade. This, they think, will lead to short-term price losses for the world’s second largest digital currency. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We thus expect Ethereum to somewhat underperform bitcoin over the near term.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Lot of Things in Play</h2>
<p>Matteo Greco – research analyst at crypto investment firm Fineqia International – believes there are several macroeconomic circumstances in play that could greatly affect the crypto arena in the coming months. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The past few days have shown strong volatility as bitcoin dropped to the lowest trading price of about $25,800 on Wednesday [last week] due to investors&#8217; fear concerning the U.S. reaching the debt ceiling. The increase of the debt ceiling means that the U.S. government is expected to issue between $800 billion and $1 trillion in the next six months. This means that, in the mid-term, money is removed from more risky assets to buy government bonds. The consequence could be an additional slowdown in volumes and liquidity.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin experienced its first monthly loss of 2023 in <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-is-on-track-for-its-first-monthly-drop-of-the-year-stalling-2023s-huge-rally-as-macro-uncertainty-builds/ar-AA1bWK4e">May following</a> several solid months of growth due to macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Had Its Worst Month of 2023 in May</h2>
<p>The world’s leading digital currency by market capitalization was about two percent lower at the end of May given that many central banks were continuing to support stronger rate hikes as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/inflation/">inflation</a> has still not died down in leading countries such as the United States or the United Kingdom. Thus far, the Fed has hiked borrowing costs about ten consecutive times since March of last year.</p>
<p>Sadly, the patterns are not expected to stop, and many believe 2023 will be a year of continued, steady rate hikes. Birgham Santos – COO of blockchain financial services provider Lama – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>When there is fear sentiment in the market, investors tend to flock to safer assets, such as gold and government bonds. This can lead to a sell-off in riskier assets, including bitcoin. In addition, central bank tightening can also lead to a decline in bitcoin prices. This could work as a domino effect by generating higher interest rates, which can make it harder to borrow money to invest back [into] bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>The interesting thing is that bitcoin appears to be unique at the time of this writing… Unique in that it’s one of the only main cryptocurrencies out there affected by the news of the allegedly incoming (and continued) rate hikes. While altcoins like Solana have also taken dives, Ethereum, by contrast, ended May at about two percent higher than where it was during the previous month, thus showing inflation worries aren’t being felt across the board.</p>
<p>Ben Caselin – vice president and chief strategy officer at crypto exchange Mask EX – mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s no doubt that bitcoin&#8217;s price, as well as wider crypto market movements, are directly impacted by the US Federal Reserve and central bank policies. It is, after all, in response to central banking that bitcoin was created in the first place.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Still Up from 2022</h2>
<p>While the news regarding bitcoin may not be the best, things are still looking up for the currency given it’s about 65 percent higher than where it stood at the end of 2022. Santos continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whilst there are multiple external factors that can stall the crypto market, such as regulation, monetary policies, and geopolitical events creating uncertainty and fear in the behavior of institutional investors, there is also a massive adoption in the market. This means more users, more use cases, more innovation, and more value creation… Mid and long-term signals are looking good as mass adoption is increasing, and this is what ultimately defines the price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin is presently trading in the high $27K range, and it’s believed the asset will gain traction during the coming months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ashley Crossland is a man who made his bones working as a graphic designer, but while it’s been a solid career, the money he’s made in this field is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/cryptocurrency-digital-artist-nets-hundreds-075352492.html">nothing compared to the</a> big bucks he’s rung in developing non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<h2>NFTs Are Bigger Than Ever</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/nfts/">NFTs</a> are a new breed of digital currency. While they cannot be used as methods of payment, they are getting big in that the space is growing like crazy, and you now have people putting their NFTs up as collateral should they ever wish to take out crypto or stable asset loans. The lender observes their tokens to see if their value is substantial. If they feel the worth is there, the money is issued.</p>
<p>Not long ago, some of the NFTs developed by Crossland sold for more than 500,000 pounds in his native Wales. He has thus far produced over 7,000 unique art-based tokens. He stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>I never thought it would be this successful. As I&#8217;ve always liked art and technology, I was drawn to the NFT space because it creates the possibility of digital collectability, something that wasn&#8217;t as easy before. I started posting sketches of humanoid deer in communities online, and before I knew it, the project had gathered a lot of interest and quickly became a massive success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Crossland is just one of many artists that have found their niche in the digital currency market developing NFTs. Carol Breen – an artist and lecturer in graphic communication design at Cardiff Metropolitan University – has also stepped into NFT territory, though she says many of her constituents don’t believe in the arena the way she does. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Really, all it is, is a way of managing ownership in a digital space. I think it gained popularity because a lot of people thought there was a lot of potential to sell art in [a] way that was more democratic, so that it would become available to people who don&#8217;t have the platform of a gallery. You can assign a piece of digital certification to a piece of art that&#8217;s online. That, in some ways, is good for an artist because you can copyright it as well. I&#8217;m sure a lot of artists have found new audiences through NFTs, and a lot of artists that I admire have played around with NFTs, but then a lot of artists that I admire are quite skeptical of them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Giving the Tokens Their Stories</h2>
<p>She continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some have said this is just another way that big conglomerates can entice people onto these new types of art markets. [Actually], they are quite closed off to everyday people or everyday artists.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jameel Sandham is not a designer, but he’s now working as a writer for a new NFT series and creating the backstories of the featured characters.</p>
