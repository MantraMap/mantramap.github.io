<p>Jetshare is one of the most exciting cryptocurrency projects on the blockchain today. With the fractional NFT concept fast becoming a craze for cryptocurrency lovers, there has been a high demand for the project in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are still doubts about how big the Jetshare token can grow in the coming years. In this article, we take a look at Jetshare&rsquo;s price prediction for the next two years. This price prediction is based on current market movement and the strengths of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Market Opportunities Available</p>
<p>With the average rate for private Jet hires sitting at between $1,300 and $3,000 hourly, one would expect that very few people will have an interest in using these flights.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, contrary to that, research shows that private Jet rentals have soared in numbers over the past years. Partly because of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and also for the ultimate desire for privacy, most people are now turning towards private Jets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most would think these people are either celebrities, millionaires, billionaires, or successful businessmen, however groups of private individuals are more likely to pull funds together to travel across the globe in comfort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the industry moves to a more sustainable future with the advent of electrical systems and hybrid-electric propulsion over the coming years, one can only expect the demand for private Jets to go in an upward trajectory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will in turn increase the demand for Jetshare&rsquo;s native token JETT$. In the end, the underlying Jets for the project will see real-life usage, while the tokens themselves will also appreciate in price as holders use the token to book Jet charters, pay at private terminals and access international aviation events.</p>
<p>Actual Price Predictions</p>
<p>The big question again remains: How high can the price of JETT$ get? It is expected that when the Jetshare project officially launches after its pre-sales, the price of the token will take off at around 0.08USD landing somewhere close to $5 by year end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this value is expected as the token gets listed on other exchanges over the coming months and receives more attention from the general investing public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the subsequent months, as the project adds more Jets to its fleet and announces partnerships with airports, charter businesses and flying schools around the globe, it is expected that more investors will get interested in the project and increase the buying pressure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is expected to cause some positive price action in the market. Based on this intel, Jetshare should see a price increase of between 300% to 350% within 18 months.</p>
<p>By the end of 2024, the price of the token is likely to be on its way to the moon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The best way to make money from cryptocurrency is to invest in projects that have real value and are backed with assets. In today&rsquo;s crypto market, what's better than a token that allows you to fly where you want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the price prediction in this post, you can already see where this project is headed in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
