					<description><![CDATA[According to court filings, cryptocurrency exchange, Bittrex, has been accused by Florida&#8217;s financial regulator of violating several laws within the state. These violations allegedly occurred prior to Bittrex Inc. filing for Chapter 11 in May. Related Reading: Solana Registers 20% Rise In Past Week, But Can SOL Keep This Up? Bittrex had made a request for an Automatic Stay, which would impede certain creditors from pursuing or continuing legal actions against a bankrupt estate. In response, Brandon Greenberg, Assistant General Counsel to the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR), filed a statement opposing the request. The purpose of Greenberg&#8217;s filing is to challenge the implementation of the Automatic Stay. This would allow creditors to proceed with their actions against Bittrex Inc. as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. Greenberg highlighted in his statement that the financial regulator, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (OFR), had already provided guidance and advice to Bittrex, regarding potential avenues for resolving the charges brought against them. Accusations Against Bittrex: What Led To The Regulatory Uproar? Bittrex Inc. faces several accusations which included the failure to separate customer assets from the company&#8217;s own capital. Not only that, the exchange, was also accused of inconsistent maintenance of an adequate surety bond. According to the filing, from October 2022 to March 2023, the OFR collaborated with financial regulators in Texas, Maryland, and Michigan to conduct a &#8220;multistate examination&#8221; of Bittrex Inc. This suggests that the regulators from multiple states worked together to assess and investigate the operations of Bittrex Inc. during that period before coming to their present conclusion. After conducting its investigation, the OFR filed a three-count complaint against the exchange platform on April 17, as stated by Greenberg in the filing on Wednesday. On the same day, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused the company of violating federal laws by operating as a securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The OFR previously advised the company to engage in administrative procedures. It was suggested in order to help Bittrex to pursue a more substantive discussion and potentially explore options for a settlement. In his filing, Greenberg asserted that the Florida Office of Financial Regulation holds the authority to exercise administrative discretion. It can determine which violations to charge in their Administrative Complaint against the platform. Bittrex Ceased Operations Amidst &#8220;Uncertain Regulatory and Economic Environment&#8221; On March 31, Bittrex Inc. made an announcement stating its intention to wind down its operations in the United States. It cited concerns over the uncertain regulatory and economic environment. According to Greenberg, the company expressed disappointment with the enforcement action taken by the OFR back in April as they had hoped to surrender their license and exit Florida without such action. At that time, Bittrex Inc. did not disclose any plans to file for bankruptcy. However, on April 30, the company surrendered its money transmitter license.

					<description><![CDATA[What is arbitrage? Arbitrage, in its simplest form, is the process of buying a stock on one market and selling it on another to take advantage of price listing differences across various markets. For example, a car manufacturer is priced at $45 on the NYSE but is trading at $45.30 on the SSE. A trader purchases these shares on the NYSE and sells them on the SSE to make a 30-cent profit on each share. This is a basic example of arbitrage trading. What is arbitrage trading in crypto? Arbitrage crypto trading works in a similar way to conventional stock market arbitrage trading. In the same way arbitrage traders seek to make gains by buying and selling across markets, crypto arbitrage traders look to profit from the varying list prices on different exchanges. For example, an investor buys 100 Solana coins on the Coinbase crypto exchange at $14 per coin and sells them on the eToro exchange for $14.10 — meaning the investor made 10 cents profit per share by trading them on a new platform. Types of crypto arbitrage The only significant difference between crypto arbitrage trading and stock market arbitration is that there&#8217;s more than one way to do it. Some of the common types of crypto arbitrage trading include: Spatial arbitrage — Also known as geographical arbitrage, spatial arbitrage is when an investor simply buys cryptocurrency on one exchange, sells in another, and collects the profit. Investors can trade crypto between centralized exchanges (CEXs) or Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and take advantage of an exchange&#8217;s technical inefficiencies — like pricing delays — and listing differences to profit. Spatial arbitrage without transferring — The most common and simple form of arbitrage trading. An investor takes a long position on a cryptocurrency on one exchange and a short position with the same cryptocurrency on another exchange. This means investors can hedge against substantial losses and make small profits on price fluctuations across different exchanges. Triangular arbitrage — The triangle aspect refers to three types of currency involved in a triangular transaction — the two coins and the fiat currency used. Triangular arbitrage works like this: The investor logs on to their crypto exchange or trading account and buys one Bitcoin on their account using their fiat currency — for example, pound sterling or US dollars. The investor transfers that Bitcoin to a different exchange or wallet and purchases 10 Ethereum using that Bitcoin. The investor then sells their current holding of Ethereum — for a higher price than the cost of the original Bitcoin — and buys back the original Bitcoin for the starting price to complete the triangle. Although profitable when done correctly, these opportunities rarely arise, and this isn’t a method commonly used by traders. How to find crypto arbitrage opportunities It&#8217;s all well and good knowing how to put an arbitrage trading plan into action. However, prospective arbitrageurs must know how to spot these opportunities to act on them. To spot a lucrative crypto arbitrage opportunity, investors must: Browse the market for price changes — Whether manually or using a tracking tool to do the heavy lifting, comparing the prices of cryptocurrencies on a range of platforms is essential to know where to buy and sell. Specialist software can help investors scrape this data from various exchanges to highlight potential opportunities. Use trading pairs — Trading helps gauge the comparative value of two cryptocurrencies or between a coin and a fiat currency. For example, an exchange might show that one Bitcoin token is worth X amount of Ethereum on the interface and vice versa. This value can be used to calculate how much a coin is worth when you trade, making it easier to identify if the exchange rate works in your favor. Keep up-to-date with currency exchange rates — Another crucial aspect of arbitraging crypto is tracking the exchange rates of fiat currencies. For investors buying and selling cryptocurrencies across global CEXs and DEXs, understanding how the fiat currencies have moved can affect how much profit they&#8217;ll make when all the assets are sold. Advantages of crypto arbitrage Despite being an uncommon tactic, there are many potential advantages to arbitraging cryptocurrencies. The main advantages of cryptocurrency arbitrage trading include: Low risk — Because crypto arbitrage trading often involves buying and selling simultaneously or on different markets, traders hedge their losses with a counter investment, meaning there is minimal risk for the trade. Potential for quick returns — Arbitrage trading has a quick turnaround — once investors spot an opportunity, they jump at it. The nature of rapid arbitrage trading and currency conversions at a desirable rate means that profits can be realized in a matter of minutes. Industry Volatility — Volatility is usually not associated with positive financial investing, however, it&#8217;s a vital part of arbitrage. Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Because the supply and demand of a coin are largely based on speculation, markets are constantly moving — exposing daily pricing errors and inefficiencies across many crypto exchanges daily. It&#8217;s these inefficiencies that open the door for traders to profit. Works during bull and bear markets — Whether the market is rising or falling, the number of arbitrage opportunities remains the same. Although bull markets are more desirable, traders can hold both long and short positions and make money whether the markets bull or bear. Disadvantages of crypto arbitrage All investment strategies come with a level of risk – cryptocurrency arbitrage is no different. Some of the drawbacks of crypto arbitrage include: Withdrawal limits — Some cryptocurrencies limit the amount you can withdraw at any given time. Investors must understand these limits and select exchanges that offer the cheapest withdrawal fees to maximize profit on short-term trades. Transaction Fees — All trading platforms and cryptocurrency exchanges won&#8217;t let you buy, deposit, or withdraw money or coins from a wallet without charging fees. Investors must factor these fees into account before taking arbitrage trades. Fees for buying, selling, and withdrawing coins or fiat currency can exceed the profit made by performing a successful arbitrage trade — adding extra layers of complexity for novice and experienced investors alike. Slow Transaction Times — As competition for a share of the crypto pie ramps up, so do transaction times, due to the increased volume. Because funds need to be reallocated and withdrawn quickly, these slow wait times can be the difference between an investor profiting, missing out on an opportunity, or losing out entirely. Precision Timing Needed — All trading is relatively time-sensitive, but none more than arbitrage trading. When prices across exchanges don&#8217;t match up, and an opportunity arises, investors have minutes or even seconds to react and turn a profit. Investors need to be quick to reduce the risk of the market turning against them, making it a method that&#8217;s most suitable for more experienced traders. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Which coin is the best for arbitrage? Arbitrage can be done with any crypto coin or token. However, coins with high volatility are most suitable as they open more opportunities for arbitration. Cheaper tokens and meme coins – like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Cardano – offer increased volatility and are also more accessible to investors with smaller portfolios. Can you lose money doing crypto arbitrage? Like any form of trading, if the market doesn&#8217;t fall in your favor — or you make a mistake on your inputs — you can lose money from crypto arbitrage. Unfortunately, trading has real-world consequences, so it&#8217;s critical to be informed and practice on a paper money account before committing personal capital. For more information on how to invest in crypto as a beginner and the potential pros and cons of trading, check out our helpful guide! Is crypto arbitrage legal? Crypto arbitrage trading is not only legal in the majority of countries across the world, but it&#8217;s also encouraged. It helps iron out market inefficiencies by making it easier for centralized and decentralized markets to receive a steady supply of coins to fulfill demand without affecting the market price. How to learn crypto arbitrage? When learning any form of trading, it&#8217;s important to learn from the best and practice the strategy in a safe environment. Most exchanges offer investors the option to set up a paper account. A paper account lets novice investors set up and try different investment strategies — including crypto arbitrage trading – without the risks associated with committing capital straight away.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Many traders and technicians closely follow the well-known &#8220;Golden Cross&#8221; moving average crossover in key liquid markets such as Bitcoin, Gold, and the Nasdaq 100 Index among others. Today, however, we&#8217;ll examine an under-the-radar Bitcoin moving average crossover which looks imminent. Using Bitcoin&#8217;s reliable data from 2011 through today, let&#8217;s find out if this lesser known moving average crossover looks bullish or bearish going forward. This Lesser Known Moving Average Crossover May Soon Hit While the Golden Cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average crosses above the 200-day simple moving average, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50-day simple moving average (50MA) currently looks poised to cross above its 100-day simple moving average (100MA) within days. Earlier this year, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50MA crossed above its 100MA as the number one crypto by market cap surged in January off of its post-FTX collapse low. Further Bitcoin gains followed from this most recent crossover.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many traders and technicians closely follow the well-known &#8220;Golden Cross&#8221; moving average crossover in key liquid markets such as Bitcoin, Gold, and the Nasdaq 100 Index among others. Today, however, we&#8217;ll examine an under-the-radar Bitcoin moving average crossover which looks imminent. Using Bitcoin&#8217;s reliable data from 2011 through today, let&#8217;s find out if this lesser known moving average crossover looks bullish or bearish going forward.</p>
<h2>This Lesser Known Moving Average Crossover May Soon Hit</h2>
<p>While the Golden Cross occurs when the 50-day simple moving average crosses above the 200-day simple moving average, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50-day simple moving average (50MA) currently looks poised to cross above its 100-day simple moving average (100MA) within days. Earlier this year, Bitcoin&#8217;s 50MA crossed above its 100MA as the number one crypto by market cap surged in January off of its post-FTX collapse low. Further Bitcoin gains followed from this most recent crossover.</p>

<p>Now that Bitcoin has extended its year-to-date gains in recent sessions, its 50MA looks poised to cross back above its 100MA once again. Beyond the signal earlier this year, what&#8217;s happened in the past when Bitcoin&#8217;s 50MA has crossed above its 100MA?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin exchange supply has only continued to decline despite the recent rally that the asset has observed. Bitcoin Exchange Supply Continues To Register Net Decline According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, exchanges have continued to see withdrawals recently. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;exchange balance,&#8221; which measures the total amount of Bitcoin that&#8217;s currently sitting in the wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that the investors are depositing a net number of coins to these platforms currently. As one of the main reasons why holders may transfer their BTC to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, this kind of trend can have short-term bearish consequences for the price. On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator imply a net amount of the supply is leaving from the exchanges. Such a trend, when prolonged, can be a sign that the investors are accumulating at the moment. Naturally, this could be constructive for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange balance over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have been going downhill in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin exchange balance had been in an overall uptrend during 2018 and 2019, but with the COVID crash in March 2020, a shift happened in the market and the indicator started moving in a downward trajectory. There was a break in this trend during the 2021 bull run, as the metric mostly moved sideways, with some increases coming near the top of the rallies. This deviation in the trend was possibly a result of investors depositing to take advantage of the profit-taking opportunity. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? With the end of the bull market and the transition toward a bearish period, though, the indicator resumed its decline. Events like the 3AC Collapse and the FTX Crash saw the exchange balance dropping especially hard, as these platforms going down made investors more wary of keeping their coins in centralized custody. With the start of the Bitcoin rally this year, however, the metric once again started moving sideways as demand for selling returned. In the leadup to the local top in April, exchanges were receiving net deposits as their supply outright registered an increase. Interestingly, while investors were looking to sell during the price surge back then, the latest uplift in the price above the $30,000 level has actually seen the exchange balance only decline further. This trend of net withdrawals can be a sign that there isn&#8217;t much appetite for selling in the market currently, at least when compared to the demand for taking coins to self-custody.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana has observed an increase of more than 20% in the past week. Here&#8217;s what on-chain data says regarding whether this is sustainable or not. Solana Trading Volume Has Remained Low Despite Price Rise In its latest insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has looked at the underlying metrics of Solana to see what has been driving the latest increase in the price. The firm has looked at the &#8220;social volume&#8221; of the cryptocurrency for various social media platforms and has found that the asset has seen elevated interest on Reddit recently. Here, the social volume refers to a metric that measures the total number of unique posts or threads on a given social media platform that is making at least one mention of SOL. This metric can tell us about the degree of discussion that the coin is currently receiving on the website in question. Now, below is a chart that shows the trend in the Solana social volume on four major social media platforms: Telegram, Reddit, Twitter, and 4chan. Looks like the value of the metric has been relatively low for most of these platforms &#124; Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, the Solana social volume on Reddit has seen some spikes as the cryptocurrency has risen during the past week or so. The other platforms, however, haven&#8217;t observed that much discussion related to the asset. Related Reading: Blame The “Supermoon” If Bitcoin Crashes Or Rallies Towards $35,000 In July A notable spike in the social volume on Reddit also occurred before the coin&#8217;s 5% surge during the past 24 hours. This may imply that interest from users on the platform could partly be helping fuel the rise. In terms of the actual trading volume, though, SOL has continued to observe muted activity, despite the growth. Here is a chart that displays the trend in this indicator: The value of the metric hasn't been too high recently &#124; Source: Santiment Interestingly, the initial, strong rise that Solana enjoyed was accompanied by elevated volumes, but at the start of this month, the indicator&#8217;s value noted some decline. Since this drop in volume, SOL has mostly moved sideways. Generally, for any price rise to be sustainable, high trading volumes are required. This is due to the fact that participation from a large number of traders is needed to provide enough fuel for any such price move to go on.

Despite the sharp growth that Solana has observed today, the trading volume remaining at low values would suggest that the wider market isn&#8217;t finding the rally interesting enough to make moves on the network. Naturally, if the rally has to go on for an extended period, volumes may have to return to the market. There is also the fact that the SOL funding rates (a measure of the periodic fee that futures traders are exchanging between each other) on Binance and DyDx have become quite positive recently. Longs are dominating the market &#124; Source: Santiment From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the earlier increase in the asset&#8217;s price may have been helped by shorts being liquidated in the market &#8211; as the funding rates had been highly negative then. As long contract holders are the majority force in the futures market now, the chances of a long squeeze taking place are higher now. In this case, if one does take place, the price would feel a bearish effect. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $20, up 20% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is captivating the attention of the crypto community with its ongoing price surge. The recent inclusion of BCH on EDX, a Citadel Securities-backed crypto exchange, has sparked fresh interest in this digital asset.  As investors eagerly monitor its progress, the price of BCH on CoinGecko stands at $291.80, showcasing a 24-hour rally of nearly 7% and an impressive seven-day surge of 27.5%. Source: Coingecko The overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market has contributed to the positive trajectory of BCH. As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream acceptance and adoption, investors are seeking alternatives beyond the traditional giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and BCH has emerged as a viable contender. However, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is whether Bitcoin Cash can sustain its current bullish streak. BCH Whales Pause Buying Spree Amidst Price Surge While the recent listing on EDX has undoubtedly played a part in this rally, on-chain data reveals an intriguing aspect of the price surge. A cluster of Bitcoin Cash whales holding significant amounts of 1 million to 10 million coins has emerged as a pivotal player in driving last month’s rally. Source: Santiment Between June 21 and June 30, these BCH whales accumulated 170,000 coins, which amounted to approximately $52.4 million in value. Their substantial purchases had a significant impact on the asset&#8217;s price, as whales possess substantial financial power and strategic influence on other investors. When whales buy more coins, it often leads to an increase in the asset&#8217;s price.

The same cluster of BCH whales, who were actively accumulating coins during the June rally, has conspicuously paused their buying spree.

Chart: TradingView.com The Future Trajectory Of Bitcoin Cash The whales&#8217; decision to halt their buying activity raises questions about the current market sentiment surrounding Bitcoin Cash.

As the market eagerly watches Bitcoin Cash, the question arises as to whether the recent price surge can be sustained without the continued support of these influential whales. The coming weeks will shed light on the market&#8217;s overall sentiment and the role these whales will play in shaping the future trajectory of Bitcoin Cash.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) recently faced a major token dump of epic proportions, with a whopping 800 billion SHIB tokens being thrown into the market. But what caused this massive sell-off and what does it mean for the future of Shiba Inu? This major token offloading extravaganza went down on Binance alone, with traders ditching their SHIB for USDT. The Buying Selling View indicator revealed that this frenzy took place from 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. UTC. To understand the degree of the situation, let&#8217;s delve into the factors behind this recent market movement and explore the potential consequences for both short-term traders and long-term SHIB investors. What SHIB Offloading Means For Short-Term Traders When a massive token offloading event like the recent SHIB dump occurs, it creates a ripple effect that can have significant implications, especially for short-term sellers aiming for quick gains.  Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor Token dumps often result in increased market volatility, causing sudden price drops and erratic fluctuations. For short-term traders, this can be both a bane and boon. On one hand, volatility presents opportunities for quick profits if they time their trades well. On the other hand, it also raises the risk of unexpected losses if the market turns against their positions. Source: TradingView Massive offloading events tend to put downward pressure on the token&#8217;s price. The increased supply flooding the market can lead to price depreciation, which may discourage short-term traders from entering or maintaining their positions.

<p>LucieSHIB, a marketing specialist for Shiba Inu, recently took to Twitter and expressed optimism by stating that it&#8217;s time for Bone&#8217;s price to target the <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1675753955551326208" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$2 to $3 range</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network has begun the process of swapping altcoins for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). The recent court approval (June 30) granted the company permission to convert its altcoin holdings into the two leading digital assets, raising concerns about a potential sell-off of popular altcoins. Celsius Network, known for its altcoin lending services, has been undergoing bankruptcy proceedings since July 2022 when it filed for Chapter 11 protection, revealing liabilities of up to $10 billion. The recent court ruling allows Celsius to convert its altcoins into BTC and ETH starting from July 1. LINK, AAVE And SNX Sell-Off Due To Celsius Coming? According to on-chain analysis provider Lookonchain, Celsius has been actively transferring altcoins to different wallets. Most of the altcoins have been moved to wallet address &#8220;0x4131&#8221;. Remarkably, Celsius made its first swap today. Lookonchain tweeted: Note that Celsius seems to be starting to swap altcoins for BTC and ETH. Currently: Most of the altcoins have been transferred to wallet&#8221;0x4131&#8243;. Transferred 1,393 StaFi( $rETH) to Wintermute Trading and received 1,393 $ETH.  The altcoins held by Celsius Network amount to approximately $164.5 million on the EVM chain, including: 3.16 million LINK ($19.9 million) 98,268 AAVE ($7.36 million) 2.9 million SNX ($6.2 million) 7.95 million TGBP ($5.49 million) 1,812 PAXG ($3.45 million) 12.650 BNB ($3.02 million) 3.841 million MATIC ($2.65 million) 419,899 UNI ($2.27 million) 9.25 million ZRX (2.00 million) In addition to the above, Celsius Network&#8217;s wallets also contain around $296 million worth of Bitcoin, $120 million worth of Ethereum, and approximately $100 million (in paper value) of its native token CEL. Yesterday, data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that Celsius moved around $70 million worth of altcoins and stablecoins to different wallets, including those related to crypto market maker Wintermute, crypto custodian Fireblocks, and stablecoin issuer Paxos.

LINK, AAVE and SNX could face a dump if Celsius sells these altcoins in one go, but the prices of MATIC, UNI, ZRX and BNB could also see a negative impact. It&#8217;s worth noting that while the court approval allows Celsius to convert altcoins into BTC and ETH, the exact details and timeline of the conversion process remain unclear. It is uncertain whether Celsius plans to sell all of its altcoins and in what proportion it intends to acquire BTC and ETH. Traders and investors holding the aforementioned altcoins should closely monitor market developments and prepare for possible market turbulence.

Celsius&#8217; largest altcoin holding, Chainlink, could potentially see the most selling pressure, and the timing is conceivably bad. Just two weeks ago, the LINK price managed to climb back into the 1+ year trading range between $5.31 and $9.62. Earlier in the week, the LINK price was rejected at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. A dump of Celsius could put the price in danger of falling again to the lower end of the trading range. LINK marines should therefore closely monitor the addresses by the bankrupt crypto lender. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>
