It’s not going to happen. The markets are completely wrong.”</strong></p>
<h2>Peter Schiff Says &#8216;We’re Going to Have More Inflation&#8217;</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff issued more warnings about the U.S. economy over the past week in a series of posts on the X platform and on the Peter Schiff Show. Emphasizing &#8220;how badly the Fed has screwed up monetary policy,&#8221; Schiff wrote Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not only have they gotten it wrong for 20 years, but their policies have significantly harmed the economy and made dire consequences inevitable.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that many people are wrong in thinking that the Federal Reserve can beat inflation and guide the U.S. economy to a soft landing, asserting that the central bank cannot win.</p>
<p>Referencing the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta revising its estimate for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the third quarter using the GDPnow model to 5.8% on Aug. 16, Schiff exclaimed: “5.8%, that isn’t landing at all. That’s the plane still up there in the air. You’re not landing at 5.8%. You’re not even close to the runway.”</p>
<p>He stressed: “Now, a lot of people would think if the economy is this strong, well, the Fed can’t cut. In fact, the Fed has to hike.” Schiff cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re going to have more inflation. Because you still have all these Keynesians out there who think that inflation is a byproduct of economic growth, and if we’re going to have this booming economy, well, then we’re going to have the trade-off of higher inflation.</p></blockquote>

<p>The economist continued: “As if slowing the economy is what’s going to bring down inflation. It’s not. The truth is if they really want to bring down inflation, the consequence is going to be that the economy weakens. It has to, because we have a bubble economy that is based on debt. Everybody is loaded up with debt and it’s all based on excess consumption. The American economy is about spending more than you earn. We have elevated that to an art form.”</p>
<p>Schiff, who owns Schiffgold, a precious metals dealer specializing in gold and silver bullion, proceeded to comment on the price of gold. &#8220;The only thing that’s keeping gold from exploding is this idea that the Fed is going to succeed in bringing inflation back to 2% and a soft landing.” The economist concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>The markets are confident that the Fed is going to pull this off. It’s not going to happen. The markets are completely wrong. And so gold is priced for something that is not going to happen.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Gary Gensler&#x2019;s SEC Faces Backlash for Rushed Rulemaking</h2>
<p>Congressman Frank Lucas (R-OK) has slammed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Chair Gary Gensler over the regulator&#x2019;s reckless approach to rulemaking. The official account for Financial Services GOP wrote on the X platform Monday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gary Gensler&#x2019;s SEC is pursuing a reckless, rushed rulemaking agenda with inadequate economic analysis and limited public input &#x2014; threatening to upend our capital markets. Rep. Frank Lucas is holding the SEC accountable to ensure our markets remain the envy of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the longest-serving Republican on the House Financial Services Committee, Lucas serves on the Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee as well as the Capital Markets Subcommittee.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The volume and breadth of SEC rulemaking is of significant concern to me,&#x201D; the lawmaker stressed. &#x201C;The implication of many of the proposed rules are massive and often affect the same or interconnected financial products and market sectors. The adverse consequences in one sector can bleed over into another, causing lasting economic harm.&#x201D;</p>

<p>SEC Chair Gensler has been criticized for his enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto sector. Former SEC internet enforcement chief John Reed Stark recently warned that &#x201C;the SEC&#x2019;s crypto-regulatory onslaught <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-crypto-regulatory-onslaught-will-never-end/">will never end</a> (ever).&#x201D;</p>
<p>Several lawmakers are currently probing the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) regarding the &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lawmakers-probe-sec-and-finra-over-shady-approval-of-prometheum/">shady approval</a>&#x201D; of crypto firm Prometheum. Moreover, the securities regulator is currently in a legal battle with Ripple Labs and its executives over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. Last week, the SEC filed a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-files-motion-to-certify-interlocutory-appeal-of-ripple-xrp-ruling/">motion</a> to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/judge-grants-secs-request-to-seek-interlocutory-appeal-in-ripple-case-over-xrp/">certify</a> an interlocutory appeal of the Ripple ruling regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>

The court also ordered the man to pay $2,816,433 in restitution to 11 victims of his Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) swap fraud scheme.</strong></p>
<h2>SIM Swap Fraud Scheme</h2>
<p>A United States district court has sentenced to 36 months in prison a man accused of being part of a conspiracy to defraud cryptocurrency owners. According to a press statement issued by the U.S. Attorney’s office, the man, Anthony Francis Faulk, was also ordered to pay $2,816,433 in restitution to 11 victims of the SIM swap fraud scheme.</p>
<p>As per the Aug. 18 <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/pennsylvania-resident-sentenced-three-years-prison-role-conspiracy-defraud-and-extort">press statement</a>, a U.S. federal grand jury had determined on Dec. 10, 2019, that Faulk’s conspiracy to commit wire fraud violated 18 U.S.C. § 1349. The grand jury also determined that Faulk’s interstate communications with intent to extort were in violation of f 18 U.S.C. § 875(d). However, the extortion count was dismissed by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Assets Worth Approximately $20 Million Forfeited</h2>
<p>In his written plea agreement, Faulk admitted to hatching a plan to fleece and extort cryptocurrency owners. The plan, which was executed between October 2016 and May 2018, involved tricking mobile phone operators into giving Faulk and his accomplices Matthew Ditman and Ahmad Hared control of victims’ cellphone numbers. Once they gained control of the numbers, Faulk would use this to hack and steal their victims’ digital assets.</p>
<p>After successfully draining the funds, Faulk and his colleagues allegedly proceeded to extort more money from victims by threatening to further compromise their accounts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to the three-year sentence and the restitution, the court also ordered the seizure of assets &#8220;constituting or derived from proceeds obtained by Faulk’s crime.&#8221; Some of the assets forfeited include a home in Latrobe, Pennsylvania with an estimated value of nearly $1 million. Three JPMorgan Chase accounts holding more than $18.7 million and three motor vehicles were also forfeited.</p>

The bank explained the need for a rebranding and detailed how it might revolutionize transactions with digital contracts for real estate and vehicles. Drex is expected to be launched next year.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank of Brazil Rebrands Digital Real to Drex</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil has revealed the reasons behind the rebranding of the Brazilian central bank digital currency (CBDC), formerly known as the digital real, to drex. In a <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/pressdetail/2490/nota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> issued last week, the bank reported the new name was an acronym for &#8220;Digital Real Electronic,&#8221; with the X representing &#8220;modernity and connectivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maurício Moura, Deputy Governor for Institutional Relations, Citizenship, and Conduct Supervision (Direc) at the Central Bank of Brazil, detailed the vision behind drex and how it will affect the lives of Brazilians. He <a href="https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/pressdetail/2490/nota" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drex will bring more speed, practicality, and lower cost to various contractual and financial transactions we make today.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bank explained that this rebranding served to &#8220;standardize communication regarding the Brazilian CBDC by centralizing all communications on a single name,&#8221; avoiding using terms that are challenging to understand for most of the population.</p>

<h2>Drex in Transactions and Possible Launch</h2>
<p>Moura also referred to how drex will help citizens avoid the pitfalls of completing car or real estate transactions, as each party can be doubtful about making the first move. Moura hinted at integrating drex with state services that would allow the automation of these tasks with smart contracts.</p>
<p>On this possibility, he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to Drex&#8217;s programmability, it doesn&#8217;t matter who makes the first move. Only when both conditions happen does Drex conclude the contract by simultaneously transferring money and ownership.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drex is already in its test pilot stages, with the central bank having selected 16 different entities to be part of this test, to design applications that could be part of the final system. According to the state-owned Brazilian news agency Agencia Brasil, the digital real should be <a href="https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/economia/noticia/2023-08/brazils-central-bank-introduce-virtual-currency-2024#:~:text=The%20%22D%22%20signifies%20%22digital,simplify%20the%20lives%20of%20Brazilians." target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> to the Brazilian population at the end of 2024.</p>
<p>In December, Central Bank of Brazil President Roberto Campos Neto <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-could-launch-its-defi-integrated-digital-real-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that drex, called the digital real at the time, could be launched at the end of 2024, explaining that there were many challenges in reaching that schedule.</p>

In that timeframe, the digital currency <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s value has slumped by a significant 39.43%.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Despite SEC&#x2019;s Interlocutory Appeal and 39% Downturn, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Enthusiasts Hold out for a Rebound</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Recent statistics paint a tumultuous picture for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>. Over the past week alone, its price dipped by 18.5%, and a monthly overview reveals a 32% slide against the U.S. dollar. But rewind to July 12, 2023, and the scenario was different &#x2013; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> was trading at $0.47 per coin. However, after judge Analisa Torres&#x2019; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">judgment</a> the very next day, its value soared to a notable $0.819 per coin.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
July 14 saw an even greater spike with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> reaching a 2023 peak of $0.8437. But since that pinnacle, its descent has been swift, culminating in a 39.43% drop since July 14. Much of this drop is attributable to the past week&#x2019;s performance, and just in the last 24 hours as of August 22, it&#x2019;s taken a 1.5% hit against the greenback.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Yet, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s trading footprint remains significant. Over the last day, it recorded an impressive global trade volume of over $1 billion, ranking sixth in daily volume. Moreover, its market capitalization of $27.07 billion cements its position as the fifth largest on August 22. The weekly downturn coincides with the SEC&#x2019;s decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-files-motion-to-certify-interlocutory-appeal-of-ripple-xrp-ruling/">appeal two rulings</a> in the Ripple case.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite this, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> loyalists, notably the &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Army,&#x201D; remain optimistic about its future. Crypto influencer Egrag Crypto, boasting a 33,900-strong following, recently discussed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, claiming has an unparalleled legal and regulatory foundation.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;For those content with a runner-up digital asset, perhaps exploring alternative coins is a prudent choice,&#x201D; Egrag <a href="https://twitter.com/egragcrypto/status/1693892426295804285?s=20">stated</a>. &#x201C;As for me, I view <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, coupled with its technological prowess and regulatory clarity, as my foremost wager.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Egrag warns against drawing parallels between <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s journey and other cryptocurrencies, arguing that doing so overlooks <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s intrinsic value. He alludes that skeptics might be overlooking a potential surge for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, reminiscent of the 2017 rally.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Another <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> advocate suggests patience, <a href="https://twitter.com/jokohakan/status/1693900408492789983?s=20">stating</a>, &#x201C;Looking at the weekly chart, we&#x2019;re still in the early stages after a big bearish downturn,&#x201D; observes &#x200B;&#x200B;Treasure Knight. &#x201C;We&#x2019;ll need to wait a couple of weeks, possibly for a few small candles with reversal patterns, to see any potential bullish movement toward $0.82.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

Titan Global is also accused of violating the marketing rule when it advertised hypothetical performance metrics without taking the required steps. </strong></p>
<h2>Improper Use of Hedge Clauses</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Aug. 21 that it had charged a New York-based fintech investment adviser, Titan Global Capital Management, for publishing misleading information regarding its crypto investment product. In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-153?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">statement</a>, the securities regulator revealed that Titan Global has also been charged &#8220;with multiple compliance failures&#8221; which culminated in the release of &#8220;misleading disclosures about custody of clients’ crypto assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to the SEC, the same compliance failures are also believed to have led to the use of improper &#8220;hedge clauses&#8221; in client agreements. They also resulted in the illegal use of client signatures and &#8220;the failure to adopt policies concerning crypto asset trading by employees.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in its order, the U.S. securities regulator highlighted its concerns with the investment adviser’s misleading advertisements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The order alleges that Titan’s advertisements were misleading because they failed to include material information, for example, that the hypothetical performance projections assumed that the strategy’s performance in its first three weeks would continue for an entire year,&#8221; the SEC said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<h2>A Warning to Investment Advisers</h2>
<p>In addition, Titan Global is also accused of violating the marketing rule by advertising hypothetical performance metrics without taking the required steps. The SEC said the fintech adviser’s alleged violations were committed between Aug. 2021 and October 2022.</p>
<p>Commenting on the SEC’s decision against the fintech investment adviser, Osman Nawaz, the Chief of Enforcement’s Complex Financial Instruments Unit, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Titan’s advertisements and disclosures painted a misleading picture of certain of its strategies for investors. This action serves as a warning for all advisers to ensure compliance.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Commission also revealed that Titan Global had cooperated with the investigation and consented to the entry of an SEC order. Titan Global subsequently agreed to a cease-and-desist order, a disgorgement fee of $192,454, and a civil penalty of $850,000 which will be distributed to affected clients.</p>

According to the Kenyan House speaker, the 15-member committee is expected to report back to parliament within 42 days. A Kenyan court judge recently issued a ruling which called for the preservation of all data collected by Worldcoin between April 2022 and August 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Parliament Joins Movement Against Worldcoin</h2>
<p>The Kenyan parliament has established a 15-member ad-hoc joint committee tasked with investigating Worldcoin. According to Kenya’s speaker of parliament, the committee, which is chaired by the Narok West legislator Gabriel Tongoyo, is expected to report back in 42 days.</p>
<p>The announcement of the creation of the committee came just a few weeks after the Kenyan government suspended Worldcoin activities in the country. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the suspension is expected to give authorities an opportunity to assess the crypto project’s potential risk to public safety. Shortly after the suspension announcement was made, Kenyan law enforcement reportedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-kenyan-police-raid-worldcoins-offices-just-days-after-govt-suspended-the-crypto-project/">raided</a> Worldcoin offices and seized devices used to store data.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, before Kenyan authorities descended on Worldcoin, the country’s ICT ministry secretary Eliud Owalo initially seemed to back the crypto project. This stance appeared to be at odds with the Kenyan Data Commissioner’s position on the matter. However, after the raid, Owalo claimed that Tools for Humanity — the primary organization behind Worldcoin — had not adhered to the requirements of its registration license.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Kenyan Court&#8217;s Data Preservation Order</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/realtime/2023-08-21-parliament-forms-committee-to-investigate-worldcoin-project/">report</a> in The Star, the Kenyan government’s seemingly conflicting views on Worldcoin activities have prompted the parliament to summon Owalo and his counterpart at the Interior Ministry, Kindiki Kithure.</p>
<p>&#8220;In view of the foregoing, the two cabinet secretaries that were scheduled to appear tomorrow before this House, will instead appear before the committee to provide information on the matter,&#8221; said Kenyan House speaker Moses Wetangula.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the report revealed that a Kenyan court judge recently issued a ruling which called for the preservation of all data collected by Worldcoin between April 2022 and August 2023.</p>

In its upcoming summit that will take place in Johannesburg, the bloc will discuss the conditions of adding nations like Saudi Arabia and UAE to its lineup of members.</strong></p>
<h2>China Could Leverage Expanded BRICS to Fight G7 Influence</h2>
<p>China could be interested in extending the number of countries in the BRICS bloc, integrated by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, to grow its influence and pit the new group as a geopolitical adversary of the Group of the Seven (G7). Several countries have already applied to be an official part of the bloc, which will discuss new admissions for the first time after including South Africa in 2010.</p>
<p>An unidentified Chinese official quoted by Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/40f7cd4d-66f2-4e4d-876d-a0c7aa7097e1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we expand BRICS to account for a similar portion of world GDP as the G7, then our collective voice in the world will grow stronger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Economic powerhouses like Saudi Arabia and UAE have been in conversation with BRICS to be part of, or to streamline, trade relationships with countries of the bloc. Countries with high GDPs joining the group would bring the reported Chinese intentions closer to the goal. Other countries that have expressed clear anti-U.S. sentiment, like Iran and Venezuela, are also applying to be part of the group.</p>

<h2>Opposition to China</h2>
<p>Last week, several experts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-is-no-joke-bloc-could-become-g7-counterpart-experts-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acknowledged</a> the strength of the BRICS bloc. Anthony Rowley, a South China Morning Post journalist, declared that &#8220;no one can dismiss lightheartedly now their challenge to the established economic order.&#8221; Hung Tran, a non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, also explained that BRICS could &#8220;evolve to become a counterpart to the Group of Seven (G7) in world affairs, resulting in a profound impact on international relations,&#8221; predicting China&#8217;s intentions.</p>
<p>However, China&#8217;s ambition is likely to find an opposing force in India, as the latter is more inclined to position the group as a non-aligned club for the economic interests of developing countries, according to people briefed on the positions of both countries.</p>
<p>South Africa is likely to also oppose China&#8217;s intentions. South Africa&#8217;s Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/brics-expansion-isn-t-aimed-at-countering-the-west-south-african-official-says#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> on August 7 that South Africa didn&#8217;t see the BRICS bloc as &#8220;being pro-Russia or anti-Western.&#8221; Furthermore, Pandor stated that he thought classifying the group like that would be &#8220;extremely wrong.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Billion-Dollar Mysteries: The Cryptic Evolution of Bitcoin&#x2019;s Third-Largest Wallet</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The mysterious bitcoin wallet has <a href="https://twitter.com/epodrulz/status/1693820423866118293?s=20">garnered attention</a> as it rose to the third largest in a span of 98 days. The wallet, identified as &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1ql49ydapnjafl5t2cp9zqpjwe6pdgmxy98859v2">bc1ql</a>,&#x201D; currently holds 118,300.20 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> as of August 22, 2023, amounting to approximately $3.07 billion based on current exchange rates. Notably, this third-largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> wallet has been shrouded in mystery for an extended duration, even amid changes to its address over recent years. For example, in November 2021, the &#x201C;<a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1P5ZEDWTKTFGxQjZphgWPQUpe554WKDfHQ">1P5ZE</a>&#x201D; address held the third position.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Much <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1517161712432123904?s=20&t=uuSVZM26ntACf-8ebW9j3w">speculation</a> surrounded this wallet; at one point it was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rumors-claim-large-bitcoin-wallet-is-a-whales-stash-or-microstrategys-wallet-despite-conflicting-data/">erroneously attributed</a> to Microstrategy&#x2019;s bitcoin holdings. However, after 1P5ZE&#x2019;s balance decreased to zero, another wallet &#x2014; &#x201C;<a href="https://oxt.me/address/1LQoWist8KkaUXSPKZHNvEyfrEkPHzSsCd">1LQoW</a>&#x201D; &#x2014; assumed the third-largest position in 2022. Boasting over 140,000 bitcoins in December 2022, this specific wallet shares transactional ties with both the infamous 1P5ZE whale and another address, &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1FzWLkAahHooV3kzTgyx6qsswXJ6sCXkSR">1FzWL</a>.&#x201D; Subsequent cluster analyses, heuristics, and deductions hinted at a possible change from 1P5ZE to 1LQoW.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
When Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-third-largest-wallet-changed-hands-but-onchain-data-shows-its-likely-the-same-owner/">covered</a> 1P5ZE, a source with access to blockchain analytics tools (Chainalysis and Ciphertrace) informed our newsdesk that there is &#x201C;an almost 100% chance that both addresses in your article, both 1P5ZE and 1FzWL, belong to Gemini.&#x201D; Moreover, the latest address &#x2014; bc1ql &#x2014; is directly connected to the bitcoin address 1LQoW, insinuating that the enigmatic third-largest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> address remains under identical ownership.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Chinese cryptocurrency journalist Colin &#x2018;Wu Blockchain&#x2019; also posits that Gemini owns the new address. &#x201C;Gemini has transferred bitcoins to the new address bc1q&#x2026;.59v2 in the past 3 months,&#x201D; he <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1693905744712908968?s=20">reported</a>. &#x201C;It currently holds 118,000 bitcoins, or about 3.08 billion U.S. dollars. It is currently the third largest bitcoin holder. The first and second largest Bitcoin addresses are Binance Cold Wallet and Bitfinex Cold Wallet,&#x201D; he added.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Speculation persists, with some <a href="https://twitter.com/crypto_div/status/1693738671046885688?s=20">suggesting</a> that Blackrock could be preparing for its exchange-traded fund (ETF). Notably, Arkham Intelligence <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/bc1ql49ydapnjafl5t2cp9zqpjwe6pdgmxy98859v2">labels the address</a> under Jump Trading Custody as Robinhood&#x2019;s. On blockchain explorer oxt.me, onchain analyst &#x201C;Ergo <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x201D; <a href="https://oxt.me/address/bc1ql49ydapnjafl5t2cp9zqpjwe6pdgmxy98859v2">posited</a> on May 24, 2023, whether &#x201C;Jump [was] handing the keys to Robinhood.&#x201D; Despite conjecture, Blackrock owning the wallet seems highly unlikely. The most probable scenarios link the wallet to either Gemini or Robinhood and indicate a strong connection to the previous third-largest wallets 1LQoW and 1P5ZE.&#13;<br />

The decline saw the token fall to its weakest point in two months, breaking out of a key support point in the process. Cardano was also in the red today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Polygon (MATIC) dropped to a two-month low on Tuesday, as the token lost over 5% of its market value.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After peaking at $0.5679 to start the week, MATIC/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.5351 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The sell-off saw polygon plunge to its weakest point since June 10, when price neared a breakout below $0.5000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s move came as MATIC fell under a support point of $0.5600, with the relative strength index (RSI) also edging lower.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, price strength is currently tracking at 21.24, since slipping below a floor at the 24.00 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should momentum remain bearish in the coming days, it is likely MATIC will fall under $0.5000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to MATIC, cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) was also in the red during today&#x2019;s session, falling for a second straight day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $0.2582 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $0.2684.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The decline sees cardano move closer to a key support point of $0.2500, following last week&#x2019;s breakout below this mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, the RSI is also edging closer to a floor of its own at 30.00, and is currently tracking at 32.56.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event a move occurs below this mark, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> bears will likely look to exit short positions at $0.2400.&#13;<br />
