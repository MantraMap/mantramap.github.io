<p class="md-end-block md-p">The TON Foundation, dedicated to the advancement of The Open Network (TON), has partnered with Chainalysis to utilize its Crypto Incident Response Service, ensuring round-the-clock support for swift fund recovery in case of hacks or exploits.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Open Network (TON) Foundation, a non-profit association of developers and enthusiasts, is committed to advancing TON, a technology designed to unite all blockchains and Web2 internet into one open network. Chainalysis is a prime blockchain data platform that provides investigative services and support to both private and public sector organizations. By deploying Chainalysis's rapid response retainer service, TON gains a robust means to combat cyber-attacks or unauthorized network intrusions, which may involve cryptocurrency theft or ransom demands.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Justin Hyun, Head of Incubation at TON Foundation, expressed the organization's insights on enlisting Chainalysis's Crypto Incident Response Service, referring to it as the "industry gold standard" for providing a rapid response to hacks or exploits. Hyun claims that bad actors must be rooted out, and that such a measure is vital to ensuring an optimal experience for TON's growing user base.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Our vision is to achieve mass adoption in Web3 technology powered by the high performance and scalability that we offer. By rooting out bad actors we can ensure an optimal experience for our growing user base,&rdquo; shares Hyun.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chainalysis offers a 24/7 hotline for proactive Crypto Incident Response customers, assigning a dedicated team to respond to incidents such as hacks, ransomware attacks, code exploits, or flash loan attacks. The Chainalysis team works tirelessly, leveraging advanced investigative capabilities, to address incidents and, if needed, liaise with law enforcement and asset recovery counsel.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Having worked on hundreds of cases involving cryptocurrency, Chainalysis investigators have helped solve some of the most high-profile cyber-criminal cases. The Chainalysis Crypto Incident Response program streamlines the engagement process, ensuring no time is wasted regardless of the victim's location. Quick tracing and labeling of funds in the Chainalysis platform can be crucial in preventing bad actors from cashing out their ill-gotten gains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The Open Network (TON) features a layer-1 architecture designed to scale up to 2 to the power of 32 workchains, each of which can be subdivided into up to 2 to the power of 60 shardchains. This design enables TON to support millions of transactions per second near-instantly. By enlisting Chainalysis's Crypto Incident Response Service, the TON Foundation hopes to provide a more secure and reliable environment for its users as it grows.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To date, Chainalysis data, software, and services have aided law enforcement in the recovery of more than $11 billion in assets. The company has achieved SOC2 Type II Certification for its KYT and Reactor products, which attests to the successful implementation of controls in both the Security and Availability trust service criteria.</p>
