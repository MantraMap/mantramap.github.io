					<description><![CDATA[The crypto space is on the verge of another potentially historic moment with the first Ethereum Futures ETF in the US. Volatility Shares, a pioneer in the ETF space, has announced its intention to launch the Ether Strategy ETF (Ticker: ETHU) on October 12, 2023. If all goes as planned, this could mark the first Ether based exchange traded fund (ETF) in the United States. First Ethereum Futures ETF Is Set To Launch In The US Volatility Shares has positioned the ETF around cash-settled Ethereum futures contracts trading on the CBOE. Notably, the ETF avoids direct investment in Ether itself. &#8220;The Fund is an exchange-traded fund that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing its assets principally in cash-settled contracts referencing Ether&#8230; The Fund does not invest directly in Ether,&#8221; reads the SEC filing.

While Volatility Shares leads the pack, they&#8217;re not alone in this pursuit. A total of 13 heavyweight financial institutions, including names like Bitwise, VanEck, Vakyrie, Roubhill, ProShares, and Grayscale, have sought the US SEC&#8217;s blessings for their Ether Futures ETFs. However, as of now, the SEC hasn&#8217;t given its green signal to any. Will Ether Echo BTC&#8217;s 2021 Surge? Remarkably, the first Bitcoin futures ETF in the US was launched back on October 19, 2021. At that time, ProShares won the race for the first mover effect. And this has paid off. The total assets in Bitcoin futures ETFs accounts to $1.3 billion. Of that, nearly $1.1 billion is in the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO). The second largest ETF is the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF with $73 million. No other ETF has more than $50 million in assets under management.

					<description><![CDATA[The price action of Shiba Inu (SHIB) has encountered a significant compression, primarily attributed to substantial selling originating from a prominent institutional market participant. Data obtained from Lookonchain, a renowned on-chain analytics resource, has shed light on the ongoing selling spree by Voyager, a troubled asset manager currently navigating bankruptcy proceedings.  This selling binge over the past four days has amounted to an astonishing 1.4 trillion SHIB tokens, equivalent to approximately $14.4 million. The cryptocurrency landscape has witnessed a noteworthy development as Voyager, amidst its financial restructuring, embarked on an extensive liquidation of SHIB tokens.  Related Reading: Chiliz (CHZ) Empowers Smart Contracts With Upgrades – Positive Impact On Price? Voyager&#8217;s Unloading Spree And Potential Implications On Shiba Inu Lookonchain&#8217;s data revealed the staggering magnitude of Voyager&#8217;s sell-off, raising questions about the motives behind this sizeable divestment. Amid speculation, it&#8217;s important to note that the asset manager has now depleted its SHIB holdings, as confirmed by Lookonchain&#8217;s report. This intriguing turn of events prompts speculation about the potential impact on SHIB&#8217;s trajectory. Voyager has been selling assets on #Coinbase for the past 4 days and has sold 49 tokens for ~$63M. Including: 781 $BTC ($23M); 9,570 $ETH ($17.6M); 1.4T $SHIB ($14.4M); 234,660 $LINK ($1.74M); 1.87M $MATIC ($1.27M); 3M $MANA ($1.1M); &#8230; pic.twitter.com/SUGjjQQvja — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 15, 2023 As Voyager completes its selling spree, market watchers are keenly observing the ramifications on SHIB&#8217;s value. Notably, SHIB has demonstrated a commendable performance over the last seven days, exhibiting a robust 5.9% rally now trading at $0.00000998 via CoinGecko. While the cryptocurrency faced a 2.4% slump in the past 24 hours, this transient dip may be attributed to broader market sentiments influenced by seemingly unrelated news. SHIB market cap currently at $5.8 billion. Chart: TradingView.com News circulating about potential downgrades within the banking sector might have inadvertently contributed to the 24-hour slump witnessed by SHIB. It&#8217;s worth acknowledging that seemingly unrelated developments can trigger ripples of uncertainty across financial markets, ultimately impacting various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like SHIB. Such negative sentiments, although momentary, have the potential to trigger short-term pullbacks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Co-Founder Labels BTC Maximalists As ‘Insecure Losers’ Anticipating Price Rally Amidst Voyager&#8217;s Exit The revelation that Voyager has exhausted its SHIB holdings could potentially pave the way for renewed price momentum. With institutional selling pressure alleviated, the cryptocurrency could be poised to continue its impressive performance from the past week. As SHIB hovers around its current value of $0.00000998, investors and enthusiasts are cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a sustained price rally. Despite the recent slump, SHIB&#8217;s overall trajectory remains promising, supported by both its recent rally and the depletion of Voyager&#8217;s SHIB holdings. While the impact of institutional selling cannot be ignored, SHIB&#8217;s future gains may be bolstered by a reduced supply overhang.  SHIB&#8217;s upcoming performance will undoubtedly be influenced by a complex interplay of factors, ranging from market sentiment to macroeconomic developments.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the most valuable crypto asset, is at a critical juncture at spot rates if candlestick formation in the weekly chart is anything to go by. One analyst on X, formerly Twitter and NewsBTC Editorial Director Tony Spilotro, is sounding the alarm after picking out the bearish head-and-shoulder pattern in the weekly chart.  Will Bitcoin Crack? Although the pattern is technically in the last phase of formation, if realized, it could have dire implications for Bitcoin bulls as it may push prices below a multi-month critical support line toward $18,000 or lower in the weeks ahead. Even so, the volatile nature of crypto and BTC prices means traders should adopt a wait-and-see approach until it prints out. Related Reading: The Subtle Signs A Bullish Bitcoin Trend Is Brewing As of August 15, Bitcoin is stable and within a broader uptrend from a top-down perspective. Notably, the coin is confined within the trading range established between June and July 2023, as visible in the daily chart. Despite the general optimism of a price recovery above July 2023 highs, BTC was moving sideways and held above the $28,000 support level but below the $31,800 printed in the last days of H1 2023. Any breakout above $32,000 with expanding volumes might induce demand, forming an anchor for price gains toward $35,000 or better. While the inability of sellers to drive prices lower is bullish, at least from where buyers sit, the potential formation of the head and shoulder pattern in the weekly chart casts a shadow of doubt over bullish prospects. Subsequently, traders remain cautiously optimistic since the candlestick arrangement, particularly in the weekly timeframe, suggests a vulnerability that could affect market sentiment and hopes for sustained growth. Rate Hikes And Halving: Which Will Be A Stronger Influence? Several fundamental factors further complicate the outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s price in the coming days. Inflation is relatively high in the United States (versus the benchmark rate of 2%), which may prompt the Federal Reserve to resume interest rate hikes in the third and fourth quarters of the year.  Despite relatively stable labor conditions and somewhat subdued inflation, the Fed&#8217;s recent rate hikes, now at the 5.25%-5.50% range, underscore the central bank&#8217;s commitment to curbing inflation and maintaining economic stability. Related Reading: This Event Causes Bitcoin Traders’ Sentiment To Rise, Will BTC Surpass $30,000? The potential impact of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tightening policy on crypto is reminiscent of the events in 2022 when Bitcoin cracked, falling from 2021 peaks to below $16,000 in late 2022. While Bitcoin&#8217;s potential to serve as a store of value, akin to gold, during times of crisis can be a possibility in 2023 and the future, analysts still view it as a &#8220;risky&#8221; asset. From a bullish lens, Bitcoin will halve its miner rewards from 6.25 BTC in 2024. This reduction may cause a supply shock, making BTC scarcer, and may support prices in the second half of next year.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

<p>As of August 15, Bitcoin is stable and within a broader uptrend from a top-down perspective. Notably, the coin is confined within the trading range established between June and July 2023, as visible in the daily chart. </p>
<p>Despite the general optimism of a price recovery above July 2023 highs, BTC was moving sideways and held above the $28,000 support level but below the $31,800 printed in the last days of H1 2023. Any breakout above $32,000 with expanding volumes might induce demand, forming an anchor for price gains toward $35,000 or better.</p>

<p>While the inability of sellers to drive prices lower is bullish, at least from where buyers sit, the potential formation of the head and shoulder pattern in the weekly chart casts a shadow of doubt over bullish prospects. Subsequently, traders remain cautiously optimistic since the candlestick arrangement, particularly in the weekly timeframe, suggests a vulnerability that could affect market sentiment and hopes for sustained growth.</p>
<h2>Rate Hikes And Halving: Which Will Be A Stronger Influence?</h2>
<p>Several fundamental factors further complicate the outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s price in the coming days. Inflation is relatively high in the United States (versus the benchmark rate of 2%), which may prompt the Federal Reserve to resume interest rate hikes in the third and fourth quarters of the year. </p>
<p>Despite relatively stable labor conditions and somewhat subdued inflation, the Fed&#8217;s <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/fed-poised-hike-rates-markets-anticipate-inflation-endgame-2023-07-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent</a> rate hikes, now at the 5.25%-5.50% range, underscore the central bank&#8217;s commitment to curbing inflation and maintaining economic stability.</p>

<p>The potential impact of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s tightening policy on crypto is reminiscent of the events in 2022 when Bitcoin cracked, falling from 2021 peaks to below $16,000 in late 2022. While Bitcoin&#8217;s potential to serve as a store of value, akin to gold, during times of crisis can be a possibility in 2023 and the future, analysts still view it as a &#8220;risky&#8221; asset.</p>
<p>From a bullish lens, Bitcoin will halve its miner rewards from 6.25 BTC in 2024. This reduction may cause a supply shock, making BTC scarcer, and may support prices in the second half of next year. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price has mostly maintained the $29,000 level for the better part of the week. This points to low activity and momentum in the market, as well as a reluctance to engage in the digital asset at this point. One reason for this reluctance is the expectation that the Bitcoin price will see another crash before the bull market resumes. However, this crypto analyst explains why expectations may be dashed this time around. Bitcoin Price May Not See A Repeat Of 2019-2020 Before the 2020-2021 bull market kicked in, the Bitcoin price had seen a rollercoaster year. Mostly, the bear market had ravaged the digital asset causing it to fall more than 80% below its all-time high price at the time, and the crashes would continue well into 2020. Related Reading: Base TVL Surges 900% In 2 Weeks, What’s Driving The Growth? Given the tendency of the Bitcoin price to follow previous trends, investors are understandably expecting a repeat of this trend. But pseudonymous crypto analyst “Tony The Bull” took to X (formerly Twitter) to use the ‘recency bias’ to explain why this may not happen. In the post, the crypto analyst used an analogy of a town that had not had a flood before, suddenly experiencing a flash storm rainstorm. Given that it had not happened before, businesses were caught unaware without flood insurance. However, going forward, the businesses begin to expect another flood and as such, they get flood insurance. The analyst explained that even though measures would be put in place to decrease the chances of such as flood happening again, people continued to operate with the knowledge of the impact of the flood. “It is the brain’s way to going with the most easily accessible information, which is the one that has most recently impacted you in a significant way,” the analyst said. “This is what’s called recency bias.” BTC movement over the last five years &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com This recency bias, when applied to Bitcoin, shows investors are expecting a repeat of 2019-2020 because it is the most recent bear market. Hence, investors are operating with the knowledge of the most recent impactful event. “But much like the flood never happened before, we had a once in a lifetime pandemic. The probability is rather low we’ll see the same price action as 2019 and 2020,” Tony The Bull explains. BTC Price Sticking To Previous Trends? The analyst’s position is backed up by the fact that the Bitcoin price has continuously deviated from historical trends during this cycle. One example is that while the digital asset’s price did fall to around 70% below its $69,000 all-time high, it recovered to almost 50% below its ATH.

But by the end of the year, had lost about half of those gains. With the rest of the gains being wiped out in early 2020. If BTC does end up following the previously established trend though, then the digital asset’s price could fall as low as $12,000 before the next bull run begins. However, it is now a waiting game to see what ends up happening.

					<description><![CDATA[In recent weeks, the native token of THORSwap, THOR, has experienced a surge, with its value increasing by nearly 300%. This surge has attracted attention within the crypto community, prompting an exploration of the factors contributing to THOR&#8217;s rapid growth.  THORSwap, a cross-chain decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator built on the THORChain network, has been pivotal in driving this surge.  THORSwap Emerges As A Leading DEX? According to a report by crypto analytics Messari, THORSwap stands out among other automated market maker (AMM) protocols by offering a range of distinctive features.  As a DEX aggregator, it leverages the underlying THORChain network to facilitate seamless cross-chain transactions, eliminating the need for bridging or wrapped assets.  The report claims that THORSwap&#8217;s cross-chain DEX aggregation feature sets it apart by tapping into multiple liquidity sources and supporting a wide range of digital assets.  Related Reading: This Event Causes Bitcoin Traders’ Sentiment To Rise, Will BTC Surpass $30,000? By integrating with 1inch and assessing liquidity from over 50 sources on Ethereum, Polygon, and the Binance Smart Chain, THORSwap becomes an “unparalleled aggregator of aggregators,” offering users an extensive selection of native assets to swap, according to Messari. Moreover, the THOR token functions as the native utility token for THORSwap, offering traders numerous incentives. THOR holders can benefit from yields, revenue fee sharing, and trading discounts.  Moreover, THORSwap adopts continuous liquidity pools (CLPs), an innovation pioneered by protocols like Bancor. According to the report, CLPs create trustless pools of liquidity that eliminate the need for matching buyers and sellers, promoting a “well-functioning” decentralized market with limited volatility and price manipulation.  Additionally, THORSwap offers Impermanent Loss Protection (IPL) to safeguard liquidity providers from potential losses, ensuring they are better off providing liquidity than holding the underlying assets. THORChain recently introduced Synthetic Assets (&#8220;Synths&#8221;) to address the challenges of interacting with multiple blockchains.  These fully collateralized representations of assets, backed by THORChain&#8217;s liquidity pools, enable cost-effective and instant settlement without the risk of impermanent loss or liquidation.  The introduction of Synths has increased demand for THOR tokens while simultaneously boosting the network&#8217;s Total Locked Value (TVL). THORChain&#8217;s Performance Reflects Growing Interest? THORChain has reached significant milestones, solidifying its position in the industry. The report noted that the Total Value Locked metric stands impressively at $218.80 million, showcasing the trust and confidence users place in THORSwap and THORChain&#8217;s cross-chain liquidity provision capabilities.  Furthermore, the Total Volume of $11.60 billion represents the cumulative value of trades executed on the THORSwap platform. This figure reflects the increasing trading activity and demand for cross-chain swaps facilitated by THORChain&#8217;s protocol. These statistics highlight the influence and adoption of THORChain within the DeFi space. As the demand for cross-chain liquidity continues to surge, THORChain&#8217;s protocol and THORSwap&#8217;s user-friendly interface can potentially position them as industry leaders. Related Reading: Renowned Finance Author Says Bitcoin Price Will Reach $1 Million If This Happens As the THORChain ecosystem continues to evolve and demonstrate its value, the growth of the THOR token highlights the platform&#8217;s increasing adoption and recognition in the market.  Investors and crypto enthusiasts seem to recognize THORChain as a critical player in the DeFi space, leveraging its protocol to harness the benefits of cross-chain liquidity provision. As of the current market data, THOR is trading at $0.339695. Although it has experienced an 11.6% decrease in the past 24 hours, it has maintained substantial gains over the past seven and fourteen days, with impressive increases of 307% and 330%, respectively.

According to recent data, institutions have been getting their hands on the cryptocurrency at a steady rate, as reflected in the digital asset fund flows report.  Institutional XRP Holdings Rise Rapidly In the days following Ripple’s partial victory in the SEC lawsuit, XRP volumes and prices rose dramatically as crypto traders rushed to the cryptocurrency in anticipation of a continued bull run. However, price metrics from Coinmarketcap show that the euphoria has subsided, with XRP now down 13.39% in a monthly time frame.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin&#8217;s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, created Bitcoin in response to the 2008 financial crisis as an alternative to government-controlled money. Since then, Bitcoin has gone to spearhead the crypto industry, with many investors calling it digital gold. Now, renowned finance author Robert Kiyosaki has argued that Bitcoin price could reach $100,000 soon and go as high as $1 million. Bold Prediction On Bitcoin Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his bestselling book ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ is known to make very bullish predictions on the price of Bitcoin. In a recent post on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Kiyosaki tweeted of Bitcoin reaching 100,000 soon, calling it the &#8220;people&#8217;s gold.&#8221; However, a stock and bond market crash could see Bitcoin reach $1 million.

Mom, Pop &#38; kids in… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) August 14, 2023 He explained that if the economy collapsed, the value of government-issued currencies would drop drastically. As people lose faith in fiat money, many would turn to Bitcoin and precious metals as an alternative store of value. The increased demand, coupled with the limited supply of Bitcoin, would cause the price to skyrocket. Earlier this year, Kiyosaki made a similar claim regarding Bitcoin, touting a price of $500,000 for each Bitcoin by 2025. Michael Saylor, another big name in the finance sector, predicted a similar price of $1 million for BTC in the next few years. What Is The Basis For The $1 Million Bitcoin Price Prediction? Kiyosaki&#8217;s recent predictions about the US dollar, in particular, have come on the heels of the BRICS alliance, which is now gaining traction. BRICS, which is an alliance between the emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has gained ground in its campaign to support the reduction of transactions in the US dollar and the promotion of trading and settlement in local currencies.  As a result, many names in finance have seen this as a plan to de-dollarize trades in the BRICS countries, with reports of Saudi Arabia and possibly Mexico and Japan joining them. Reports are also that the BRICS alliance is working on creating a new currency backed by gold to settle global trades.  Related Reading: BALD Deployer Moves Proceeds Of The Rug From Base To Ethereum According to Kiyosaki, the only saving grace for everyday investors is to get into real gold, silver, and Bitcoin as stores of value. “SAVERS of FAKE US $ F’d,” Kiyosaki tweeted.
