<p>Swan Bitcoin is an online platform that facilitates Bitcoin investment in a simple and systematic manner. It was founded in 2019 by Cory Klippsten and Yan Pritzker with the aim of making Bitcoin investing accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of expertise. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency exchanges that offer a wide range of digital assets, Swan Bitcoin focuses exclusively on Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The platform&#8217;s main objective is to provide a user-friendly and hassle-free experience for individuals looking to invest in Bitcoin. It simplifies the investment process and encourages a long-term investment strategy. Swan Bitcoin allows users to accumulate Bitcoin gradually over time through automatic recurring purchases, also known as &#8220;stacking sats&#8221; (stacking Satoshis). Satoshis are the smallest units of Bitcoin, and Swan Bitcoin enables users to automatically purchase a specified amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, such as weekly or monthly.</p>



<p>Swan Bitcoin distinguishes itself through its commitment to low fees, transparency, security, and education. The platform charges a competitive fee of 0.99% on all Bitcoin purchases, making it cost-effective for users to accumulate Bitcoin without excessive charges. It prioritizes user autonomy by allowing investors to withdraw their Bitcoin holdings to an external wallet at any time, ensuring full control over their assets. Swan Bitcoin employs robust security measures, including cold storage and multi-signature wallets, to safeguard user funds. Additionally, the platform provides educational resources such as articles and videos to help users understand Bitcoin and make informed investment decisions.</p>



<p>Swan Bitcoin is a platform designed to simplify the process of investing in Bitcoin. It aims to make Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, promote a disciplined investment approach, and provide a secure and user-friendly experience for individuals interested in the world of digital currency.</p>

<p>Swan Bitcoin&#8217;s investment process is straightforward and designed to be hassle-free. To begin, users must sign up on the platform and complete a verification process, which includes identity verification and bank account linking. Once the account is verified, investors can set up recurring purchases or make one-time purchases of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Swan Bitcoin stands out for its unique approach to purchasing Bitcoin. Instead of executing immediate market orders, the platform employs a technique called &#8220;stacking sats&#8221; (short for &#8220;stacking Satoshis&#8221;). Satoshis are the smallest units of Bitcoin, and Swan Bitcoin allows users to automatically purchase a specified amount of Bitcoin at regular intervals, such as weekly or monthly. This approach encourages a disciplined and long-term investment strategy, enabling users to accumulate Bitcoin gradually over time.</p>



<p>The process of investing with Swan Bitcoin is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Here is a step-by-step guide to investing with Swan Bitcoin:</p>



<ol>
<li>Sign Up: Visit the Swan Bitcoin website (swanbitcoin.com) and click on the &#8220;Sign Up&#8221; button to create an account. Provide the required information, including your name, email address, and password.</li>



<li>Verification: After signing up, you will need to go through a verification process. This typically involves providing identification documents and verifying your identity. Swan Bitcoin follows strict Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to ensure the security and legitimacy of transactions.</li>



<li>Bank Account Linking: Once your account is verified, you will need to link your bank account to your Swan Bitcoin account. This step allows you to fund your Bitcoin purchases directly from your bank account.</li>



<li>Set Up Recurring Purchases (Optional): Swan Bitcoin offers the option to set up recurring purchases, which allows you to automatically buy Bitcoin at regular intervals. You can choose the frequency of purchases (e.g., weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) and the amount you want to invest each time. This feature encourages a disciplined investment approach and helps you accumulate Bitcoin over time.</li>



<li>One-Time Purchases: In addition to recurring purchases, Swan Bitcoin also enables users to make one-time purchases of Bitcoin. You can manually specify the amount of Bitcoin you want to buy and proceed with the purchase.</li>



<li>Fiat-to-Bitcoin Conversion: Once you have set up your recurring or one-time purchase, Swan Bitcoin will convert the specified amount of fiat currency (e.g., US dollars) into Bitcoin at the prevailing market rate. The converted Bitcoin will be credited to your Swan Bitcoin account.</li>



<li>Bitcoin Storage: SB provides secure storage for your Bitcoin holdings. By default, your Bitcoin is stored in a Swan Bitcoin custodial wallet. However, the platform also offers the flexibility to withdraw your Bitcoin to an external wallet of your choice if you prefer to have full control over your funds.</li>



<li>Monitoring and Managing Investments: You can track your Bitcoin holdings and monitor the performance of your investments through your Swan Bitcoin account. The platform provides an intuitive interface that displays your portfolio value and transaction history.</li>



<li>Withdrawals: If you decide to sell or transfer your Bitcoin, you can initiate a withdrawal from your Swan Bitcoin account. The platform allows you to withdraw your Bitcoin to an external wallet or sell it for fiat currency, which can then be transferred back to your linked bank account.</li>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Uniswap&#8217;s proposal to collect fees from LPs has been met with community resistance.</em></li>



<li><em>The vote resulted in a close match between the two proposals, with 45% of the vote expressing opposition to a fee. Meanwhile, 42% of the vote was in favor of charging 1/5 of the team fee on all Uniswap v3.</em></li>



<li><em>Protocol fee advocates can link together after a certain percentage of fees, they can win.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Uniswap decentralized exchange community members are facing chaos in voting for the platform&#8217;s plan to charge fees from LPs.</strong></h5>



<p>Proposal voting results showed that 45.32% voted against charging, 42.34% supported charging 1/5 of liquidity provider fees, 12.3% voted in favor of charging 1/10, and 0.04% of votes favor 1/6 Charge being imposed.</p>

<p>Although support for a fee outweighs opposition for a charge (55% vs. 45%), no individual category has received greater support than the &#8220;free&#8221;. If protocol fee advocates can link together after a certain percentage of fees, they can win.</p>



<p>Devin Walsh, executive director of the Uniswap Foundation, said on Twitter that the poll was published for feedback and was not part of a formal governance process.</p>

<p>These results will not necessarily prevent further votes on the proposal. The polling site suggests that the poll data will be used to prepare for a more formal &#8220;temperature check&#8221; vote. However, the opposition to a fee is substantial.</p>



<p>As per previous news, GFX Labs <a href="https://news.coincu.com/186644-uniswap-to-charge-liquidity-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has launched</a> a proposal in the Uniswap community to &#8220;implement liquidity pool fees&#8221;, proposing that all Uniswap v3 pools implement agreement fees equal to 20% of pool fees and open charge conversion for Uniswap v2.</p>



<p>The proposal&#8217;s scope is to implement fees on the Uniswap liquidity pool, implement a fee-for-earning system, and sell designated assets to the UNI community in a trustless manner. In subsequent proposals, the UNI community can decide how to manage, distribute or use the assets to be credited to the treasury.</p>

<li><em>Binance requests the Ontario Securities Commission, Canada, to drop its investigative orders regarding the exchange&#8217;s securities violations.</em></li>

<p>According to a document filed with the Capital Markets Court, the Securities Commission of Ontario, Canada, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/191286-binance-pressured-by-canadian-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> an investigative order against Binance last month, and Binance will be investigated to determine if it is intentionally circumventing securities laws.</p>



<p>According to the petition, the OSC&#8217;s submission requested a particularly extensive examination of whether the exchange may have attempted to evade Ontario securities laws and compliance procedures related to Binance.com or engaged in conduct contrary to Ontario securities laws or the public interest.</p>



<p>A few days later, Binance announced it was leaving the country due to &#8220;new guidance regarding stablecoins and investor restrictions.&#8221; When asked why it chose to leave the Canadian market, its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), a Canadian citizen, said in a Twitter post that he no longer thinks running a company has interest there is possible due to the new regulations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="450" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png" alt="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation" class="wp-image-191591" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-87-300x225.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Binance Asks Canadian Regulators To Recall Securities Violation Investigation 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Binance subsequently asked the Ontario Securities Commission to drop its investigation, arguing that it was &#8220;extremely broad&#8221; and &#8220;not based on any factual facts.&#8221; Binance added in its May 18 filing that the &#8220;investigation order has no legitimate purpose&#8221; and that the exchange has withdrawn from Ontario and Canada.</p>



<p>According to Capital Markets Court filings,<a href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/sites/default/files/2023-05/rad_20230529_binance-holdings-ltd.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a hearing</a> on whether to drop the investigation is set for June 2.</p>



<p>Binance isn&#8217;t the only crypto company that finds Canada a difficult place to do business. After, digital asset exchange Bybit said it was leaving the country, and OKX in March announced their withdrawal, citing the inability to withstand the new regulations.</p>

<p>The past decade has witnessed a tumultuous journey for the financial industry, with the collapse of large financial institutions and the concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a few individuals. These challenges have highlighted the risks associated with centralized systems. However, amidst the turbulence, decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a beacon of hope, offering new opportunities and empowering investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>DEX vs CEX</strong></h2>



<p>Following the centralized exchange FTX collapse in November 2022, DEX trading volume surged, indicating a significant shift in investor preference towards decentralized platforms. The ongoing debate between centralized exchanges (CEX) and decentralized exchanges (DEX) is a pivotal discussion in the crypto community:</p>

<p>The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, set to take place on April 28, 2024, is a significant milestone in the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly within the Trendy DeFi ecosystem. Occurring approximately every four years, the halving event involves a reduction of the block reward given to miners by half. As these halvings progress, the creation of new Bitcoin decreases, ultimately leading to the attainment of the maximum supply.</p>



<p>Within the Trendy DeFi pool, this reduction in new Bitcoin creation has an impact on the price of MATIC. Consequently, it fulfills one of the conditions of the investment pool, enabling participants to exercise their voting rights. Through the implementation of a DAO mechanism, investors can vote on whether to close the pool or determine the monthly profit. In cases where the voting rate surpasses 51% agreement among the investors, the development team will adjust the interest rate percentage accordingly.</p>



<p>As of July 2019, there have only been <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/184664-365-days-bitcoin-halving-the-block-reward/" rel="noreferrer noopener">two previous </a>Bitcoin halving events. These occurred on the 28th of November, 2012, and the 9th of July, 2016. At the time of the first halving event, the price of Bitcoin was $12.31, and at the time of the second halving event, the price of Bitcoin was $650.63.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/halving" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://academy.binance.com/en/halving" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance Academy</a>, the Bitcoin halvings timer is calculated using the following formula:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>(Halving block – Next block height) * Average time between blocks – estimated time until the next block.</code></pre>

<p>Trendy DeFi distinguishes itself from traditional financial projects by embracing the principles of DeFi and empowering investors. Unlike projects where decision-making power is centralized, and funds can be misused, Trendy DeFi prioritizes transparency, fairness, and user control. The platform offers a comprehensive ecosystem where users can engage in buying, depositing, exchanging, and, most importantly, earning monthly passive income based on investors&#8217; voting percentages.</p>



<p>At the core of Trendy DeFi is a shared wallet system built on Smart Contract technology, ensuring the security of funds and preventing unauthorized transfers. The platform operates as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), enabling all participating members to make decisions through voting collectively. This decentralized governance model eliminates centralized control and empowers investors to shape the project&#8217;s future. The system&#8217;s funds can only be used to adjust interest rates through voting, and any modifications require a 51% majority agreement from members through vote.</p>

<p>As a Polygon-based platform, Trendy DeFi leverages MATIC as the staking token in its investment pools. MATIC, listed on numerous exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, offers stability during market downturns and exhibits steady growth during market upswings. With more than <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-crosses-53-000-dapps-mark-in-a-major-adoption-milestone" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-crosses-53-000-dapps-mark-in-a-major-adoption-milestone" rel="noreferrer noopener">53,000 active DApps</a> on the MATIC platform, it serves as a robust foundation for developing decentralized applications, making it an ideal choice for Trendy DeFi&#8217;s technology stack.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Use $MATIC deposit token to invest 25% to pay system commission, 75% push to pool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Trendy DeFi ensures appropriate and safe interest rates for its users, ranging from 7% to 10.5%. The combination of market dynamics, the investor community, and the AUTO DCA (Cost Averaging) feature guarantees the safety of the investment pool. The project provides a clear roadmap for investors, outlining entry and exit points, profit rates, and risk management strategies. </p>



<p>Additionally, the condition-based approach ensures that investors receive interest for a defined period and allows voting to close the pool if specific criteria are met:</p>



<ul>
<li>Condition 1: Investors receive 7 &#8211; 10.5% interest over 2 years.</li>



<li>Condition 2: Once the price of Matic reaches $1.6, all system members will receive a voting notification to determine the pool&#8217;s closure. If a majority of 51% or more votes agree to end the pool, it will be officially closed. In such a scenario, the development team will collaborate to adjust the interest rate, ensuring investors can claim the remaining benefits from their investments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:28px"><strong>Staking</strong></h2>



<p>Trendy DeFi provides the potential to earn an annualized rate of return (ARP) ranging from 85.1% up to 127.75% for staking MATIC. All funds belonging to members are held within the Staking Pool, which is meticulously crafted using a Smart Contract. To instill an additional layer of trust, the Staking Pool undergoes a comprehensive audit by Certik, a reputable auditing firm.</p>



<p>Additionally, Trendy DeFi offers pool ranking rewards for those who meet the minimum requirements. Since active members staked a certain amount of tokens, they can earn additional rewards and move up in the pool rankings as table below:</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A MakerDAO vote ending Thursday approved the proposal to invest up to $1.28 billion in US Treasuries.</strong></h5>



<p>Following the proposal submitted on the MakerDAO governance forum earlier this month, the Andromeda Project was launched by Blocktower Capital Advisors LP under MIP90. According to the asset purchase schedule posted on the admin forum, 1/6 (16.67%) of the total DAI stock will be allocated to the US Treasury in 0-1 month. Equal allocations have been listed for 1-2 month bonds, 2-3 month bonds, etc.</p>



<p>MakerDAO Governance will instruct trading parties to mint Dai, exchange Dai for other stablecoins held in PSM, and buy US Treasury bonds evenly over maturities ranging from 0 to 6 months.</p>



<p>Voters unanimously supported opening a new real-world asset vault (RWA) called BlockTower Andromeda. MakerDAO will pay a 0.15% sorting fee to BlockTower, which amounts to over $1.9 million. Celadon Financial Group will act as the broker, and Wedbush Securities will custody the assets.</p>



<p>The voting page shows that the community approved the proposal with an overwhelming majority, with 99.99% of the votes in favor of Project Andromeda.</p>

<p>The approval to buy $1.28 billion worth of US Treasury bonds comes just months after the Maker community approved a proposal to<a href="https://news.coincu.com/174264-makerdao-approved-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> increase</a> its US Treasury bond portfolio holdings to 150%, from $500 million to $1.25 billion. The latest approval comes just a day after Circle, a fellow stablecoin issuer, removed all US Treasury bonds from the reserve that backs their USDC stablecoin.</p>



<p>Reportedly, the DeFi Protocol also purchased $1.1 billion in government and corporate bonds earlier this year through a vault led by asset manager Monetalis Clysdale.</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board of Governors<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20230601a1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> announced</a> the order on Wednesday as part of Silvergate&#8217;s shutdown process. Although the bank voluntarily declared liquidation with a plan of &#8220;full refund of all deposits.&#8221; Banks must preserve cash and other resources to compensate depositors.</p>



<p>The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation must approve Silvergate&#8217;s plan to liquidate assets. This bank announced it would be shutting down in March of this year.</p>



<p>The Fed&#8217;s order notes that recent Silvergate audits by state regulators and officials from the San Francisco Fed &#8220;discovered many deficiencies in its safety, soundness, and compliance. &#8220;It linked the bank&#8217;s failure to its transactions with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX.</p>



<p>Fed said the failure of FTX and Alameda, combined with Silvergate&#8217;s business strategy tied to the digital asset industry and a banking run prelude to similar higher-impact operations in the Valley Silicon and Signature Bank &#8220;has led to the funding and liquidity stress for the bank and a decline in processes that are the primary source of revenue.</p>



<p>The Fed statement noted that Silvergate executives voluntarily consented to all elements of the enforcement action. The regulator must approve any bonuses, promotions, or severance packages for executives as part of the order.</p>

<p>Silvergate was the first central crypto-friendly bank to close operations, followed by Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Many digital asset companies – including Coinbase, Paxos, Gemini, Bitstamp, and Galaxy Digital – previously had financial ties to Silvergate but announced that they would be leaving following allegations that the bank was involved in the collapse of FTX.</p>

<p>According to a Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and?__cf_chl_f_tk=NmaRfdZR.g9jCW9aKem0kQOFhQFs9V42_c0.JHl5oH0-1685665472-0-gaNycGzNDVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, institutional contacts will be 1 BTC and 10 ETH, allowing derivatives exchange customers to manage their exposure to crypto assets.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTI) and Ether (ETI) futures contracts will be made available to customers through third-party institutional futures commission traders (FCM) and leading brokers. Institutional clients who are early adopters of new derivatives may be eligible for various incentive schemes.</p>



<p>Two new futures contracts to enable investors to precisely manage risk and target attractive returns at lower fees than other US-regulated derivatives exchanges.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;With the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts, we look to empower institutional participants with greater precision in managing crypto exposure, expressing directional views, or tracking Bitcoin and Ether returns in a capital-efficient way. Coinbase Derivatives Exchange is committed to delivering innovative solutions that cater specifically to the needs of institutional investors.&#8221;</p>

<p>The new crypto offerings come less than a year after the derivatives exchange launched its nano Bitcoin and nano Ether derivatives. In addition to lower exchange fees, eligible institutions may qualify for various incentive programs if they are early adopters of these contracts.</p>



<p>The new derivatives will be offered in the form of USD-settled index futures and will expire every month. Each BTI and ETI contract represents 1 Bitcoin and Ether, respectively. In June 2022, Coinbase Derivatives Exchange launched Bitcoin nano futures contracts for its retail clients. Followed by the launch of nano Ether futures in August 2022.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SKALE has published the Levitation Protocol, a ZK rollup designed to give Ethereum developers with a new scaling alternative.</em></li>



<li><em>To supplement Levitation, the core team wants to develop a standalone decentralized Layer 1 blockchain.</em></li>



<li><em>A public testnet will be launched later this year, with a mainnet deployment scheduled for Q4 2023.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Levitation Protocol will expand the possibilities of the ecosystem by allowing any operator of Zero Knowledge Proofs to provide a decentralized ZK solution to application developers through a SKALE Chain.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SKALEverse is entering a new frontier!<br><br>Introducing the Levitation Protocol, a fully-decentralized, Zero-Knowledge (<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#ZK</a>) scaling solution, built on the world&#39;s fastest and most expansive EVM blockchain network.<br><br>The future of ZK scaling is built on SKALE. <a href="https://t.co/s5uqwde42S" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/s5uqwde42S</a></p>&mdash; SKALE (@SkaleNetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkaleNetwork/status/1664306586200752131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>SKALE is an ecosystem of over 20 application-specific sidechains that run alongside Ethereum. These chains have the potential to give scaling advantages by deploying ZK-Rollups, which, together with Optimistic Rollups, are the most extensively used Layer 2 solutions.</p>



<p>The introduction of SKALE G (G for Ganymede, the biggest moon in the solar system), which promises to be the world&#8217;s fastest and most scalable decentralized Layer 1 blockchain, will help with levitation. This blockchain will be particularly created for publishing Levitation-derived Layer 2 ZK proofs back to Ethereum, with the goal of increasing Ethereum&#8217;s scalability by employing off-chain computing while maintaining the primary blockchain&#8217;s security.</p>



<p>SKALE Labs CEO and co-founder Jack O&#8217;Holleran stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Levitation Protocol will take SKALE to the next level, offering even more options for developers and businesses to build and scale their decentralized applications. We&#8217;re excited to see the impact Levitation will have on the future of the blockchain industry.&#8221;</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="526" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75.png" alt="SKALE Launched New Decentralized ZK Scaling Solution" class="wp-image-191555" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75-300x205.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-75-750x514.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" title="SKALE Launched New Decentralized ZK Scaling Solution 38"></a></figure></div>


<p>A public testnet is expected later this year, with the mainnet launching in the fourth quarter of 2023. This, according to SKALE contributors, indicates that the network is aiming towards a thorough scaling-centric strategy.</p>



<p>As ZK projects scramble to build decentralized app-chain networks, the chain already has the world&#8217;s most robust and has completed over 70M transactions, making it naturally capable of integrating the best-in-class ZK EVM solutions.</p>



<p>The Dartmouth Blockchain Group just named SKALE the fastest blockchain in the world. The network has already established itself as one of the top ten blockchains in terms of daily transaction volume, with 86% month-over-month growth and over 400,000 unique users served in the previous 6 months. By providing app-specific chains, Layer 1, and Layer 2 alternatives, it takes a giant step ahead as a full-fledged blockchain scaling platform with the Levitation Protocol.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>MakerDAO wants to lower the USDP peg stability module debt limit from 500 million DAI to 0 DAI.</em></li>



<li><em>The ruling has a profound influence on Paxos, the controversial stablecoin issuer.</em></li>



<li><em>The market value of Paxos&#8217;s BUSD has dropped from more than $16 billion to $5.2 billion.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The community of the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending technology MakerDAO <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmQYSLHH#poll-detail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided</a> Thursday to remove the $500 million Paxos Dollar (USDP) stablecoin from its reserves.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="618" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-1024x618.png" alt="MakerDAO Proposes Eliminate Of $500M In USDP From Its Reserves" class="wp-image-191539" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-1024x618.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-300x181.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-768x464.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-1536x927.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-2048x1236.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-750x453.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-69-1140x688.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="MakerDAO Proposes Eliminate Of $500M In USDP From Its Reserves 45"></a></figure></div>


<p>The move has a huge influence on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/168889-paxos-confirms-binance-usd-of-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paxos</a> since Maker&#8217;s treasury controls almost half of USDP&#8217;s $1 billion supply.</p>



<p>This comes after New York state officials ordered the business to stop minting Binance USD (BUSD), another Paxos-led stablecoin, in February. Many unsolved concerns relating to Paxos&#8217; monitoring of its relationship with Binance resulted in the order.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/binance-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinMarketCap</a> statistics, the market value of BUSD has dropped from more than $16 billion to $5.2 billion since then.</p>



<p>Voters overwhelmingly supported lowering the USDP debt cap from $500 million to zero, affecting half of the token&#8217;s supply.</p>



<p>MakerDAO, one of the major lending protocols in DeFi, intends to increase income by investing its substantial reserves in yield-generating techniques.</p>

<p>Gemini, the GUSD stablecoin&#8217;s issuer, rewards MakerDAO for holding their stablecoin, and MakerDAO will soon receive a 2.6% dividend on up to $500 million in USDC via Coinbase Prime. Via investment management companies, the protocol is also increasingly investing in real-world assets (RWA), such as tokenized short-term US Treasury bonds.</p>



<p>MakerDAO has <a href="https://expenses.makerdao.network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent</a> little more than $10.8 million in DAI as of June 2 to address increasing expenditures in 2023 alone. DAI is an algorithmic stablecoin created and controlled by MakerDAO that tracks the value of the US dollar. It is distinct from other prominent fiat-pegged stablecoins, such as the USDT or BUSD, which are produced by a centralized body and require each token in circulation to be backed by an equivalent amount of fiat money, typically the USD.</p>
