<p>Sei Labs has just announced the launch of its Mainnet beta platform, seeking to facilitate the mass adoption of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Sei Foundation Announces Mainnet Launch
<p>Open-sourced tech firm behind the Sei blockchain, Sei Labs, has just announced a significant milestone in its journey toward revolutionizing the digital asset landscape. Following a successful Testnet alpha phase that witnessed an impressive 400 million transactions and the creation of 7.5 million unique testnet wallets, Sei Labs has officially launched the Sei Mainnet beta phase.</p>
<p>The team tweeted the announcement on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This marks the beginning of an long voyage, transitioning web2 experiences to web3 applications, with lightning fast time to finality&hellip;The Sei Foundation looks forward to seeing the exciting new applications built using Sei's infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mainnet beta phase's core mission is to undergo refinement through active community engagement and to seamlessly accommodate industry growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, Sei isn't just limiting its impact to decentralized finance (DeFi) but extends its prowess to any sector requiring trading, including gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
Scaling to Address Current Challenges
<p>As regulatory scrutiny mounts on centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized applications face the imperative of handling increased on-chain volume. Sei is seeking to provide a timely solution to the scalability challenges plaguing existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform had taken a multi-faceted approach to decentralization, scalability, and capital efficiency, combined with geographical node diversification, to strengthen its resilience against potential network disruptions.</p>
<p>Sei Labs' co-founder Jeff Feng encapsulates the mission succinctly:</p>

<p>"Current Web 3 infrastructure is unscalable, congested, and still too slow. Sei is designed to let apps and other projects scale in a way that no other blockchain can, while also maintaining a user-friendly experience."&nbsp;</p>

Sei&rsquo;s Performance Optimization
<p>The platform has reported some unprecedented speed, with impressive time to finality clocking in at a mere 250ms, which is further enhanced by a 100ms buffer to ensure protocol stability. This speed is fortified by built-in parallelization, further optimizing its performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei also introduces groundbreaking consensus research innovations, notably the Twin-Turbo consensus, propelling it to previously unattained performance milestones.</p>
Focusing On Holistic User Experience
<p>With the Mainnet's unveiling, the Sei team has revealed that over 200 teams are actively constructing on the Sei network, and over 7.5 million unique wallets have already emerged, generating a staggering 400 million testnet transactions.</p>
<p>Launch day witnesses the introduction of 30 live applications, with more slated for H2 2023, including the much-anticipated decentralized perpetual futures exchange by Sushiswap.</p>
<p>As Sei Labs co-founder Jay Jog pointed out,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The fundamental use case for blockchains is the ability to exchange digital assets. Trading is universally important for all Web3 applications, not just DeFi. It includes social platforms, gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and more. Exchange applications such as NFT marketplaces or gaming economies will offer the best user experience by building on Sei."</p>
