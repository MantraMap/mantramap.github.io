XRP has been on the front lines of crypto news for the past couple of weeks as Rippleâ€™s lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) heats up. The increased attention has translated to more market movement, and whales are looking to take advantage of this. Whales Move Into XRP XRPâ€™s trading volume saw a spike on Tuesday following the upward rally in the crypto market. This saw an increase in the price of the digital asset but perhaps most important for the day was the fact that Binance Smart Chain whales were actually more interested in the coin.

The breakpoints to a short-term bull trend for the digital asset, at least for the week. The most important now is for the digital asset to break the resistance at $0.037, as this will propel it above its 50-day moving average of $0.379. Once this is achieved, then a rally above $0.4 will be locked in for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Why Are Liquid Staking Cryptocurrencies Seeing Double-Digit Gains?
