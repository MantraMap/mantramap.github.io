			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are a few projects that have witnessed tremendous growth despite the all-year low season in the industry. One such project is Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) which is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is still in the third phase of its presale but the ORBN token is already seeing a huge increase in price. </p>
<p>The price of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) now stands at $0.0435, higher than its original presale price of $0.004. Experts have even forecast a 6000% growth for Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>What is Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)?</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new innovative venture capital and crowdfunding platform. Despite being a new initiative, investment platforms for both startups and investors have become an effective solution to most of the problems normally associated with traditional venture capital and crowdfunding sectors. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) offers a secure and enabling platform for startups to easily and conveniently connect with interested investors. The goal is to build a community ready to invest in a company of their choice at a low cost. </p>
<p>Using a unique approach of NFTs-as-a-service (NFTaas), Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses blockchain technology to mint equity-based fractionalized NFTs representing the worth of a new company. The fractionalized NFTs are sold to interested investors at a low price, sometimes at just $1. </p>
<p>This means that anyone anywhere in the world can invest in thoroughly vetted companies with great potential at the early stage. Startups also get an opportunity to access and engage with their supporters on a Web3 platform. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Focus on Security</p>
<p>Scams and rug-pulls have become all too common, especially in the cryptocurrency and NFT worlds. To counter such risks, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has enhanced security measures for its users. </p>
<p>For a start, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) comes with tamper-proof security in its smart contracts and the liquidity pool is locked for 10 years to prevent rug pulls. </p>
<p>Another key security feature is the &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; mechanism embedded in the smart contract code. This mechanism ensures that if a project being funded fails to reach its target, investors get an automatic refund of their money.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>ORBN Token</p>
<p>The Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) platform is powered by its native token, ORBN. The token serves many functions within the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) ecosystem to connect the virtual world to real-world economy. </p>
<p>Holders of the ORBN token enjoy several perks and privileges such as voting and governance rights in making important decisions on the protocol, an opportunity to stake and earn passive income, cashback rewards, trading fee discounts, and access to exclusive investment groups in the Winners Club.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has experienced significant growth in its presale. The initial price of the token started at $0.004 at the beginning of the presale but the demand has grown among savvy investors and is currently priced at $0.0435, an 987% increase in just a short time. </p>
<p>Given the huge potential of the project in solving real-world problems, it is obvious why market analysts forecast Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to grow by 6000% and hit a price of $0.24 by the end of the presale. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The way we conceive of challenges has shifted as a result of blockchain. It has resulted in a great many positive outcomes. Blockchain technology offers solutions to fundamental problems, such as maintaining trust within a network. Thus users can evidently witness the blockchain benefits.</p>
<p>Any company can shift its attention to problem-solving if it modifies the essential operating parameters and increases its level of trust. Its relevance has not been lost on the governments of the world, and they are eager to put blockchain technology into practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue that needs to be answered right now is, what are the benefits of utilizing blockchain technology?</p>
True Traceability
<p>Companies are able to concentrate on developing a distribution network that includes both suppliers and vendors when they use blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is difficult to trace objects in the conventional supply chain, which can lead to a variety of issues including loss of commodities, theft, and the production of counterfeit goods.</p>
<p>The supply chain will be more open to scrutiny than ever before thanks to blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes it possible for every participant in the supply chain to track the commodities and verify that they are not being mismanaged or substituted in any way during the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The in-house implementation of blockchain traceability is another way for businesses to get the most out of this feature.</p>
Extreme Surveillance&nbsp;
<p>When compared to other systems or record-keeping systems, among several blockchain benefits, enhanced security features stand out as a clear advantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a transaction is registered, everyone must agree on it using the consensus mechanism. Additionally, a hashing algorithm is used to encrypt each transaction and properly link it to the previous one.</p>
<p>The system's defenses are also made stronger by the fact that every node keeps a history of all network transactions.</p>
<p>So, if a bad actor tries to change the transaction, other hubs will always say no to his request to compose actions to the system.</p>
<p>Data that has been written to blockchain benefits cannot be changed after it is written. This is also the best choice for systems that are dependent on static information, like databases of people's ages based on information from the public.</p>
Inexpensive Operating System&nbsp;
<p>Companies currently invest substantial sums in enhancing the capacity of their current management system. That's why it's important to cut costs and use the money saved to start new projects or improve old ones.</p>
<p>Organizations can save money often spent on middlemen by adopting blockchain technology. Blockchain eliminates the need for vendor fees because there is no central authority to charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, less human intervention is required to validate a transaction, which further reduces the need to expend resources on mundane tasks.</p>
The Epitome Of Clarity&nbsp;
<p>Today, lack of openness is a major problem in many fields. Several changes in policy and practice have been made by various establishments in an endeavor to become more transparent. A system's degree of centralization, however, is the one thing that can ever make it less than transparent and trustworthy, alongwith the growth of reliable trading bots like the Bitcoin era.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using blockchain, a company can switch to a decentralized network in which a single administrator isn't necessary, increasing the openness of the system.</p>
<p>"Peers" are the people who participate in and verify transactions in a blockchain network. Even though there is a requirement that all peers take part in the validation process, not all of them necessarily do so using the consensus approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consensus method is used to provide decentralized verification. After a transaction has been verified, all of the nodes store a replica of the confirmed record. The blockchain system takes care of this openness.</p>
<p>Organizational settings magnify the effects of transparency. As was already mentioned, governments can take advantage of transparency when creating, implementing and operating, or holding elections.</p>
Efficiency Wrapped Under Speed Lanes&nbsp;
<p>Increased productivity and speed in industrial settings is blockchain's final advantage. Blockchain technology allows for the automation of tedious tasks, drastically improving productivity. With the use of automation, it gets rid of mistakes made by people as well.</p>
<p>The digital ledger facilitates this by giving users a centralized database for recording business dealings. When procedures are streamlined and automated, time and effort are saved, and production speeds up significantly.</p>
<p>It's much simpler for everybody to trust one another because the data is all kept in a decentralized ledger. In brief, blockchain employs its unique form of data storing to deliver a highly efficient procedure with trust, openness, and immutability.</p>
The Final Thoughts&nbsp;
<p>Whether a company chooses to utilize a global blockchain network or a private, permissioned one, blockchain and its properties can offer numerous benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, this concludes our discussion of the foremost advantages of blockchain technology. With this newfound understanding of blockchain's significance, you can decide for yourself whether or not to implement this technology.</p>
<p>In every industry, blockchain will have far-reaching consequences because of its revolutionary nature. To help you better relate to and appreciate its benefits, we have focused on only the most relevant areas.</p>
<p>However, the ultimate choice is up to you. This manual is meant to serve as a resource to assist you in selecting the best choice for your company.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced the launch of Binance Mirror, an off-exchange settlement solution for its institutional investors. Binance Mirror will enable institutional investors to invest and trade using cold custody. </p>
<p>On Monday, Binance announced the launch of an off-exchange settlement solution called &ldquo;Binance Mirror&rdquo; that allows its institutional investors to lock collateral by connecting their qualified cold wallet with Binance Custody, a regulated institutional digital asset custodian. Locked assets can then be mirrored on their Binance exchange account. Binance said that its new offering enables more security by allowing traders to access the exchange without having to post collateral directly on the platform:</p>

<p>Their assets remain secure in their segregated cold wallet for as long as their Mirror position remains open on the Binance Exchange, which can be settled at any time.</p>

<p>Binance Custody was launched in 2021 and is a custodian platform with its own cold-storage solutions that covers secured assets against physical loss, damage, theft, and internal collusion.</p>
<p>Binance added that assets held in cold storage will be kept safe for as long as the mirror position remains open on the Binance Exchange, which can be settled at any time. The company said that assets held on Binance Mirror &ldquo;account for more than 60% of all assets secured on Binance Custody.&rdquo; Athene Yu, vice president of Binance Custody explained that by using the mirror service, institutional investors have access to a variety of products on the Binance exchange as well as &ldquo;institutional VIP Loans.&rdquo; Yu explained that given recent events in the market, institutions are looking for first-rate security, but also &ldquo;the deep liquidity that the Binance Exchange offers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yu further said:</p>

<p>We spent much of last year refining its operations to help our clients unlock the liquidity of their assets held in our cold storage. Adding, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very excited about where we are today and can&rsquo;t wait to introduce our upcoming new features that will elevate Binance Mirror&rsquo;s functionality even further.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lately, businesses have been exploring new ways to increase efficiency and reduce costs. One of the areas that have seen a lot of growth is the use of cryptocurrency, which has the potential to revolutionize the way business is conducted.</p>
<p>Currently, there are over 15,000 businesses around the world that accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment. As more governments regulate and embrace this technology, the potential for companies to benefit from using cryptocurrency is becoming more apparent.</p>
<p>But why are businesses jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon? Are they abandoning the traditional finance system in favor of cryptocurrencies? Read on to learn all about it.</p>
Why Are Businesses Embracing Cryptocurrency Payments?
<p>Firstly, there is no substantial evidence or recognizable pattern of businesses abandoning traditional finance. We are, however, witnessing a trend where companies are adopting cryptocurrency as an additional payment acceptance option. This is due to a number of factors.</p>
Greater Legacy Outcomes
<p>Businesses strive to create a legacy for themselves. By leaving a mark in history, they cement their legacy and become more attractive to future customers. One of the best ways to do this is the early mover advantage.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are still in their nascent stages and not entirely ready for mass adoption, primarily due to poor awareness among people. By jumping onto crypto and making it more accessible for its customers, a business is not only seen as adaptable to the changing digital landscape but also as one that strives to provide more options for its customers.</p>
Lower Fees
<p>Processing costs for credit cards can range from 1.5% to 3.5%, plus additional fees for international transactions. This could add up to an expensive option for businesses.</p>
<p>With cryptocurrency, the transaction fees are significantly lower, and there are no additional costs for international transactions. This allows businesses to save costs in the long run and increase profitability.</p>
Faster Settlement Times
<p>Traditional payment methods can take days or weeks to settle, which can be a significant pain point for businesses. Automated payment systems, such as those using cryptocurrency, can greatly reduce this time and result in faster settlements and improved customer satisfaction.</p>
Higher Security Levels
<p>Cryptocurrency payments are highly secure and encrypted by default. This means that businesses can protect their customer data and also their own assets. Additionally, cryptocurrency payments are irreversible, meaning that businesses can be sure that their money is safe.</p>
<p>Further, iTeller's stablecoins are very low risk for business operations and allow companies to transact without any hidden charges or third-party financial intermediaries. This makes the process of sending and receiving payments more efficient, secure, and cost-effective.</p>
24x7 Availability
<p>The traditional payment infrastructure has a higher likelihood of pausing or going down because central entities and organizations control it. For instance, payments can be stopped throughout the country in case of wars or sanctions.</p>
<p>With cryptocurrencies, businesses have one less thing to worry about. The decentralized infrastructure like that of iTeller ensures that there is no single point of failure and network uptime is close to 100%. This also allows businesses to accept payments 24x7 without any geographical or geopolitical constraints.</p>
Conclusion
<p>With the rise of cryptocurrency kiosks like the iTellerATM, the barrier to entry for the average citizen to get started with cryptocurrency is lower than ever.</p>
<p>Businesses now have the opportunity to accept cryptocurrency payments in exchange for goods and services. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities, from lower costs to higher security levels.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the choice to adopt cryptocurrency payments lies with the businesses themselves. However, the advantages of accepting crypto payments are too compelling to ignore.</p>
<p>By taking advantage of the latest technologies, businesses can ensure their long-term sustainability and offer customers a better experience.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japan's Financial Services Agency recently issued a statement urging global regulators to consider treating cryptocurrencies and digital assets in the same manner as banks.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese regulator (FSA), crypto should be controlled in much the same way that traditional financial institutions have been regulated in the past few decades. Tighter regulatory oversight over the crypto sector would mean adopting standards and policies that are at par with what banks and digital "neobanks" aspire to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like to implement effective regulation, you have to do the same as you regulate and supervise traditional institutions,&rdquo; opines Mamoru Yanase, deputy director-general of the country's Financial Services Agency - Strategy Development and Management Bureau.</p>
<p>This varies from country to country, though, and while Japan's financial regulatory climate has often been perceived as carrying with it a good reputation, the fact that crypto projects, exchanges, and even fledgling protocols that introduce new technologies to the sector operate from different approaches and use cases may prove difficult in terms of policy implementation.</p>
<p>To say the least, implementing "blanket" rules and policies specifically for the crypto sector may harm investment flows for the domestic Japanese crypto market.</p>
<p>The urgency of such an idea can be felt as more and more pressure is dealt to global regulators. According to Yanase, the Japanese FSA's stance on crypto regulation is tangentially different from that of their U.S. counterparts, who are inclined to think that crypto and the technology it represents is the core problem. To the Japanese regulators, it's with how rules and standards are upheld without any sort of special treatment.</p>
<p>"What&rsquo;s brought about the latest scandal isn&rsquo;t crypto technology itself [...] it's the loose governance, lax internal controls, and the absence of regulation and supervision," Yanase said.</p>
<p>One could argue that the statement from Japan's FSA is largely conditioned by recent tragedies in the industry. The FTX fiasco, continued DeFi exploits, the still-unperturbed crypto winter, and the proliferation of Ponzi-scheme type scams across lower segment crypto markets: these are just some of the concerns that regulators like Japan's FSA have to face. These are also the same factors that regulators continue to be vigilant about, and ideas such as this are welcome albeit without the requisite amount of criticism.</p>
<p>All this is, of course, also being done in the interest of protecting crypto consumers. Demands for money laundering prevention, strong governance, internal controls, auditing and disclosure for crypto brokerages have been laid down for all global regulators, stemming from the initiative of Japan's FSA.</p>
<p>According to Yanase, the proposal has already been forwarded to the Financial Stability Board, a global organization working on regulatory compliance across the digital asset industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 17th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Allen Wei, co-founder, and CEO of LBank Exchange, recently commented on a McKinsey &amp; Company report that outlined the metaverse&rsquo;s potential to reach $5 trillion in value by 2030, with an estimated 50% of live events being held in the metaverse. Having been following its development closely for a number of years, Wei is confident that the metaverse industry will grow into a multi-trillion-dollar economy that will provide jobs and recreation for millions.</p>
<p>In 2022, more than $120 billion worth of investments went to the metaverse with more expected to come in 2023. &ldquo;Its potential to unleash the next wave of digital disruption seems increasingly clear, with real-life benefits already emerging for early adopting users and companies,&rdquo; the report stated.</p>
&nbsp;&ldquo;The magic about the metaverse is the experience that it could give us,&rdquo; said Allen Wei. &ldquo;When a lot of people think of the metaverse at present, they think about headsets and virtual reality games. This is definitely part of what the metaverse could do, but it is so much more. Right now we&rsquo;re still testing the waters. In terms of having a mature metaverse that is widely used, we&rsquo;re simply not there yet.&rdquo;
<p>The report presents potential ways the metaverse could create value and suggest technological requirements for it to achieve wider adoption. Four key enablers highlighted by the report are devices, interoperability and open standards, facilitating platforms, and development tools. According to the McKinsey report, despite high adoption rates in certain fields, most metaverse initiatives have had only relatively low levels of adoption.</p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping a close track of the metaverse since its inception,&rdquo; said Wei. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s changing so quickly and it&rsquo;s hard to say what it&rsquo;ll look like in a few years. But the fact that we as humans are craving more intimate connections with one another, more efficient ways to participate in events, and to learn information will never change. The metaverse will be the key to unlocking a new era of human interaction.&rdquo;
<p>Although last year was turbulent for cryptocurrency and NFTs, investors and experts are still optimistic about the future of the metaverse and its prospects of becoming a multi-trillion-dollar industry by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Seoul has launched the first phase of a metaverse that will allow its citizens to visit attractions virtually and interact with official services.</p>
<p>The Seoul Metropolitan Government has launched a new initiative called Metaverse Seoul, which allows residents of the South Korean capital to access city services in a virtual environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In what is being called the first city-backed metaverse project in the world, the first phase of the project, which reportedly cost 2 billion won or $1.6 million to develop, will focus on allowing citizens to explore the platform with avatars, and an app will issue proof of citizenship and offer support to struggling businesses among other services.</p>
<p>The second stage, forecast for 2024, will offer real estate counselling and will supply a hub for foreign investors looking to invest in local businesses.</p>
<p>The final stage, due in 2026, will be the completion of a public metaverse that will combine virtual and augmented reality to offer an experience that will enable citizens to interact with the city&rsquo;s infrastructure.</p>
<p>According to an article on CoinTelegraph, Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon announced the launch during a press briefing, stating that the online environment will be a "place of communication for citizens" of the capital city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>South Korea has always been at the forefront of innovation in the metaverse and blockchain space. With one of the fastest internet connectivity speeds in the world, it has been a leader in the development of virtual environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the FTX debacle, the city had been looking at collaborating with Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s company in order to build a city crypto exchange. However, the plans were dropped after FTX collapsed in early November of last year.</p>
<p>Despite this collapse, and the more than year-long crypto bear market, South Korea has continued to be resilient to the downturn, and is backing crypto-based technology such as the metaverse in order to be one of the world&rsquo;s frontrunners in this futuristic world.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>SushiSwap has shared a detailed roadmap for the coming year, which will see the development of a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator, a decentralized incubator, and several new stealth projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement comes just a month after the protocol warned of a significant deficit in its treasury.&nbsp;</p>
A Detailed Roadmap &nbsp;
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol SushiSwap has outlined its plans for 2023 in a detailed roadmap shared by CEO Jared Grey. According to the roadmap, SushiSwap will develop a DEX aggregator, a decentralized incubator, and several other stealth projects. However, the primary focus of the roadmap will be on user experience, and DEX products, in line with its previous plans to make the protocol sustainable and more profitable. Grey stated that the protocol plans to launch its decentralized exchange aggregator in the first quarter of 2023. In a blog post, the SushiSwap CEO stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ultimately, we will provide deep liquidity, optimal pricing, sustainable tokenomics, &amp; an easy-to-use platform, placing you first in everything we build.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Grey, the end goal of the roadmap is to increase SushiSwap&rsquo;s market share by 10x in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sushi commands ~2% of the AMM market &amp; 0% of the aggregation market. By executing our vision, we intend to 10x our market share in 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Grey stated that the upcoming DEX aggregator was created in &ldquo;stealth mode&rdquo; last year and is part of the plan to drive the scalability and sustainability of the business. The aggregator will help connect different decentralized exchanges and liquidity pools, enabling traders to access a better price and higher liquidity. Popular DEX aggregators in the market include OpenOcean, ParaSwap, and 1inch.</p>
A Decentralized Incubator On The Cards&nbsp;
<p>The SushiSwap CEO also shared his vision for Sushi Studios, a decentralized incubator through which Sushi will facilitate the launch of self-funded projects, helping grow the ecosystem without creating a burden on the DAO treasury. He also added that several stealth products are in development, along with its long-awaited NFT platform Shoyu, which could also be launched during the first quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement comes after the SushiSwap&rsquo;s chief technology officer, Matthew Lilley, stated in a Twitter thread that two of its products, MISO, a launchpad for external tokens, and the Kashi lending platform, were being shuttered due to a lack of public interest, and the effort and resources it took to maintain and keep the two platforms running. Lilley had stressed at the time that developers on the platform would begin focusing more on the protocol&rsquo;s DEX products.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to become a market-leading DEX by improving our product stack &amp; delivering feature parity to provide a firm foundation enabling innovation, like biased LP routes via our aggregation router &amp; concentrated liquidity coming in Q1.&rdquo;</p>

A Rocky 2022&nbsp;
<p>SushiSwap&rsquo;s push for more offerings in 2023 comes after a governance proposal put forward by Grey, which revealed that the protocol&rsquo;s treasury had only about one and a half years of runway left, seriously threatening its operational viability. In a later update, Grey revealed that Sushi had lost $30 million over the past year on incentives given to liquidity providers.</p>
<p>SushiSwap was created as a copy of Uniswap but with liquidity mining and governance features. According to data from DeFiLlama, the SushiSwap DEX has around $454 million in total value locked (TVL), out of which $326 million is locked on Ethereum-based assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency lending platform Nexo has filed suit against the regulator in the Cayman Islands which rejected the firm&rsquo;s application for a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license. </p>
<p>Nexo, a crypto lender, has sued the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) for denying it registration as a VASP according to reports by The Block and Cointelegraph citing a lawsuit filed on January 12. The lender claims that the regulator had placed &ldquo;too much weight&rdquo; on regulators&rsquo; enforcement actions in its decision to reject Nexo&rsquo;s registration. Nexo has requested that the court overrule CIMA&rsquo;s decision as it is &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; to provide residents of the Cayman Islands with crypto services. CIMA rejected Nexo&rsquo;s application on December 20, saying that the firm&rsquo;s business model did not meet the required risk profile:</p>

<p>Nexo posed a risk to market confidence, consumer protection and the reputation of the Islands as a financial centre.</p>

CIMA&rsquo;s Concerns Over Nexo
<p>Nexo is currently under the crosshairs of a large-scale investigation in Bulgaria which saw its offices raided by 300 police officers last week. Bulgarian authorities are probing into allegations of money laundering, computer fraud, tax offenses, and various other crimes. The crypto lender has also received multiple cease and desist orders from various U.S. regulators, but asserts in its lawsuit that this does not mean the lender acted improperly:</p>

<p>[Nexo] had diligently cooperated with all US states and federal regulatory inquiries and has been proactive in maintaining dialogue with the respective regulators [...] There have been some regulatory ambiguities with respect to the laws and regulations applicable to digital assets in the US such that the fact of the regulatory enforcement itself does not connote any improper behaviour.</p>

<p>In December, Nexo announced that it planned to gradually cease operations in the U.S. &ldquo;over the coming months,&rdquo; citing a lack of regulatory clarity.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, CIMA claimed Nexo directors and shareholders failed to disclose to it potential regulatory enforcement matters in the U.S. and proceedings in English courts. Nexo&rsquo;s legal representatives argue that CIMA&rsquo;s decision was procedurally unfair. Furthermore, it claims the regulator breached its constitutional and statutory duties by not providing Nexo a detailed reason for the VASP license rejection. Nexo however says that it had addressed CIMA&rsquo;s concerns during the application process.</p>
<p>In its filing, Nexo dismissed CIMA&rsquo;s concerns over litigation in the U.K., saying that it is merely an action brought by crypto exchange BitMEX against Nexo and one of its former employees over the ownership of a BitMEX account.</p>
<p>In its relief sought, Nexo not only wants the CIMA decision to be overturned but further wants the court to rule that Nexo is competent to be registered to offer crypto services. It finally wants CIMA ordered to award it with a VASP registration.</p>

Sustainability has become the goal of many projects and as such many have taken action to reduce their energy consumption.

<p>Crypto.com has for a long time been conscious of its environmental impact and is committed to becoming more sustainable. In its efforts to become more sustainable, the company has signed an eight-year carbon renewal agreement with Climeworks. By signing this agreement, Crypto.com intends to neutralize its direct carbon emissions. Climeworks is a Swiss company and leader in the field of carbon dioxide removal using direct air capture technology.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale, the world's largest bitcoin-only investment vehicle, has once again attempted to convince the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow conversion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many and varied are the applications for a Bitcoin exchange traded fund (ETF), but despite the carefully lodged protests by some of the applicants, including Greyscale, the SEC has always denied a Bitcoin ETF, stating that investors would not be adequately protected.</p>
<p>According to an article in Proactive Investors, a new Grayscale appeal, termed the SEC&rsquo;s refusal as &ldquo;arbitrary to its core&rdquo; and &ldquo;illogical&rdquo; given that the SEC hadn&rsquo;t had a problem in approving futures ETFs. The Grayscale petition stated that the SEC's decision should be held unlawful and set aside.</p>
<p>The main problem with GBTC is that the shares cannot be redeemed, leaving investors with only one option, of selling them on to a willing buyer.</p>
<p>Over time, the shares have underperformed against the underlying bitcoin, and have shown a very large negative discount. However, with Bitcoin rising over recent times, the gap has narrowed somewhat.</p>
<p>Osprey Funds, the controlling shareholder of Grayscale&rsquo;s parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) has made a bid to take over as the trust&rsquo;s sponsor and has made several recommendations.</p>
<p>These include slashing the management fee to 0.49%, and cleaning up the expense structure of the fund which contains significant conflicts of interest, seeking to implement a redemption program as soon as possible, and pursuing a listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Valkyrie Investments is also interested in taking over as the sponsor of GBTC, and co-founder Steven McClurg was quoted by Proactive Investor as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what actions Grayscale and DCG will take in response to the pressure they are facing, but it is clear that something needs to be done to protect the interests of GBTC investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Founders of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital, and crypto exchange CoinFlex, are pitching investors to raise $25 million for a new crypto exchange focused on claims trading. </p>
<p>The founders of the now defunct crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Su Zhu and Kyle Davis, are pitching investors with the hopes to raise $25 million to start a new cryptocurrency exchange called GTX. Zhu and Davis are joined in the venture by CoinFlex co-founder Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam. &nbsp;Two separate pitch decks were obtained by the news agency The Block.</p>
<p>Zhu and Davis are trying to bring GTX to life following the implosion of FTX, which saw millions of creditors lose their funds. GTX aims to take advantage of the FTX situation by offering depositors the ability to transfer their FTX claims to GTX to receive immediate credit in a token called USDG. GTX is a spin on the &ldquo;FTX&rdquo; name &ldquo;because G comes after F,&rdquo; according to one of the pitch decks.</p>
<p>GTX will employ CoinFlex&rsquo;s technology to build the exchange while a legal team will oversee the onboarding of claims for the recent bankruptcies that occurred in 2022 such as Voyager, BlockFi, Mt.Gox, and Celsius. According to the pitch decks, GTX is aiming to launch very soon, possibly in February already, and estimates that the claims market is worth somewhere in the whereabouts of $20 billion.</p>
<p>The GTX pitch deck has not been well received within the crypto community. Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy said on Twitter:</p>

<p>If you are investing into CoinFLEX/3AC[&rsquo;s] &lsquo;exchange&rsquo; you might find it a bit more difficult to work with Wintermute in future (on the relationship building side). Adding, &ldquo;Similarly, we are not going to be participating in venture rounds where these guys are about to enter the cap table, so founders beware.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A California-based cannabis seed bank has turned to blockchain technology and smart contracts to verify the efficacy of its medicinal plants. </p>
<p>Mendocino Clone Company (MCC), a cannabis nursery, has turned to blockchain technology and smart contracts to verify the authenticity of the therapeutic plants they sell. Through blockchain, the company will be able to certify all baby plants, also referred to as clones, with a batch certificate. Mendocino entered a partnership with the EMTRI project, a decentralised cannabis supply chain community, and technology firm Global Compliance Applications to make the project possible.</p>
<p>Cannabis nurseries, or seed banks, are organizations that focus on plant genetics and produce clones, baby plants, and seeds for wholesale distribution. According to a blog post by Global Compliance:</p>

<p>This innovative move allows the nursery to document the beginning stages of a cannabis plant's journey to becoming a premium product for consumers based on the gram weight it flowers.</p>

<p>Jed Davis, CEO of MCC said:</p>

<p>At Mendocino Clone Company, we are always looking for ways to innovate and improve the quality of our products. We believe that by joining the EMTRI decentralized community, we can provide an additional level of transparency and trust for our customers.</p>

<p>The batch certificate is a self-generated smart contract for clone batch and provides each baby plant with its own &ldquo;unique identity block,&rdquo; which is created by the nursery and linked to its Ethereum-based blockchain according to reports by Cointelegraph. The nursery&rsquo;s clients which include commercial farms and retail dispensaries can then use the batch certificates to verify the authenticity of their clones and their genetic lineage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests Multi-Month High:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 17 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gave back some additional recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair moved back below the 21000 figure after peaking around the 21437.02 area, a test of its relative high of 21478.80 from early November 2022.&nbsp; &nbsp;Major Stops were elected above the 19856.70 and 20947.28 areas en route to the recent multi-week high, upside price objectives related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above the 20190.78 area during the ascent, representing the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460, and this level recently served as technical support during a pullback.&nbsp; BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 21488.32, 21920, 23127.09, and 23196.08 levels as areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure, related to historical selling pressure that emerged around the 25214.57, 32371, and 48240 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stops were also recently elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 20026, 19153, 18448, 17743, 16870, and 16739 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 18513.27 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 20856.77.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18390.99/ 16714.46/ 14500.15 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;21488.32/ 22912.49/ 23127.09 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">XRP is a digital asset designed to bridge the gap between different forms of currency, including fiat and cryptocurrency. It is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, an open-source decentralized payment protocol that enables fast, secure, and low-cost payments.&nbsp;</p>
The Ripple Network
<p dir="ltr">The underlying technology of XRP is based on the Ripple protocol, a payment protocol that is built on blockchain technology. The Ripple protocol consists of a distributed ledger, which is maintained by a network of independent servers. This network is used to store, verify, and transfer payments. The Ripple protocol is built on a consensus algorithm, which allows it to reach consensus without the need for a trusted third party. It is also designed to be highly efficient, so that transactions can be completed in seconds, rather than minutes or hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP enables users to send and receive payments of any size, from any currency to any currency, in a matter of seconds. This makes it ideal for international payments, which require the transfer of different currencies. XRP can be used to make payments, exchange currencies, and facilitate transfers of other digital assets. It is currently used by hundreds of companies and financial institutions, including MoneyGram, American Express, and Santander.</p>
Price Fluctuation Of XRP
<p dir="ltr">The price of XRP, a cryptocurrency created by Ripple, has been volatile in recent years, with significant fluctuations in both directions. This has been caused by a variety of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory changes, and the impact of news events.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2017, the price of XRP rose dramatically as the company behind Ripple, Ripple Labs, announced partnerships with banks and other financial institutions. The following year, the price of XRP reached an all-time high of $3.84. However, the price of XRP has been subject to wide fluctuations since then. In 2018, the price dropped sharply as speculation about the potential regulation of cryptocurrencies increased. This caused investors to become wary of investing in XRP, leading to a decrease in the price.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In 2019, XRP experienced another significant price drop after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs for allegedly selling XRP as an unregistered security. This news had a major impact on the price of XRP, as investors began to worry about the future of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite this, XRP has managed to recover somewhat in 2020. This is largely due to the fact that Ripple Labs has managed to reach a settlement with the SEC, and the company is now focusing on expanding its services. The price of XRP has also been supported by a number of positive news events, such as Ripple Labs&rsquo; partnership with MoneyGram.</p>

Is Investing In XRP Profitable For The Future?
<p dir="ltr">The main argument for investing in XRP is that it is a digital asset with a growing user base and real-world applications. Ripple has established a strong foothold in the financial industry, and its technology has been adopted by major banks, financial services companies, and remittance companies. This has created a strong demand for XRP, which is likely to continue to grow as more companies adopt Ripple&rsquo;s technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP also has the potential to increase in value over time. This means that it can increase in value independent of other currencies. As more companies use XRP to facilitate real-time payments, the demand for XRP is likely to increase, which could lead to an appreciation in the value of XRP. If the demand for XRP decreases or if Ripple&rsquo;s technology fails to gain traction, the value of XRP could decrease.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Simply put, XRP is still in its developing stage. If you really want to invest in it, you can invest for the short term and trade on bitsoft360 to make a profit, but factually, it is not a good investment option for the longer term.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The digital asset has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, and its regulatory status has yet to be determined.

<p dir="ltr">That said, many investors remain optimistic about the future of XRP. The asset has a lot of potential as a payment system, and if the SEC grants it regulatory approval, it could become an invaluable tool for international payments. Additionally, Ripple has been making significant investments in its technology, and if these investments pay off, XRP could become one of the leading digital assets in the future.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, the future of XRP remains uncertain. The asset has seen some significant gains in recent months, but its long-term prospects are still unclear.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">XRP is a digital asset designed to bridge the gap between different forms of currency, including fiat and cryptocurrency. It is the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, an open-source decentralized payment protocol that enables fast, secure, and low-cost payments.&nbsp;</p>
The Ripple Network
<p dir="ltr">The underlying technology of XRP is based on the Ripple protocol, a payment protocol that is built on blockchain technology. The Ripple protocol consists of a distributed ledger, which is maintained by a network of independent servers. This network is used to store, verify, and transfer payments. The Ripple protocol is built on a consensus algorithm, which allows it to reach consensus without the need for a trusted third party. It is also designed to be highly efficient, so that transactions can be completed in seconds, rather than minutes or hours.</p>
<p dir="ltr">XRP enables users to send and receive payments of any size, from any currency to any currency, in a matter of seconds. This makes it ideal for international payments, which require the transfer of different currencies. XRP can be used to make payments, exchange currencies, and facilitate transfers of other digital assets. It is currently used by hundreds of companies and financial institutions, including MoneyGram, American Express, and Santander.</p>
Price Fluctuation Of XRP
<p dir="ltr">The price of XRP, a cryptocurrency created by Ripple, has been volatile in recent years, with significant fluctuations in both directions. This has been caused by a variety of factors, including market sentiment, regulatory changes, and the impact of news events.</p>

The following year, the price of XRP reached an all-time high of $3.84. However, the price of XRP has been subject to wide fluctuations since then. In 2018, the price dropped sharply as speculation about the potential regulation of cryptocurrencies increased. This caused investors to become wary of investing in XRP, leading to a decrease in the price.</p>
