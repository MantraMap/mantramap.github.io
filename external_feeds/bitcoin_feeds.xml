<h2>Texas State Regulators Issue Cease-and-Desist Order, Citing Insolvency Claims Against Crypto Firm Abra</h2>
<p>The Texas State Securities Board (TSSB) has <a href="https://www.ssb.texas.gov/sites/default/files/2023-06/ENF_23_CDO_1873_NOH_Actions.pdf">issued</a> an emergency cease-and-desist order against the company Abra and its network of subsidiaries. The notice alleges that Abra and its affiliate companies are &#8220;collectively insolvent or nearly insolvent.&#8221; The order also named Plutus Financial, Plutus Lending, Abra Boost, and the firm&#8217;s founder, William John &#8220;Bill&#8221; Barhydt.</p>
<p>The TSSB allegations suggest that in 2022, Barhydt restructured the firm into multiple entities and “sold investments in Abra Earn, a digital asset depository account, to unaccredited and accredited investors in the United States.” The TSSB order additionally alleges that a “working group of state securities regulators have been investigating Abra.”</p>
<p>During the investigation conducted on or around March 31, 2023, Barhydt was interviewed by the working group. Allegedly, the interview revealed that all the &#8220;parties collectively operating as Abra&#8221; were insolvent or close to insolvency. The regulator insists that Plutus Financial, Plutus Lending, and Barhydt violated state securities laws through Abra Earn.</p>

<p>The order further states that Barhydt and the parties &#8220;engaged in fraud&#8221; and made “statements that were materially misleading or otherwise likely to deceive the public.” Additionally, the order declares that the Abra Boost products &#8220;are securities,&#8221; and the state regulators demand an immediate cease and desist of all operations by the firm in Texas. The order is signed by Travis J. Iles, the Texas state securities commissioner.</p>
<p>“The Texas State Securities Board is encouraging Abra investors to immediately access and review the enforcement actions. The enforcement actions include allegations that relate to the disclosure of information, including the disclosure of financial information. Abra has not yet had the opportunity to challenge the allegations,” a <a href="https://www.ssb.texas.gov/news-publications/abra-earn-and-abra-boost-warning">press release</a> from the TSSB website says.</p>
<p>Abra&#8217;s social media platforms have not addressed the matter at the time of writing, and Barhydt&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/billbarhydt/status/1668985274968277000?s=20">last tweet</a> was on June 14, but it is now deleted. Prior to that, according to records, the Abra founder <a href="https://twitter.com/billbarhydt/status/1668272138606854144?s=20">tweeted</a> about artificial intelligence (AI) on June 12, 2023.</p>

Over $215 million worth of coins such as CEL, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, LINK, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, and others will be sold beginning on July 1, 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Celsius Plans to Convert 15 Different Tokens to Bitcoin and Ethereum</h2>
<p>In mid-February 2023, Celsius <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-celsius-to-be-acquired-by-novawulf-exiting-chapter-11/">announced</a> it would be acquired by Novawulf Digital Management to execute the reorganization plan. The firm <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysb.312902/gov.uscourts.nysb.312902.2807.0.pdf">filed its plan</a> on June 15, and as per the latest revisions, customers who possess &#x201C;altcoins&#x201D; will have their balances converted to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> on July 1. The only accounts exempted from this conversion are the &#x201C;custody and withhold accounts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Celsius will be selling all altcoins from all customers (except custody and withhold accounts) starting July 1st and will be converting them into bitcoin and ethereum,&#x201D; the official Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/CelsiansNetwork/status/1669289468489084930?s=20">wrote</a>. The coins included in the transition will be CEL, MATIC, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>, LINK, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, DOT, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, AAVE, UNI, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" target="_blank">XLM</a>, SOL, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/EOS" target="_blank">EOS</a>, FIT, SRM, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>. Some of these tokens have been classified as securities by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in specific lawsuits.</p>
<p>The sale will contribute more than $215 million worth of these tokens to the current selling pressure the market is already experiencing. However, the distribution among 15 different crypto assets will moderate the impact of the sales. The largest sales will involve $70 million of Celsius&#x2019;s native token, CEL, and around $52 million of MATIC.</p>

<p>Similar to FTX&#x2019;s FTT token, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celsius-network-token">CEL</a> doesn&#x2019;t have much to offer these days following Celsius&#x2019; bankruptcy. Over the past year, CEL has experienced an 80.8% decrease in value, with a 51.5% decline over the past 30 days. This week marks the one-year anniversary since Celsius <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/celsius-insolvency-rumors-swirl-after-company-pauses-withdrawals-nexo-offers-to-buy-firms-assets/">suspended</a> withdrawals and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>Of course, the plan to convert the altcoins to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> must be approved by the bankruptcy court. David Adler, an attorney at McCarter & English who represents a group of borrowers in the case, said his group will oppose the plan. Adler <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidJAdler1991/status/1669222668762071040?s=20">tweeted</a>, &#x201C;This proposed treatment violates every consumer lending law out there.&#x201D;</p>

In a letter sent to the SEC, republicans push back against the new proposed definition of &#8220;exchange&#8221; and its implications.</strong></p>
<h2>Financial Services Committee Republicans Push Back Against SEC&#8217;s Proposed Ruleset</h2>
<p>Republicans of the House Financial Services Committee are pushing back against the proposed amendments to Rule 3b-16 presented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that expands the definition of &#8220;exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group, comprising Chair Patrick McHenry and 28 other representatives, sent a <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fsc_gop_letter_on_the_secs_proposed_definition_of_an_exchange_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letter</a> on June 13 criticizing the implications of the approval of the rule, and its effects on the cryptocurrency market and its operators.</p>
<p>According to these representatives, passing this rule would imply that software protocols and even developers of decentralized financial products would have to register as exchanges with the SEC. This would be detrimental to adoption of the tech in the U.S.</p>
<p>Republican representatives stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The proposed rule will stifle innovation and harm digital asset market participants and the U.S. economy more broadly. We urge you to withdraw this proposal as it would effectively shut down development of the digital asset ecosystem and continue to stagnate U.S. technological innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the group of Republicans disagreed with an assertion made in the proposed rule, which states that &#8220;it is unlikely that systems trading a large number of<br />different crypto assets are not trading any crypto assets that are securities.&#8221; The letter explains the SEC should not generalize or make &#8220;sweeping judgments&#8221; in its rulemaking.</p>

<h2>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Said to Be Pushing His Personal Views</h2>
<p>The letter goes even further, accusing SEC Chair Gary Gensler of taking advantage of his position to propose rules that fit his perception of cryptocurrency. The letter states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is clear that Chair Gensler is using this proposal to push his own personal views regarding digital assets. It appears this proposed rule is an attempt to assert this personal view as official SEC policy without adequate analysis or justification.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the group accused the SEC of trying to front-run Congress, which is already working on different bills regarding cryptocurrency, with some of them being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-affirm-blockchain-developers-and-non-custodial-services-are-not-money-transmitters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> by representatives part of the committee like Tom Emmer.</p>
<p>Rep. Warren Davidson, who also signed the letter, recently introduced a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/republican-congressman-seeks-to-oust-sec-chair-gensler-with-sec-stabilization-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bill</a> to oust Gary Gensler from his position as chairman of the SEC, titled the &#8220;SEC Stabilization Act.<strong>&#8220;</strong></p>

Notably, the co-CEO of an obscure cryptocurrency broker named Prometheum expressed support for the existing regulatory framework of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its securities laws. Yet, the crypto community remains skeptical of Prometheum&#x2019;s credibility, as the company remains relatively unknown and doubts have emerged regarding the co-CEO&#x2019;s testimony.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Who is Prometheum? Firm&#x2019;s Endorsement of SEC Regulations Met With Controversy, Skepticism</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Who is Prometheum? That is the question <a href="https://twitter.com/kingmel_eth/status/1669123784111009793?s=20">being asked</a> by crypto advocates on social media in the wake of the statement made by co-CEO Aaron Kaplan during the recent United States House Committee hearing. The executive from Prometheum <a href="https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=408851">emphasized</a> the company&#x2019;s endorsement of the existing regulations and securities laws established by the SEC. Kaplan asserted that the SEC is &#x201C;the most capable financial markets regulatory agency in the world.&#x201D; He also highlighted that the current framework is &#x201C;clearly laid out,&#x201D; adding that businesses seeking new crypto securities laws are &#x201C;simply not willing to comply.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">For those that didn&#x2019;t stick around until the end of the <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FinancialCmte</a> hearing today, this exchange between <a href="https://twitter.com/USRepMikeFlood?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@USRepMikeFlood</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/PrometheumInc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PrometheumInc</a> CEO Aaron Kaplan is an absolute must-watch. </p>
<p>Flood explicitly lays out why Prometheum&#x2019;s claims that their SPBD approval is evidence of a&#x2026; <a href="https://t.co/yCDDKHiLea">pic.twitter.com/yCDDKHiLea</a></p>
<p>&#x2014; Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderGrieve/status/1668764481252478979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The company reiterated its viewpoint through a <a href="https://twitter.com/PrometheumInc/status/1669025167299813391?s=20">tweet</a>, stating, &#x201C;Prometheum&#x2019;s stance is clear: There is a path forward for digital assets in the U.S. through the current regulatory frameworks set up by federal securities laws.&#x201D; However, Kaplan <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderGrieve/status/1668764481252478979?s=20">faced questioning</a> from U.S. representative Mike Flood, who read comments from a letter penned by the company in April 2021. The letter sought greater clarity on crypto assets. Flood also inquired whether the firm provided clients with the opportunity to acquire bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), to which Kaplan responded by saying &#x201C;no.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Prometheum saga was <a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshInBos/status/1669061636953366528?s=20">described</a> by Castle Island VC executive Matt Walsh as extraordinarily strange. Walsh <a href="https://twitter.com/MattWalshInBos/status/1669061657312501782?s=20">added</a>, &#x201C;Bizarre that this fringe player with no biz model is being held up as an example of compliance by the SEC when the actual businesses in the United States can&#x2019;t get a fair shot.&#x201D; Although Prometheum was established in 2017 by Benjamin and Aaron Kaplan, the company remains an enigma to the wider crypto community. &#x201C;Who the hell are these Prometheum guys?&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1669083769259671554?s=20">questioned</a> Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, while others voiced even harsher criticism.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;This is hillarious, I didn&#x2019;t realize Prometheum doesn&#x2019;t actually trade anything people want,&#x201D; Omid Malekan <a href="https://twitter.com/malekanoms/status/1668946504189394945?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#x201C;But even if it did, who would use it? [This a] perfect example of a parasitic (and pathetic) startup that doesn&#x2019;t think it can compete on the merits of its products, so it hides behind regulatory moats and licenses. This is a classic Tradfi strategy, and one reason why so much of our banking system is stuck in the dark ages.&#x201D;&#13;</p>
<h2>Prometheum Investigation Jumps Into Hyperdrive</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures, <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143092274888704?s=20">uncovered</a> several Prometheum executives who had affiliations with regulatory bodies and financial incumbents such as the SEC, FINRA, NYSE, and CBOE. Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143100881551362?s=20">highlighted</a> that Prometheum utilized Regulation A to issue a token back in 2017, yet it has not yet introduced a product. The Cinneamhain executive alleged that the company &#x201C;scrubbed their social media from prior to 2019,&#x201D; despite archived data <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143103259783168?s=20">showing</a> that their Genesis block was intended to launch in 2019. &#x201C;But even to date, it acknowledges it can&#x2019;t clear or settle transactions and therefore, even though it is registered it cannot operate,&#x201D; Cochran added.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Cochran further explained that in 2021 and early 2022, Prometheum brought on board former staff members from FINRA and the SEC, &#x201C;with no clear product.&#x201D; Additionally, he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143115700092929?s=20">highlighted</a> that Prometheum purportedly secured funds by partnering with Wanxiang, an alleged affiliate of the CCP, raising $48 million despite having no product to show for it. It was reported that the company made a payment of $1.5 million to Network 1 Financial Securities, a firm with a history of &#x201C;20 regulatory or civil actions against them,&#x201D; Cochran stated. Furthermore, he <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143119789432832?s=20">disclosed</a> that Network 1 had ties to the team behind the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-3-individuals-for-alleged-long-blockchain-insider-trading-scheme/">Long Island Blockchain scam</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Cochran maintains that the Prometheum narrative implies one of <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143132183707648?s=20">three scenarios</a>. He suggests that it is conceivable that they may be individuals strategically placed as &#x201C;plants&#x201D; to benefit from a favorable regulatory arrangement from &#x201C;engaging in the way the SEC wanted to.&#x201D; Alternatively, they could be leveraging their connections with the SEC and FINRA to establish themselves as the sole approved entity &#x201C;to capture the market.&#x201D; Finally, Cochran posits the possibility that &#x201C;these guys are grifters who raised a ton of money from sketchy sources and for years have been twisting worst and progress to continue to ride the grift.&#x201D; He <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1669143137686618112?s=20">added</a>:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#x2019;t know which one it is, but something is rotten here.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Regardless of the circumstances, the Prometheum narrative has captured the interest of the crypto community, prompting many to delve into the firm&#x2019;s affiliations and history. In October 2022, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221026005178/en/Prometheum-Launches-SEC-Registered-Market-for-Digital-Asset-Securities">made public</a> its launch of an SEC-registered marketplace for digital asset securities through its subsidiary, Prometheum Ember. According to the <a href="https://www.prometheum.com/institutions">web portal</a>, institutional traders can register, establish a custodial account, link it to their trading account, and commence trading activities. Notably, the website refrains from showing the institutions utilizing their services, so it is unclear who uses Prometheum.&#13;<br />

This month has seen only one 2010 block reward transfer, with the previous two taking place on May 22, 2023.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>$1.25 Million in Bitcoin Moves After a Decade of Inactivity; 2023 Sees 6 Block Rewards From 2010 Spent</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Although bitcoin&#x2019;s price has dipped by 7.5% this month, the address, established on June 21, 2010, opted to move its entire 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> balance worth $1.25 million &#x2014; the first such activity in over 12 years. Nowadays, transfers of 2010 block rewards are relatively rare and were more prevalent when the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s value was twice its current size. Blockchain parser Btcparser.com <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">caught the movement</a> of the entire balance from the &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">13CFn</a>&#x201D; address.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Interestingly, <a href="https://blockchair.com/search?q=13CFnFFn932HdxjP2sJYdijmcDPVvDVT2i">data</a> reveals that the owner didn&#x2019;t spend the associated <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> that is tied to the funds. The last &#x2018;sleeping bitcoin&#x2019; transfers from 2010 happened 24 days prior on May 22, 2023. On that day, two <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1B67KGYNMxPB6cznHTTzgGprmw7kBxTRB1">block rewards</a> amounting to a total of 100 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> were <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=17Zj2pWUeQVwD13RD2A28MtgLDTooDdanS">moved</a>. In April, a single block reward from 2010 was shifted <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/16M6tUcPmpVkZ92Lr9mGRuiEiubJgRav9N">without being detected</a> by parsers due to an earlier dust transaction. Before April&#x2019;s transfer, a <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=1QC2eAKL4dmvvaNUwCcxobKhewRubj4rWt">separate transaction</a> involving a 50 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block reward occurred on March 20, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In February 2023, a single block reward from 2010 was <a href="https://btcparser.com/?a=13UXyHZsVRLeu28VEmdRF3pduSAxzcHL9k">transferred</a>. January did not see any transfers involving funds from that year. According to Blockchair.com&#x2019;s privacy tool, the recent transfer of a block reward dating back to 2010 <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/privacy-o-meter/391cb05e80efc1b7b8376ff116fdd8e9be5bbf909e903a563a1447ef5901b34a">scored</a> a &#x201C;low&#x201D; rating for privacy. A mere five points &#x2014; with several identifiable issues in leakage such as a &#x201C;sweep,&#x201D; &#x201C;same address in inputs,&#x201D; and &#x201C;various input types.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The entirety of this <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> balance was transferred to one address before reaching another wallet, and then it finally split into two addresses holding 23.11 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and 26.88 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, respectively. In total, 2023 has seen six block reward transfers from the 2010 era &#x2014; all after more than a decade of inactivity.&#13;<br />

The global market cap is trading 4% lower as of writing, as a wave of bears captured sentiment. Litecoin plunged to a three-month low today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Polygon (MATIC) was a notable mover on Thursday, as the price slipped by as much as 9%, nearing a multi-month low in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
MATIC/USD fell to a floor of $0.5951 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, after trading at a high of $0.6598 on Wednesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this drop in price, polygon moved closer to Saturday&#x2019;s bottom at $0.5059, which was its lowest point since last July.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, today&#x2019;s drop saw the token move below a floor at $0.6000, just as the relative strength index (RSI) found one of its own at the 21.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, price strength is tracking at 22.19, which is still significantly oversold, and could potentially prompt long-term bulls to buy the dip.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A ceiling at the 25.00 mark will likely act as a test for traders, and should they pass this point, there is a possibility that MATIC could be heading back above $0.7500.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to polygon, litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) also moved considerably lower in today&#x2019;s session, hitting a three-month low in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After trading at a peak of $77.86 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD retreated to a low at $72.02 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This bottom pushed litecoin to its weakest point since March 12, falling below a floor at $73.00 in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This downturn came as the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extended its recent crossover with the 25-day MA.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On top of this, the RSI also slipped below a key support zone at 31.00, and as of writing, is tracking at 30.89.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> has since moved back above $73.00, with bulls now targeting a resistance level near the $80.00 mark.&#13;<br />

During this period, three of the leading stablecoins experienced a decline in their supplies ranging from 4% to 19% compared to the previous month.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Stablecoin Economy Slips Lower</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In the realm of stablecoin projects, the diminishing supplies of various tokens have become an ongoing trend, and the past month witnessed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230615002503/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">notable redemptions</a> for USDC, BUSD, and DAI. The second largest stablecoin, USDC, experienced a 5.7% reduction in its supply, while BUSD saw approximately 19% of its tokens redeemed.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similarly, Makerdao&#x2019;s DAI stablecoin witnessed a 4% decline since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230515154427/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">May 15, 2023</a>. However, amidst these fluctuations, two stablecoins stood out by showcasing increases in their supplies over the last 30 days &#x2014; tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) and true usd (TUSD).&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Within the span of 30 days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> witnessed a 0.9% growth in its supply, reaching an all-time high market valuation of $83.614 billion. In a similar vein, TUSD witnessed a 0.3% rise in its supply, propelling its market capitalization to $2.04 billion as of June 15.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
On the other hand, pax dollar (USDP) recorded a 4.8% decrease over the past month, while FRAX managed to inch up 0.2% within the same timeframe. Tron&#x2019;s USDD saw a reduction of 1%, whereas Gemini&#x2019;s GUSD suffered a 1.9% decline. Additionally, liquity usd (LUSD) underwent a reduction of approximately 1.9% over the course of the last 30 days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Redemptions ranging from 1% to 19% have affected the market valuations of seven out of the top ten stablecoins. Since May 15, 2023, roughly 2.471 billion stablecoins have been redeemed, contributing to the overall decline in the stablecoin economy.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The predominantly USD-pegged crypto assets that constitute the stablecoin economy have reached their lowest value in 20 months, and if the trend observed in June persists, a downturn lasting 21 months could be in store.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While BUSD experienced a significant decline of 19%, the losses suffered by other stablecoin projects have resulted in the current value of $128.92 billion. At present, the stablecoin economy represents 12.12% of the crypto economy&#x2019;s total value of $1.06 trillion.&#13;<br />

<h2>Hong Kong Welcomes Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p>Hong Kong legislator Johnny Ng has invited global cryptocurrency exchanges to apply for a license to operate in Hong Kong, following a recent crackdown by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on unregistered crypto exchanges and securities tokens.</p>
<p>Noting that there has recently been a lot of news about cryptocurrency exchanges, the lawmaker tweeted Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I hereby offer an invitation to welcome all global virtual asset trading operators including Coinbase to come to HK for application of official trading platforms and further development plans.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Please feel free to approach me and I am happy to provide any assistance,” the lawmaker added.</p>
<p>Hong Kong recently revamped its regulatory framework for crypto in an attempt to become a crypto and innovation hub. The new law went into effect on June 1. The Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) claimed that its new regulatory regime &#8220;seeks to capture all the dimensions of the public’s interface with virtual assets, providing for investor protection and market integrity while managing key risks to financial institutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. SEC has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ceo-responds-to-sec-lawsuit-accusing-crypto-exchange-of-securities-law-violations/">cracking</a> down on unregistered cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase. The regulator also sought to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/asset-freeze-to-halt-binance-us-operations-exchange-says-seeks-rejection-of-sec-request/">freeze</a> the assets held at Binance US.</p>
<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has reaffirmed that his exchange platform does not list securities. He emphasized Coinbase&#8217;s commitment to engaging in a legal battle with the SEC in order to establish clear regulatory guidelines for the cryptocurrency industry. Armstrong further highlighted that Coinbase made multiple attempts to comply with SEC Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s suggestions and &#8220;come in and register.&#8221; However, he expressed frustration, stating that it was not possible. &#8220;We tried,&#8221; he stressed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gensler has insisted that the rules regarding cryptocurrency exchanges are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-rebuts-claims-crypto-exchanges-lacked-fair-notice-affirms-majority-of-tokens-are-securities/">clear</a> and that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">most crypto tokens</a>, other than bitcoin, are securities. Nonetheless, numerous industry participants and lawmakers have strongly criticized him and the SEC for adopting an enforcement-focused approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

In an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, Saylor emphasized that the entire industry is bound for rationalization and will undergo a significant metamorphosis into a Bitcoin-centric financial sector, leaving only a few proof-of-work tokens to prevail.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Saylor Says Regulators Show No Love Toward Stablecoins, Crypto Securities, and Tokens</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In an <a href="https://youtu.be/9_LKEp6aPnM">interview</a> with Bloomberg on June 13, Michael Saylor, the founder and chairman of Microstrategy, delved into the recent crackdown on exchanges. Saylor emphasized that Microstrategy has held the belief since 2020 that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> stands alone as the &#x201C;only institutional grade investable asset in the crypto space.&#x201D; He underlined the fact that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is widely recognized as a digital commodity on a global scale, and he speculated that regulators do not envision a promising future for other cryptocurrencies.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;[Regulators] don&#x2019;t have any love for crypto derivatives,&#x201D; Saylor explained. &#x201C;They don&#x2019;t have any love for crypto tokens. And they have a view of crypto exchanges, which is far-constrained. I mean, their view is crypto exchanges should exchange and should trade and hold pure digital commodities like bitcoin. And so the entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other proof-of-work tokens.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In a recent report by Bitcoin.com News, an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-chose-eth-over-btc-the-firm-be-up-ahead-by-more-than-2b/">intriguing tool</a> highlighted that if Microstrategy had invested in <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH/">ethereum (ETH)</a> instead of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, the company would have witnessed a profit of over 50% rather than enduring a 14% decline. This revelation likely holds little significance for Saylor, who remains unwavering in his firm&#x2019;s bold bet on their massive stash of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategys-bitcoin-holdings-reach-140000-btc-after-acquiring-1045-more-bitcoins/">140,000 bitcoins</a>. During the Bloomberg interview, Saylor expressed his conviction that the general public is gradually awakening to the realization that &#x201C;bitcoin is the next bitcoin.&#x201D; He further insisted that the logical progression for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is to multiply its value by tenfold, and then do it all over again.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Saylor Expects Bitcoin Dominance to Head Back to 80%, Others Believe Regulation Is Not the Way Forward</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The founder of Microstrategy underlined his belief that crypto exchanges will eventually comprehend <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s reign, assuring them that their business models will remain unscathed as &#x201C;bitcoin goes up by a factor of 10.&#x201D; Looking ahead, Saylor predicted a resurgence in bitcoin dominance, propelling it to reclaim the 80% level, a milestone that has <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">remained</a> elusive since 2017. He highlighted the role of regulatory clarity, saying it will propel the industry forward, and claimed that it would eradicate the lingering confusion and unease that he believes hinders institutional investors.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Regulatory clarity,&#x201D; Saylor affirmed, &#x201C;is going to drive bitcoin adoption.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Saylor&#x2019;s perspective, unsurprisingly, received mixed reactions, as not everyone agreed with his stance. Critics argued that relying on the state&#x2019;s monopoly of force to shield <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> from free-market competition is not the optimal path forward. One individual pointed out that the very laws and government regulations that the Microstrategy founder advocates for &#x201C;wouldn&#x2019;t have let Satoshi create bitcoin.&#x201D; &#x201C;You have become everything that Satoshi was fighting against,&#x201D; the critic <a href="https://archive.ph/2hwoE">contended</a>. Meanwhile, another individual <a href="https://archive.ph/begCU">expressed</a> the belief that regulation ultimately enables governments to seize one&#x2019;s wealth, simplifying it as &#x201C;retaining the government&#x2019;s ability to steal your wealth.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
