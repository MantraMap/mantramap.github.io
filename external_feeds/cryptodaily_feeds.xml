			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance has officially announced the launch of its opBNB Mainnet, a notable addition to the burgeoning decentralized scaling solutions sector. Touted to bolster transaction speed, security, and scalability, the move is closely watched by industry insiders and users alike.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Harnessing the Optimism OP Stack Bedrock, an optimistic rollup framework, opBNB underwent a comprehensive Testnet phase over a span of 1.5 months. During this time, the network recorded more than 7 million on-chain transactions, connecting to over 435,000 unique wallet addresses. This trial run demonstrated block processing capabilities with times hovering around one second.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, opBNB's Testnet revealed its capacity to support an array of tokens, encompassing not only Binance's proprietary BNB but also widely recognized stablecoins like BUSD, USDT, and DAI. A distinguishing feature emerged in the form of minimized transaction costs, with the Layer 2 gas price set at a minimal 0.2 gwei, leading to significantly reduced expenses for users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The impending Mainnet rollout, slotted for mid-August 2023, is bifurcated into stages: an initial access for infrastructure providers followed by a general user release. Calearly defined criteria underline the Mainnet's launch, with emphasis on High Availability to mitigate potential bottlenecks and an ambitious performance benchmark, aiming for a consistent 4,000 TPS.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Governance remains central to opBNB's approach. The Mainnet's governance framework, as detailed in the BEP-1 proposal, underscores the commitment to democratic governance processes. Concurrently, to foster ecosystem growth, opBNB is initiating a range of grants and builder programs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Looking ahead, Binance's roadmap for opBNB is multifaceted. It includes enhancing fraud-proof systems, streamlining account abstraction, and ensuring seamless data exchange with the BNB Greenfield ecosystem. A pivotal feature on the horizon is the decentralized sequencer, indicative of Binance's preemptive stance on potential centralization concerns.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While the opBNB Mainnet launch represents a significant juncture, the path ahead focuses on robust security, augmented community engagement, and facilitating broader digital adoption.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, provided an analytical dive into X's Community Notes tool via a post on his personal website. Notably, Buterin lauded the tool, formerly known as Twitter's Birdwatch, for aligning closely with the ethos of "crypto values" in mainstream contexts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Launched as Birdwatch in the U.S. in October 2022, Community Notes was conceptualized as a feature that would empower users to classify tweets based on their helpfulness and context. This was introduced prior to Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Buterin's assessment illuminated that the tool's core strength lies in its open-source algorithm, ensuring decisions about which notes are displayed are transparent and unbiased. He opined that the system is &ldquo;the closest thing to an instantiation of &lsquo;crypto values&rsquo; that we have seen in the mainstream world.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While emphasizing its merits, Buterin also touched upon certain imperfections of the algorithm, noting, "It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of credible neutrality." Additionally, he highlighted the tool's capability in providing context to potentially misleading images used in news previews and addressing misinformation related to COVID-19.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Going deeper into the mechanics, Buterin elaborated on how the algorithm avoids simplistically averaging out people's votes to gauge a comment's utility. He further noted its efficiency in detecting stark political differences in content, reinforcing its neutrality.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Musk's Approach and Buterin's Observations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Elon Musk's role in steering X's strategy since acquiring Twitter has been under scrutiny. Vitalik Buterin, while appreciating the algorithm's robustness, speculated that Musk might have directed the removal of certain Community Notes that could be perceived as contrary to his business alignments, specifically those critiques of the Chinese government. Despite this conjecture and comments on "highly contentious actions" post-Musk's takeover, Musk acknowledged Buterin's wrrite-up as a "great analysis".</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This commendation occurs amidst a backdrop of various discussions surrounding Musk's approach to free speech, exemplified by his self-proclaimed stance as a "free speech absolutist." There have been allegations, as per a Washington Post report, suggesting Musk&rsquo;s potential involvement in introducing a five-second delay for links to specific news outlets, including The New York Times.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a somewhat tangential twist, Buterin's analysis was published at a time when Musk was reportedly involved in a digital altercation with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with discussions hinting at a potential mixed martial arts face-off between the two tech magnates.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ethereum layer-2 solution Arbitrum is set to &ldquo;cliff unlock&rdquo; over 1 billion worth of $ARB on March 16, 2024 and finally start ARB&rsquo;s staggered unfreezing over the next four years. The first unlock is set almost a year after the $ARB token finally launched last March 2023.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Token Unlocks, after the initial March 16 unlock, more $ARB tokens will be unlocked every four weeks for the next four years.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At present, over 5 billion ARB tokens remain locked. Staggered unfreezing is a way to ensure that investors do not immediately sell the token in large quantities (thus drastically lowering the price so as to be completely worthless) and also to ensure that its stakeholders stay involved for a longer period.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The initially turbulent launch of the ARB token last March was somewhat remedied by its $120 million airdrop to DAOs. But ARB is currently on the decline partly because of security issues plaguing the still relatively-new platform. Just last July, Rodeo Finance suffered a significant $1.5 million blow when a code vulnerability was exploited. Last June, Chibi Finance executed a rug pull that stole approximately $1 million worth of tokens from users. The disturbing fact is that these were not the only incidents of some form of exploit in the Arbitrum platform. They highlight the pressing need for security measures in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Still, according to DefiLlama, Arbitrum is the fourth biggest protocol as of writing, with $1.88 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL). ARB on the other hand is currently trading at $1.09 according to Coingecko, down from $1.3 last July. Investors and traders should remain vigilant for developments in the protocol as the unlock date nears.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered additional bearish momentum early in the Asian session as the pair continued to establish lower highs, increasing the risk that bears will test the 28306.11 area.&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 30222 area, right around the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 24750 to 31862.21.&nbsp; Additional downside pressure ramped up near the 29709 area, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31862.21.&nbsp; Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a shift in investor appetite, the cryptocurrency community is witnessing a phenomenon that might reshape the Web3 ecosystem for good. Ethereum (ETH), the blockchain synonymous with decentralized applications and smart contracts, is now facing a bold contender, Borroe ($ROE), as the top 10 addresses control over 36% of Ethereum supply.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Circle as Borroe ($ROE) Presale Makes Waves
<p>Borroe Finance is an artificial intelligence, blockchain, and smart contracts-powered NFT marketplace that is rapidly reshaping the future of web3 financing. Borroe has a unique concept that merges cutting-edge technologies to solve real-world financial problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presale of $ROE continues, investors are grabbing the opportunity to be part of this game-changing project. The current Stage 1 offers $ROE tokens at a low price of $0.0125 per token. With six more stages to come and incremental price increases, early participants can join the Borroe revolution at a pivotal moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the web3 space continues to flourish, Borroe Finance is a testament to the power of innovation, teamwork, and the unwavering belief that a brighter financial future is within reach.</p>
<p>Borroe Finance boasts a roster of experts with deep-rooted experience in the financial, fintech, and blockchain sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael Price, the Chief Product Officer (CPO), brings over 25 years of leadership in the Financial Services domain, while Maxim Prishchepo, the Blockchain Lead, has an extensive background in blockchain technologies and crypto trading systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This powerhouse of visionaries is committed to revolutionizing how businesses access funding in the web3 era.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
$ROE: Powering the Borroe Revolution
<p>The $ROE token lies at the heart of Borroe Finance's transformative ecosystem. With a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens, $ROE operates on the Polygon (Ethereum sidechain) network, offering rapid transfers and scalability while maintaining the structural integrity of the Ethereum Mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the governance and utility token of the Borroe Ecosystem, $ROE grants holders many benefits, including priority notifications, discounted fees, access to premium features, rewards, and the power to shape the future of the Borroe marketplace through governance membership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a clear and innovative tokenomics structure, $ROE fuels Borroe's revolution and empowers investors to actively participate in shaping the web3 financing landscape.</p>
<p>A Point of Entry in a New Financial Frontier</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain, Borroe allows businesses to mint non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing future recurring revenues, all in exchange for immediate funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This innovative approach ensures a faster, more efficient way for businesses to secure the capital they need to thrive in the rapidly evolving web3 landscape. The brilliance of Borroe's AI-driven risk assessment is that it automates the entire process, reducing the need for cumbersome paperwork and lengthy approval timelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, Borroe Finance provides a seamless experience for both sellers and buyers, making it a game-changer in web3 financing. Borroe's smart contract has undergone a thorough audit by BlockAudit, a top-tier auditing firm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This stamp of approval demonstrates Borroe's commitment to security and reassures investors of the platform's reliability and integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transparency extends to the smart contract address, which is live and available for scrutiny. This level of openness is a testament to Borroe's dedication to building trust within the community and ensuring that investors can confidently participate in the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its approach of seeking regulation where possible and adhering to best practices showcases a responsible approach to growth. By bridging the gap between traditional financial models and the web3 landscape, Borroe Finance has created a unique entry point for investors seeking opportunity and security.</p>
<p>Shifting Tides: Ethereum's Evolution Sparks Interest in $ROE</p>
<p>While Ethereum (ETH) has long been a staple in the crypto realm, recent developments in its Proof-of-Stake transition have stirred uncertainty within its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Santiment recently reported that Ethereum's top 10 addresses now control over 34% of the total supply. This highlights a potential centralization of ownership and influence within Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reacting to the update, savvy investors are turning their attention to Borroe Finance, an entire presale. The appeal lies in the unique opportunity Borroe presents, a marketplace that seamlessly marries AI, NFTs, and blockchain technology to reinvent web3 financing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the $ROE presale gains traction, investors recognize Borroe as more of a move towards a novel financial frontier, drawing attention away from the uncertainties surrounding Ethereum and taking advantage of a revolutionary platform promising outsized returns.</p>
<p>Investors are catching on to this trend, loading up on $ROE tokens in the presale. Analysts predict that $ROE is poised for a massive rally, with potential gains of 100X even amid the current market conditions. The market sentiment speaks volumes about investors' confidence in Borroe's vision and execution.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sei Labs has just announced the launch of its Mainnet beta platform, seeking to facilitate the mass adoption of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Sei Foundation Announces Mainnet Launch
<p>Open-sourced tech firm behind the Sei blockchain, Sei Labs, has just announced a significant milestone in its journey toward revolutionizing the digital asset landscape. Following a successful Testnet alpha phase that witnessed an impressive 400 million transactions and the creation of 7.5 million unique testnet wallets, Sei Labs has officially launched the Sei Mainnet beta phase.</p>
<p>The team tweeted the announcement on X,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This marks the beginning of an long voyage, transitioning web2 experiences to web3 applications, with lightning fast time to finality&hellip;The Sei Foundation looks forward to seeing the exciting new applications built using Sei's infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mainnet beta phase's core mission is to undergo refinement through active community engagement and to seamlessly accommodate industry growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, Sei isn't just limiting its impact to decentralized finance (DeFi) but extends its prowess to any sector requiring trading, including gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
Scaling to Address Current Challenges
<p>As regulatory scrutiny mounts on centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized applications face the imperative of handling increased on-chain volume. Sei is seeking to provide a timely solution to the scalability challenges plaguing existing Layer 1 and Layer 2 infrastructures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platform had taken a multi-faceted approach to decentralization, scalability, and capital efficiency, combined with geographical node diversification, to strengthen its resilience against potential network disruptions.</p>
<p>Sei Labs' co-founder Jeff Feng encapsulates the mission succinctly:</p>

<p>"Current Web 3 infrastructure is unscalable, congested, and still too slow. Sei is designed to let apps and other projects scale in a way that no other blockchain can, while also maintaining a user-friendly experience."&nbsp;</p>

Sei&rsquo;s Performance Optimization
<p>The platform has reported some unprecedented speed, with impressive time to finality clocking in at a mere 250ms, which is further enhanced by a 100ms buffer to ensure protocol stability. This speed is fortified by built-in parallelization, further optimizing its performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sei also introduces groundbreaking consensus research innovations, notably the Twin-Turbo consensus, propelling it to previously unattained performance milestones.</p>
Focusing On Holistic User Experience
<p>With the Mainnet's unveiling, the Sei team has revealed that over 200 teams are actively constructing on the Sei network, and over 7.5 million unique wallets have already emerged, generating a staggering 400 million testnet transactions.</p>
<p>Launch day witnesses the introduction of 30 live applications, with more slated for H2 2023, including the much-anticipated decentralized perpetual futures exchange by Sushiswap.</p>
<p>As Sei Labs co-founder Jay Jog pointed out,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The fundamental use case for blockchains is the ability to exchange digital assets. Trading is universally important for all Web3 applications, not just DeFi. It includes social platforms, gaming economies, NFT marketplaces, and more. Exchange applications such as NFT marketplaces or gaming economies will offer the best user experience by building on Sei."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) has made a strategic investment in MoneyGram International, which resulted in obtaining a coveted seat on the firm&rsquo;s Board of Directors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Building On A Strong Partnership
<p>The Stellar Development Foundation, responsible for expanding the Stellar network, announced a substantial investment in MoneyGram, a key player in the money transfer sector. This decision builds upon their existing commercial partnership, which was established two years ago. Although the SDF established a commercial partnership with MoneyGram in 2021, the two have collaborated on tools and technology since 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, MoneyGram joined forces with SDF to enable cryptocurrency payments and to introduce a cash-to-crypto service. Late last year, the payments firm announced plans to enable users to buy, sell, and hold crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
Strategic Investment from SDF
<p>Denelle Dixon, the CEO and Executive Director of SDF, clarified in a recent blog post that the investment was made from the SDF's cash treasury, distinct from the Enterprise Fund, which typically supports startups and early-stage companies. This marks the first instance of such an investment being drawn from SDF's treasury. Dixon emphasized that this strategic move aligns with SDF&rsquo;s core mission and is a testament to MoneyGram's commitment to digital evolution.</p>
A Leap Towards Digital Advancement
<p>This investment is expected to bring about substantial benefits for both parties involved. MoneyGram, a prominent player in global financial technology, is set to expand its digital reach with the support of SDF's investment. Moreover, this collaboration will pave the way for the exploration of blockchain technology in the realm of money transfers.</p>
<p>Dixon highlighted the significance of this partnership by stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most importantly, it signifies a rededication from MGI, one of the world&rsquo;s leading global financial technology, to becoming a digital-forward leader in fintech.&rdquo;</p>

Gaining a Seat at the Table
<p>The most noteworthy outcome of this investment is SDF securing a seat on MoneyGram's Board of Directors. This move not only solidifies their partnership but also positions SDF to actively contribute to MoneyGram's strategic decisions and digital business expansion.</p>
<p>Although the exact amount of the investment remains undisclosed, Dixon affirmed that this collaboration underscores SDF's commitment to bridging the gap and democratizing access to financial services.</p>
<p>In her own words,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Continuing to build strong partnerships with organizations across the payments space puts SDF one step closer to achieving our mission of creating equitable access to financial services."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>From October 1st onwards, PayPal will temporarily halt its cryptocurrency sales in the United Kingdom. This decision can be attributed to the shifting regulatory environment in the UK.</p>
<p>The underlying motive behind this suspension appears to be twofold. Firstly, it underscores PayPal&rsquo;s commitment to adhering strictly to local regulations. By suspending sales temporarily, the company is ensuring that it remains in compliance with the UK's dynamic regulatory framework on cryptocurrency transactions. This move demonstrates a precautionary measure to prevent any potential regulatory discord.</p>
<p>Secondly, the pause can be seen as a measure to safeguard users. As the UK refines its stance on crypto activities, there might be potential uncertainties and implications for users. By taking this proactive step, PayPal aims to shield its clientele from potential pitfalls and uncertainties until the regulatory landscape is clearer.</p>
<p>A significant driver behind these changes in the UK is the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The body has been proactive, focusing on establishing clearer guidelines and stricter regulations for cryptocurrency operations. The Authority&rsquo;s stated goal is to bring clarity to the sector, protect investors, and mitigate the inherent risks associated with digital assets.</p>
<p>In the US, PayPal has a lot more challenges on its plate. The recent supervisory letter issued by the Federal Reserve was a warning to banks that are doing business with crypto companies, or who are thinking of such a move. The letter reminds the banks of exactly what their due diligence entails, and adds that all Federal Reserve controlled banks must first gain permission from the Fed before engaging with any crypto-related entity.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The path to government control with central bank digital currencies is becoming clearer as cash is being stealthily removed by banks.</p>
ESG is the excuse
<p>Despite government saying that cash will be around for a very long time yet, steps are being taken to broaden our &ldquo;cashless society&rdquo;, as bank branches close and ATMs are being taken away.</p>
<p>So how are banks managing to get away with this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are seizing on the Environmental, Social, and Governance narrative (ESG) which has become de rigueur in Western society, and which has become a rallying cry for governments and big business looking to shut down anyone and anything that doesn&rsquo;t fit with their ideals.</p>
<p>For example, if someone goes to their local bank branch or ATM to withdraw cash it is being stated by banks that they are emitting carbon in their movement. The fact that if they weren&rsquo;t going to the bank they would be going somewhere else and still would be emitting carbon isn&rsquo;t discussed.</p>
<p>In addition the banks say that ATMs use a lot of electricity, plus if someone is making a deposit or withdrawing cash someone in the branch has to deal with this, thereby adding to more electricity and carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Is this all just nonsense, and is all this being used to justify the banks&rsquo; desire to eventually remove cash from society?</p>
NatWest sets cash limits
<p>NatWest, one of the biggest banks in the UK, coming under the umbrella of the Royal Bank of Scotland, which owns Coutts (Nigel Farage scandal), and other banks, has recently decided to give itself the right to set limits on customers&rsquo; deposits and withdrawals.</p>
<p>The bank hasn&rsquo;t yet said how much these limits will be, but Neil McCoy Ward who has a YouTube channel with 413,000 subscribers is surmising that the daily limit could be &pound;250. The limit is set to be imposed on September 11.</p>
Banks are closing all exits
<p>Banks are currently under a lot of pressure, not just in the UK but around the world. Three major banks have collapsed in the US, and Credit Suisse was recently taken over by UBS in Europe. If it were not for the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank the contagion would very likely have brought down the entire global banking system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments must know how shaky the fiat monetary system has become and therefore it appears they are giving banks carte blanche to do everything they can to stop customers from moving their funds.</p>
<p>Citizens are forced to own bank accounts if they want to be able to pay their bills etc. However, banks no longer provide any kind of service that would make up for customers&rsquo; depreciation of purchasing power, inflation, and the possibility that their bank might fail and decide to bail them in.</p>
<p>Central planners are starting to close all the exits from the fiat monetary system at the same time as banks increase their power and control over customers. Bitcoin is completely outside of this dystopian nightmare. The world&rsquo;s citizens may want to investigate this option before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee are demanding that SEC Chair Gary Gensler explain how Prometheum got approval from the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawmakers have petitioned both financial regulators for more information regarding the company&rsquo;s registration status.&nbsp;</p>
Republicans Demand Answers&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers on the Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Patrick McHenry, have questioned how the previously unknown entity was able to beat other, more established entities to obtain approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer for crypto. The members have directed their inquiries to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a letter signed by 23 House Financial Services Lawmakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several questions have been raised regarding the context of Prometheum&rsquo;s approval, especially since the approval came shortly after a joint hearing held by the House Financial Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on digital assets. The letter stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

A Play By Gensler?&nbsp;
<p>The letter has also flagged serious concerns about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission put Prometheum up as a poster firm to shore up SEC Chair Cary Gensler&rsquo;s argument that no new laws were required to regulate the crypto space in the United States. The approval comes just before McHenry&rsquo;s committee is about to send the digital assets legislation to the house floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Prometheum executives have insisted there is nothing to be surprised about regarding the approval. They added that they followed the registration process step-by-step, just like other firms looking for approval. Prometheum&rsquo;s co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, has also insisted that the firm would go about demonstrating the right way to build a crypto platform that is also fully compliant with current laws and regulations. In response to the letter, the company released a statement, responding,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws. This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.&rdquo;</p>

Lawmakers Wary Of Prometheum&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers are the latest to call for more information and an investigation into the sudden approval of Prometheum, a company that has not done any trading as yet. Several other Republican members of the Senate have called for greater scrutiny of the prevailing situation. Republican lawmaker Thomas Tuberville has alleged that the company may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated several US Securities Laws. Meanwhile, Democrat lawmaker Ritchie Torres has requested an investigation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p>
Prometheum&rsquo;s China Connection&nbsp;
<p>Prometheum has previously collaborated with the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain Inc. to develop a blockchain trading software, a point that has been noted by lawmakers. While the collaboration has been concluded, reports have highlighted the involvement of a Chinese firm during Prometheum&rsquo;s early days. According to several reports, a Chinese entity owns a portion of the company and even has a representative, Feng Ziao, as a director at Prometheum. Lawmakers have also pointed to the connection between Wanxiang and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which has led to significant concerns about national security and data privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kaplan&rsquo;s posts on social media have also garnered considerable attention. Kaplan&rsquo;s views closely align with that of the Securities and Exchange Commission and differ from those taken by crypto-space members. Kaplan has insisted that existing Federal Securities Laws are sufficient to regulate crypto. Kaplan and other top executives at Prometheum&rsquo;s connections with the Securities and Exchange Commission and FINRA have also been discussed.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee are demanding that SEC Chair Gary Gensler explain how Prometheum got approval from the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawmakers have petitioned both financial regulators for more information regarding the company&rsquo;s registration status.&nbsp;</p>
Republicans Demand Answers&nbsp;
<p>The Republican lawmakers on the Financial Services Committee, led by Chairman Patrick McHenry, have questioned how the previously unknown entity was able to beat other, more established entities to obtain approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a broker-dealer for crypto. The members have directed their inquiries to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a letter signed by 23 House Financial Services Lawmakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several questions have been raised regarding the context of Prometheum&rsquo;s approval, especially since the approval came shortly after a joint hearing held by the House Financial Committee and the House Agriculture Committee on digital assets. The letter stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The timing of the approval raises concerns that it was aimed at demonstrating that legislation is not needed because there is a workable regulatory framework for the custody of digital asset securities.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

A Play By Gensler?&nbsp;
<p>The letter has also flagged serious concerns about whether the Securities and Exchange Commission put Prometheum up as a poster firm to shore up SEC Chair Cary Gensler&rsquo;s argument that no new laws were required to regulate the crypto space in the United States. The approval comes just before McHenry&rsquo;s committee is about to send the digital assets legislation to the house floor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Prometheum executives have insisted there is nothing to be surprised about regarding the approval. They added that they followed the registration process step-by-step, just like other firms looking for approval. Prometheum&rsquo;s co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, has also insisted that the firm would go about demonstrating the right way to build a crypto platform that is also fully compliant with current laws and regulations. In response to the letter, the company released a statement, responding,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prometheum purpose-built its technology with the goal to develop a market infrastructure for digital asset securities that is compliant with the federal securities laws. This technology will serve as a building block for a compliant and orderly digital asset securities marketplace that protects investors and serves their best interests.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>GSR, the oldest market maker in the crypto space, is feeling the full impact of the ongoing bear market, with multiple top executives, including the CFO, departing the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company had also announced a staff cut in October 2022, terming them as a part of &ldquo;structural changes&rdquo; in the organization.&nbsp;</p>
Top Executives Depart&nbsp;
<p>As crypto&rsquo;s largest market maker retreats in the face of the bear market onslaught, several high-level executives, including C-level and department heads, are headed toward the exit. According to sources, the retrenchment is having a major impact on one of the industry&rsquo;s oldest and best-known players and one that is extremely prominent in the US markets. The most recent and maybe the most high-profile departure from the firm is its Chief Financial Officer, Jonathan Hugh. Hugh joined GSR in 2021 and played a pivotal role in building the company&rsquo;s finance function. Hugh has so far not commented on his departure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other high-level executives leaving the company include GSR&rsquo;s Global Head of Product, Benoit Bosc, and its Director of Trading Operations, Aman Bhalla. Bosc had taken over the sales role from Michael Bressler, a highly experienced TradeFi executive from JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. Bressler had joined GSR in 2021, becoming the company&rsquo;s sales head in 2021. However, Bressler left the firm in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
Other Notable Departures&nbsp;
<p>Other notable departures from the company include Jake Dwyer. Dwyer had joined the firm in 2021 and was tasked with leading GSR&rsquo;s DeFi and venture initiatives. Trader Quentin Dubois and the head of Quant Trading, Romain Bernard, have also exited the company, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Director of Business Development at GSR, Jeff Stern, has also left the organization. All of these departures occurred this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Dwyer confirmed his departure from GSR, the others, including Bhalla, Bosc, Vince, Barnard, and Dubois, have not commented on the matter. A spokesperson from GSR commented on the matter, stating that the company will look to evolve with the fast-moving crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;GSR has been at the center of crypto markets for ten years &mdash; markets that are fast-moving and volatile. We owe it to our clients to continue adapting and evolving to keep pace with the speed of crypto, and we will continue to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The spokesperson also confirmed the departures of Bosc and Bhalla. However, they added that they will continue in their respective roles until the end of August and ensure a smooth transition of their respective roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our business operations and strategy have naturally evolved to respond to changing market conditions, but there has been no restructuring.&rdquo;</p>

Crypto Winter Takes Its Toll&nbsp;
<p>GSR had laid off around 10% of its workforce in October 2022, adding that the layoffs were part of structural changes. In doing so, the company became the latest in a long line of crypto firms that had to curtail their growth and ambitions in the face of a crippling crypto winter. Companies and exchanges operating have sanctioned a wave of layoffs as they look to navigate the crypto bear market. The firm had undertaken an aggressive expansion drive, growing its workforce to over 200 and reaching a peak of 300 before the layoffs took place. A source familiar with the firm and its operations stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The executive team is mostly friends, and I think it threw off a lot of the momentum GSR built in the previous cycle. They hired a lot of corporate Wall Street executives that came in at the top of the bull market, which ended up costing the firm dearly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Most of the c-suite executives have links with Winton, CEO Jacob Palmstierna&rsquo;s former employer, or Goldman Sachs, the former employer of Rich Rosenblum and Cristian Gil. Staff at GSR believes that the firm got too big too soon and the team needs to be better streamlined. A GSR spokesperson stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;While last year&rsquo;s bear market created challenges for all crypto companies, our long-term belief in the space hasn&rsquo;t changed. We have continued investing and hiring in high-conviction areas and have maintained a world-class team of TradFi and DeFi talent that is uniquely positioned for another decade of growth.&rdquo;</p>

Scaling Back US Operations&nbsp;
<p>The firm is also focusing on scaling back its US operations. Multiple sources have attributed the retreat to a combination of a number of factors. These include a decreasing appetite for token listings, a high cost of talent acquisition, and concerns around regulations. According to a source, the company has also moved from its New York office, taking up a space in Jersey City instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At one point, it was probably their largest office, and they have been scaling it down meaningfully. They have given up their New York office and have a smaller space in Jersey City.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto media outlet CoinDesk has cut its editorial staff by 45% as its parent company DCG prepares to introduce strategic investors. </p>
<p>Rumours that DCG is negotiating a sale of its crypto media outlet CoinDesk have been circulating for a while. Reports by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) claim that the crypto conglomerate was reportedly finalizing a $125 million deal to sell a portion of the company. DCG would reportedly retain a stake in the company.</p>
CoinDesk Announced Staff Cuts
<p>Reports by crypto news outlet The Block claim that CoinDesk let go of 45% of its editorial staff as its parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG), prepares for a partial sale of the company. DCG purchased CoinDesk in 2016 for $500,000. The company was established in 2013.</p>
<p>In an internal memo viewed by The Block, the firm was soon to have an &ldquo;all-hands&rdquo; meeting to discuss the layoffs.</p>
<p>In an email, Kevin Worth, CoinDesk CEO, told staff:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The purpose of the meeting is to inform everyone that today several roles, predominantly in our media team, were impacted by a reduction in force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an incredibly difficult message to send to everyone over email and yet I also wanted everyone at CoinDesk to know as soon as possible what is happening today. This was a required step to ensure a financially sound business moving forward and to set us on the path to close the deal to sell CoinDesk Inc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to The Block&rsquo;s report, which cites someone familiar with the matter, CoinDesk would let go of 45% of its editorial team or 20 people.</p>
DCG Will Retain a Stake in CoinDesk
<p>CoinDesk recently appointed financial advisers to &ldquo;help bring on new institutional and strategic investors&rdquo; alongside its parent company. DCG has faced severe pressure from crypto exchange Gemini over a dispute involving the &ldquo;Earn&rdquo; program. In July, Gemini announced that it had filed a lawsuit against DCG.</p>
<p>The reports from the WSJ indicated CoinDesk was in the final stages of a partial sale of the company to a crypto syndicate led by crypto investor Matthew Roszak of Tally Capital. As part of the $125 million deal, DCG would retain a share of CoinDesk.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase has announced its official entry into the Canadian market in a strategic move that involved the integration of Interac payment rails.&nbsp;</p>
Expanding Horizons: Canada as a Crypto Hub
<p>On Monday, Coinbase executives Nana Murugesan and newly-appointed Lucas Matheson penned a joint announcement declaring Coinbase's decision to venture into Canada's crypto landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The statement also addressed the various factors why Canada was chosen as the next Coinbase outpost, calling it the world's third-most crypto-aware nation, with a thriving local tech ecosystem that firmly positions it as a potential global leader in the crypto-economy. The duo pulled up the Ontario Securities Commission's survey highlights, which revealed that over 30% of Canadians are gearing up to explore crypto assets within the year.</p>
Pioneering Innovations for Canadians
<p>According to the statement, Coinbase will be presenting a slew of innovative offerings to cater to the Canadian market. The integration of Interac payment rails takes center stage as it would enable Canadian users to effortlessly deposit and withdraw funds (CAD) to and from their Coinbase wallets in an attempt to make the crypto experience more accessible to Canadians.</p>
<p>They also revealed the launch of Coinbase One, which is being touted to feature benefits like a 30-day trial period, zero trading fees, enhanced staking rewards, and priority support.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Appoints New Canada Director
<p>In March 2023, Coinbase appointed Lucas Matheson as the Country Director for Canada. Matheson, who has experience leading operation and financial teams, will be focusing on Coinbase&rsquo;s offerings for Canadians by working with partners, government, and regulators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the regulatory front, the company has also signed an Enhanced Pre-Registration Undertaking in order to highlight its dedication to regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firm has almost 200 full-time employees at the Canadian tech hub, thus making the most of local talent and fostering a user-centric platform tailored to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Other Crypto Firms In Canada
<p>Other leading crypto firms have also turned to Canada, especially in the wake of growing regulatory uncertainty in the United States. Crypto exchange Kraken has demonstrated its commitment to Canada's financial sector by signing a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) with the Ontario Securities Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a few of them, like Binance and ByBit, have had to wrap up their Canada operations, citing an unfavorable regulatory climate in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, Coinbase's official launch in Canada, backed by Interac payment integration, Coinbase One, and a strong commitment to local engagement, ushers in a new chapter in Canada's crypto journey. This move is a testament to Coinbase's unwavering dedication to fostering financial empowerment through innovative crypto solutions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon and Solana are two of DeFi&rsquo;s most popular altcoins. In 2023, both projects have grown their ecosystems, with Solana taking a slight lead over Polygon in terms of market cap. Now, however, a new cryptocurrency could outperform both.</p>
<p>Everlodge is a new DeFi project set to release in 2023. It has revolutionary utility and could offer returns of 280% during its presale. Here&rsquo;s why analysts are choosing Everlodge over Polygon and Solana.</p>
<p class="s6">Find Out How To Buy Everlodge (ELDG)</p>
Everlodge Brings Travel Properties To Web3 
<p>Everlodge is a DeFi property marketplace designed for luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels. Its marketplace lets individuals buy, sell and invest in fractional real estate on the blockchain. To achieve this, a property is minted into an NFT and fractionalized.</p>
<p>For example, A $2 million luxury villa in Spain could be fractionalized into 20 fragments. Each can then be purchased or sold for $200,000, reducing the amount an investor needs for their investment.</p>
<p>Everlodge will also offer a launchpad designed for property developers. This launchpad will let developers raise capital from the Everlodge community to kick-start developments. Investors will then profit from getting involved in developments early to maximize their returns.</p>
<p>In addition to its launchpad and property marketplace, Everlodge will offer an exclusive rewards club. As part of the rewards club, investors will earn free nightly stays across properties throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. Several tiers will be available and will determine the properties and number of stays an individual gets. Members aren&rsquo;t obliged to use this timehowever. Instead, it can be sold on third-party platforms such as Airbnb to generate another income source.</p>
<p>Investors who co-own properties will be able to use their NFT as collateral to obtain other short term loans. This will give them access to more capital to quickly scale their property portfolio.</p>
<p>ELDG tokens will be used throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. They will grant holders a number of benefits such as staking bonuses, discounts on property and free stays at properties. Tokens will start at $0.01 when the Everlodge presale begins, and are expected to hit $0.035 before tokens are launched on mainstream exchanges.</p>
Experts Predict That Solana Will Pass $30 
<p>Solana&rsquo;s total value locked has consistently increased since the start of 2023. Over the last month, Solana&rsquo;s TVL has stayed above $1 billion. This indicates that confidence in Solana is starting to build following the project's crash in June.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Solana&rsquo;s value has also increased. In the last 30 days, Solana has increased in value by 22.44%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.59. Given its steady increase, experts believe that Solana will pass $30 in August.</p>
Confidence In Polygon Remains High Despite POL Proposal
<p>Polygon&rsquo;s price increases slowed over the last week after Polygon founders proposed an upgrade to Polygon's native token. This proposal has caused Polygon to decrease in value by 2.24%, andcreated confusion throughout the Polygon community.</p>
<p>The development team has proposed replacing MATIC tokens with POL. This new token would be used throughout the Polygon network, though investors are questioning why the upgrade needs to be made.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, confidence in Polygon continues to rise. PancakeSwap recently launched its v3 on the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta, which is a huge win for the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>Currently trading at $0.6897, analysts believe that Polygon will increase to $1 by the end of the year. Despite this increase, experts still predict that Everlodge will be a more profitable investment.</p>
