The justice system provides the presumption of innocence unless proven otherwise,&#8221; he stressed. O&#8217;Leary also denied the accusation by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) that he perjured himself in a U.S. Senate hearing over why FTX failed.</strong></p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary on FTX&#8217;s Collapse</h2>
<p>Shark Tank star Kevin O&#8217;Leary defended his position as a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-ftx-paid-him-15-million-to-become-a-spokesperson-for-the-exchange/">spokesperson</a> for the collapsed crypto exchange FTX in an interview with CNBC Friday. He also commented on Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) calling him a liar.</p>
<p>When asked why he did not stridently condemn former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), O&#8217;Leary replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is America. The justice system provides the presumption of innocence unless proven otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former FTX executive was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> in the Bahamas last week. The U.S. government and several regulators have filed a number of fraud <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charges</a> against him and his crypto exchange. O&#8217;Leary was FTX&#8217;s spokesperson and an investor in the exchange when it collapsed. The company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-ftx-paid-him-15-million-to-become-a-spokesperson-for-the-exchange/">paid</a> him about $15 million to become its spokesperson, which the Shark Tank star said was lost when the exchange filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>When asked, &#8220;Are you still conflating money you got paid by FTX that you lost, or did you actually invest some of your own funds?&#8221; the Shark Tank star replied: &#8220;Money is fungible.&#8221; CNBC&#8217;s Joe Kernen then noted: &#8220;So you didn&#8217;t. Once again, you&#8217;re a venture investor who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-ftx-paid-him-15-million-to-become-a-spokesperson-for-the-exchange/">ventured your name</a> &#8230; You didn&#8217;t even pay your own money on the taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Leary was then asked by Andrew Ross Sorkin: &#8220;What do you think happened? Do you believe this was a fraud?&#8221; Emphasizing that he doesn&#8217;t &#8220;have the facts&#8221; and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ceo-says-ftx-is-the-worst-case-of-corporate-failure-with-untrustworthy-financial-data-and-unacceptable-practices/">new FTX CEO</a> also &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have them yet,&#8221; Mr. Wonderful replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m looking for my records. I&#8217;m willing to fund a forensic audit of our accounts. I&#8217;d like to know what happened, obviously. There&#8217;s a lot of bad things that have been alleged here. No question about it. Some of them are going to be true, likely, because there is no money there. Somewhere the cash is gone.</p></blockquote>

<h2>O&#8217;Leary Responds to Binance CEO CZ&#8217;s Accusation</h2>
<p>Following O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s testimony before the Senate Banking Committee stating that he believes FTX failed because rival crypto exchange Binance intentionally <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-tells-us-lawmakers-ftx-failed-because-binance-intentionally-killed-it/">put it out of business</a>, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) called the Shark Tank star a liar.</p>
<p>Mr. Wonderful stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, on the air, CZ called me a liar. Then he suggested I perjured myself in front of the U.S. Senate for 2 hours this week. I can assure you that&#8217;s not the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Another little parable here you should understand,&#8221; O&#8217;Leary continued. He proceeded to explain that his birth father was Irish, adding that when he was young, his father told him: &#8220;Son, never call an Irishman a liar, unless you know with certainty that it&#8217;s true.&#8221; The Shark Tank star then asked his father: &#8220;Why is that dad?&#8221; His father replied: &#8220;Because the Irish are crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Referring to CZ&#8217;s accusation, Mr. Wonderful emphasized, &#8220;I&#8217;m not happy about this,&#8221; adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the end of the day I have no ill will towards this guy, but he&#8217;s part of the story too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before FTX collapsed, O&#8217;Leary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-how-he-almost-secured-8-billion-to-rescue-ftx-before-it-collapsed/">almost secured</a> $8 billion to save the crypto exchange from having to file for bankruptcy. He said that Bankman-Fried is one of the best traders in the crypto space and he will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-slammed-for-saying-hed-back-former-ftx-ceo-again-insists-sbf-is-a-brilliant-crypto-trader/">back the FTX co-founder again</a> if he has another venture.</p>

<h2>Federal Prosecutors Investigate Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Political Donations</h2>
<p>The United States District Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York has reportedly begun an investigation into illegal campaign contributions from Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) and two other former FTX executives.</p>
<p>Following Bankman-Fried&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrest</a> in the Bahamas last week, the District Attorney&#8217;s Office sent an email to a few Democratic political organizations, including the party&#8217;s official campaign offices, a few of its major PACs, and the individual campaigns of some politicians, including Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY).</p>
<p>The email asks for any information about donations from SBF, his colleagues, and companies, the New York Times reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the request. Referring to the FTX case as &#8220;the biggest campaign finance scandals in years,&#8221; the publication noted that the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiries &#8220;appear to be an effort to gather evidence against Mr. Bankman-Fried and other former FTX executives, rather than against their political beneficiaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a press conference announcing the indictment of Bankman-Fried Tuesday, U.S. District Attorney Damian Williams requested:</p>
<blockquote><p>To any person, entity or political campaign that has received stolen customer money, we ask that you work with us to return that money to the innocent victims.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the official charges federal prosecutors unveiled last week after SBF&#8217;s arrest was conspiring to violate campaign finance laws. The former FTX CEO was 2020&#8217;s second-largest campaign donor, contributing nearly $45 million, mostly to Democratic campaigns and committees, the publication conveyed. In an interview before his arrest, Bankman-Fried claimed that he made <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-interview-reveals-dark-donations-to-republicans-ftxs-poorly-labeled-accounting/">dark donations</a> of a similar amount to the Republicans. Tesla CEO and Twitter boss Elon Musk believes that the former FTX boss donated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-suspects-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-donated-over-1-billion-to-support-democrats/">over $1 billion to Democrats</a>.</p>
<p>Federal Election Commission regulations require donations to be returned if they are later determined to be illegal, even if the funds have already been spent and new money needs to be raised.</p>

<p>Nishad Singh, another former FTX executive, also donated nearly $9.7 million, mostly to Democratic candidates and groups, the news outlet noted. Prosecutors are also reportedly investigating donations to Republican campaigns and committees by Ryan Salame, another former FTX executive, who gave $24 million, primarily to Republican candidates and committees.</p>
<p>Karl J. Sandstrom, a former Federal Election Committee member and current Democrat campaign advisor, told the publication that the FTX case has the potential to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>The largest corporate conduit case we have had.</p></blockquote>
<p>FTX filed for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">bankruptcy</a> on Nov. 11 and an estimated one million customers and investors have lost billions of dollars in the collapse. The U.S. government and regulators have brought several <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">fraud charges</a> against the crypto firm and Bankman-Fried. The former FTX chief has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> and is now in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamas-corrections-commissioner-says-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried-is-in-good-spirits-in-the-prison-sick-bay/">prison</a> in the Bahamas; he is expected to agree to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried-plans-to-surrender-to-us-extradition-request/">extradition</a> to the U.S. this week.</p>

The two Stanford professors Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried have not been charged with any wrongdoing, but the current FTX CEO, John J. Ray III, recently told members of the U.S. Congress that Joseph Bankman and “the family certainly received payments” from FTX.</strong></p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Ethics-Obsessed Parents Face Scrutiny Over Their Alleged Ties With FTX Operations</h2>
<p>On Saturday, a report from Reuters detailed that the FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) will likely <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried-plans-to-surrender-to-us-extradition-request/">surrender</a> to a U.S. extradition request, after it was initially reported that SBF would fight extradition to the United States. <a href="https://youtu.be/OBOFWAAXoCI">Reports</a> detail that SBF’s parents, who are reportedly in The Bahamas supporting their son, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/bankman-fried-parents/index.html">face scrutiny</a> over how involved they were with FTX operations.</p>

<p>While speaking in front of the U.S. Congress about the FTX collapse, the current FTX CEO, John J. Ray III, was asked about SBF’s parents and whether or not Joseph Bankman was an employee. “He received payments,” the new CEO and FTX restructuring chief said. “The family certainly received payments.”</p>

<p>The FTX CEO’s statements in front of Congress follow the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamas-property-worth-121-million-acquired-by-ftx-sbfs-parents-report-unveils/">report</a> that alleged $121 million in Bahamian real estate was associated with SBF’s parents and FTX. One particular home was a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/01/sam-bankman-fried-parents-16-4m-bahamas-home-meant-for-ftx-staff/">$16.4 million house</a> purchased in SBF’s parents&#8217; name, but SBF detailed “it was intended to be the company’s property. I don’t know how that was papered in.” SBF’s parents’ spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The couple] never intended to and never believed they had any beneficial or economic ownership of the house.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fried and Bankman both teach law classes at Stanford University, and the news publication Puck recently published an <a href="https://puck.news/keeping-up-with-the-bankman-frieds/">article</a> that says SBF’s parents were obsessed with ethics. SBF, himself, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/business/dealbook/sam-bankman-fried-parents-net-worth.html">told</a> the New York Times (NYT) that his parents “bore no responsibility” for his affairs. Bankman had scheduled law classes to teach this month and he recently canceled his classes, while Fried recently resigned from super political action committee (PAC) Mind The Gap, a PAC she helped co-found in 2018.</p>

<p>According to the Wall Street Journal authors Justin Baer and Hardika Singh, a spokesperson for the family <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sam-bankman-frieds-parents-were-there-for-ftxs-rise-and-now-its-fall-11670841001">explained</a> that Bankman was paid by FTX for at least a year as he was working on charitable projects for the now-defunct crypto exchange. It has also been said that Bankman advised SBF before he spoke in front of the House Financial Services Committee on Dec. 8, 2021.</p>
<p>Reports also note that Bankman advised SBF on legal matters prior to the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing and his resignation. While it is currently unknown if SBF’s parents had been more involved with SBF’s business affairs, the family faces significant legal bills from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-founder-sbf-retains-white-collar-lawyer-who-represented-ghislaine-maxwell/">white-collar lawyer SBF hired</a>.</p>

During the last 2,016 blocks, Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate has been around 254.3 exahash per second (EH/s), and block intervals have been faster at 9:41 minutes per block.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Difficulty Expected to Jump 3% Higher on Dec. 19, Bitcoin Average Mining Costs Are Higher Than the Current Spot Market Value</h2>
<p>In roughly 24 hours, the Bitcoin network will experience another difficulty transition, and this time around it is estimated to increase. The increase is estimated to be around 3.2% to <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">3.76%</a> higher than the current 34.24 trillion value. The rise would lift the 34.24 trillion to around 35.53 trillion on or around Dec. 19, 2022.</p>
<p>Data shows that while the network&#x2019;s difficulty is increasing, <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">BTC&#x2019;s hashrate</a> has been lower than the month prior. Bitcoin&#x2019;s hashrate did tap a high of 316 EH/s on Dec. 1, 2022. The average block time or block interval is between <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">9:41 minutes</a> per block to roughly <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-confirmationtime.html#3y">10:43 minutes</a> per block.</p>

<p>The estimated 3% change is occurring after the last difficulty change which saw a reduction of around 7.32% on Dec. 5, at block height 766,080. The network&#x2019;s mining difficulty retarget on that day was the largest recorded decrease in 2022. If the estimated increase occurs on Dec. 19, 2022, roughly 3% of the most recent reduction will be erased making it more difficult for miners to find a <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block.</p>
<p>During the past three days, Foundry USA has been the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s top mining pool with 27.05% of the overall hashrate or 66.59 EH/s. Foundry is followed by Antpool (53.51 EH/s), F2pool (35.08 EH/s), Binance Pool (31.51 EH/s), and Viabtc (22 EH/s) respectively. 414 block rewards were discovered during the last three days and the top five aforementioned mining pools discovered 351 of those blocks.</p>
<p>On Dec. 17, <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">macromicro.me</a> stats show bitcoin average mining costs based on metrics from Cambridge University, indicating that the cost is around $19,806, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price on Dec. 18, is around $16,700 per bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Gemini Hopes to &#8216;Provide a Path for the Recovery of Funds&#8217; With Newly Created Creditors Committee and Houlihan Lokey Advisor</h2>
<p>On Dec. 17, 2022, Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1604206071161139200?s=20&amp;t=kpKHjvu4FiH2-mXVZSesvQ">tweeted</a> an update concerning the company’s Earn program. “Earn Update: Houlihan Lokey, the Financial Advisor of the Creditor Committee, has begun advocating for a plan to resolve the liquidity issues at Genesis and DCG and provide a path for the recovery of funds,” Winklevoss said.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/an-important-message-regarding-gemini-earn">paused</a> the Earn program on Nov. 16, 2022, and it cited the company’s lending partner Genesis Global Capital had also paused withdrawals. “We are working with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the Earn program as quickly as possible,” Gemini said at the time.</p>
<p>Genesis has suffered from the FTX contagion and a unit of the company was awarded a position on the official creditors committee for the FTX bankruptcy case. Reportedly, Genesis was also soliciting $1 billion in funding from investors, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-11-17-2022/card/crypto-lender-genesis-sought-emergency-loan-of-1-billion-by-monday-573TThK17Ke15FYwJzLR">according</a> to FT and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) sources. Winklevoss’s tweet on Saturday also noted that the committee is in the early stages.</p>
<p>“It is still early stages, and discussions are ongoing, however, we will update you as soon as more information is available,” Winklevoss <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1604206072851361792?s=20&amp;t=LYbKCsw0PG-uvgp5VqWsxw">said</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Gemini’s issues with Genesis, the company has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-crypto-exchange-gemini-suffers-from-data-breach-5-7-million-emails-allegedly-leaked/">suffered</a> from a database breach as well. Sources detailed that 5.7 million Gemini user emails and partially redacted phone numbers were leaked, and some <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-customer-data-leak-was-advertised-for-sale-on-hacker-forums-for-30-btc-in-september/">reports</a> noted that the files were published to hacker forums. <a href="https://hl.com">Houlihan Lokey</a> is a financial services company and independent investment bank that operates one of the largest financial restructuring practices worldwide.</p>

<h2>Trump NFTs Sell out, Cards Quadruple in Value on Opensea, Left-Leaning Political Commentators Are Outraged</h2>
<p>Donald Trump once said in 2019 that he was <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192?s=20&t=QowMMQ3JIToIblnJPKGg3g">not a fan of bitcoin (BTC)</a>, and today the former president has leveraged blockchain technology to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-launches-nft-card-collection-sweepstake-winners-could-dine-or-golf-with-the-45th-president/">release his NFT trading cards</a>. The <a href="https://collecttrumpcards.com/">collection</a> of 45,000 cards features images of Trump dressed as Superman, an astronaut, a cowboy, and many other designs. However, there&#x2019;s been <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1604219443529351171?s=20&t=M9ex1Q0-nmYcej3vI1VShA">accusations</a> that the team behind Trump&#x2019;s NFTs used stock images from Shutterstock and left the Shutterstock watermarks on the NFT photos.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Half the people mocking Trump for selling NFTs today were silent when he was selling out our nation&#x2019;s future through record inflation.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Despite the claims, Trump&#x2019;s NFT cards have been very popular and during the last 24 hours, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">cryptoslam.io stats</a> show Trump&#x2019;s collection is the second-largest in sales behind Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Trump NFT sales increased by 50.19% during the past 24 hours and there&#x2019;s been $3,597,251 in sales. The $3.5 million in sales was across 4,749 transactions and 1,839 buyers and 2,155 sellers.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On Opensea, the <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards?search%5BsortAscending%5D=true&search%5BsortBy%5D=UNIT_PRICE">current floor value</a> for Trump&#x2019;s NFT cards is around .49 ether or $578, which is more than 4x larger than the original $99 price when the sale launched. There&#x2019;s roughly 15,811 Trump NFT owners and 35% are unique owners, according to Opensea metrics on Dec. 18, 2022. <a href="https://opensea.io/0xfb65415Ca83B69DA9bC56B4C9C2334fa402baCd7/trump-digital-trading-cards?tab=collected">One user</a> owns approximately 1,000 Trump NFT cards and is the largest holder of the entire collection. Some people <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTherder/status/1604099659382784000?s=20&t=8SaLOatNZTYywyu7-s5hyg">have claimed</a> the unknown Trump NFT owner with 1,000 cards is Donald Trump himself.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Of course, Trump&#x2019;s NFT trading cards caused an outcry from left-leaning political pundits since the 45th U.S. president made his announcement. Current U.S. president Joe Biden mocked Trump in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1603455603606798378?s=20&t=8SaLOatNZTYywyu7-s5hyg">tweet</a> that says Biden &#x201C;had some MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENTS the last couple of weeks,&#x201D; using all capital letters like Trump. The left-leaning political commentator Lindy Li made fun of Trump&#x2019;s NFT announcement as well, when she <a href="https://twitter.com/lindyli/status/1603491919195168777?s=20&t=8SaLOatNZTYywyu7-s5hyg">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trump&#x2019;s big announcement is that he&#x2019;s selling NFTs. Melania&#x2019;s big announcement was that she was selling a $185,000 NFT. Ivanka&#x2019;s big announcement was to promote Goya beans. Don Jr&#x2019;s big announcement was to sell $500 cameos. The most pathetic family to ever occupy the White House.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other proponents of the left, like former New York Times (NYT) author, Kurt Eichenwald, tried to expose Trump&#x2019;s NFT venture. Eichenwald published a <a href="https://threats.substack.com/p/trumps-trading-card-grift-is-worse">blog post</a> on his Substack that claims &#x201C;Trump&#x2019;s trading card grift is worse than you think.&#x201D; Eichenwald found that shell companies are associated with a company called NFT International LLC. The former NYT columnist also linked the firm to some people with negative reputations but in the end, Eichenwald concludes that &#x201C;none of this means that NFT International is crooked.&#x201D;</p>

The fake cryptocurrency’s “global master distributor” has been in custody since 2018 when he was arrested in Thailand and extradited to the United States.</strong></p>
<h2>Cryptoqueen’s Partner at Onecoin Admits Role in Multimillion-Dollar Fraud</h2>
<p>Co-founder of Onecoin Karl Sebastian Greenwood pled guilty in Manhattan federal court to wire fraud and money laundering charges on Friday. As a result of misrepresentations made by him, the Ponzi scheme’s mastermind, ‘Cryptoqueen’ Ruja Ignatova, and others, victims from around the world, including the U.S., invested billions of dollars into the fraudulent platform.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/co-founder-multi-billion-dollar-cryptocurrency-pyramid-scheme-onecoin-pleads-guilty" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams pointed out that Greenwood, Ignatova and their co-conspirators ran Onecoin and claimed that a purported cryptocurrency with the same name would be the ‘Bitcoin killer.’ In reality, it was worthless, was never mined or based on blockchain, and its price was not determined by the market but set manually.</p>
<p>Greenwood, a citizen of Sweden and the United Kingdom, and Bulgarian-born German national Ignatova founded Onecoin in 2014. It operated as a global multi-level-marketing (MLM) network, the members of which were paid commissions for recruiting others. According to Onecoin’s promotional materials and records, over 3 million people invested more than $4 billion by the end of 2016.</p>
<h2>Greenwood’s Sentencing Scheduled for April Next Year</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptoqueen-ruja-ignatova-tipped-off-about-onecoin-investigations-before-she-vanished-report/">Ignatova</a>, who disappeared from the public eye in late 2017, is still <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/greek-police-scramble-to-catch-onecoins-cryptoqueen-ruja-ignatova-local-media-reports/">at large</a> and is wanted by Interpol, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/onecoin-crypto-queen-ruja-ignatova-listed-among-europes-most-wanted/">Europol</a>, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/onecoins-co-founder-ruja-ignatova-has-been-added-to-the-fbis-10-most-wanted-fugitives-list/">FBI</a>), which offers a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest. Her brother, Konstantin, was detained in Los Angeles in 2019, pleaded guilty and sought witness protection.</p>

<p>In August, media reports revealed that a British national accused of money laundering related to the Onecoin scam, Christopher Hamilton, had lost his bid to avoid extradition to the United States and would be handed over to U.S. authorities. In October, three Onecoin associates <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/onecoin-cryptoqueen-associates-appear-in-german-court/">appeared</a> in a German court to face charges of fraud and other crimes.</p>
<p>Greenwood, who was Onecoin’s “global master distributor,” was credited by Ignatova for the idea of marketing and selling the crypto through an MLM structure. District Judge Edgardo Ramos accepted his guilty plea and the sentencing is scheduled for April 5, 2023. The 45-year-old co-founder of Onecoin faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the counts against him.</p>

<h2 class="article__header__heading">While Elon Musk Plans to Purge 1.5 Billion Inactive Twitter Names, Bitcoiners Beg Him to Preserve Hal Finney&#8217;s Account</h2>
<p>On Dec. 9, 2022, Twitter’s owner Elon Musk told the public that the social media company plans to purge 1.5 billion accounts. Musk further added that the deletions would be obvious accounts that have no tweets or that haven’t logged in for years.</p>
<p>However, after Musk announced this plan, a great number of cryptocurrency proponents have grown concerned that Hal Finney’s account would be among the purged names. Finney, who passed away in Aug. 2014, was the first to mention bitcoin in a tweet on the public forum.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hal-finneys-wife-fran-activates-her-husbands-twitter-account-to-protect-it-from-being-purged-by-elon-musk/">recent update</a>, Finney&#8217;s wife, Fran Finney, appears to have activated and tweeted from the account to protect it from being deleted.</p>

<p>According to a recent report published by the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), cryptocurrency executives were allegedly concerned that Sam Bankman Fried’s (SBF) Alameda Research was trying to “depeg stablecoins.” Purportedly, high-up executives from crypto exchanges are members of a Signal chat group called “Exchange coordination,” and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) ostensibly told SBF to stop causing “more damage.”</p>

The leading coin trading platform has been active in the region this year, seeking to expand market presence and increase interaction with authorities.</strong></p>
<h2>Binance to Assist Azerbaijan’s Monetary Authority With Regulations for Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>The world’s largest exchange for crypto assets, Binance, is ready to provide support to the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) in elaborating mechanisms for crypto regulation, the company’s Director of Governmental Relations in the Commonwealth of Independent States (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CIS</a>) Olga Goncharova told local media.</p>
<p>Speaking to Azerbaijan’s Trend News Agency, the Binance representative revealed that regulatory matters have been discussed during a recent meeting with CBA officials and stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In practice, both around the world and in a number of CIS countries, central banks choose the way to regulate cryptocurrency rather than ban it.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Introducing regulation will increase confidence in the industry as well as foreign direct investment in the country,” Goncharova elaborated. The executive emphasized that Binance sees great potential for the crypto industry in the future, noting that traders in CIS countries show interest in its products.</p>
<p>“Even though crypto assets declined this year for various reasons, we see that the technology itself has held up and interest in it will only grow. This technology solves the challenges citizens are facing, including financial services at minimal cost and even faster,” Goncharova pointed out.</p>

<h2>Largest Exchange Looking to Expand Contacts in CIS Area</h2>
<p>Olga Goncharova also remarked that besides Azerbaijan, the exchange has held meetings in other former-Soviet republics, including Central Asia’s Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and intends to expand the geography of such contacts.</p>
<p>In early October, Binance offered to support Kazakhstan’s government in the “safe development” of the country’s crypto market and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-and-kazakhstan-to-share-information-about-crypto-related-crime/">agreed</a> to cooperate with its financial authorities. It was later <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-licensed-in-kazakhstan-as-provider-of-crypto-exchange-and-custody-services/">licensed</a> as a provider of crypto exchange and custody services.</p>
<p>The global trading platform has been also looking to increase its presence in Eastern Europe, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-founder-cz-announces-romanian-office-as-part-of-regional-expansion/">announcing</a> the opening of a new office in Romania in September. The developing crypto industry has caught the attention of regulators, founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao commented during a visit to Bucharest.</p>
<p>Like others in the industry, the world’s leading crypto exchange has been impacted by negative developments in the space, the latest of which was the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">collapse</a> of its competitor, FTX. On Dec. 13, Binance saw net outflows reaching $3 billion and a report quoted Zhao as warning colleagues in a memo to expect <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-withdrawals-binance-ceo-warns-of-bumpy-months-ahead/">bumpy months</a> ahead.</p>

The currency&#8217;s resurgence appears to have been fueled by reports that Ghana has secured a $3 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). </strong></p>
<h2>Cedi Appreciates by Over 36% in Just Four Days</h2>
<p>After tapping an all-time low of more than 14 cedis for every dollar, the Ghanaian currency’s exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar appreciated to 8 cedis per dollar by Dec. 16, the latest data from the Bank of Ghana (BOG) has shown. According to the BOG data, the most rapid recovery occurred between Dec. 12 and Dec. 16 when the cedi appreciated by more than 36%.</p>

<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ghanaian-cedi-slides-further-versus-the-us-dollar-to-become-worlds-worst-performing-currency/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in October, shortages of the greenback as well as Ghana’s economic troubles had fueled the cedi’s plunge, which saw it being named the world’s worst-performing currency. At the time, Ghanaian authorities reportedly pinned their hopes on a financial bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Ghana Finally Secures IMF Bailout Package</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/12/13/imf-agrees-to-ghana-3bn-debt-bailout">report</a> in Al Jazeera, the IMF and Ghanaian government finally agreed on a $3 billion loan package. As part of the Dec. 13 agreement, Ghana will reportedly use the funds to help those most affected by the deteriorating economic conditions, restore financial stability, and get the country’s national debt under control.</p>
