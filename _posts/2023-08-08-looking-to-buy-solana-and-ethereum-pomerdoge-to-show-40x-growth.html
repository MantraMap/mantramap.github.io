<p class="s6">If you are searching for a project that can make you a millionaire over the coming years, Pomerdoge is one cryptocurrency that you shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on. Convinced by its growth projections and presale performance, experts believe that Pomerdoge&rsquo;s value can rise by 40x this year.</p>
Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have moved downward in recent months.
<p class="s8">Summary:</p>
● Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) social engagements have plummeted by 53% in the past week
● Ethereum (ETH) is planning to launch the Dencun upgrade by the year-end
● Pomerdoge&rsquo;s presale tokens are selling out fast during Stage 1

Solana (SOL) Sees Drop In Social Metric
<p class="s6">Amid the bullish market sentiments, Solana (SOL) has seen growth in a key metric. The total value locked (TVL) of Solana (SOL) has increased over the past few months. The rise in Solana&rsquo;s (SOL) TVL has been caused largely because of the increase in the LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives) vertical.</p>
<p class="s6">Data shows that Jito, an LSD protocol operating on Solana (SOL), has seen a massive uptick after the Shapella upgrade. However, social engagements on the Solana (SOL) network have dropped by 53% in the past week. Besides, social mentions for Solana (SOL) have tumbled by 47%. Thus, the market price of Solana (SOL) has fallen by 10% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, Solana (SOL) is trading at $22.53.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Set To Launch A New Upgrade
<p class="s6">The Ethereum (ETH) network has been on a roll to launch new updates. A few months ago, Ethereum (ETH) had launched its much-awaited Shapella upgrade.</p>
<p class="s6">Ethereum (ETH) has intensified its efforts on the upcoming Cancun-Deneb upgrade. However, the news regarding the Dencun upgrade has not caused any positive response for the price of Ethereum (ETH). Notably, the trading price of Ethereum (ETH) has tumbled by 3% in the past seven days. As a result, an Ethereum (ETH) token can now be traded at $1,826.29.</p>
<p class="s6">Also known as Dencun, the upcoming upgrade will improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum (ETH) network. Reportedly, Ethereum (ETH) may launch the upgrade by the end of 2023.</p>
Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Makes Big Waves
<p class="s6">According to a report, the global blockchain gaming market can grow from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $65.7 billion by 2027. Thus, Pomerdoge has developed a new blockchain game that will disrupt the play-to-earn gaming arena. The new P2E game, named Pomergame, is equipped with many rich and unique features. Therefore, it has generated big market waves even before its launch in the market.</p>
<p class="s6">According to experts, Pomerdoge is different from meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe. Pomerdoge is a mix of fun and earning. Hence, you get paid for all the time you spend on the game. Its ecosystem consists of three major elements.</p>
<p class="s6">The first element is Pomergame, where you will be able to play, create, and level up your character to elite status. The Pomerplace is the second element, where you will get an opportunity to sell your custom in-game assets to other members, or battle with gamers across the globe. The last element is a unique collection of 7,777 NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">Pomerdoge&rsquo;s business roadmap has revealed that it will launch POMD tokens on Uniswap after the presale round. At present, the presale of POMD tokens is in its first stage, and its price is $0.007. However, analysts have predicted that POMD&rsquo;s value can skyrocket by 1700% by the end of the presale round. So, hurry before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
