Davidson insists the act aims to safeguard U.S. capital markets &#x201C;from a tyrannical chairman.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Legislation Filed to Remove SEC Chair Gensler in Effort to Safeguard U.S. Capital Markets</h2>
<p>Several Republican lawmakers have openly criticized SEC chairman Gary Gensler for his performance in leading the federal securities regulatory division. Among them is congressman Warren Davidson (R-OH), who recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-introducing-legislation-to-remove-sec-chairman-due-to-long-series-of-abuses/">announced</a> his intention to introduce legislation to remove Gensler from his position. Less than two months later, Davidson filed the SEC Stabilization Act and shared the news on Twitter on June 12th.</p>
<p>&#x201C;U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical chairman, including the current one,&#x201D; Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668305460368121857?s=20">said</a> in a statement. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come. It&#x2019;s time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as chair of the SEC.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Davidson also <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668313132211617792?s=20">announced</a> that U.S. congressman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-introduces-bill-to-affirm-blockchain-developers-and-non-custodial-services-are-not-money-transmitters/">Tom Emmer</a>, a Republican from Minnesota, has joined him in supporting the bill. &#x201C;American investors and industry deserve clear and consistent oversight, not political gamesmanship,&#x201D; Emmer said. &#x201C;The SEC Stabilization Act will make common-sense changes to ensure that the SEC&#x2019;s priorities are with the investors they are charged to protect and not the whims of its reckless chair.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Criticism of Gensler&#x2019;s job performance extends beyond Republican politicians, with Democratic presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also expressing his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-slams-sec-for-protecting-banks-instead-of-american-people-calls-for-crypto-friendly-commissioners/">dissatisfaction</a> with the U.S. securities regulator. Kennedy stated last month that the &#x201C;SEC&#x2019;s function now is not to protect the American people, but it&#x2019;s to protect the banks.&#x201D; The presidential candidate also advocated for a leader at the SEC who is supportive of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Davidson&#x2019;s proposal aims to establish a new structure where the responsibility of producing current policy would shift from the SEC chair to the six SEC commissioners, who would be involved in rulemaking, enforcement, and investigations. Patrick McHenry, the chair of the United States House Financial Services Committee, has also <a href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1648318713660338181?s=20">voiced criticism</a> of Gensler in recent times.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/">oversight hearing</a> on April 18, McHenry posed a question to Gensler regarding the classification of ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) as a security. At the time, Gensler refrained from providing a direct answer to whether he believed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> to be a security.</p>

<h2>This Week&#x2019;s NFT Sales Follow Crypto Market&#x2019;s Nosedive</h2>
<p>Sales of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have nosedived more than 20% over the past seven days compared to the previous week. The decline follows several consecutive weeks of gains, during which Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>)-based NFTs gained significant prominence. In the last seven days, NFT sales totaled $152.96 million, and the number of NFT buyers decreased by 63.59%. Ethereum-based NFT sales accounted for $84 million, representing 54.91% of the market share among 21 different blockchains.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-593075 size-full" title="NFT Market Sees 20% Drop in Weekly Sales After a Few Weeks of Gains" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nftsles.jpg" alt="NFT Market Sees 20% Drop in Weekly Sales After a Few Weeks of Gains" width="1280" height="75" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nftsles-300x18.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nftsles-1024x60.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nftsles-768x45.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/nftsles.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Ethereum-based NFT sales, however, have dropped 34% compared to the previous week. Bitcoin-centric NFTs still hold the second position in terms of sales, with $29.41 in recorded sales. Bitcoin-based NFT sales increased by about 25.9% compared to last week&#x2019;s sales total. Behind <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, NFT sales on other blockchains include Solana ($8.48 million), Mythos ($8.12 million), and Polygon ($6.32 million).</p>

<p>While Bitcoin NFTs took the top five spots last week, that is not the case this week, according to statistics from <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">cryptoslam.io</a>. Two of the five most expensive NFTs sold this week were Ethereum-based, and the other three were Bitcoin-based.</p>

<p>The most expensive NFT sale came from the Bitcoin-centric Derps collection, which is also the eighth-largest collection in terms of overall sales this week. However, the largest collection by sales belonged to uncategorized ordinals.</p>

<p>Uncategorized ordinals are followed by Dmarket, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Gods Unchained, Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Azuki. Although NFT sales were lower April than in March, sales in May exceeded April&#x2019;s total NFT sales. Just over $739 million worth of NFTs were sold last month, and as of now in June, <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/nftglobal">$263.86 million in sales</a> have been recorded.</p>

A Peckshield Alert <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1668070638819606528?s=20">notified</a> the community that &#x201C;the exploiter has already transferred 442.6 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> to Tornado Cash,&#x201D; the well known <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> mixer.</p>
<p>Sturdy Finance <a href="https://twitter.com/SturdyFinance/status/1668080627030315009?s=20">addressed the situation</a> on Twitter and said, &#x201C;We are aware of the reported exploit of the Sturdy protocol. All markets have been paused; no additional funds are at risk and no user actions are required at this time. We will be sharing more information as soon as we have it.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Sturdy currently has approximately $10.78 million locked into the defi protocol. However, according to defillama.com <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/sturdy">statistics</a>, the figure was around $12.8 million the previous day. Although 2023 has witnessed several defi hacks, the number of attacks has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-hacks-plunge-70-in-q1-2023-victims-recover-over-half-of-stolen-funds-but-experts-warn-of-temporary-relief/">significantly lower</a> compared to 2022. Additionally, victims in 2023 have been successful in recovering a substantial amount of funds from this year&#x2019;s attacks.</p>

The hacker who exploited the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> blockchain managed to secure $150 million in stablecoins through the use of Venus. If the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> slips to $220 per unit, the position will be liquidated.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Community Focuses on Venus Protocol&#x2019;s Role in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Liquidation Risk</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency community has been engaged in discussions about the Venus Protocol, a decentralized finance (defi) application for lenders and borrowers. Last year, during the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-backed-bnb-smart-chain-paused-over-potential-multi-million-dollar-exploit-token-slides-4/">attack</a> on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> blockchain, a hacker managed to acquire $150 million in stablecoins from the Venus Protocol, utilizing 900,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a>.</p>
<p>The position is currently still <a href="https://debank.com/profile/0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec">active</a>, but it is at risk of being liquidated, causing concerns about potential disruptions in the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> ecosystem. To trigger the liquidation, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> must drop below the $220 per unit threshold. Presently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> is being traded at prices ranging from $222.23 to $238.20 per unit. Over the past week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> has experienced a decline of 22.3% in its value, and it currently stands 66.01% below its all-time price high.</p>

<p>The Venus Protocol addressed the matter on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1668142791505977344?s=20">stating</a>: &#x201C;In November 2022, @BNBCHAIN submitted a governance proposal which was passed by the community to whitelist liquidation of the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Bridge exploiter&#x2019;s position exclusively to @BNBChain core team for the purpose of securing the misappropriated assets and preventing any further impact and sell off from liquidating.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Venus Protocol announced that the whitelisted wallet received initial funding of $30 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>. The funding was intended to mitigate potential deficiencies on Venus and provide additional backing through the Venus governance-approved mechanism. However, the Twitter account subsequently deleted a prior tweet which <a href="https://twitter.com/rangeblue_/status/1668144139693686784?s=20">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>@BNBChain core team is ready to take over the $<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> position on Venus as planned if the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> price hits the liquidation threshold. The liquidator address has prepared $30M already to refund the account loans with more to come if needed. No <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> will be dumped into the market and no shortfall is expected on Venus.</p></blockquote>

<p>Venus Protocol <a href="https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1668145581800267776?s=20">addressed</a> an individual who shared a screenshot of the now-deleted tweet, stating, &#x201C;A new tweet was published to give readers more context and a link to the actual governance proposal explaining the mechanism for more transparency.&#x201D; With <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> reaching $222.23 during today&#x2019;s trading sessions, it has come dangerously close to the liquidation threshold.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Starting June 13, 2023, the </span><a href="https://www.probit.com/en-us/ieo/gxz-round2/0?utm_source=Bitcoin.com&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=gxzieo"><span style="font-weight: 400;">token sale</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will enable investors to join an ecosystem that seeks to take its unique synergistic dynamic non-fungible token (sdNFT) beyond the traditional concept of dynamic NFTs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on an ecosystem that enables cross-chain interoperability, the sdNFT technology used by the Galactix Zone Project is like a static NFT ‘Terminator’, providing features that are far beyond those found in regular NFTs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NFT gaming platform is built on a unique ecosystem based on </span><a href="https://galactixzone.io/whitepaper/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a tokenomics model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that offers GXZ holders and users several benefits, aimed at helping them to maximize rewards, facilitate community interaction, and drive innovation within the blockchain and NFT spaces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GXZ holders will earn rewards in proportion to the length of time they hold the digital asset, as well as receive discounts on future sdNFT launches. They will also have access to a network of social media connections within the ecosystem while GXZ holders who are social media influencers will be able to earn rewards for spreading the word about the Galactix Zone Project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it serves as a launchpad platform for new projects to make their offerings available to early adopters through a whitelist opportunity (with a lock-up period of six months to a year), </span><a href="https://galactixzone.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Galactix Zone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers projects that use its ICO launchpad some discounts on their listing fees. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We believe that our synergistic dynamic NFT (sdNFT) technology is the future of NFTs and gaming, and we&#8217;re excited to be at the forefront of this innovation,” says Galactix Zone’s CEO, John Nguyen. “Our project is a community-driven initiative that values transparency, integrity, and innovation, and we invite you to join us on this journey to revolutionize the NFT and gaming industry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GXZ ecosystem also runs a DAO-operated charity fund, in which GXZ token holders are allowed to vote on suggestions for donations. </span></p>
<p><b>ABOUT GXZ </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The GXZ token is the native asset for the Galactix Zone ecosystem which offers a range of utilities and future projects aimed at driving innovation in the blockchain and NFT spaces with projects like the Galactix Zone Kalpa Avian (GKA) which gives investors greater control over their investments and the ability to earn more. </span></p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) rebounded by nearly 5% to start the week, as traders moved to buy this weekend&#x2019;s dip.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD fell by over 30% in the past few days, dropping to a low of $0.2300 in the process.</p>
<p>However on Monday, the token rallied to an intraday peak of $0.2859, with bulls seemingly finding a stable floor at $0.2600.</p>

<p>This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) jumped back above the 20.00 region, and is now heading towards a ceiling at 31.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 24.99, which remains in oversold territory.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> is currently trading at $0.2815, down 24% from the same point last week.</p>

<p>Another notable token to climb higher on Monday was cosmos (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>), which also rebounded from recent losses.</p>
<p>Following a low of $8.21 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>/USD jumped to a high of $8.68 to start the new trading week.</p>
<p>The rally sees <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a> continue to move away from a one-year low at $7.31, which was hit on Saturday.</p>

<p>Similar to cardano, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ATOM" target="_blank">ATOM</a>&#x2019;s RSI reading remains below the 30.00 mark, which is a positive for longer-term bulls.</p>
<p>This shows that there is some potential upside in the market. However, volatility also remains high.</p>

Several reports have linked Emefiele&#8217;s suspension to the central bank&#8217;s controversial naira demonetization exercise. </strong></p>
<h2>Emefiele&#8217;s Presidential Aspirations</h2>
<p>The Nigerian central bank governor, Godwin Emefiele, was on June 9 suspended by the West African nation’s new president Bola Ahmed Tinubu. The suspension is expected to pave the way for further investigations into Emefiele&#8217;s conduct throughout his tenure as head of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST IN: The Department of State Services (DSS) have  confirmed that Mr Godwin Emefiele, the suspended Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is now in its custody for some investigative reasons. <a href="https://t.co/tJJtcEduzZ">pic.twitter.com/tJJtcEduzZ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Eons Intelligence (@eonsintelligenc) <a href="https://twitter.com/eonsintelligenc/status/1667527007452758017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Immediately after his suspension, several local media reports said Emefiele was <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNationNews/status/1667875796508180480">arrested</a> by a domestic security agency known as the Department of State Services (DSS). As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-nigerian-security-agency-seeks-to-arrest-central-bank-governor-on-charges-of-funding-terrorists/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News on Dec. 28, 2022, the CBN’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigeria-central-bank-governor-cryptocurrency-is-a-product-embedded-in-high-level-of-illegality/">anti-bitcoin</a> governor is accused of funding terrorists and of failing to properly manage the central bank.</p>
<p>At the time when the charges were initially leveled against him, the country’s domestic security agency sought to arrest Emefiele but the move was blocked by a Nigerian High Court. However, the departure of Emefiele&#8217;s ally, former president Muhammadu Buhari, appears to have allowed the DSS to finally act against the CBN governor.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to the allegations leveled against him by the DSS, supporters of Tinubu have repeatedly claimed that Emefiele had attempted to block Tinubu&#8217;s ascendancy via the CBN’s controversial naira demonetization exercise. A few days after Tinubu’s electoral victory, the CBN was forced to issue a <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2023/CCD/Emefiele%20debunks%20Newspaper%20report%20(March%2013%202023)%20.pdf">statement</a> which denied claims that Emefiele had initiated another plot against the then president-elect.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>New President Attacks Central Bank&#8217;s Policies</h2>
<p>However, in his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-nigerian-president-slates-central-banks-interest-rate-and-currency-demonetization-policy/">inaugural speech</a> as president, Tinubu appeared to take a cue from his backers when he blasted the CBN’s handling of currency and monetary policies. The new president also called for the replacement of Nigeria’s multiple exchange rate regime with one unified exchange rate. A few days after Tinubu’s admonishment, a local report on June 1 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-central-bank-blasts-naira-devaluation-report-publication-stands-by-its-story/">suggested</a> that the CBN had taken heed of the president’s call by devaluing the naira to N631:USD1 from around N460:USD1. However, the central bank has since branded the report &#8220;fake news.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Nigerian corporate lawyer who did not wish to be identified told Bitcoin.com News that Emefiele’s past presidential aspirations may partly explain why Tinubu chose to remove him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long before this suspension, some prominent Nigerians and Nigerians in the street have been calling for Emefiele&#8217;s outright sack for several reasons. [One of these reasons is] Emefiele&#8217;s membership of the ruling party All People&#8217;s Congress (APC) with indication to contest the 2023 presidential election,” the lawyer said.</p>
<p>According to the lawyer, the central bank’s failed naira demonetization exercise proved to be the &#8220;straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back.&#8221;</p>

In this issue, Volcano Energy rises in El Salvador, Venezuelan bitcoin miners flee amidst nationwide mining ban, and Argentina deepens usage of the Chinese yuan to pay imports.</strong></p>
<h2>Volcano Energy Green Mining Project Rises out of Stealth in El Salvador</h2>
<p>Volcano Energy, a bitcoin mining project, <a href="https://volcano-energy.tiiny.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the construction of a 241MW renewable power generation facility in El Salvador. The operation, which will get most of its energy using photovoltaic (solar) cells, will power what it calls &#8220;one of the world&#8217;s largest bitcoin mining farms,&#8221; with a mining processing capacity of 1.3 EH/s in its first stage.</p>
<p>The cost of the whole development is estimated to reach $1 billion, with the first phase of $250 million being financed by &#8220;Bitcoin industry leaders.&#8221; Tether is among the companies participating in the project as part of its recently announced mining and renewable energy investment expansion policy.</p>
<p>Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-expands-investments-in-green-bitcoin-mining-invests-in-el-salvadors-volcano-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Volcano Energy represents one of the most ground-breaking and strategic initiatives we are investing in and we look forward to working alongside Josue Lopez [Volcano Energy&#8217;s CEO] and his team to make El Salvador a global force in renewable energy production.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin Miners Leaving Venezuela Amidst National Mining Ban</h2>
<p>Venezuelan bitcoin miners are looking to <a href="https://www.criptonoticias.com/mineria/nos-vamos-venezuela-dicen-mineros-bitcoin-ante-limbo-regulatorio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relocate</a> their operations to other countries in Latam due to the nationwide mining ban that the government enacted after the intervention of the Venezuelan crypto watchdog Sunacrip. The institution was allegedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/how-crypto-ended-up-at-the-center-of-a-potential-20-billion-internal-corruption-scandal-in-venezuela-bitcoin-mining-shutdown-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">involved</a> in a $20 billion corruption scheme.</p>
<p>An anonymous miner told Criptonoticias that he is looking to move his 2,000 ASIC mining rigs to Paraguay, stating that it had one of the &#8220;cheapest electricity rates in Latin America and it is a country that has open arms for bitcoin miners to whom it is not imposing restrictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other miners are considering moving their bitcoin mining operation out of Venezuela, taking them to Paraguay and El Salvador.</p>

<h2>Argentina Registers Increase in Usage of Chinese Yuan for International Settlements</h2>
<p>Argentine companies are <a href="https://www.telam.com.ar/notas/202306/630855-guillermo-michel-aduanas-empresas-importaciones-yuanes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">embracing</a> the Chinese yuan for settling cross-border payments to save U.S. dollars. According to general customs director Guillermo Michel, more than 500 companies have shifted to pay for imports with Chinese yuan after the Argentine government introduced dollar-like protections to the currency in the financial system.</p>
<p>Out of the almost $10 billion available as part of the Chinese <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/latam-insights-t…doning-us-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swap line</a>, there are currently more than $2 billion in payments awaiting approval.</p>
