An agreement to settle by paying a penalty often will include the violator agreeing to stop all operations within the US and not return in the future.<br /><br />----<br /><i><b style="color: #666666;">Adam Lee /</b><span style="color: #666666;"> Asia Newsroom</span><br /><span style="color: #660000;">Global Crypto Press Association</span></i></div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
