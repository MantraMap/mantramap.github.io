<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/vitalik-buterin-worldcoin-protocol/">Vitalik Buterin Shares Opinion on Newly Launched Worldcoin Protocol</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/vitalik-buterin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin</a>, the esteemed co-founder of the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> network and a vocal advocate for innovative solutions in the blockchain space has recently expressed his views on the significance of an efficient and trustworthy proof-of-personhood system, exemplified by new projects like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldcoin</a>.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">long note</a>, Buterin emphasized the substantial risks associated with the rapid development and deployment of such systems. The concept of a proof-of-personhood system has been gaining traction as a potential solution to address identity verification and authentication challenges in the digital age.</p>
<p>By utilizing <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain technology</a>, such systems aim to establish a secure and decentralized way of confirming individuals’ identities, which can have far-reaching implications across various sectors. Vitalik Buterin acknowledges the value of these systems, recognizing their potential to enhance financial inclusion, streamline administrative processes, and empower individuals by providing them control over their digital identities.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Concerns on Worldcoin</h2>
<p>However, in his warning, Buterin sheds light on the risks involved in the hasty race to develop proof-of-personhood systems. He summarized the risks into four major points which are privacy, centralization, accessibility, and security.</p>
<p>Also, he noted that the process of creating such intricate technologies demands meticulous attention to detail, security, and privacy concerns. As such, rushing into implementation without thoroughly addressing these critical aspects could lead to unintended consequences and vulnerabilities that malicious actors might exploit.</p>
<p>Per the long-read essay, Buterin raised concerns about the potential for centralization in the proof-of-personhood systems. In their pursuit of efficiency and scalability, developers might inadvertently concentrate power in the hands of a few entities or individuals. This could in turn undermine the core principles of decentralization that blockchain technology seeks to uphold.</p>
<p>To address these challenges, Buterin calls for a measured and collaborative approach. He advocates for open discussions, peer reviews, and transparency during the development and deployment of such systems. By involving a diverse group of stakeholders, including researchers, technologists, policymakers, and privacy advocates, the risks can be better understood and mitigated.</p>
<p>Despite his cautious stance, Vitalik Buterin envisions a future where decentralized identity verification can empower individuals, improve access to services, and foster a more inclusive global society.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin (WLD) Token Goes Live Today</h2>
<p>OpenAI chief Sam Altman <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/openai-worldcoin-wld-token-live/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>that Worldcoin is in an attempt at global scale alignment. The protocol went live after securing the needed backing from prominent players in the industry like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).</p>
<p>Interestingly the WLD token from Worldcoin was listed on several crypto exchanges including Binance, and Huobi, amongst others. Recall that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/worldcoins-world-id-program-2m-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according </a>to a July 13 post, Worldcoin had gained over 2 million users for its global identity protocol World ID.</p>
<p>The Worldcoin project aims to establish a global digital currency and identity system. Sam Altman created it to address the challenges associated with financial inclusion and identity verification using blockchain technology.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-twitter-logo-xrp/">Elon Musk&#8217;s New Twitter Logo Unleashes XRP Community&#8217;s Euphoria</a></p>
<p>On Sunday, July 23, billionaire Elon Musk <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/musk-twitter-logo-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that he would change Twitter&#8217;s logo to an &#8216;X&#8217; on Monday, sparking excitement among the XRP community, which responded positively to the news.</p>
<p>According to Musk, the new <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1dRKZMMdOLzxB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">logo</a> with the letter &#8216;X&#8217; represents the name of the &#8220;super app&#8221; he wants to create to compete with the Chinese social media and instant payments giant, WeChat.</p>
<p>Musk openly stated his desire to replicate the &#8220;WeChat for the West&#8221; model, suggesting that this move should have been made a long time ago. Additionally, the CEO of Tesla, well-known for being a cryptocurrency enthusiast, received unexpected support from the XRP community, despite not tweeting about it with the same passion as he does for his favorite memecoins: Shiba Inu (SHIB) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dogecoin-doge-elon-musk-tweet/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>.</p>
<h2>The XRP Community Applauds Twitter&#8217;s Image Change</h2>
<p>The XRP community on Twitter wasted no time expressing their thoughts on the new logo, given its resemblance to the XRP logo.</p>
<p>For instance, the renowned influencer of the XRP community, &#8220;@XRPcryptowolf,&#8221; proposed an identical logo to that of XRP, emphasizing the &#8220;X&#8221; similarities by placing it on a black background, suggesting that it would look better than the logo posted by Twitter&#8217;s CEO, Linda Yaccarino.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Anyone else agree that the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a> logo looks way better? 👀 <a href="https://t.co/efEstwvNAQ">https://t.co/efEstwvNAQ</a> <a href="https://t.co/RwowxCiuIC">pic.twitter.com/RwowxCiuIC</a></p>
<p>&mdash; XRPcryptowolf (@XRPcryptowolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPcryptowolf/status/1683362093657882624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, other users pointed out that the resemblance to the XRP logo was so striking that Ripple could potentially sue Twitter for copyright infringement.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$XRP</a> looks way better, but they should still sue the fuck out Elon for the clear copyright infringement.</p>
<p>&mdash; JustSaiyin.eth 🦇🔊 (@JSaiyin) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSaiyin/status/1683363169618604032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Some users reminisced about the old days when the social media giant had a tip bot that used XRP, wondering if there was a possibility that the new &#8220;X app&#8221; would reintroduce such payment features.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TWITTER IS NOW BECOMING THE &quot;X&quot; APP, WILL XRP BE THE PAYMENTS SYSTEM?? Full video on YT<br /> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#crypto</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/news?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#news</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/twitter?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#twitter</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/elonmusk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#elonmusk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/xrp?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#xrp</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ripple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ripple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/X?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#X</a> <a href="https://t.co/Tw9s6SM4VH">pic.twitter.com/Tw9s6SM4VH</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Elon Musk Changes Twitter&#8217;s Logo Again</h2>
<p>This is not the first time Elon Musk has decided to change Twitter&#8217;s logo overnight. A few months ago, he replaced the blue bird logo with the image of a Shiba Inu, the most beloved and cherished dog both among memecoin enthusiasts and Elon Musk himself.</p>
<p>That unexpected image change resulted in a class-action lawsuit in June 2022, alleging price manipulation of memecoins to unjustly enrich himself with billions of dollars through undisclosed sales of Dogecoin, using insider information. After the first logo replacement, DOGE&#8217;s price increased by 30%.</p>
<p>However, Musk attempted to dismiss the original lawsuit, claiming that there was nothing illegal about supporting a legitimate cryptocurrency. Furthermore, there has been no evidence of illicit enrichment by the billionaire, who continues to express his support for memecoins on every possible occasion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/putin-law-digital-ruble/">Russian President Vladimir Putin Signs Law on Digital Ruble</a></p>
<p>President of Russia Vladimir Putin has officially signed the digital ruble into law, with the amendment to the Russian Constitution set to come into force starting from August 1, 2023.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307240009?index=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a> released by the authorities, selected articles of the Constitution of the Russian Federation about the regulation of non-cash funds will now include certain rules for the use of digital rubles. The Bank of Russia will be in charge of all the stored digital ruble assets as well as be the principal operator of the digital ruble infrastructure. In other words, the platform where users will be able to make transactions with the digital ruble will be run and overseen by the Bank of Russia. In addition, the institution&#8217;s Board of Directors will set tariffs on digital currency transactions.</p>
<p>The bill signed by Vladimir Putin enforces Russia&#8217;s progress in developing a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC) in Russia. In August, the pilot test of the digital ruble will start. Real clients of 13 Russian banks will be the first ones to gauge the use of a CBDC.</p>
<p>Notably, the Bank of Russia has promised there will be no obligatory transfer of salaries and pensions to digital rubles when they are finally in use. Similar to cash and non-cash rubles, the digital ruble will also have no expiry date.</p>
<p>Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The most important thing we are going to talk about is the voluntariness. It [the use of the digital ruble] will be a personal choice. Some people, for example, don&#8217;t use smartphones and are not going to use them. There will be other forms of currency available for them, to which they are accustomed, both cash and non-cash.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>By 2027, the Bank of Russia is planning to enable payments in digital rubles in shops, which means that mass adoption should be reached by that time. Besides, we have <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/russia-digital-ruble-deals-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Russia is planning to start using the digital ruble in mutual international deals with China by the end of next year.</p>
<p>Notably, for citizens, digital ruble transactions will be free, while businesses will be charged a 0.3% fee for taking payment in the CBDC.</p>
<h2>On the Way to Implementing Digital Ruble</h2>
<p>Russia is one of those countries progressing in developing a CBDC. The Central Bank of Russia started working on a digital ruble back in 2020, and in April of this year, it was planned to start the currency&#8217;s testing. However, the testing phase was delayed as there documents allowing to implement digital ruble were not ready yet. The prototype platform for the digital ruble was finished in December 2021.</p>
<p>In July this year, the State Duma of Russia passed the Digital Ruble law that introduced the concepts of &#8220;digital ruble,&#8221; &#8220;digital ruble platform,&#8221; and &#8220;digital ruble platform participant.&#8221; The legislation enlists the basic rules by which the Bank of Russia, as the operator of the platform, will interact with its participants and users, and the requirements for them.</p>
<p>As Vladimir Putin has also signed the bill allowing the implementation of the digital ruble into real use, Russia is now one step closer to becoming a country with its own CBDC.</p>
<p>Among nations that have already implemented CBDCs are the Bahamas, Nigeria, as well as seven countries in the Eastern Caribbean Union – Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St. Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dogecoin-doge-price-twitter-x-com/">Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Surges as Twitter Rebrandes to X.com </a></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency market is abuzz with excitement as Dogecoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOGE</a>) is experiencing a remarkable <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">surge</a> following <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>&#8216;s surprise Twitter rebranding <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/musk-twitter-logo-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> on June 24. The visionary entrepreneur and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX has once again demonstrated his ability to sway investor sentiment with his social media antics, further solidifying his influence over the digital asset space, particularly with DOGE.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s recent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/">Twitter</a> moves centered around Twitter&#8217;s logo <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1682978324375543808?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">rebranding</a> to X.com, which he unveiled with a cryptic video teaser. The tech mogul also changed his Twitter profile picture to a simple white X on a black background, adding to the intrigue. Alongside these changes, Musk playfully incorporated the Dogecoin symbol, Ð, alongside the letter X in his Twitter location, sending excitement through the Dogecoin community.</p>
<p>The impact of the news from Twitter on DOGE price was swift and substantial. Within hours of Musk&#8217;s engagement, the meme crypto witnessed a surge of nearly 10%, climbing from 0.07144 to 0.07785, according to CoinMarketCap data, reaching levels not seen since early May. The spike in value has reignited enthusiasm among Dogecoin holders and traders as they closely monitor the token&#8217;s movement in response to Musk&#8217;s announcements. It also reaffirms Dogecoin&#8217;s position as the top meme coin in the market, climbing to the eighth position among all cryptocurrencies and boasting a remarkable market value increase of over $1 billion.</p>
<h2>Elon Musk Declares Support for Dogecoin</h2>
<p>While Dogecoin started as a playful joke inspired by the popular &#8220;Doge&#8221; meme, it has become a significant player in the digital currency market. Its active and devoted community has been instrumental in promoting its adoption and popularity. Musk&#8217;s support for Dogecoin further reinforces its position as a beloved cryptocurrency with real potential in the crypto space.</p>
<p>During the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in Q2 2023, Musk openly expressed his affection for Dogecoin, declaring it his favorite cryptocurrency. According to the billionaire tech mogul, he was drawn to Dogecoin&#8217;s potential as a digital asset and its whimsical and humorous nature. However, Musk quickly emphasized that he does not provide financial advice, especially regarding cryptocurrency investments. Despite his appreciation for Dogecoin&#8217;s playful charm, he urged investors to exercise caution and make informed decisions when navigating the highly volatile crypto market.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Market Volume Reaches $16.29 Billion</h2>
<p>Dogecoin&#8217;s bullish performance has been remarkable, with its market value surging to an impressive $16.29 billion as of July 24, a significant leap from the previous month&#8217;s $15.54 billion. Over the last 30 days, Dogecoin has seen a surge of nearly 10%, including a 1.3% rise against the US dollar in the preceding week alone. Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter antics continue to be a driving force in the crypto community, keeping Dogecoin at the forefront of discussions and captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>The crypto asset reacted similarly in April when the Tesla CEO updated the Twitter icon with the Dogecoin symbol, further fueling speculation about the future integration of DOGE and other cryptocurrencies into the platform.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, market experts are closely watching the transition of Twitter to X.com, as they believe it could pave the way for a positive trend for Dogecoin. Unofficial sources have even hinted at the possibility of X.com becoming a hub for digital asset transactions, creating a fascinating intersection between social media and virtual currencies.</p>

<p>Although Threads is not expected to host ads anytime soon, experts believe the changing policies of the X platform make advertisers look into the former for diversity.</p>

<p>The differences between tech entrepreneurs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/mark-zuckerberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg</a>, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) have morphed into growth competition between X platform (formerly Twitter Inc) and Threads. Undeniably, Musk currently has the upper hand with more than 240 million monetizable users on the platform. In a recent interview, Musk highlighted that the X platform will become a huge financial ecosystem, simultaneously helping users relate socially. Ideally, the X platform has been likened to China-based WeChat after Musk described it as an everything application.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Meta’s Thread has made significant progress by attracting a huge user base as depicted by its rate of download since inception. Launched on July 05, Threads attained the fastest social media platform to hit 100 million downloads both on Android and iOS. Nonetheless, Threads does not currently accept advertising offers as the development and adoption is apparently still in the early stages.</p>
<p>According to Zuckerberg, Threads will shift its focus to advertisers after a clear path to 1 billion users is achieved.</p>
<p>“Tens of millions of users come back to Threads daily, and the team will focus the rest of the year on improving the basics and retention,” Zuckerberg recently <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/metas-threads-could-lure-ads-twitter-its-early-days-analysts-say-2023-07-24/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Analysts Take on Threads and Twitter’s Competition</h2>
<p>Since Musk took over Twitter, several changes have happened that have had mixed reactions from users and advertisers. However, Current X CEO Linda Yaccarino stated that the social media platform will focus on free expression and a healthy platform for all. Recently, an article by Bloomberg alleged that harmful content on Twitter was on the rise, which was vehemently opposed by X’s leadership. Nonetheless, Musk recently acknowledged that ads on the X platform have declined nearly 50 percent without issuing a definite timeline.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">To our partners, we want to address a recent Bloomberg article which claims that harmful content viewed on Twitter has gone up over the past six months. This is an absolutely false assertion. 99.99% of Tweet impressions are healthy. Which means only a tiny amount of content…</p>
<p>&mdash; Twitter Business (@TwitterBusiness) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBusiness/status/1681646056038187008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to analysts at Bernstein, Threads could offer Meta a huge revenue collection avenue if it manages to retain its customers. Specifically, the analyst highlighted that Threads could fetch Meta up to $5 billion in yearly revenues in a few years.</p>
<p>“The unprecedented adoption of &#8230; Threads now also offers Meta some material greenshoots to get excited about,” the analysts at Bernstein noted.</p>
<p>A note to investors by Morningstar analysts noted that Threads could add between $2 billion and $3 billion to Meta&#8217;s revenue every year between 2024 and 2027. Interestingly, Evercore ISI analysts estimated earlier this month that Threads could generate up to $8 billion in annual revenue by 2025.</p>
<p>However, experts unanimously agreed that it is still in the very early days for advertising comparison between Threads and X platforms as both are still in the development phase.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-bybit-okx-worldcoin-wld/">Binance, Bybit, OKX and Other Crypto Exchanges List Newly Launched Worldcoin (WLD) Token</a></p>
<p>Several crypto exchanges, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, have announced their intention to list Worldcoin (WLD) token. Binance started to trade the crypto at 5 a.m. EST, and they have already enabled WLD token deposits for Worldcoin beta participants. The exchange plans to allow leveraged trading for WLD through its isolated margin feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/worldcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worldcoin</a>, the brainchild of Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is a cryptocurrency project focused on decentralized identity and payment protocols. Its standout features include user authentication through eye scanning, which provides enhanced security and convenience.</p>
<p>Beta users of the World App were awarded WLD tokens after undergoing a rigorous biometric verification process using the project&#8217;s &#8220;orb&#8221; machines to establish their World ID within the application.</p>
<p>WLD is already available not only on Binance but also on other platforms, including Bybit, where it started trading at $0.3 per token and then quickly rose to $2.79 within fifteen minutes before settling at $2.42.</p>
<p>At this time, WLD price is around $2.8  as CoinGecko data shows a total token supply of 10 billion, giving the token a fully diluted value of $25.6 billion at current prices.</p>
<p>OKX has revealed the listing of WLD on its spot market. The exchange now allows WLD deposits and stated that withdrawal will be possible from 10 a.m. UTC on July 25. Huobi and Gate.io are also among the exchanges that have announced introducing the WLD/USDT trading pair on their platforms.</p>

<h2>WLD Token Is Experiencing a Good Start</h2>
<p>The WLD token is experiencing a remarkable start, gaining significant attention among crypto exchanges. With the project’s unique decentralized identity and payment approach, the token has excellent potential for continued growth and success.</p>
<p>Investors and enthusiasts are also watching its performance, eagerly awaiting what lies ahead for the token. The crypto had a more than 60% price spike within hours of its launch, signaling that many people were anticipating its introduction.</p>
<p>Alex Blania and Sam Altman, founders of Worldcoin, <a href="https://worldcoin.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Worldcoin is an attempt at global scale alignment, the journey will be challenging and the outcome is uncertain. But finding new ways to broadly share the coming technological prosperity is a critical challenge of our time. We hope you’ll join.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As the world moves closer to using AIs for different purposes, a solution such as this can help identify differences between humans and bots online. It could demonstrate how AI will reshape the economy and bring in some form of control by placing proper identity on entities.</p>

<p>US big tech may be seeing their cloud businesses pick up steam again as interest in AI rises, and consumers spend more on advertising.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-tech-cloud-business-ai/">US Tech Giants to Benefit from Improved Cloud Business Thanks to Focus on AI</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-tech-cloud-business-ai/">US Tech Giants to Benefit from Improved Cloud Business Thanks to Focus on AI</a></p>
<p>Tech giants in the US may be close to a positive shift in their cloud business after a long decline in the sector that has lasted nearly a year. These tech giants could see some respite as clients seek to increase their tech expenses following signs of a resilient economy.</p>
<p>The expected improvement in their cloud businesses draws strength from many factors, especially increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI). The market is currently expecting earnings reports from four of the biggest tech companies, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a> (NASDAQ: AMZN), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Platforms Inc</a> (NASDAQ: META), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT), and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/alphabet-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alphabet</a> (NASDAQ: GOOGL), by next week at the very latest. Results posted by these companies, with a combined valuation of more than $6 trillion, may set the tone for general sentiments regarding tech business, especially with cloud and AI.</p>
<p>All four tech giants have ventured deeply into AI products and research as companies worldwide scramble to take the largest chunk of the current AI boom. Their expected results will provide a clearer picture of the general market and potential revenue. Canaccord Genuity analyst Kingsley Crane said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re really only looking for metrics that point to ramping user traction for AI-based offerings, with the idea being that they will generate more meaningful revenue in the medium-term.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Analysts polled by Refinitiv predict that Alphabet and Amazon’s cloud computing businesses will grow 24.4% and 9.8%, respectively. This would be the lowest-ever growth percentages for both cloud giants. The analysts also put <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/solutions/intelligent-data-platform">Microsoft Cloud</a>’s growth at 13.7%, the lowest since 2017.</p>
<h2>Tech Giants to Benefit from Cloud Businesses, AI, and Advertising</h2>
<p>While these figures don’t seem very encouraging, some analysts have more optimistic opinions. For instance, RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria believes that the companies are resilient enough to weather the storm until things pick up:</p>
<blockquote><p>“While the macro continues to be soft, it is not getting materially worse and companies are figuring out how to operate in this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Jaluria’s optimism might also stem from a recent RBC Capital survey. The survey found that 80% of the 150 enterprise technology buyers that were part of the survey were pumping money into generative AI endeavors. These buyers also expect to spend more on IT expenses this year than 2022.</p>
<p>For advertising, Meta Platforms is likely to see an increase in ad spending. Meta may witness its fastest growth in the last 6 quarters as consumers are gradually becoming more open to spending on digital advertising. The digital advertising channel is Meta’s primary revenue source.</p>
<p>Alphabet is also likely to benefit considerably from a rise in consumer spending on digital ads. According to Bernstein analysts, “if the digital ad space is like riding a roller coaster, we are just about done with the boring/tough part, slowly climbing to the top chain link by chain link.”</p>
<p>For Q2, Alphabet’s revenue growth is likely to come in at 4.5%, its highest over the last three quarters.</p>

<p>Private banks are exploring blockchain-based "certificate of deposit" tokens (CDs) that will replace deposits and customary notes. Besides, they can also easily integrate with CBDCs. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/korean-alternative-stablecoins-cbdc/">Korean Banks Start Research on Alternative for Stablecoins and CBDC</a></p>
<p>South Korea has always been at the forefront of introducing new advancements and developments in its financial and economic structures. Recently, several private banks in South Korea have come together to study the potential of tokenized deposit technology. This technology will basically serve as an alternative to both private stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDCs</a>). Local media publication Maeli Business News Korea reported that top private-sector banking institutions such as Hana Bank and Woori Bank have shown interest in the “certificate of deposit” tokens (CDs).</p>
<h2>Alternative for Stablecoins and CBDC</h2>
<p>CDs are nothing but tokenized bank deposits placed on a blockchain platform. Their aim is to replace deposits and customary notes without disrupting the existing banking system. Similar to other traditional banking services, CDs require identity verification of the same standards.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800018&amp;year=2023&amp;no=562428" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> cites anonymous senior bankers who noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“CD tokens are perceived as stable from the banks’ perspective since they do not differ significantly from the current system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Hana Bank is looking into CD tokens, and Woori Bank&#8217;s research department has published a report on these tokens. From the bankers&#8217; point of view, CDs appear to have few drawbacks. The interest in them arises from concerns raised among financial regulators due to stablecoin failures in 2022, as mentioned in the report.</p>
<h2>CD Tokens Will Be Compatible with CBDCs</h2>
<p>Currently, central banks across the world have been working on central bank digital currencies. Thus, it&#8217;s important that any developments that happen within the banking space, have a consideration for the CBDCs.</p>
<p>A significant advantage of CDs is their potential compatibility with CBDCs. Both Hana Bank and Woori Bank are part of a proof-of-concept test for a CBDC led by the Bank of Korea.</p>
<p>In July, the Bank of Korea shared its ongoing preparations for the possible introduction of a CBDC. They were exploring the use of smart contracts, offline payments using near-field communications, and cross-border payments.</p>
<p>The pilot program, involving 14 private banks, is already in operation. However, there are still some technical challenges. While the system managed to handle 2,000 transactions per second, which is higher than most domestic payment systems, it eventually slowed down as it approached its capacity. The Bank of Korea is now working on enhancing the technical capabilities of the project.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bank-of-america-ripple-sec-ruling/">Bank of America Highlights Uncertainty in Ripple vs SEC Ruling</a></p>
<p>The legal battle between <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a> and the United States <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) has been closely watched by the crypto community, and a recent court ruling has added further complexity to an already contentious issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of America Corp</a> (NYSE: BAC) emphasizes in a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/24/implications-of-ripple-sec-court-ruling-for-wider-crypto-industry-are-unclear-bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/19857399/874/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-ripple-labs-inc/">ruling</a> falls short of providing clarity on broader regulatory concerns and fails to establish a clear precedent for other tokens.</p>
<h2>Ripple vs SEC: Uncertainty in the Ruling</h2>
<p>While the court ruled partially in favor of Ripple by stating that XRP sales through exchanges and algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, it also found that institutional sales of XRP tokens violated federal securities laws. This mixed decision creates ambiguity in how other cryptocurrencies may be affected by similar regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>The Bank of America research report acknowledges that the implications of the court’s ruling are not straightforward to determine due to Ripple’s XRP offerings’ uniqueness. This uniqueness makes it difficult to apply the court’s ruling to other digital assets with different use cases and functionalities.</p>
<p>Notably, Ripple’s XRP has been acknowledged as a trailblazing digital currency that serves a specific purpose within the Ripple network. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, XRP functions as a bridge currency, allowing for quick and low-cost cross-border transactions.</p>
<p>This utility-focused use case distinguishes XRP from typical investment-focused cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The unique characteristics of XRP have attracted the interest of financial organizations looking to streamline their cross-border payment procedures.</p>
<p>To promote healthy growth and mainstream adoption of digital assets, the report stresses the importance of clear and comprehensive regulatory guidelines. A well-defined regulatory framework will instill investor confidence and provide market participants with a transparent understanding of the rules governing the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Remarkably, Analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss highlight that the court’s decision was significantly influenced by an initial unregistered offering and sale of XRP to institutional investors. They noted that this early sale to institutional investors laid the foundation for a secondary market for <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a>, which subsequently included programmatic sales on digital asset exchanges.</p>
<h2>Bank of America’s Distinction in Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>The recent court ruling in the Ripple Labs and SEC case has prompted Bank of America to reiterate its differentiation between the trading of blockchain-native crypto tokens and tokenized traditional assets.</p>
<p>While the bank noted that regulations for blockchain-native tokens are still being established, the trading of tokenized traditional assets, such as Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), repos, and gold, already adheres to well-established rules, with trading volumes reaching trillions of dollars.</p>
<p>Rival broker Needham, on the other hand, sees the court’s decision as a favorable step for crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) in its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-coinbase-unregistered-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing case</a> with the SEC.  Needham emphasized that the ruling will reduce regulatory pressure on the company.</p>
