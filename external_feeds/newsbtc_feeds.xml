					<description><![CDATA[After the Bitcoin price hit a new yearly high of $32,410 last Friday, June 23, the price rally has stalled for the time being. While the long-term outlook looks extremely bullish due to various Bitcoin spot ETF applications, there are currently a few reasons in the short-term which prevent a continuation for now. Today, Wednesday, June 28, several negative news are weighing on the market&#8217;s sentiment. First and foremost, the depegging of the fourth largest stablecoin by market cap, TrueUSD (TUSD), may have unsettled investors. As Bitcoinist reported earlier today, the latest revelations surrounding Prime Trust have raised new doubts that TUSD is fully backed with reserves. Remarkably, TUSD is the most important trading pair (BTC/TUSD) in the entire market, with around 15% and $2.6 billion in trading volume on Binance in the last 24 hours. The rumors could have a negative impact, as shown by previous stablecoin depeggings by USDT and USDC. 🚨 TUSD depegging: New crypto drama unfolding? 1/@adamscochran raises several red flags: &#8211; Auditor who attested $TUSD audits (in Prime Trust) is the rebranded old FTX US auditor &#8211; Oracle price is obtained from a single entity &#8211; Bank partners are unknown — Jake Simmons (@realJakeSimmons) June 28, 2023 Another factor that is probably having a negative impact on the Bitcoin price is the behavior of Bitcoin miners. As Glassnode reports today, Bitcoin miners are currently experiencing extremely high interaction with exchanges, sending an all-time high of $128 million in BTC to exchanges, representing 315% of their daily revenue. In an analysis today, CryptoQuant writes that miners have sent over $1 billion in BTC to exchanges since June 15. About 33,860 BTC were sent to derivatives exchanges, although the majority flowed back into their own wallets. Miners saw a reduction in their reserves of about 8,000 BTC. Remarkably, only a small portion was sent to spot trading exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Struggles As Bears Attempt To Drive It Below $30,000 According to the on-chain experts, this could indicate that miners are using their newly minted coins as collateral in derivatives trading. A good example of this type of trading is so-called &#8220;hedging,&#8221; where bets are made in the opposite direction to the market consensus. Bitcoin Consolidates, More Reasons Also weighing on market sentiment could be the record-breaking amount of BTC options expiring on Friday, June 30. Traders could take a wait-and-see approach in the run-up. However, Greeks.Live analysts comment that institutions such as Fidelity and BlackRock continue to drive the positive developments; the volume of BTC block calls now accounts for more than a third of the total volume. &#8220;Both BTC and ETH are currently significantly above their maxpain points, but due to the weakness in ETH prices, a large number of market makers have continued to sell ETH calls, while buyers have concentrated more on BTC, which has caused ETH IV to be significantly lower than BTC,&#8221; the analysts say. Related Reading: Bitcoin Starts To Bite Back Says Reptilian Technical Signal The market may also be on a wait-and-see approach ahead of Friday&#8217;s release of the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) index numbers. &#8220;After a similar PCE report spurred BTC from $26k to $28k, we wait with bated breath. A positive PCE outcome can spark a bullish uptrend in BTC,&#8221; the co-founders of Glassnode (@Negentropic_) write. Last but not least, it should be noted that Bitcoin price is facing an extremely important resistance area $31,000 and consolidation is normal. After last week&#8217;s rapid rise, the daily RSI is still just below the overbought area at 66.3. As analyst @52Skew points out, BTC remains in a tight consolidation, with price fluctuating between supply and demand blocks. &#8220;4H / 1D EMAs catching up to price &#38; in key $29K area,&#8221; the analyst notes via Twitter and surmises, referring to Binance Open interest, &#8220;Pretty much still the same, chop chop. Eventually there will be liquidity grab imo; which will probably lead to a trap.&#8221; At press time, the Bitcoin price remained in its tight consolidation range.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) has found itself in the midst of a regulatory storm as two prominent exchanges in the United States have attracted the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has not only focused on these exchanges but has also classified certain altcoins, including Cardano (ADA), as securities. Consequently, ADA has been directly affected by the recent scrutiny imposed by the SEC. In response to the SEC&#8217;s statements, the team behind Cardano has issued a statement expressing their disagreement with the regulatory body&#8217;s position. However, it appears that the consequences of the SEC scrutiny are starting to manifest.  The latest reports indicate that specific Cardano trading pairs will be delisted from Huobi, a development that has very little impact on the price of ADA. Market Reaction And Impact On Cardano (ADA) Price Despite the recent news of specific ADA trading pairs being delisted, the market response has been relatively subdued. The current price of ADA on CoinGecko stands at $0.27, reflecting a decline of 1.8% in the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that this price movement cannot be solely attributed to the delisting announcement.

This indicates that, despite the delisting news and regulatory scrutiny, the market sentiment towards ADA has remained relatively stable. Investors and traders have shown confidence in the token&#8217;s ability to withstand challenges and maintain its value, even in the face of negative developments. ADA market cap currently at $9.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Huobi Removes ADA Trading Pairs As Part Of Strategic Decision Huobi, in an official statement, has announced the discontinuation of various trading pairs, including ADA/USDD, starting from 8:00 a.m. (UTC) on June 29. The reason provided by Huobi for this action is their dedication to improving the trading experience for users. However, it is important to note that trading ADA with USDT and Bitcoin (BTC) will remain unaffected.  By considering the recent delisting by Huobi in the context of previous actions taken by the SEC, it becomes evident that ADA is dealing with a challenging regulatory landscape. These developments raise questions about the future classification and regulatory treatment of ADA within the cryptocurrency market. Featured image from Hong Kong Lawyer]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The XRP community continues to eagerly await a ruling in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So far, all speculations about a supposed end date have been wrong. The judge in charge, Analisa Torres, is taking more time for her ruling than many legal experts predicted based on previous proceedings. However, this does not stop lawyer John E. Deaton, who is representing the XRP army in the legal case as amicus curiae, from making a new prediction. In the latest CryptoLaw broadcast, lawyer Deaton speculated that Judge Torres will issue the summary judgment on September 6, 2023. Ripple Vs. SEC: Why September 6 Might Be The End Date In the live stream, the lawyer explains that he has tried to give a prediction for a verdict date several times in the past. For this, he looked at Judge Torres&#8217; previous proceedings. The finding was that Torres ruled at different speeds once the Daubert/expert motions were decided: sometimes it was on the same day, in other cases it was after two, four and six months respectively. Related Reading: XRP Traders Show Capitulation, Why This Could Be Bullish Based on this, Deaton made the prediction that Judge Torres will rule on May 6, by early June at the latest (the average: three months). As a reminder, Torres ruled on the Daubert motions in the case between Ripple and the SEC on March 6 this year. Now that those deadlines have passed, Deaton came up with a new prediction: according to the lawyer, Judge Torres will issue a summary judgment after the full six months, on September 6 this year. As Deaton also pointed out, the length of the litigation between Ripple and the SEC is within the usual range so far and does not take longer than other cases. In another comment, Deaton noted that Judge Torres may delay the ruling because she understands the importance of the SEC v. Ripple case. She knows that thousands of people, including the appellate courts, will be reviewing her summary judgment decision in the Ripple case. She also has a staggering 500 open cases to decide, 44 of which are criminal cases. Ripple: Waiting on a Decision https://t.co/ty0LG3AASV — CryptoLaw (@CryptoLawUS) June 27, 2023 XRP Price Loses Steam The delay of the ruling in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC seems to have upset XRP investors. A look at the 1-day chart of XRP shows that the price is in a descending trend channel after the price failed to break above the resistance at $0.50 in the higher time frames over the past two weeks. Related Reading: Ripple Emails Reveal: XRP Buybacks Were On The Table To Prop Up Price A breakout from the trend channel is crucial to make a new run towards resistance at $0.50.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The XRP community continues to eagerly await a ruling in the legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). So far, all speculations about a supposed end date have been wrong. The judge in charge, Analisa Torres, is taking more time for her ruling than many legal experts predicted based on previous proceedings.</p>
<p>However, this does not stop lawyer John E. Deaton, who is representing the XRP army in the legal case as amicus curiae, from making a new prediction. In the latest CryptoLaw broadcast, lawyer Deaton speculated that Judge Torres will issue the summary judgment on September 6, 2023.</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: Why September 6 Might Be The End Date</h2>
<p>In the live stream, the lawyer explains that he has tried to give a prediction for a verdict date several times in the past. For this, he looked at Judge Torres&#8217; previous proceedings. The finding was that Torres ruled at different speeds once the Daubert/expert motions were decided: sometimes it was on the same day, in other cases it was after two, four and six months respectively.</p>

<p>Based on this, Deaton made the prediction that Judge Torres will rule on May 6, by early June at the latest (the average: three months). As a reminder, Torres ruled on the Daubert motions in the case between Ripple and the SEC on March 6 this year.</p>
<p>Now that those deadlines have passed, Deaton came up with a new prediction: according to the lawyer, Judge Torres will issue a summary judgment after the full six months, on September 6 this year. As Deaton also pointed out, the length of the litigation between Ripple and the SEC is within the usual range so far and does not take longer than other cases.</p>
<p>In another comment, Deaton noted that Judge Torres may delay the ruling because she understands the importance of the SEC v. Ripple case. She knows that thousands of people, including the appellate courts, will be reviewing her summary judgment decision in the Ripple case. She also has a staggering 500 open cases to decide, 44 of which are criminal cases.</p>

<h2>XRP Price Loses Steam</h2>
<p>The delay of the ruling in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC seems to have upset XRP investors. A look at the 1-day chart of XRP shows that the price is in a descending trend channel after the price failed to break above the resistance at $0.50 in the higher time frames over the past two weeks.</p>


A breakout from the trend channel is crucial to make a new run towards resistance at $0.50. Currently, XRP is testing the middle line of the trend channel. A break below $0.4730 could mean a further drop towards the lower end of the trend channel at $0.46.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Cash (BCH) recently experienced a remarkable surge, registering more than 100% increase. As one of the leading digital currencies, Bitcoin Cash has often been compared to its predecessor, Bitcoin (BTC), but it has also carved its own path in the ever-evolving crypto landscape. BCH, a cryptocurrency born out of a hard fork from Bitcoin in August 2017, shares the same underlying technology as its predecessor but aims to address some of the scalability issues that Bitcoin faced. With its larger block size and faster transaction times, Bitcoin Cash aimed to become a more efficient and accessible form of digital currency. However, it has faced its fair share of scrutiny and volatility over the years.  Now, with its recent meteoric rise, the question on everyone&#8217;s mind is: What factors are driving this surge in Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s price, and what does it mean for the future of this digital asset? Bitcoin Cash Emerges As Top Performer Bitcoin Cash BCH has exhibited an exceptional performance, positioning itself as one of the leading performers over both short and long timeframes. Over the past seven days, BCH has shown an impressive surge, soaring by a remarkable 106.3%. Source: Coingecko Even in the past 24 hours, it remains a top contender with a gain of 2.8%, defying the prevailing sentiment of stagnation observed in recent days. The current trading price for BCH, according to CoinGecko, stands at $226.69, further solidifying its upward trajectory. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, experienced a significant breakthrough by surpassing the $30,000 mark with remarkable momentum, briefly breaching the $31,000 threshold before the start of the weekend. BCH market cap currently at $4.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com However, the bullish momentum was unable to sustain itself, leading to a resurgence of selling pressure and subsequently pushing the price back towards the $30,000 level. At the time of writing, the primary cryptocurrency is trading around $30,444, reflecting a meager setback in its upward trajectory. Factors Driving BCH Price Surge Recent developments have shed light on the factors driving the impressive surge in the price of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). According to a new BCH price report, the launch of EDX Markets, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by industry giants Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp., and Fidelity Digital Assets, has significantly benefited BCH. EDX Markets will offer trading services for various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Cash, providing increased accessibility and liquidity for BCH investors.

Source: CoinMarketCap Furthermore, another significant catalyst for the surge of the crypto&#8217;s price can be attributed to its recent game-changing upgrade. In May, Bitcoin Cash underwent a network hard fork that not only enhanced the network&#8217;s security and privacy measures but also introduced plans for CashTokens. This innovative feature holds immense potential for building decentralized applications (dApps) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, opening up new possibilities and driving increased adoption.

					<description><![CDATA[An altcoin with a long and storied history, Monero is currently running to the upside in a way it never has before. After closing higher for twelve consecutive days &#8211; a new record for the privacy-focused altcoin &#8211; Monero looks poised to once again make history with a thirteenth straight higher close. What&#8217;s happened after other Monero winning streaks in the past? Let’s take a closer look at the price history to find out. Monero Win Streak Making History Monero&#8217;s current winning streak of twelve consecutively higher closes breaks the previous record set in 2021 of ten straight higher closes. While the price advance is clearly impressive, its unprecedented nature means we&#8217;ll have to look at earlier and shorter win streaks to get an understanding of what might be ahead for Monero in the future. In other words, we&#8217;ll use the prior shorter historical win streaks to generate enough occurrences to make a more statistically meaningful conclusion.

Holding time is defined as the amount of time one held the asset before exiting. For example, if one hypothetically purchased Monero following the trigger event (i.e., 6 straight higher closes) and sold it 30 days later, this would be a holding time of 30 days.

Past Monero Win Streaks Suggest More Strength Ahead The hypothetical average trade results for Monero (XMR) show a consistent positive edge across all holding times from 7 days through one year. Please note that even though the average historical trade results are positive for each hold time we examine, losses have also occurred for each hold time. Monero Hold Time Results for Six Straight Higher Closes &#124; SOURCE: Tableau Going out to a roughly three-month hold time, the past win streaks have delivered far greater gains on average, with an average trade of +65.1% with a 90-day hold, +121.7% with a 180-day hold, to an impressive +373.8% with a 365-day hold.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) failed to break through the $31,500 resistance level and has since retreated to a range between $30,300 and $30,800 in the past few days. The cryptocurrency has also been unable to reclaim the $31,000 territory, leading some to believe that Bitcoin bears may still have the upper hand. Despite recent signs of strength, Bitcoin&#8217;s inability to overcome key resistance levels has left many investors wary. The digital currency&#8217;s failure to break out of its current range suggests that it may be vulnerable to further losses in the short term. Liquidity Grab Sends Bitcoin Tumbling Bitcoin has been on a remarkable run since June 15th, gaining 25% in nine days. However, according to crypto analyst Justin Bennet, recent price action suggests a pullback may be in order. BTC longs have piled into the rally, but as Bennet notes, Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t usually offer free rides for those late to the party. A pullback from current levels just above $30,000 would make sense, and the price action on the 8-hour time frame looks very similar to the April swing high. Related Reading: BLUR Up By 11% Following This Announcement Bitcoin closed above $30,400 on the 8-hour trend line in April, only to close below it within the next few candles. While BTC has held up better this time, the 4-hour time frame has already broken below $30,400. The next few 8-hour candles will confirm whether this breakdown is sustained. If so, Bennet believes a pullback into the $28,000 area to flush out late BTC longs seems likely. How the Bitcoin price action develops at $27,000-$28,000 if and when tested will determine where BTC trends in July. On the other hand, a sustained break above $31,000 would suggest that bulls remain in control and expose $32,500. Nevertheless, despite the uncertain market conditions, the current uptrend in Bitcoin is far from over as long as bulls do not lose the $30,000 line.  Historical data suggests that if Bitcoin can consolidate and maintain this key level of support, there are many chances for it to continue to breach higher levels and mark new yearly highs. Conversely, the $29,500 support level will be the next floor to watch if Bitcoin succumbs to bearish pressure. A downside movement could continue if BTC drops below this level, potentially leading to a further decline toward the $27,300 line.  Related Reading: Ripple Thrives Despite Legal Battle – What’s The Market Reaction Of XRP? Despite the potential downside risks, the Bitcoin market continues to receive positive news with the applications of Fidelity and Blackrock&#8217;s Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF).

					<description><![CDATA[According to Google Trends data, interest in Bitcoin is heading to historic lows as of June 27. In a screenshot shared by a Twitter user, organic searches related to “Bitcoin” have dropped in the last six months.  Google Trends is a free tool that tracks how people search for specific terms or phrases on Google, the world’s largest search engine. Interest in a particular topic or asset can be ascertained in real time depending on the number of search terms. Currently, few users are searching for the term “Bitcoin.” Interest In Bitcoin Fast Falling Notably, BTC and crypto prices have steadily recovered after bears wiped gains last year. As an illustration, BTC is up roughly 87% when writing and trending at around 2023 highs. On the other hand, organic searches related to the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency are at multi-year lows, sharply falling in the first half of 2023. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Shines Among Top Gainers, Tallies 78% In Last Week Data from Google Trends show that interest in searches around Bitcoin is below 2018 levels and could drop lower, considering how fast the reading has been free-falling in the first half of the year. This “disinterest” in Bitcoin seemed to have been spilled over from the second half of 2022.  In the first half of last year, searches temporarily expanded before dropping. Even so, at that time, Bitcoin search readings, according to Google Trends, were lower than that registered in 2021 when it was at record highs. Based on this development, there appears to be a direct correlation between sentiment and prices, as deduced from Google Trends data on Bitcoin. BTC prices peaked at over $69,000 in November 2021 after steadily rising from late 2019. Notably, prices more than doubled as they rallied below $10,000, breaking December 2017 highs of around $20,000 and soaring to new all-time highs of about $70,000 registered in Q4 2021. When prices roared, searches related to Bitcoin, Google Trends data shows, also rose.

From the current BTC price action, there is a divergence between Google Trends data on Bitcoin and prices. While prices are rising, shaking off bears of Q4 2022 and the first half of Q1 2023, interest in Bitcoin is shrinking.  This observation can be pinned on several factors, including increasing regulatory scrutiny of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the United States and worldwide.
