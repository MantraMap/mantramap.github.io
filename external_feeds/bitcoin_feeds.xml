<h2>Michael Burry on Audits of Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>Famous investor and founder of investment firm Scion Asset Management, Michael Burry, said Friday that proof-of-reserves (POR) audits of cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance and the collapsed exchange FTX, are meaningless.</p>
<p>Burry is best known for being the first investor to foresee and profit from the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2010. He is profiled in &#8220;The Big Short,&#8221; a book by Michael Lewis about the mortgage crisis, which was made into a movie starring Christian Bale.</p>
<p>Commenting on accounting firm Mazars Group <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/accounting-firm-mazars-stops-proof-of-reserve-audits-for-crypto-firms-binance-audit-removed-from-the-web/">halting</a> proof-of-reserves audits for crypto companies, Burry tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the problem. In 2005 when I started using a new kind of credit default swap, our auditors were learning on the job. That&#8217;s not a good thing. Same goes for FTX, Binance, etc. The audit is essentially meaningless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Burry&#8217;s tweet references an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-16/mazars-to-pause-all-work-for-crypto-clients-binance-says-lbqbamw7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> by Bloomberg explaining that the French accounting firm suspended work on crypto firms because of concerns over intense media scrutiny and indications that markets have not been reassured by the proof-of-reserves reports it has published so far, including for Binance, Crypto.com, and Kucoin.</p>
<p>The news followed <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1596227031637045248?s=20&amp;t=zWVhWf7oKMuMfpYplr7qRg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticism</a> from the CEO of rival crypto exchange Kraken, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/krakens-jesse-powell-takes-aim-at-newly-launched-proof-of-reserve-lists-por-audit-requires-cryptographic-proof/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jesse Powell</a>, who recently <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1600787933065117696?s=20&amp;t=tKz4ziLUnQXfK8Ml6ZoQcw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">denounced</a> Binance&#8217;s POR audited by Mazars. This week, more than $3 billion in funds were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-withdrawals-binance-ceo-warns-of-bumpy-months-ahead/">withdrawn</a> from Binance.</p>

<p>Addressing concerns over his exchange&#8217;s POR in an interview with CNBC Thursday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) also claimed most accounting firms do not know how to audit cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
<p>The executive was asked why Binance does not use one of the Big Four accounting firms — Deloitte, EY, KPMG, and Pricewaterhousecoopers (PwC) — to audit its books, and whether the crypto firm was unable to provide files and data for auditors to be comfortable giving their stamp of approval. The Binance boss simply replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many of them don&#8217;t even know how to audit crypto exchanges.</p></blockquote>

After the statement, bitcoiners grew concerned that the now-deceased computer scientist Hal Finney&#x2019;s Twitter account would be terminated. It seems that since then, Finney&#x2019;s wife Fran Finney has taken over Hal&#x2019;s social media account in hopes Musk won&#x2019;t purge her husbands account.</strong></p>
<h2>Fran Finney Has Control of Hal&#x2019;s Twitter Account &#x2014; Says She Activated It to Protect the Account From Elon Musk&#x2019;s Inactive Twitter Account Purge</h2>
<p>On Dec. 16, 2022, the bitcoin supporter Jameson Lopp <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1603845036201938965?s=20&t=KTDlIgXJL_QLmBYEJ2f-Qg">tweeted</a> an alert letting people know that Hal Finney&#x2019;s Twitter account &#x2014; <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin">@halfin</a> &#x2014; was now active. &#x201C;ALERT,&#x201D; Lopp said. &#x201C;Someone has taken control of Hal&#x2019;s Twitter account. Consider that we don&#x2019;t know the intentions of the new owner; it could be compromised.&#x201D; Lopp&#x2019;s tweet got a reply from the @halfin Twitter account, which disclosed why Finney&#x2019;s account was now active again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-564429 size-full" title="Hal Finney's Wife Fran Activates Her Husband's Twitter Account to Protect It From 'Being Purged' by Elon Musk" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fran3032.jpg" alt="Hal Finney's Wife Fran Activates Her Husband's Twitter Account to Protect It From 'Being Purged' by Elon Musk" width="1280" height="500" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fran3032-300x117.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fran3032-1024x400.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fran3032-768x300.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fran3032.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>&#x201C;This is @franfinney. I am tweeting for Hal (as @pavlenex thought) to avoid his account being purged by Elon,&#x201D; Finney&#x2019;s account <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1603847718039744512?s=20&t=KTDlIgXJL_QLmBYEJ2f-Qg">tweeted</a> in response to Lopp&#x2019;s tweet on Friday. Fran Finney, Hal&#x2019;s wife, also <a href="https://twitter.com/franfinney/status/1603856782862217217?s=20&t=KTDlIgXJL_QLmBYEJ2f-Qg">confirmed</a> from her personal account that she was the one behind activating the account after it wasn&#x2019;t used since 2010.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I appreciate how people monitor Hal&#x2019;s account. Thank you,&#x201D; Fran Finney&#x2019;s account said to Lopp.</p>
<p>The news follows Elon Musk detailing that Twitter would remove 1.5 billion inactive Twitter names on Dec. 9. Following Musk&#x2019;s statements, a great number of bitcoin supporters grew worried that Finney&#x2019;s account would be purged and they <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/while-elon-musk-plans-to-purge-1-5-billion-inactive-twitter-names-bitcoiners-beg-him-to-preserve-hal-finneys-account/">begged him</a> to preserve Finney&#x2019;s account. Furthermore, there&#x2019;s been some weird signings taking place as well as a Bitcointalk forum user named &#x201C;Onesignature&#x201D; <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/an-unknown-individual-signed-a-message-associated-with-btc-block-1018-reward-was-minted-16-days-after-satoshi-launched-bitcoin/">signed</a> a message <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/recently-signed-2009-bitcoin-block-reward-linked-to-hal-finneys-set-of-btc-transactions/">associated</a> with a block Finney had mined.</p>

<p>Additionally, not too long after that odd signing event, the &#x2018;pharma bro&#x2019; and former hedge fund manager <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/so-called-pharma-bro-martin-shkreli-turns-crypto-bro-i-started-using-uniswap-in-prison/">Martin Shkreli</a> shared a signed message associated with an address linked to Finney. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-mysterious-person-signs-a-2009-btc-address-message-shared-by-martin-shkreli-mentions-convicted-felon-paul-le-roux/">The message</a> was tied to the address Hal used to receive 10 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from Satoshi Nakamoto and the message said: &#x201C;This Transaction was made by Paul Leroux to Hal Finney on January 12, 2009 #bitcoin.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s not known if anyone has reached out to Fran Finney directly about these odd address signings and whether or not she knows why someone may have access to Hal&#x2019;s private keys. Shkreli told the software developer Greg Maxwell that he planned to reach out to the Finneys to ask about the private keys. The controversial Shkreli, however, did not disclose how he obtained the message that used an old 2009 address with a message about Paul Le Roux.</p>

SBF is held in custody at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS), a jail called Fox Hill that is known for being filthy, and was accused of prison maltreatment last year. Acting commissioner of The Bahamas Corrections, Doan Cleare, detailed that SBF is in a dorm-style cell with roughly five other inmates.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Now Resides in an Overcrowded, Filthy Prison — Corrections Commissioner Says SBF Is &#8216;Getting His Medication on Time&#8217; and He&#8217;s in &#8216;Good Spirits&#8217;</h2>
<p>After living in luxury at Albany Place in Nassau, Bahamas, the FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is now located in the maximum security unit at the Bahamas Department of Correctional Services (BDOCS). The prison doesnt have a <a href="http://www.tribune242.com/news/2021/apr/12/murphy-denies-prison-maltreatment/">great reputation</a> and according to a New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/14/sam-bankman-frieds-ex-caroline-ellison-likely-works-with-feds/">report</a>, the jail is “maggot-infested” and a “hellhole” of a penitentiary. The Post also details that SBF’s family members have been attempting to get the former FTX executive vegan meals.</p>

<p>BDOCS is referred to as Fox Hill prison and it is also known for being <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-bahamian-prison-harsh-conditions-2022-12?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=yahoo.com">overcrowded.</a> There are numerous human rights <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/es/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/amr140042003en.pdf">reports</a> littered all over the web about the prison’s alleged maltreatment issues. The journalist Tiffany Fong <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_/status/1603089937527885825?s=20&amp;t=1ckh1Fft3gFtWNp7VlVT5w">tweeted</a> that the U.S. State Department flagged Fox Hill prison for being &#8220;infested with rats, maggots, and insects,” and “inmates removed human waste by bucket” and “developed bed sores from lying on the bare ground.” Other <a href="http://understaff/">reports</a> reveal that Fox Hill is understaffed and some inmates are only “allowed outside for 30 minutes a week.”</p>

<p>Acting commissioner of The Bahamas Corrections, Doan Cleare, told <a href="https://thenassauguardian.com/cleare-says-sbf-in-good-spirits-at-prison/">thenassauguardian.com</a> that SBF is being in the Fox Hill medical department. Cleare further disclosed that after the former FTX executive spent his first night in jail, he was in “good spirits.” “Mr. Fried is housed in [the] Maximum Security Housing Unit in [the] sick bay,” the commissioner told the reporter.</p>
<p>“He is getting his medication on time,” The Bahamas Corrections commissioner added. “Only in-person lawyer visits [are permitted] at this time, along with personnel from the American Embassy. All others will be via video conferencing. He is with five other inmates in a dorm-style setting.” SBF will be held in custody at Fox Hill until February 8th, 2023, if he isn&#8217;t extradited to the U.S. first.</p>

While 20% of BUSD&#x2019;s supply was drained since last month, statistics show that 14.77% of the reduction took place on Dec. 13. </strong></p>
<h2>BUSD&#x2019;s Supply Declined by 3.24 Billion Since Dec. 13</h2>
<p>Amid the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-speculation-and-rumors-surrounding-binance-exchange-token-bnb-suffers-losses-from-the-alleged-fud/">speculation</a> surrounding Binance and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-withdrawals-binance-ceo-warns-of-bumpy-months-ahead/">large number of withdrawals</a> (over $3B) that took place on Dec. 13, 2022, the stablecoin BUSD has seen its supply reduced by 14.77% in a matter of three days. Over the course of the last month, stats show BUSD had 23 billion tokens in circulation, and today it is 20% lower at 18.58 billion BUSD coins.</p>
<p>The news follows Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-and-paxos-backed-stablecoin-busds-market-cap-climbs-22-in-2-months/">reporting</a> on the Binance-associated and Paxos-backed stablecoin climbing 22% higher in two months on Oct. 22, 2022. <span style="font-weight: 400;">It should be noted that while BUSD shares its logo and name with the crypto exchange Binance, the stablecoin is managed by </span><a href="https://paxos.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paxos</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto company Paxos also manages pax dollar (USDP) and pax gold (PAXG). </span>The BUSD increase at the time was taking place while tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) and usd coin (USDC) saw their coins in circulation depleting. In terms of market capitalization, BUSD&#x2019;s market cap is the sixth-largest crypto market valuation today, and it entered the top ten standings right after Terra&#x2019;s UST collapsed.</p>

<p>30-day stats show BUSD saw the largest monthly decline out of all of the top ten stablecoins by market cap, except for Gemini&#x2019;s stablecoin GUSD. Gemini too has been dealing with turbulent markets and recent reports that the exchange suffered a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-crypto-exchange-gemini-suffers-from-data-breach-5-7-million-emails-allegedly-leaked/">user data leak</a>. Furthermore, a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-owes-gemini-customers-900-million-exchange-is-attempting-to-recoup-assets/">report</a> notes that Genesis Global Capital allegedly owes Gemini $900 million.</p>
<p>GUSD&#x2019;s coins in circulation have dropped 25% lower during the last 30 days, which is 5% more than the reduction recorded by BUSD last month. GUSD&#x2019;s reduction was not as drastic as BUSD&#x2019;s as GUSD&#x2019;s dollar-pegged tokens in circulation started to decline on Nov. 16, 2022. BUSD has seen $6.61 billion in 24-hour global trade volume and cryptocompare.com metrics show a great deal of BUSD pairs are swapped with tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) today.</p>
<p>Binance is BUSD&#x2019;s most active exchange on Dec. 16, 2022, and on Pancakeswap $2,896,034 in BUSD&#x2019;s trades with tether have been recorded during the past 24 hours. At press time, out of the $851 billion crypto economy, BUSD&#x2019;s market capitalization dominates by 2.184% on Friday.</p>
<p>Out of the $140 billion stablecoin economy, BUSD is still the third largest dollar-pegged coin, equating to 13.271% of the entire stablecoin economy&#x2019;s valuation. In addition to the BUSD coins in circulation statistics taken from coingecko.com, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221115082643/https://etherscan.io/token/0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53">archived etherscan.io records</a> indicate that BUSD&#x2019;s supply has <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x4Fabb145d64652a948d72533023f6E7A623C7C53">shrunk by 20%</a> as well during the last 30 days.</p>

<h2>Solana&#x2019;s Prior Relationship With FTX, Alameda Continues to Hurt the Project, Solana-Based Exchange Raydium Exploited for $2 Million</h2>
<p>Since the collapse of FTX, the crypto asset solana (SOL) has taken a beating and the digital asset that was once a top ten contender is now close to being pushed out of the top 20 standings in terms of market capitalization. The reason the Solana project has been hit so badly compared to other crypto assets in the space is because of the project&#x2019;s deep relationship with FTX and Alameda Research. The project&#x2019;s team members published a post highlighting the connection as the Solana Foundation <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-facts-ftx-bankruptcy">wrote</a> about the situation on Nov. 9.</p>

<p>The foundation admitted it had &#x201C;~$1M in cash or cash equivalents on FTX.com as of 11/6/22 when FTX.com ceased to process withdrawals.&#x201D; Additionally, the Solana Foundation had &#x201C;3.24m shares of FTX Trading LTD common stock,&#x201D; &#x201C;3.43m FTT tokens,&#x201D; and &#x201C;134.54m SRM tokens.&#x201D; Furthermore, 58.08 million SOL was sold to FTX and Alameda since 2020.

FTX was responsible for minting the wrapped tokens and ever since the collapse, they have traded for well below <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s spot market values.</p>
<p>There were also issues with the decentralized exchange software built on Solana, Serum, as developers had to <a href="https://twitter.com/m_schneider/status/1591636068650352640?s=20&t=1KIPuqsTVADYTjwz2gU2Zg">fork the project</a> because FTX had control of the project&#x2019;s &#x201C;upgrade key.&#x201D; Additionally, the hacker dubbed &#x201C;<a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x97f991971a37D4Ca58064e6a98FC563F03A71E5c">FTX Accounts Drainer</a>&#x201D; held a significant portion (20.28%) of the serum (SRM) supply. All of these factors had affected the Solana project negatively, and it did not help that Solana suffered from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/solana-network-suffers-another-outage-cyber-capital-founder-says-downtime-is-another-consequence-of-bad-design/">significant outages</a> one month prior to the FTX-related issues. Solana&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/solana/richlist/">rich list stats</a> do not help the project much either, as 50 holders own 25.36% of the SOL supply, and 100 holders own 33.90% of the supply. That&#x2019;s a significant number of SOL for 100 owners out of the 9,154,449 SOL holders today.</p>

<p>SOL has lost 8.5% in value during the last 30 days and since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211106204845/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana">Nov. 6, 2021</a>, the crypto asset is down 94.9% against the greenback. Cryptocompare.com metrics indicate that 38.5% of SOL trades on Dec. 16 are paired with tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>). 34.06% of SOL swaps are traded against the U.S. dollar, and 17.44% of SOL trades are swapped against BUSD. The most active exchanges today dealing with SOL trades include Coinbase, Binance, and Digifinex. On Nov. 6, 2021, SOL was ranked in the fourth position in terms of the largest crypto market caps and today, SOL is struggling to hold the 18th position.</p>
<p>Solana&#x2019;s market performance suffered even more bad news on Dec. 16 as the Solana-based exchange Raydium was <a href="https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol/status/1603762271028748289?s=20&t=ggpmF9_VcJLRF1coXQLtWA">exploited for $2 million</a>. After the Raydium <a href="https://twitter.com/prism_ag/status/1603752282083950592?s=20&t=-U7mw_adsQXCSjEKhfvWxg">discovery</a> highlighted that $2 million was &#x201C;<a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1603758780528861185?s=20&t=-U7mw_adsQXCSjEKhfvWxg">bridged to ETH</a>,&#x201D; SOL&#x2019;s market value dropped even more on Friday. By 10:15 a.m. (ET) SOL lost 6.1% against the greenback following the Raydium exploit reports.</p>

INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, Dec 16, 2022</strong> – LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, has recently launched ApeCoin (APE) staking in its &#8220;Earn” – “Flexible” section, users will be able to earn APE token with an annual return of 175% (floating adjustment), and withdraw anytime without locking.</p>
<p><strong>APE Staking Is the New Trend</strong></p>
<p>Recently, ApeCoin DAO (ApeDAO) has established an official staking protocol for ApeCoin (APE), which was created as a way for APE, BAYC, MAYC, and BAKC holders to earn rewards through staking. APE can be staked by itself or in conjunction with a BAYC, MAYC, or BAKC in one of the four staking pools, with each pool offering different levels of rewards.</p>
<p>The protocol was proposed in AIPs 21 and 22 and subsequently approved by the community on May 4, 2022. Following approval, the Ape Foundation enlisted Horizen Labs to provide a platform for the staking protocol according to the specifications set forth in the AIPs.</p>
<p>Staking is a common way to earn passive income in crypto space. This protocol basically allows holders of APE to put their idle tokens to work by staking them within various pools and earning additional rewards in the form of more APE. Being more than just a simple staking pool, the protocol has the distinction of offering layers of rewards for holders of certain NFTs. These NFTs grant holders access to exclusive staking pools, operating like a safe-deposit box key.</p>
<p>According to the recent data on dune.com, the protocol’s APE-Only Pool has reached an astonishing 175% APR. Apparently, staking APE has become a new trend. However, in order to join these staking pools, one must meet some requirements that may not be easy to meet. For instance, some pools require users to own Yuga Labs’ official NFTs to join, and these NFTs cannot be sold while it is committed in a BAYC or MAYC pool, otherwise users may lose all of their staked APEs.</p>
<p><strong>Earn APE on LBank Exchange</strong></p>
<p>To provide an alternative solution, LBank Exchange recently launched its own APE Staking in its “Earn” – “Flexible” section. Users will be able to earn 175% APR (floating adjustment) and enjoy daily rewards settlement by simply joining. And since it’s “Flexible”, there’s no locking required, users can withdraw their staked APE tokens whenever they want.</p>
<p>To join the APE Staking on LBank Exchange, just click <a href="https://www.lbank.com/locking-list.html">Earn</a> and find the APE on the list, then click “Join Now”. The minimum interest-bearing amount requires that users’ account assets are not less than 6 APE tokens, and there’s no limit on the maximum interest-bearing amount. The settlement process includes interest calculation on T+1 and interest payment on T+2.</p>
<p>Follow the new trend in crypto and seize the opportunity to earn 175% APR through APE Staking on LBank Exchange right now!</p>
<p><strong>Click [</strong><a href="https://www.lbank.com/locking-list.html"><strong>Earn</strong></a><strong>] to Participate</strong></p>
<p>* Assets registered in &#8220;APE Staking&#8221; do not affect trading or withdrawal. However, after registration, the assets that have been traded or withdrawn will not enter the interest calculation of the day. The amount gap will be released at 2:00 pm the next day.</p>
<p>* The freezing assets due to orders and participation in activities does not affect the interest calculation of assets.</p>

The token fell for a third consecutive day, with prices moving below a key price floor in the process. Polygon also extended recent declines, hitting a multi-week low as a result. </strong></p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) hit an all-time low in today&#x2019;s session, as sentiment in cryptocurrency markets remains bearish, following recent economic data.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.2845 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, less than a day after trading at $0.3026.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s sell-off comes as cardano fell for a third straight session, breaking out of a key support point in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the aforementioned floor is at the $0.3000 mark, which was broken once before, on November 21.</p>
<p>The 14-day relative strength index (RSI) also moved below a floor of 35.50, and as of writing is tracking at 30.91.</p>
<p>This is the lowest point the index has hit since October 22, with prices hitting a bottom of $0.3100 on that occasion.</p>

<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) was another notable token to fall today, with prices also moving lower for a third straight day.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.891 on Thursday, MATIC/USD dropped to a bottom of $0.8483 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this drop, polygon moved to its lowest point since November 30, when prices hit a bottom of $0.837</p>

<p>MATIC has since rebounded from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $0.8569, which is still nearly 4% lower than Thursday&#x2019;s floor.</p>
<p>This slight rebound comes as the RSI rejected a breakout of a point of support at the 43.00 level, and the index is currently at the 44.26 mark.</p>
<p>Historically, bulls have used this floor as a point of reentry, and should this reoccur, then we could see MATIC move back towards the $0.90 level.</p>

Mazars was conducting a number of POR audits for crypto exchanges like Binance, Crypto.com, and Kucoin following the FTX collapse last month. </strong></p>
<h2>Mazars Group Pauses Crypto Company Audits, Binance POR Scrubbed From the Web</h2>
<p>Reports detailed on Dec. 16, 2022, that the accounting firm <a href="https://twitter.com/MazarsGroup">Mazars Group</a> has paused doing POR audits for cryptocurrency exchanges. On Friday, a Binance spokesperson <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/16/mazars-suspends-all-work-with-crypto-clients-including-binance-cryptocom.html">told</a> CNBC that “Mazars has indicated that they will temporarily pause their work with all of their crypto clients globally, which include Crypto.com, Kucoin, and Binance.” The spokesperson added that “this means that we will not be able to work with Mazars for the moment.”</p>
<p>The news follows the recent <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1596227031637045248?s=20&amp;t=zWVhWf7oKMuMfpYplr7qRg">criticism</a> from Kraken’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/krakens-jesse-powell-takes-aim-at-newly-launched-proof-of-reserve-lists-por-audit-requires-cryptographic-proof/">Jesse Powell</a> on Nov. 25, and when he <a href="https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1600787933065117696?s=20&amp;t=tKz4ziLUnQXfK8Ml6ZoQcw">denounced</a> the Binance POR audited by Mazars on Dec. 8. Binance’s POR has been in the spotlight for quite some time and the company has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-speculation-and-rumors-surrounding-binance-exchange-token-bnb-suffers-losses-from-the-alleged-fud/">dealing</a> with lots of speculation, rumors, and FUD. Furthermore, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-withdrawals-binance-ceo-warns-of-bumpy-months-ahead/">experienced</a> a significant amount of withdrawals on Dec. 13, as more than $3 billion in funds were withdrawn from the exchange.</p>
<p>While Mazars is not doing POR audits for crypto exchanges, for now, the company has seemingly removed Binance’s POR from the internet. The page now says the “server cannot be located” when someone attempts to visit the Mazars-published Binance audit. At the time of writing, <a href="https://crypto.com/document/proof-of-reserves">Crypto.com’s audit</a> is still on the web and has not been removed.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://assets.staticimg.com/cms/media/3F1cJQjj2OaP8P4dLEoQmxkuwDlSryAGrLJSvmmDg.pdf">Mazars POR audit</a> drafted for the crypto exchange Kucoin is still live on the web as well. The difference between Crypto.com’s and Kucoin’s POR audits, compared to Binance’s POR audit, is that Crypto.com’s and Kucoin’s documents are hosted on their own websites. The Binance audit, completed on Nov. 22, 2022, at Bitcoin block height 764,327, was hosted solely on the Mazars website. At the time of writing, Mazars Group has not commented on the situation or explained why it stopped doing POR audits for crypto firms.</p>

Ethereum moved closer to the $1,200 level in today&#x2019;s session.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) fell below $17,000 in today&#x2019;s session, as markets continued to react to last month&#x2019;s retail sales data.</p>
<p>As retail sales in the United States disappointed, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $16,997.54 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This comes less than a day after prices were nearing a breakout of $18,000, hitting a peak of $17,725.88 in the process.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, bearish pressure intensified following a breakout of a floor at $17,200, with the price now trading $17,023.22.</p>
<p>This slight reversal comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved close to a support point of 45.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at the 47.05 level, and should price strength hit the aforementioned floor, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could land at $16,800.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also lower on Friday, as the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency fell closer to the $1,200 mark.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a bottom of $1,210.35 earlier in the day, which comes after trading at a high of $1,291.32 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s drop sees ethereum move lower for a third consecutive session, breaking out of a key resistance level of $1,230 in the process.</p>

<p>As of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is nearly 5% lower than yesterday&#x2019;s peak, with the RSI tracking at 43.50, which is near a key floor.</p>
<p>This point of support is at the 42.00 mark, and hasn&#x2019;t been reached since November 28, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> was below $1,200.</p>
<p>Should price strength continue to head towards this bottom, there is a strong possibility that ethereum will be trading under $1,200.</p>

The bill, which also approves the issuance of local artistic assets as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) seeks to enable the promotion of social development, and economic, cultural, and financial inclusion using blockchain.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">San Luis Approves Blockchain Development Bill</h2>
<p>San Luis, an Argentine province, has taken its first steps to include blockchain-based tech as part of its digitization push. The legislators of the province recently <a href="https://billetera.sanluis.gov.ar/pdf/Ley_innovacion_sancionada.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approved</a> a bill designated with the number VIII-1085-2022, called &#8220;Financial Innovation for Investment and Social Economic Development,&#8221; that introduces blockchain as a tool to potentiate the development of several fields in the province, including generating value and improving auditing processes.</p>
<p>As part of this law, San Luis contemplates the issuance of its own dollar-pegged stablecoin. The token, denominated &#8220;San Luis Savings Digital Asset,&#8221; will be available to all citizens of the province and will be 100% collateralized in liquid financial assets of the provincial state. It is still unknown if this digital asset will be used as a currency or will merely function as a kind of debt bond, as the ruleset for this law has still not been created.</p>
<p>The law also establishes that the province will be able to issue up to 2% of the annual budget of the province. The law does not specify the chain on which these assets will be issued, but does establish that they will be transferable between users via different wallet accounts.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Art NFTs</h2>
<p>The law also includes a chapter dedicated to the issuance of artistic digital assets. It establishes that it will issue &#8220;San Luis Art Digital Assets&#8221; as art collections created by local artists of the province with the objective of giving them a platform for digitizing their artwork. These pieces will be issued as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) guaranteeing each one to be &#8220;unique, granting ownership and authenticity to the artist or holder of the digital asset.&#8221;</p>
<p>The province will also build an internal market that will allow creators to commercialize their pieces, giving them visibility as part of the San Luis community of artists.</p>
<p>Argentina has recently made moves to include blockchain tech in its development plans with the issuance of a blockchain national framework <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-organizes-national-blockchain-committee-to-implement-state-level-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> on December 7. The document, which also creates a national blockchain committee, describes two areas in which blockchain tech might be useful: auditing and identification. However, it does not mention currency issuance.</p>
