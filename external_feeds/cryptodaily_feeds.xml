			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Layer-2 scaling solution Optimism Labs has announced the renaming of its blockchain to &ldquo;OP Mainnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The name change &ldquo;makes clear the the delineation between the OP Mainnet blockchain and the Collective, vibe, and ethos that &ldquo;Optimism&rdquo; encompasses.&rdquo; In the thread, Optimism continued that this move is motivated by its desire to create a &ldquo;superchain&rdquo;, that OP Mainnet &ldquo;will be one L2 chain among many&rdquo;, alongside Base, Celer, and Polygon zkEVM, among others.</p>
A New Name After Bedrock
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Optimism recently rolled out its Bedrock upgrade last June 6. With this much-anticipated upgrade, (the &ldquo;bedrock&rdquo; for the superchain-to-come), all associated and integrated chains either constructed within or designed in alignment with the OP tech stack (developer tooling, APIs, and SDKs) will be linked over, enabling smooth communication over a unified ecosystem. It was estimated that the upgrade would significantly reduce gas fees by 40% through a more refined data compression. The Bedrock upgrade brought Optimism a step closer to its goal of creating a superchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Optimism has stayed its course as among the top L2 solutions, second only to its main rival Arbitrum. However, Optimism recently edged out Arbitrum in terms of transaction volume last January. Arbitrum still has the advantage in terms of total value locked (TVL). </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of writing, Arbitrum has a total of $2.2b total in TVL while Optimism lags behind at $824m. One reason for this is Optimism&rsquo;s focus on DEXs and derivatives protocols. Arbitrum&rsquo;s operations also involve the previous two but more importantly, they also include cross-chain protocols, lending protocols, and yield farming. However, with the recent upgrade, a boost in Optimism&rsquo;s competitiveness is expected as Bedrock will enable faster transactions with significantly cheaper fees.</p>
Implications Of The Change Change
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The shift from "Optimism" to "OP Mainnet" doesn't merely represent a rebranding effort; it also signals a transformative shift in the platform's strategy and vision. The intention to create a "superchain" indicates a drive towards more comprehensive interoperability and connectivity within the Ethereum ecosystem. OP Mainnet's aspiration to be one Layer 2 chain among many reflects a collective ambition to decentralize and democratize the Layer 2 landscape, broadening the scope for innovation and cooperation. This collaborative vision could drastically change the competitive dynamics within the Layer 2 space and Ethereum ecosystem more broadly.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The data reveals a dynamic rivalry between OP Mainnet and Arbitrum, both in terms of transaction volume and total value locked (TVL). This competition extends to the heart of each platform's design choices and strategic focus. While both platforms aim to enhance the scalability of the Ethereum network, their distinct approaches reflect different priorities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">OP Mainnet's single-round fraud proof system, although faster, is more expensive than Arbitrum's multi-round system. This difference has contributed to Optimism's lesser TVL and daily active addresses. However, the recent Bedrock upgrade is a potential game-changer in this respect.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">If the upgrade can deliver on its promise of significant gas fee reduction, it might alter the balance between speed and cost, making OP Mainnet an increasingly attractive platform for users and developers alike. The effectiveness of this strategy and its potential to shake up the Layer 2 landscape remains to be seen, but the ambition behind it is clear.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polkadot, a heterogeneous multi-chain protocol, has recently undergone significant changes. Following a successful referendum, the Bridge Hub, a critical tool for blockchain interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem, has been upgraded to runtime v9420.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the primary facilitator for asset, message, and data transfers among different blockchains, the Bridge Hub greatly augments Polkadot's network functionality.</p>
Runtime Upgrade Marks Major Step for Interoperability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">By making transactions and data from one blockchain accessible and usable by others within the Polkadot ecosystem, the Bridge Hub promotes cross-chain capabilities. It fosters compatibility and collaboration across various blockchain projects, significantly augmenting the scope and potential of Polkadot's network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the impact of these changes on user acquisition remains to be seen. The success of upcoming referendums will be key in determining whether this protocol can achieve sustained growth moving forward.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the potential uncertainty, Polkadot's high staking reward ratio might attract users. Blockchain data indicates that $DOT, Polkadot's native token, has outperformed other cryptocurrencies in terms of staking rewards, boasting a reward rate of 14.54% for staking DOT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Interestingly, interest in DOT staking has waned somewhat, as evidenced by a 0.35% decrease in the number of stakers on the Polkadot network, according to Staking Rewards&rsquo; data.</p>
Impact and Implications of Runtime v9420
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Delving deeper into the specifics of the Bridge Hub upgrade, it was a referendum to transition the Bridge Hub from v9382 to v9420. The prior call for this change failed because the Bridge Hub, operating on v9382 and therefore on XCM v3, expected an UnpaidExecution instruction before the Transact instruction, which Polkadot (on v9370 and XCM v2) could not provide.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Now that Polkadot has shifted to XCM v3, the correct XCM program has become possible. The call to execute on the Relay Chain is a Whitelist Call.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The weight parameters for this call, which influenced the Transact parameters, were as follows:</p>
<ul class="ul-list" data-mark="-">
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">refTime: 229,363,000</p>
</li>
<li class="md-list-item">
<p class="md-end-block md-p">proofSize: 3,556</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">These technical developments reflect Polkadot's commitment to continuous improvement and optimization of its multi-chain interoperability. With these changes, we may see an influx of new users, increased staking, or an improved general market sentiment toward $DOT in the coming weeks.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">The market for meme coins seems to be constantly evolving. Caged Beasts (BEASTS), a project currently making headlines for its new presale, is the latest addition to this trend.</p>
<p class="s7">The goal of this guide is to discuss the unique features that distinguish Caged Beasts from the many other meme coins available</p>
<p class="s10">Caged Beasts: What's The Lowdown?</p>
<p>As a result of actively engaging its community and harnessing its power, Caged Beasts is emerging as an innovative crypto venture propelled by public participation and engagement. There is an anticipation of exceptional gains among investors for the upcoming meme presale, which has sparked a wave of excitement.</p>
<p class="s7">Dedicated to the thriving NFT scene, Caged Beasts wants to make a lasting impact.</p>
<p class="s11">Is Caged Beasts An Earning Opportunity?</p>
<p class="s7">Without a doubt. If you share your carefully selected referral code to help others acquire $BEASTS tokens, you will enjoy a 20% share of the amount deposited in reputable cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, or Tether. Simple, straightforward, and convenient are the hallmarks of this streamlined approach.</p>
<p class="s7">As soon as someone uses your code, you'll receive their referral reward, which seamlessly accumulates in your wallet, giving you the opportunity for limitless profits.</p>
<p class="s11"></p>
<p class="s11">Community Building with Caged Beasts</p>
<p class="s7">Caged Beasts focuses heavily on creating a community-driven ecosystem instead of conventional investment avenues. It gives users the power to generate their own referral codes to earn an additional 20% in tokens for themselves and their friends. As a result of this clever feature, the community thrives, which fuels demand and can lead to price appreciation in the future.</p>
<p class="s7">In addition to being enthusiastic participants in the pre-sale, investors engage in effective promotion, attracting a wider audience and improving the chances of making significant returns. Investors actively contribute to the project's growth by raising awareness and participating in it, which creates a profitable ecosystem. Everyone benefits from that.</p>
<p class="s11">Insight Into Caged Beasts Tokenomics</p>
<p class="s7">A key distinguishing feature of Caged Beasts is a strategic allocation of funds during the presale, with a significant 30% reserved for active engagement and the building of anticipation among investors.</p>
<p class="s7">Featuring a large token supply of 10T, Caged Beasts offers tax-free trading, enabling users to navigate the market faster and execute transactions more easily.</p>
<p class="s7">In terms of the project's development, the presale accounts for 60%. By securing 30% of the funds until the launch, the project ensures liquidity and establishes long-term stability and success.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) added to ongoing range expansion early in the Asian session as the pair was softer after peaking around the 31057.86 area, a move that represented a test of the 61.8% retracement of the recent depreciating range from 31443.67 to 30330.61.&nbsp; Prior to the move higher, buying pressure emerged around the 30330.61 area, right around the 61.8% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp;&nbsp; BTC/USD continues to orbit the 38.2% retracement of this range while awaiting technical guidance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent rapid appreciation to the 31443.67 area was its strongest level in twelve months and represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap (UNI) announces the launch of its V4 upgrade, and it promises some great updates to the Ethereum-based protocol. However, the most notable feature for Uniswap (UNI) with the upgrade is increased decentralization. Uniswap pushes towards more decentralization, and it&rsquo;s timed to the exact moment the SEC is probing centralized exchanges. Also, market trends have shown that the SEC can hardly build up any case against a truly decentralized network.</p>
<p>Uwerx is another decentralized platform for freelancers currently on its ICO, and the presale is a unique opportunity to be early. And as the saying goes, &ldquo;Crypto rewards early adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uniswap (UNI) V4 Upgrade
<p>Uniswap (UNI) is the earliest decentralized protocol on Ethereum and the blockchain landscape at large, and it has been responsible for some great breakthroughs since its launch such as community governance. Uniswap launched as an innovative decentralized solution for swapping tokens. The protocol recently released its V4 draft, and invites community feedback before the launch goes public. </p>
<p>The upgrade will efficiently help to keep the costs connected with transactions as low as possible. The V4 version will include new features, including on-chain limit orders, automatic compounding of liquidity provider (LP) incentives, and dynamic fees.</p>
<p>Onchain data shows an address accumulating over 878,336 UNI tokens after the V4 announcement from Uniswap. The accumulated token on the address is worth almost $4 million and supposedly belongs to an algorithmic trading firm, Wintermute Trading. Onchain patterns like this consistently demonstrate privileged information from top whales, and small retailers often look to make some profit off this.</p>
<p>UNI tokens have some prospects toward launch, but we believe Uwerx could be a better opportunity for gains as the launch comes close.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) With Great Prospects As Launch Approaches
<p>Uwerx emerges as a top prospect despite a regulatory crackdown on the market. The new freelance platform is offering its native token on its ICO for cheap to raise funds for its initial roadmap. This allows early buyers to get in with a market advantage towards launch. Presale opportunities are pretty unique as they could return massive profits after launch when the token begins to trade towards its actual value.</p>
<p>Uwerx, as a new freelance platform, is proving to be quite valuable to the gig market with its unique features enabled by blockchain integration. Merging value across both industries allows Uwerx to look to massive growth when it launches, and early buyers could be the biggest winners of the exciting price trend ahead.</p>
<p>Uwerx recently announced the completion of its alpha test, while the project also locked team tokens to demonstrate the founding team&rsquo;s commitment to growing the platform and building value for early adopters. Uwerx is building a decentralized freelance economy where WERX will be a huge currency and store of value.</p>
<p>The opportunity in this is to get in early on WERX as it trades at $0.041 on Phase 5 presale. Also, claim a 15% bonus on presale when you get in now.</p>

Shiba Inu (SHIB), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Caged Beasts (BEASTS) are prowling the crypto jungle, ready to make a meme-tastic impact. Join the frenzy as these adorable yet fierce tokens take the market by storm &mdash; keep reading!</p>
<p class="s11">Floki Inu Embraces 8% Rise &mdash; Despite Altcoin Wounds</p>
<p>FLOKI, also known as "Floki Inu," is making waves in the crypto world, and it's anything but ordinary! Born from the fierce SHIBArmy, this Ethereum-powered gem is capturing the hearts of crypto enthusiasts and gamers alike with its Valhalla's Open World launch in the US.</p>
<p>Not stopping there, FLOKI is conquering the Chinese gaming market with its local alternative to Valhalla called Btok. Beyond that, FLOKI brags about its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Metaverse venture. Recently, FLOKI surged a jaw-dropping 8%, stealing the spotlight from its rival, Shiba Inu.</p>
<p class="s13">What&rsquo;s Fueling This Growth?</p>

<p>The competition between Floki Inu and Shiba Inu is an epic tug-of-war, where the ultimate winner will be determined by various factors, including a strong ecosystem and flourishing market conditions.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Traders are attempting to short the TUSD stablecoin amidst reports of the stablecoin issuer&rsquo;s connection with crypto custodian Prime Trust.</p>
<p>The TrueUSD issuer has stated that it does not have any exposure to Prime Trust, having announced earlier in the month that it had stopped mints and redemptions through the crypto custodian.</p>
Traders Hedge Their Bets
<p>Traders are beginning to bet that the TUSD stablecoin could de-peg, putting the markets in crisis. One trader opened a multi-million short position on the TUSD stablecoin after its issuer stopped mints and redemptions through Prime Trust. A user on Ethereum deposited 7.5 million USDC as collateral on the Aave v2 lending platform. According to the available on-chain data, they then used this collateral to borrow 4 million TUSD and immediately sold these for USDC. Borrowing and then selling immediately is a common tactic used by traders who are looking to take a short position on a specific asset.</p>
<p>On Aave v2, traders are paying up to 50% APY to short TUSD, while the TUSD Curve Pool is also showing a similar trend, with its currency reserves reaching 61%. Twitter user Etheraltog also noted that users attempting to redeem TUSD are getting it re-minted into their wallets.</p>
TrueUSD Tries To Clear Air
<p>Traders are rushing to short the TUSD stablecoin after it emerged that Nevada&rsquo;s Financial Institutions Division ordered cryptocurrency custodian Prime Trust to halt all operations. Nevada&rsquo;s Financial Institutions Division stated that the custodian&rsquo;s business had declined to a &ldquo;critically deficient level&rdquo; and was in an unsafe and unsound position to conduct business. Furthermore, the withdrawal of BitGo&rsquo;s offer to purchase Prime Trust added further pressure on the custodian.</p>
<p>Representatives from TUSD have stated that the stablecoin is not impacted by the situation unfolding at Prime Trust and that it had no exposure to the embattled custodian. They added that TUSD maintains multiple USD rails for minting and redemption purposes.</p>
<p>Prime Trust has been looking to raise millions in emergency funding and had been in talks with a number of potential financiers. Executives at the custodian believed that funding of up to $25 million would be enough to stabilize the balance sheet. A deal with BitGo was announced for an undisclosed amount but was later canceled.</p>
Volatility Hits TUSD
<p>TUSD is usually a very stable asset. However, recent developments have seen the asset face considerable volatility, with its price falling as low as $0.995 and as high as $1.003. The volatility has also had a significant impact on the loan markets for the TUSD stablecoin, especially on Aave v2. Aave v2 is the largest on-chain lending facility for TUSD. According to data from Parsec, the variable borrow rate for TUSD was over 30%, although it was higher at one point during the day.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US SEC has approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF. The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF will launch on the Chicago Board Options BZX on Tuesday, June 27. </p>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Friday approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF). The Volatility Shares 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) will launch on the Chicago Board Options (CBOE) BXZ Exchange on June 27.</p>
BITX Goes Live on June 27
<p>An ETF allows investors to have exposure to a particular product without owning them directly. An ETF bundles securities from which investors can buy shares to gain exposure to that product without owning Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin ETFs take two shapes: Bitcoin spot ETFs and Bitcoin futures ETFs.</p>
<p>BITX will be a leveraged ETF. In the case of a leveraged ETF, the fund uses debt or financial derivatives as leverage to increase the return of a benchmark index. A leveraged 2x ETF allows investors to gain exposure to BTC by only putting up 50% of the value of BTC. Bitcoin spot ETFs are funds that track Bitcoin&rsquo;s value rather than futures contracts. Spot ETFs purchase Bitcoin directly, allowing investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without buying, storing, or managing it themselves.</p>
<p>BITX&rsquo;s SEC filing indicates the fund:</p>

<p>Seeks investment results that correspond to two times (2x) the return of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index.</p>

Bitcoin Breaches $30,000 Amid ETF Filings
<p>Bitcoin has reacted positively in response to a string of recent ETF filings. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $30,640, holding firm above the $30,000 threshold.</p>
<p>The bitcoin price rose this week after numerous financial industry players announced their intention to create Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>BlackRock, the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, announced last week that it filed an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. While there is optimism that BlackRock&rsquo;s ETF application would be the first the get approval, analysis indicates that it would be unlikely in the near term, thanks to the regulatory hurdles posed by the SEC and its chief Gary Gensler.</p>
<p>As is the case with any financial product, the approval process for a Bitcoin ETF involves rigorous scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the SEC.</p>
<p>BlackRock&rsquo;s ETF filing triggered a series of ETF filings from several firms, including Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Invesco. The rumour mill also suggests that Fidelity is filing an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>

While there is optimism that BlackRock&rsquo;s ETF application would be the first the get approval, analysis indicates that it would be unlikely in the near term, thanks to the regulatory hurdles posed by the SEC and its chief Gary Gensler.</p>
<p>As is the case with any financial product, the approval process for a Bitcoin ETF involves rigorous scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the SEC.</p>
<p>BlackRock&rsquo;s ETF filing triggered a series of ETF filings from several firms, including Valkyrie, WisdomTree and Invesco. The rumour mill also suggests that Fidelity is filing an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world's largest stablecoin, USDT, has recently frozen an account with over $4.1 million, as shown by on-chain explorers. This once again raises the question of whether centralization, with its concentration of power, is the ideal path forward or if decentralized projects like Tradecurve are essential for the survival of the DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
No explanation for $4.1 million freeze of USDT
<p>On June 19th, Tether froze $4.11 million of USDT without providing any further comment on the action. The analytics platform Etherscan marks the USDT wallet as frozen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Reddit user traced the frozen account back to a Huobi user, and on-chain data indicates that the USDT was funneled into the wallet in March 2023. There is ongoing speculation that the owner of the account may be involved in illegal activities, which appears to have prompted Tether to actively freeze the holdings in the address.</p>
<p>Tether Holdings Limited acts as a centralized entity and manages over $83.1 billion worth of USDT in circulating supply. Each USDT token on any blockchain is issued and backed 1:1 with cash or cash equivalents.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tether and USDT play an essential role in the cryptocurrency market but face concerns regarding centralization, which are further highlighted by the issuer's ability to freeze assets. This stands in contrast to the core principles of blockchain technology, which is inherently borderless and decentralized.</p>
<p>Critics on social media are raising their voices, pointing out that Tether Holdings Limited behaves like a bank by freezing the address. A Reddit user highlighted the fact that Tether has integrated a "kill switch" in the token's code that can potentially be triggered at any point to block an address. This carries a certain risk for the overall market and the financial system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to expand and evolve, it remains to be seen to what extent USDT can achieve decentralization in its final state.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tradecurve aims to revolutionize the trading industry by offering a decentralized hybrid exchange.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve.io: Decentralized trading
<p>Tradecurve represents the next step in decentralized trading. By combining the worlds of decentralized and centralized exchanges, it provides access to thousands of financial instruments across multiple international markets. Users can leverage their cryptocurrency to trade commodities, stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, and more.</p>
<p>Tradecurve users enjoy complete anonymity without the need for KYC procedures, making trading accessible to everyone and facilitating easy onboarding to a wide range of markets and instruments. Tradecurve offers various advantages, such as AI-driven algorithmic trading, 500:1 leverage, a VIP account service for whales, copy trading, and a Metaverse Trading Academy, which provides all the necessary materials for self-education.</p>
<p>The TCRV token is currently priced at $0.018 in the 4th stage of the official presale, and analysts predict a 100x return when the presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>&lsquo;The Future is Now Film&rsquo; has been enlightening its audience over the past 5 years showcasing the amazing feats that blockchain technology has endured and overcome. Even in such a short time, it&rsquo;s now clear just how revolutionary cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology have come out to be. Starting in the 1990&rsquo;s with the internet of information, slowly moving into the Internet of Things throughout the early 2010&rsquo;s, we&rsquo;re now witnessing the era of the Internet of Value.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is a concept that is not only unique, with everyone having access to a growing digital market, but also one that offers a fair chance to create and store money in ways never before seen. In many countries that didn&rsquo;t have access to a central banking system, let alone broadband due to corruption and other factors, we are now seeing communities prosper thanks to the introduction of crypto banking systems and blockchain technology integrated within their infrastructure.</p>
Africa and the Future of Crypto
<p>Probably one of the most prevalent examples of blockchain being successfully integrated into a region&rsquo;s infrastructure would relate to Sandi Bitenc &ndash;&nbsp;an individual at the forefront of change within Africa. Sandi is the founder of 3air, a telecom and blockchain company&nbsp; whose mission is to give access to the internet even to the most underserved communities. In Sierra Leone, 3air has already built two base stations capable of serving around 90% of the city, finally enabling access to broadband for thousands of people. 3air also provides the use of its cryptocurrency token as a means to pay and get paid for redistributing its unique broadband connectivity within its ecosystem, allowing people in Sierra Leone to embark further in crypto mass adoption.</p>
<p>Africa is the largest adopter of cryptocurrency, largely thanks to the underlying need for such a technology. Many banks throughout Africa simply didn&rsquo;t have the structure or resources to hold dollar reserves, the typical international currency for trade, meaning it was a useless tender when trading as most citizens just didn&rsquo;t have access to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nearly all countries hold their reserves in foreign banks which are subject to laws out of their control. We have seen Africa torn apart for centuries with natural resources being drained, purposely being deprived of basic educational and technological needs which could have easily been shared, drastically improving the quality of life. Let's take a look at some of the innovators who are already injecting this technology into Africa and beyond.</p>
TheFutureIsNowFIlm &ndash; Queen Diambi
<p>Queen Diambi of the Bakwa Luntu tribe of Central Kasa&iuml; in the historic Kingdom of Luba (Congo) is making headlines with Africa and their adoption of cryptocurrency. She is travelling the world and spreading the word in the pursuit of making Africa great again. Queen Diambi is driven by the goal of bringing African technology and sciences to the level that they once were in the distant past, where the African nation was much more advanced than traditional history books would deem to say.</p>
<p></p>
TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash;&nbsp;Revoland Game
<p>Already making waves in both the educational and financial sectors, Jimmy Zhao first introduced Revoland to Africa as a growing market. ChainXGame was responsible for teaching users in Ethiopia about gaming but under a Play-2-Earn model. This meant that individuals were able to earn crypto while playing and learning the fundamentals about GameFi as a future means for their economic well being, let&rsquo;s remember the Axie Infinity and the Philippines use case. Cultivating this kind of access for Africans is fundamental in moving into a fairer financial community where everyone can create value, together.</p>
<p>TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash; Ikigai Ventures</p>
<p>Ikigai Ventures are all about supporting companies who can benefit all of us &ndash; companies who are striving for positive social change and a good ESG strategy. As Eman Pulis puts it, if you love what you do and it rewards you well, while being great for society, you have found your ikigai, a Japanese word that cannot be translated to English. Through AIBC Summit which also belongs to Eman, the man who once named himself &ldquo;Just an events guy&rdquo; to now a full fledged Web3 start up fund, has now created access to incredible deal flow in the industry.&nbsp;</p>
TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash; Oz Living
<p>Devoted to financial freedom, Oz Living is providing services for individuals and their families to gain full control over their assets while also helping them reduce taxes. Their mission being a world where people live life on their own terms. The Oz eco-zone is currently being pioneered with the permission of the Philippines Government that is allowing Jin Gonzalez, the founder, to create a portable and tax-free zone for its citizens who wish to relocate, gain citizenship and experience living in the world of Oz.</p>
TheFutureIsNowFilm &ndash; Acta Finance
<p>Acta Finance ecosystem is looking to combine new and already existing centralised passive-earning principles and bring them on-chain. Christof Waton considers this really a great example of out with the old and in with the new as the company rewards their growing ecosystem creating a cross-platform and friendly community for all to experience the power of DeFi.&nbsp;</p>
Web3 Shareholders
<p>Web3 revolutionises the way we interact with the internet. Web2, the current incarnation of our internet, and its websites are typically controlled via a central entity meaning, the company that owns that site decides where one&rsquo;s data is stored, what they can actively do with your data while also taking responsibility for preventing data breaches and hacks. In Web3, every user is a shareholder building communities, not businesses. The Internet of Value works towards educating and rewarding those who wish to build the foundations for the new digital world.</p>
<p>People are tired of a broken system that shows failure every other decade as seen with the most recent USD inflation rates. Africa is by far the largest adopter of crypto and is a leading example of how to start implementing the use of blockchain technology into a countries ecosystem while Dubai is the world leader in education on the blockchain as well as a host to many prestigious events in the field focusing on the MENA region&rsquo;s development and beyond.</p>
AIBC Summit Eurasia
<p>The private screening and film premiere was held at AIBC Summit Eurasia in Dubai March 2023 at the Awards Gala Dinner organised by Eman Pulis and SiGMA Group. The film starred Queen Diambi of Congo, Nick Spanos from "Banking on Bitcoin'', Ivan on Tech, Eman Pulis from SiGMA &amp; Ikigai Ventures, Sandi Bitenc of 3air, Jin Gonzalez of Oz Living, Christof Waton of ACTA Finance, Jimmy Zhao of Revoland and even a cameo of Akon, the world renowned celebrity singer and artist who is also creating Web3 ripples in Africa with his Akoin Foundation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Gala Dinner and Awards show has become an industry staple since the inception of AIBC back in Malta 2018, then known as the Malta Blockchain Summit, bringing together professionals from all continents. The AIBC Gala in its 5 year history has awarded prominent decentralised futurists like Roger Ver, Brock Pierce &amp; Bobby Lee to name a few. Having #TheFutureisNowFilm premiere at this event in its 2023 reiteration marked The Future is Now DAO's full move and relocation to Dubai as well as a chance for the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me community of Web3 to get acquainted with this film series which has been covering Bitcoin's disruption across the world. As a matter of fact the 5th episode of TFINFILM, which is the film&rsquo;s Twitter handle, was the first AIBC Summit in 2018 established by Eman Pulis &amp; SiGMA Group, which back then was branded as the Malta Blockchain Summit and held in Portomaso, Malta. That episode features the late John McAfee, the founder of McAfee anti-virus and the scandalous yet powerful figure in the world of decentralisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miguel Francis-Santiago, the film's creator &amp; host, also the Founder of TFIN DAO, confirmed that its time for the platform to go global and has secured a partnership with a 30 year VP of Distribution veteran from Hollywood who has led distribution in giants like Vivendi Universal, Paramount &amp; Hulu. Francis-Santiago believes this partnership is key to having 'The Future is Now Film' finally take on platforms like Netflix &amp; Amazon Prime.</p>
Final Thoughts
<p>It&rsquo;s time to get excited about Web3 and the blockchain. Users finally have the opportunity not just to build their own future but contribute to the future being built around them. This trend is becoming even more apparent as we begin to observe the social shift away from centralization and more into the world of a decentralised and equally balanced networks of value creation and knowledge.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Reaches 12-Month Peak:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 24 June 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) retained positive upward momentum early in the Asian session as the pair worked to consolidate gains above the psychologically-important 30000 figure after escalating to the 31443.67 area, its strongest print since June 2022.&nbsp; The rapid appreciation to its strongest level in twelve months represented a test of the 31488.23 area, an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Stops were also recently elected above the 30127.80 area during the ongoing appreciation, an upside price objective associated with historical buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 19568.52 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.&nbsp; Following recent upside price activity, areas of technical support and potential buying pressure include the 30192, 29863, 29423, 28886, 28179, 28096, and 27293 areas.&nbsp; Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 27474.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30124.83.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent IMF post was extremely favourable towards countries in Latin America and the Caribbean using central bank digital currencies, while denigrating El Salvador&rsquo;s adoption of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The post by the International Monetary Fund suggested that Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries were making &ldquo;significant strides in the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p>
<p>It cited the four Latin American countries of Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Ecuador, as ranking among the top 20 countries in 2022 for adoption of crypto assets.</p>
<p>However, the IMF post chose to go along with the perceived disadvantages of these potential adoptions citing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;crypto asset adoption also presents numerous challenges and risks, particularly for vulnerable LAC countries with a history of macroeconomic instability, low institutional credibility, substantial capital flows, corruption, and extensive informal sectors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the subject of adoption, the IMF authors pointed out how the Dominican Republic and Argentina had prohibited the use of crypto assets, citing the concerns of &ldquo;financial stability, currency and asset substitution, tax evasion, corruption and money laundering&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It was not mentioned that the IMF itself had obliged the Argentinian central bank to insert an anti-crypto clause in its agreement over a recent IMF bailout.</p>
<p>The IMF said that it had carried out a survey of government officials in the LAC region and half of them had replied that they were considering retail and wholesale CBDC options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most survey participants viewed CBDCs as a means to enhance their payment systems and broaden their access. They deemed financial inclusion and monetary sovereignty as crucial factors in favor of retail CBDC issuance by facilitating the integration of unbanked individuals and curbing currency substitution towards stablecoins or crypto assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the IMF admitted that CBDC takeup was &ldquo;slow&rdquo; for the ECCU and the Bahamas, and stated that it was for this reason that these countries must promote CBDC adoption and raise public awareness of them.</p>
Opinion
<p>The IMF has a profound belief in fiat currencies, and the dollar in particular. It has spent the last several decades of its existence providing loans to primarily third world countries, thereby enslaving them in yet more debt.</p>
<p>For such an organisation crypto assets are anathema, to be prohibited and repressed at any cost, despite acknowledging the obvious advantages that the crypto industry has brought to finance.</p>
<p>That El Salvador might be having success with its bitcoin adoption strategy must be making officials at the IMF wring their hands with worry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should the IMF be successful in urging some of these countries in the LAC region to adopt CBDCs then it can be expected that their citizens will be utterly controlled and enslaved.</p>
<p>Hopefully citizens will have the education to reject a CBDC, just as is the case in Nigeria, where only 0.5% of the population are using the eNaira as a transaction option, even in the face of cash shortages.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>MicroStrategy has turned a profit on its significant Bitcoin investment as the premier cryptocurrency soars the charts.&nbsp;</p>
MicroStrategy Turns A Profit
<p>With Bitcoin finally overcoming the $30,000 price tag hurdle, leading business intelligence firm and largest institutional BTC-holder, MicroStrategy, is finally turning a profit on its reserves. The company had gone all in on its audacious investment strategy, religiously allocating a portion of its capital to buy the dip and stock up its Bitcoin reserves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strategy seems to have paid off, with the cryptocurrency breaking through the $30,000 ceiling and staying consistently above it for the last several hours, at the time of writing. The price surge has helped MicroStrategy&rsquo;s funds and turned profitable.&nbsp;</p>
TradFi Renews BTC Interest
<p>The company has invested millions of dollars into its Bitcoin strategy across several installments made in a time when the market was exceptionally volatile and the crypto was barely breaking the $20k threshold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, recently there has been an increasing institutional interest in the crypto owing to the number of spot Bitcoin ETF applications from several major TradFi players like BlackRock Investments, WisdomTree, and Invesco. As a direct result, Bitcoin has seen a significant price increase as investors are hoping to have more investment options, should these BTC ETF applications be approved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
The Big Spot BTC ETF Push
<p>Following a successful first quarter, Bitcoin briefly maintained its positive momentum in the second quarter. In mid-April, the leading cryptocurrency surpassed the $31,000 mark. However, it soon entered a correction phase, experiencing weeks of underwhelming performance amidst legal controversies. Bitcoin's rally reignited after BlackRock submitted its Bitcoin ETF application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just recently, crypto expert, Ki Young Ju pointed out that MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings, which amount to 140,000 BTC, were close to reaching the break-even point at $30,045. Today, when Bitcoin's price reached that level, the portfolio completely recovered from all its previous losses. Currently, with Bitcoin priced at $30,057, the company&rsquo;s holdings have continued their profitable run.&nbsp;</p>
Saylor&rsquo;s Conviction Wins Out
<p>The company's investment has placed it among the few publicly traded companies to hold a significant amount of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy's CEO, Michael Saylor, has been a vocal advocate for Bitcoin and has been instrumental in shaping the company's cryptocurrency investment strategy. He has repeatedly emphasized Bitcoin's potential as a long-term store of value and hedge against inflation and most recently claimed that the regulatory crackdown on altcoins, could result in Bitcoin&rsquo;s market dominance to reach 80% in the long term.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pepecoin surged as much as 40% to extend weekly gains to over 70% amid a market-wide rally led by bitcoin. Trading volumes for the frog-themed tokens jumped to over $800 million, as a risk-on environment likely fueled outsized bets on riskier assets, such as altcoins and meme coins.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Was bitcoin&rsquo;s latest surge just a last fling before sinking lower, or does it have the legs to continue on upwards?</p>
Just a narrative pump?
<p>Some analysts and commentators would have us believe that there just isn&rsquo;t the market order flow for any sustained moves, and it must be said that volume is quite low, having been so since late March.</p>
<p>A short term relief rally to the upside?</p>
<p>Is everyone just FOMOing in because of all the new ETF filings which began with Blackrock&rsquo;s Spot Bitcoin ETF application of just a week ago and then the subsequent Fidelity, Wisdom Tree, Invesco, and Valkyrie filings, and then the Wall Street-backed EDX Markets?</p>
<p>This is likely the case. Bitcoin and crypto haven&rsquo;t had much to shout about for quite a while so the perceived positive news here does look to be responsible for the price action, and perhaps it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before the ETF narrative starts to die down.</p>
<p>Also, could it be that the traditional institutions are coordinating with the SEC with a view to taking down the crypto businesses before providing their own solutions taken from the crypto innovations?</p>
Bullish in the short term
<p>Be this as it may, at least in the short term, bitcoin is still looking strong. After briefly touching $30,800 bitcoin looks as though it is forming a bull flag, although another touch of the flag bottom is probably needed. The 4-hour Stochastic RSI has reset to the bottom and we should see a cross up soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ethereum is behaving in a similar way, and looks to be breaking out of its own bull flag already. In relation to BTC, ETH has been rather a laggard though, and has been steadily forming lower highs and lows from all the way back to September of 2022.</p>
<p>A bottom could now have been found given that ETH is currently sitting at the 0.618 Fibonacci level against its BTC pair. Also, with the ongoing ETH staking narrative helping to drastically reduce the market supply, perhaps this is the time for Ethereum to start to shine.</p>
Many altcoins will die
<p>As for the rest of the crypto market it does rather look as though the altcoins as a whole are not going to do their usual thing and rise en masse. Instead, a small group of alts, with strong use cases and narratives might be the only ones to make the big moves.</p>
<p>Things are changing in crypto, and previous cycles where just about anything might rocket skywards on a given day is likely not to happen any more. In the coming times the wheat is going to be sorted from the chaff.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to trading firm QCP Capital, BlackRock&rsquo;s Bitcoin spot ETF is unlikely in the near term, thanks to SEC Chair Gary Gensler&rsquo;s attitude towards cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has taken an increasingly hostile stance against the crypto ecosystem under Gensler.&nbsp;</p>
BlackRock Spot ETF&rsquo;s SEC Headache&nbsp;
<p>There have been several applications for spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in recent times. However, all have been rejected by the regulator that is responsible for approving Exchange Traded Funds, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BlackRock, the world&rsquo;s largest asset manager, is the latest to apply for a Bitcoin spot ETF. While there is optimism that BlackRock&rsquo;s spot Bitcoin ETF application could be the first to get approval, an analysis by trading firm QCP Capital has dampened that optimism.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to QCP Capital&rsquo;s assessment, a spot Bitcoin ETF, whether BlackRock&rsquo;s or any other, is not likely in the near future primarily due to Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and his harsh attitude toward cryptocurrencies. QCP added that while institutional involvement and interest in Bitcoin was bound to increase, the SEC&rsquo;s current makeup means that it is unlikely that spot ETFs would get the green light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BlackRock had filed its spot ETF earlier during the month, with a filing by the Nasdaq stock exchange revealing that Coinbase Custody Trust Company would be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s Bitcoin holdings, while the Bank of New York Mellon would be the custodian of the fund&rsquo;s fiat currency.&nbsp;</p>
A Hurdle Called Gensler&nbsp;
<p>The picture is further complicated by current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has taken a hostile stance against cryptocurrencies in general. Under his leadership, the SEC has initiated several lawsuits against major cryptocurrency exchanges. These include Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase. QCP Capital, in its assessment, wrote,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, with Gensler as head of the SEC, we are not confident of the actual ETF approval happening in the near term. Nevertheless, as we&rsquo;ve continually maintained, there is a huge place for institutional BTC and ETH in the asset management world, and over the next months and years, we will see further steps in that direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>QCP Capital&rsquo;s observation is interesting, especially as it was highlighted that BlackRock had received just one rejection out of a total of 576 prior applications.&nbsp;</p>
Grayscale Bitcoin Trust Rebounds&nbsp;
<p>As a result of the knock-on effects of the BlackRock spot Bitcoin ETF has reflected in Bitcoin&rsquo;s (BTC) price performance and beyond. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), having seen a considerable rebound after trading nearly 50% below BTC/USD, has continued to see an upswing as it makes up lost ground. According to data sourced from CoinGlass, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust&rsquo;s discount to BTC spot (discount to net asset value) reached its smallest level of 2023 at 33.45%. According to QCP, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has seen its sharpest recovery since late 2020.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance.US, Binance Holdings Limited, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao have accused the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of misleading the public through statements during its ongoing lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The allegation was made during a motion filed by lawyers representing Binance.US at the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on the 21st of June.&nbsp;</p>
SEC Deliberately Misleading The Public&nbsp;
<p>According to the arguments filed by lawyers representing Binance.US, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s assertions made during a press release on the 17th of June were misleading, and appealed to the financial regulator to adhere to the &ldquo;applicable rules of conduct.&rdquo; In its press release, the SEC accused Binance and CEO Changpeng Zhao of commingling customer assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Given that Changpeng Zhao and Binance have control of the platforms&rsquo; customers&rsquo; assets and have been able to commingle customer assets or divert customer assets as they please, as we have alleged, these prohibitions are essential to protecting investor assets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The motion filed alleges that the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s press release included statements that were unsupported by evidence and lacked substantiation. The lawsuit also stressed that the Securities and Exchange Commission presented no evidence to support its claims that Binance had commingled customer funds or diverted them as per its discretion. Binance representative stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The SEC has no evidence that BAM [Binance.US] customer assets have been dissipated, commingled or misused in any way.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also alleged that the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s press release was designed to introduce further unwarranted confusion into the crypto markets, having a detrimental impact on BAM customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SEC&rsquo;s press release seemed designed to introduce unwarranted confusion into the marketplace, which could have the effect of harming BAM customers rather than protecting them. It also risks tainting the jury pool with misleading descriptions of the evidence concerning the Defendants.&rdquo;</p>

Implications Of The Motion&nbsp;
<p>The motion filed against the SEC also stated that its press release risked prejudicing the jury pool by misleading descriptions of events related to the defendants in the case. Binance had also accused the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler of having a conflict of interest, alleging that Gensler had sought an informal advisory role with Binance before he was appointed as the SEC chair. According to Binance&rsquo;s lawyers, Gensler&rsquo;s previous connection with the exchange could influence his actions and decisions as the head of the SEC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the federal judge approves, the motion could have significant consequences for the SEC. For starters, it could limit the regulatory body&rsquo;s ability to make public comments about the Binance lawsuit throughout the duration of the case, in particular, any comments that may impact court proceedings. To support their argument, Binance&rsquo;s legal team also included some excerpts from a hearing held on the 13th of June. During this hearing, the SEC counsel admitted that there was no proof yet that Binance.US assets were being channeled overseas. The motion filed by the defense lawyers is part of its defense strategy in response to a lawsuit filed against Binance by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the 5th of June.&nbsp;</p>
The Lawsuit Against Binance&nbsp;
<p>The lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Binance, Binance.US, and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao accuses them of failing to register as an exchange or a broker-dealer clearing agency and offering customers unregistered securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler also accused Binance of misleading its investors regarding their risk controls. Furthermore, the SEC also moved the court to freeze all assets belonging to Binance.US before reaching a compromise where only employees of the exchange could access client funds for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>
