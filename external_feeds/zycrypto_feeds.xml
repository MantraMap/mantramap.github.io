<p>Despite his previous skepticism about cryptocurrencies, former U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly holds more than $5 million in an Ethereum wallet. This puts Trump, who is bidding to return to the White House in 2024, near the crypto “whale” category. The $5 million in Trump’s Ethereum wallet is significantly bigger than the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/filing-reveals-donald-trump-holds-250000-500000-worth-of-ethereum/">$250,000-$500,000 figure</a> previously disclosed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-anti-crypto-trump-nears-crypto-whale-status"><strong>Anti-Crypto Trump Nears Crypto Whale Status</strong></h2>



<p>In new financial disclosure records submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, Trump discloses owning just over $2.8 million in crypto held in an Ethereum wallet.</p>



<p>The Washington-based non-profit watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), <a href="https://twitter.com/CREWcrew/status/1691488099056988167">shared</a> the updated figure on Tuesday. The statements also reveal that the former U.S. president accrued over $4.9 million from licensing fees from a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFT) using Trump’s image that his campaign rolled out as part of his bid to return to the Oval Office in 2024 after losing to current-President Joe Biden in 2020.</p>



<p>Sales of the NFTs skyrocketed after their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-is-selling-superman-themed-nft-trading-cards/">launch </a>in December 2022 and also after a New York state court first indicted the real estate mogul-turned-politician. Subsequently, the Republican candidate dropped the second collection of digital trading cards in April, and this batch also quickly sold out.</p>



<p>Trump’s new financial reports were eclipsed by the news of his fourth <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/1ccdf52e-1ba2-434c-93f8-2a7020293967.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_5">indictment </a>in Georgia for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-is-a-scam-but-nfts-are-okay"><strong>Bitcoin Is A “Scam”, But NFTs Are Okay?</strong></h2>



<p>The huge size of Trump’s holdings makes him something of a crypto whale, which is ironic for a man who has voiced skepticism for the asset class in the past. During an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6257768965001#sp=show-clips">interview </a>with <em>Fox Business</em> in June 2021, Trump said Bitcoin “just seems like a scam” before adding that he wasn’t a fan of the asset “because it’s another currency competing against the dollar.”</p>



<p>Trump’s aversion to cryptocurrencies contrasts with the pro-crypto stance of other Republican presidential candidates like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-asserts-pro-crypto-governor/">Ron DeSantis</a>, who has vowed to end “Biden’s War on Bitcoin” if elected. The Florida governor posited that every American citizen has “every right to do Bitcoin” while speaking extensively on Twitter with Elon Musk.</p>



<p>On the Democratic front, presidential challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has made waves in the crypto community as an outspoken advocate of Bitcoin after making a pitstop at the Bitcoin Miami conference. He also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/presidential-hopeful-robert-f-kennedy-jr-discloses-buying-two-bitcoins-for-each-of-his-seven-kids/">admitted </a>to buying 14 Bitcoins for his seven children.</p>

<p>Mark Yusko, the CEO and Founder of $2 billion investment firm Morgan Creek Capital Management, has boldly predicted that the price of Bitcoin could hit six figures within a year.</p>



<p>Making the forecast during a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lFRPCg1HE&amp;ab_channel=KitcoNEWS">interview</a> with Kitco News, Yusko discussed various aspects of the cryptocurrency market, including the regulatory environment and the implications of a potential <a href="https://zycrypto.com/multiple-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-on-the-way-cathie-wood-predicts/">spot Bitcoin ETF approval</a> on Bitcoin’s price in the coming months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-etf-approval-likely-but"><strong>ETF Approval Likely, but…</strong></h2>



<p>Yusko acknowledged the growing excitement around the possibility of a spot Bitcoin ETF approval, particularly as major players such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-ceo-cz-bullish-on-defi-blackrock-speaks-on-impact-of-recent-xrp-ruling/">BlackRock</a>, Fidelity, Wisdom Tree, and VanEck have submitted filings for such ETFs. He, however asserted that although there is an impending deadline of August 13th, by which the SEC is required to either approve or reject an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF from ARK Invest, the SEC can extend the deadline.</p>



<p><em>“There is a fast-approaching deadline that&#8217;s getting some attention August 13th this is the date by which the SEC is required to approve or reject Arc spot Bitcoin ETF application but and this is a big but the SEC also has the option to stretch the deadline until as late as January 2024,” </em>he said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-headed-for-100-000"><strong>Bitcoin Headed for $100,000</strong></h2>



<p>As for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundits-100000-bitcoin-price-target-by-next-halving-sparks-exciting-bet/">price forecast</a>, the billionaire’s analysis relied on Metcalfe&#8217;s law, which suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s value grows exponentially with the network&#8217;s size. According to him, the law puts Bitcoin&#8217;s fair value at $55,000. Furthermore, he predicted that with each halving event, the total value of the network could increase tenfold. He thus stated that he anticipates that the upcoming halving could push Bitcoin even higher.</p>



<p><em>“So should that spot ETF get approved, and we know we&#8217;re going to have the halving in April, you anticipate Bitcoin at between $100,000 and $150,000 by mid-2024,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>Yusko&#8217;s predictions come even as Bitcoin struggles to shake off a prolonged consolidation phase that has exerted downward pressure on its price over the past one and a half month. Technically, the $31,000 resistance area has proved challenging to breach, with the cryptocurrency’s volatility tapping a seven-month low.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the anticipation around a spot Bitcoin ETF approval and underlying solid network fundamentals continue to suggest an enduring interest in Bitcoin, which could help drive higher prices. BTC traded at $29,187 at press time after dropping around 0.1% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Despite the overall slump in volatility by the general crypto market, PEPE has sustained its exceptional growth trajectory into the third week of August, surging ahead of notable contenders such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-sees-super-bullish-momentum-but-can-it-trigger-shib-price-to-astronomical-highs/">Shiba Inu</a> and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-eyes-record-highs-as-elon-musk-hints-on-some-exciting-news-doge-payments-coming-to-x/">DOGE</a>.</p>



<p>PEPE made a resounding entrance onto the scene earlier this year, witnessing an astonishing surge of over 25,000% within days of its mid-April launch. This unprecedented leap left the community amazed and captivated by the unfolding. As August progresses, the enthusiasm surrounding the frog-themed coin seems to have rekindled, with a renewed interest from whales amplifying the excitement.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whale-purchases-surge"><strong>Whale Purchases Surge</strong></h2>



<p>On Tuesday, August 15, &#8220;The Data Nerd,&#8221; an analyst renowned for tracking the movements of the so-called &#8220;smart money whales,&#8221; or those influential players known for their well-timed trades, unveiled intriguing insights into PEPE&#8217;s recent ascent.</p>



<p>Notably, the coin&#8217;s value has surged impressively by over 23% in the span of a week, as per CoinMarketCap, with this remarkable growth largely attributed to substantial acquisitions made by influential addresses within the crypto sphere.</p>



<p>Referencing his specialized tool, the NerdBot, the analyst highlighted several whales and intelligent wallets that have been steadily amassing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pepe-coin-shows-resilience-amidst-sec-selloff-recovery-rally-or-fakeout/">PEPE coins</a>, offering a glimpse into the minds of those who play the long game. Notably, he underscored the activities of three initial investor addresses—0xAf2, 0x720, and 0x778—each of whom garnered unrealized gains exceeding 100 times their initial investment, with the addresses holding around $5 million in PEPE.</p>



<p>The analyst also underscored an influx of new wallets that have entered the PEPE ecosystem, driven by an earnest desire to accumulate tokens. Notably, during the preceding week, one address stood out prominently. On August 9, address 0x5a2 bought 41B coins at the dip with $8,700 resulting in a (17%) unrealized gain at press time.</p>



<p>On the same day, address 0x3ef, mirroring this strategic manoeuvre, procured a staggering 1.07 trillion PEPE tokens for $1.5 million. This acquisition has resulted in a gain of 12%, amounting to $162,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/un5A_9zbIMCzPSGHDhTvAyaIvVMWYmbTU2cOho53zACcKKVmZ3riL9TRXg4CPob8XufiXVS0n42oJb4gzem90MuZFfIJzJDFQMPQcwR56a2TjWVZcYy36366LQWlC8ACmcS0KHB0L8myzjh_l8znag" alt=""/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-doge-fall-back"><strong>SHIB, DOGE fall back</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, while PEPE&#8217;s remarkable success continues, its counterparts, Shiba Inu and DOGE, are experiencing a different fate. Despite robust surges earlier in the month, SHIB has taken a step back, posting gains of roughly 14% over the past week. On the other hand, DOGE has maintained a relatively stable trading pattern over the past month with diminished volatility. Notably, the surge in Shiba Inu&#8217;s value has been attributed to the imminent Shibarium launch, which is anticipated to unfold this week.</p>



<p>PEPE was trading at $0.000001264 at press time after an 8.24% drop in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Europe has usurped the United States with the listing of its first spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange by London-based Jacobi Asset Management. The spot ETF will trade under the ticker symbol &#8220;BCOIN” and has a focus on decarbonization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-jacobi-asset-management-has-rolled-out-the-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-europe">Jacobi Asset Management has rolled out the first spot Bitcoin ETF in Europe</h2>



<p>After receiving the green light from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) in October 2021, the firm initially planned to launch its spot Bitcoin investment vehicle last year. It, however, decided to shelve the launch due to an inopportune time in the cryptosphere following the implosion of the Terra network and the bankruptcy of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX digital asset exchange.</p>



<p>But today, the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF has finally been listed for trading. The physically-backed Bitcoin fund will charge investors a 1.5% annual management fee. Fidelity Digital Assets provides custodial services for the fund, and Flow Traders takes on the role of market maker. Jane Street and DRW have been added as Authorized Participants.</p>



<p>BCOIN makes use of the FT Wilshire Bitcoin Blended Price Index to access real-time average Bitcoin price data from select crypto exchanges. The ETF product will allow investors to gain access to trading and holding Bitcoin’s value without the hassle of holding the underlying asset.</p>



<p>Jacobi teamed up with Zumo to create a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution, which allows institutional-grade investors to invest in BTC while remaining compliant with their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives.</p>



<p>The spot BTC ETF is touted as the first decarbonized digital asset fund in line with Article 8 of the European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which applies to funds fostering environmental and social objectives.</p>



<p>“Jacobi has implemented a verifiable built-in Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) solution which allows institutional investors to access the benefits of Bitcoin whilst also meeting ESG goals.”</p>



<p>The rollout of Jacobi’s spot ETF marks a significant milestone for Europe, while the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to approve a new wave of similar applications from traditional finance heavyweights such as BlackRock and Fidelity Investments — which have even included &#8220;surveillance-sharing&#8221; agreements designed to safeguard against market manipulation in their filings.</p>



<p>Martin Bednall, the CEO of Jacobi Asset Management, remarked on the continent’s progressive stance toward crypto investment products as a potential driver for more adoption:</p>



<p>“It is exciting to see Europe moving ahead of the US in opening up Bitcoin investing for institutional investors who want safe, secure access to the benefits of digital assets using familiar and regulated structures like our ETF.”</p>



<p>Whether American investors soon get a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/multiple-spot-bitcoin-etf-approvals-on-the-way-cathie-wood-predicts/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> like their European counterparts remains to be seen.</p>

<p>On Monday, August 14, the metaverse platform The Sandbox released approx. 16% of its circulating supply in a planned event. SAND, the utility token used in The Sandbox web3 ecosystem, is utilized for interaction and transactions, with a maximum supply of 3,000,000,000 SAND.</p>



<p>The anticipated event saw 332 million SAND unlocked, equating to $129.9 million in funds. The latest unlock means that 79% of SAND is now in circulation, with only 616 million yet to be released. The next release of tokens is scheduled for February 14, 2024.</p>



<p>Data published in shows that 71 million tokens went to the team and 96.8 million flowed into company reserves, while 103 million tokens were unlocked for seed sale participants. The remaining 37.5 million went to advisers and 24 million to strategic sales buyers; however, all tokens can now be freely traded on the market.</p>



<p>An increased supply usually pushes the price downwards and it is expected that much of the distributed tokens will be sold off. Interest in the metaverse has decreased by 92%, in sharp contrast to the hype it experienced when Facebook changed its name to Meta and revealed its ambitious plans for the space.</p>



<p>So far, SAND continues its slow decline in value, with only a modest drop. SAND trades at $0.38 currently, down 12% from a month ago and well short of its all-time high of $8.44 in November 2021. It appears quite likely that the market had already priced in the release of SAND as the events are pre-planned.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-legal-uncertainty-and-developments"><strong>Legal Uncertainty and Developments</strong></h2>



<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which had labelled several altcoin securities, had also included SAND in that list, alleging that The Sandbox provides information that the public would use to make investments. Sebastien Borget, the Chief Operating Officer of The Sandbox, refuted these claims saying, <em>“We do not necessarily agree with the characterization that’s been put in that litigation, including the qualification of SAND as a security there.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, a partnership was established between The Sandbox and the British Museum. This partnership aims to develop a series of digital artefacts that reflect various things from the British Museum&#8217;s collections dating back to its founding in 1753. The British Museum, which houses the most extensive collection in the world, and is also the first public national museum, hopes to expand into the digital arena through its participation with The Sandbox.</p>



<p>This collaboration will create new immersive experiences that will allow visitors worldwide to examine and interact with artefacts from the British Museum&#8217;s collections. The cooperation includes the British Museum&#8217;s licensing partner, LaCollection, focusing on building digital collections and experiences showcasing the museum&#8217;s historical value and different artefacts.</p>



<p><em>“This is a great opportunity for The Sandbox players, regardless of where they are, to learn about and enjoy the amazing collections of human history, art, and culture in the British Museum,” Borget said.</em></p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the legal uncertainty and the future token release can be countered by positive developments such as the British Museum collaboration; it will certainly depend on a renewed interest in the metaverse, should that occur.</p>

<p>The best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, said yesterday that Bitcoin could shoot well past $100,000 in the near future spurred by a number of bullish factors.</p>



<p>This news has reinvigorated Kiyosaki’s unwavering optimism in the premier cryptocurrency and its long-term investment potential.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-s-ascension-kiyosaki-sets-price-target-at-100k"><strong>Bitcoin’s Ascension: Kiyosaki Sets Price Target at $100K</strong></h2>



<p>Robert Kiyosaki, also a real estate mogul and an investor in precious metals, remains a steadfast Bitcoin supporter, despite recent incidents that have shaken mainstream investors&#8217; confidence in the world’s largest crypto.</p>



<p>Popular for his proven theories on market trends and investment strategies, Kiyosaki’s latest prediction boosts Bitcoin’s prospects. In an August 14 X post to his 2.4 million followers, he <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1691174700234477570">predicted </a>that Bitcoin’s price could hit an impressive $100,000 in the near future.</p>



<p>The rationale for his prediction is that Bitcoin is “people’s money” while gold and silver are “God’s money”. This can help BTC reach the elusive $100k mark, especially should the stock and bond markets plummet significantly, Kiyosaki says. This would also drive traditional safe-haven assets like gold and silver higher.</p>



<p>According to the famed investor, a situation where not only stocks and bonds crash but also the entire world economy collapse would supercharge Bitcoin’s price to $1 million. In such a scenario, gold would hit $75,000 per ounce, and silver would rocket to $60,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">August 22, 2023, in Johannesburg, South Africa, BRICS nations  announce gold backed crypto. US $ will die. Trillions of US $ rush home. Inflation through the roof. Buy Gold, <br>Silver. Bitcoin to $120k next year.</p>&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) <a href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1678652054951317504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Last month, Kiyosaki cited another factor he expects to catalyze Bitcoin’s run to the moon: the BRICS nations’ ((Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa)&nbsp; meeting in South Africa scheduled for August 22, 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-not-the-only-pundit-predicting-100-000-btc"><strong>Not The Only Pundit Predicting $100,000 BTC</strong></h2>



<p>Notably, Kiyosaki is not the only one making a sky-high price prediction as Adam Back, the chief executive officer of Blockstream, projects a surge in BTC’s value. Back <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundits-100000-bitcoin-price-target-by-next-halving-sparks-exciting-bet/">forecasted </a>last month that Bitcoin will rise to $100,000 and beyond by the next halving slated for March 2024.</p>



<p>British Multinational Bank Standard Chartered also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/standard-chartered-bank-says-bitcoin-price-likely-to-hit-50000-this-year-120000-by-2024/">said </a>last month that it expected the flagship cryptocurrency to reach $50,000 by the end of this year and up to $120,000 by end-2024.</p>



<p>Kiyosaki’s comments come as the price of Bitcoin continues to trade around the $29,300 zone at press time. The top crypto has returned around 0.4% for investors in the past week — making it one of the lowest volatility periods.</p>

<p>Lucie, the Chief Marketing Strategist for Shiba Inu, has taken to Twitter to provide crucial insights into the upcoming launch of Shibarium&#8217;s Layer 2 solution, igniting a wave of excitement within the Shiba Inu community.</p>



<p>In a series of tweets on Sunday, Lucie unveiled the highlights of Shibarium, shedding light on its transformative features and benefits. Shibarium Layer 2 is poised to revolutionize the Shiba Inu blockchain experience, promising ultra-low transaction fees, rapid transactions, and freedom from centralized control. Lucie emphasized that to unlock the full potential of Shibarium; users will require $BONE, a key ingredient for accessing its capabilities.</p>



<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-sees-shibarium-outshining-x-worldcoin-shib-price-at-0-001-looking-likely/">Shibarium Layer 2</a> is its focus on security. Lucie revealed that Shibarium has participated in hackathons to bolster its security infrastructure, ensuring a safe and robust platform for users. Furthermore, she revealed plans to integrate Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), enhancing asset security and giving users greater control over their digital identities. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in crypto is a concept where individuals control their own identity, thereby shifting control from central authorities.</p>



<p>Notably, every transaction conducted on Shibarium contributes to the burning of SHIB tokens, fueling what Lucie referred to as the &#8220;Shib bonfire.&#8221; This mechanism aligns with Shiba Inu&#8217;s deflationary model and highlights the ecosystem&#8217;s dedication to sustainability and tokenomics.</p>



<p>Notably, amidst the mounting excitement surrounding Shibarium&#8217;s impending launch, set to coincide with the Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto (August 13 to 17, 2023), Lucie promptly clarified that an official release date for Shibarium remains unconfirmed.</p>



<p><em>“I&#8217;m not saying it won&#8217;t come, just that there was no official announcement, and anything can happen until then,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the launch nears, crypto platforms have positioned themselves to ride the wave with KuCoin, adding to the anticipation by hinting at the potential listing of tokens from the Shiba Inu ecosystem. On Saturday, the prominent crypto exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/Shibtoken/status/1690491024508960768">tweeted</a> out an image of the Shiba Inu dog positioned next to the date August 12, accompanied by a Bone icon beneath August 15/16. Notably, the timing coincides with the upcoming launch of Shibarium, further fueling excitement within the SHIB community.</p>



<p>As the launch closes in, SHIB has held its ground firmly, following a robust surge of more than 25% over the last week. The cryptocurrency traded at $0.000010 at press time after a 3.04% drop in the past 24 hours. On the other hand, BONE faced a sharp drop of roughly 11% over the same period to trade at $1.48&nbsp;at press time.</p>

<p>Tether (USDT) recently lost its peg to the U.S. dollar. Although USDT is the most valuable stablecoin by market cap, the market turbulence did not spare the asset.</p>



<p>Last week, USDT depegged below $1 and stayed below the $1 peg for the longest time since the collapse of FTX, before making a recovery at the end of the week.</p>



<p>Selling pressure is still significantly higher than the previous week, as trading volume has dropped by 77% over the last 24 hours, while market cap progressively heds value.</p>



<p>However, the cryptocurrency has succeeded in clearing off hourly losses. According to data from CoinMarketCap, USDT is now trading at a press time price of $0.9996.</p>



<p>It bears mentioning that it wasn’t all chaos for the stablecoin. According to MessariCrypto, a leading provider of crypto market intelligence products, USDT saw a major change in the movement of its circulating supply.</p>



<p>On previous occasions when USDT had traded below $1, Tether’s market cap dropped significantly. This time, USDT’s redemptions surged to levels last seen in 2022 while supply remained stable.</p>



<p>As Messari explained;</p>



<p><em>“USDT also saw the highest amount of redemptions ($325m) since November 2022. Unlike previous depegs, where Tether&#8217;s market cap decreased significantly as redemptions rose, USDT&#8217;s circulating supply remained at similar levels.” </em></p>



<p>The instability comes not long after Tether rolled out its newly attained milestones from the second quarter of 2023. As the report noted, the company generated more than $1 billion in operating profits.</p>



<p><em>“Tether’s operational profits are over $1B for the period of April 2023 to June 2023, which corresponds to a significant 30% increase quarter over quarter.” The report read. </em></p>



<p>Additionally, Tether’s $72.5B in exposure to US T-bills is greater than Australia, Mexico, and the UAE. Tether also holds an estimated 8.5% of its total assets in Bitcoin, other precious metals, and other investments in energy production.</p>



<p>Tether also made efforts to tackle the continuous scepticism surrounding its current reserve levels, stating that its reserves are extremely liquid.</p>



<p>The CTO of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, went on to explain that transparency is not just a buzzword for the Tether network. “It [transparency] is the cornerstone of our philosophy.” He stated.</p>



<p>Conclusively, Messari maintains that despite the instability of Tether and the USDT stablecoin, Tether’s market shares are larger than it has ever been.</p>

<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase has announced the expansion of its services to Canadian citizens, strengthening its already outstanding stronghold on the North American market.</p>



<p>For its newly unveiled subscription service, Coinbase One, the exchange will waive membership fees for Canadian nationals for the first 30 days in an effort to onboard new users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-lands-in-canada"><strong>Coinbase Lands In Canada</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is making waves in Canada amid a promising local crypto regulatory climate.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s Canadian users are primed to enjoy a seamless transaction experience, thanks to an integration of Interac payment rails in partnership with local financial services firm Peoples Trust Company — which is part of Peoples Group.</p>



<p>“Coinbase is now providing access to Interac e-Transfers<em>® *</em> to 100% of Canadian Coinbase users, making it secure and simpler than ever to move money in and out of your account,” the Monday <a href="https://investor.coinbase.com/news/news-details/2023/Coinbase-Accelerates-International-Expansion-with-Official-Launch-in-Canada/default.aspx#:~:text=Through%20its%20partnership%20with%20Peoples,and%20out%20of%20your%20account">announcement </a>said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase’s official entry into Canada also introduces its Coinbase One subscription product, bringing a couple of advantages to the Canadian cryptoverse, including zero trading fees, boosted staking rewards, and priority customer support. As an introductory offer, Coinbase is giving Canadian users a free 30-day trial.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-coinbase-is-expanding-in-canada-despite-rival-exits"><strong>Why Coinbase Is Expanding In Canada Despite Rival Exits</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase explained that it has expanded its crypto services to Canada owing to the country’s high “crypto-awareness” along with what it believes is a robust regulatory framework.</p>



<p>According to Coinbase, Canada is presently the world&#8217;s third-most crypto-aware nation. In fact, the crypto exchange said it sees the Canadian market as its next “go deep” market, citing a report from the Ontario Securities Commission that claims more than 30% of Canadians said they’ll purchase cryptocurrencies within the year.</p>



<p>“Canada is well positioned to be a global leader in the crypto economy thanks to the high levels of crypto awareness, a passionate local tech ecosystem, and the progress towards a strong regulatory framework,” Coinbase&#8217;s Vice President for International and Business Development, Nana Murugesan, opined.</p>



<p>Further bolstering its commitment to Canadian users, Coinbase has named Lucas Matheson as the new Canadian Country Director. The firm is also strengthening its tech presence in the region by establishing a tech hub and investing in local startups.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s entrance to the Canadian market comes despite the recent exits of digital asset exchange competitors like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/">Binance</a>, OKX, and Bybit, citing tightening regulations in the country. </p>



<p>Notably, Coinbase is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">embroiled </a>in a lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) back at home, for allegedly failing to register as a securities exchange and broker, along with allegedly offering unregistered security tokens to its users.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Analyst Ali Martinez recently shared his thoughts about the price trajectory of LINK, the native cryptocurrency of oracle network <a href="https://zycrypto.com/chainlink-whales-splurge-over-100-million-on-link-buys-amid-surging-developer-activity/">Chainlink</a>. He wrote on ‘X’ (formerly Twitter) that Chainlink maintained support between $6.63 and $6.88, highlighting that 29,000 addresses bought 295 million LINK worth over $2 billion. Whales eager to stock up on LINK seem to have recognized Chainlink’s strength by acquiring over $90 million worth of the asset.</p>



<p>In his view, the outlook for LINK remains strong as long as it can keep above those levels, as very little in terms of barriers is in its path. He added that traders might not be as happy as long-term holders as <em>“On-chain data shows a decrease in network activity in the past three weeks, with the number of large transactions going from 527 to 118. Still, a spike in this metric might indicate a breakout.”</em></p>



<p>Data analytics platform Santiment echoes the positive attitude, stating, “Chainlink’s GitHub development activity has been notably higher this summer, leading to the asset cracking the top five most frequently developed assets,” further highlighting the bullish outlook. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ccip-gaining-momentum"><strong>CCIP Gaining Momentum</strong></h2>



<p>Chainlink, of course, has some promising developments, for example, the partnership with SWIFT, the bank transfer network currently testing the eagerly anticipated Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This collaboration aims to connect financial institutions to blockchains using CCIP, which Chainlink&#8217;s co-founder Sergey Nazarov sees as a bridge between various chains, much like TCP/IP for finance.</p>



<p>CCIP&#8217;s security model is rooted in Chainlink&#8217;s reliable pricing oracles, known for thwarting risks like flash-loan attacks. CCIP&#8217;s availability on testnets like Ethereum and Polygon reflects Chainlink paving the way for CCIP&#8217;s wider adoption on the mainnet. Chainlink received validation from Coinbase when it became clear that its layer 2 BASE would use Chainlink as a price feed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Chainlink Price Feeds are one of the leading price data solutions for developers when it comes to security, reliability, and usability,&#8221; said Coinbase Head of Protocols Jesse Pollak, who also holds responsible for creating BASE.</p>



<p>Chainlink Price Feeds will allow developers to transition their current application to BASE, based on Ethereum but with much lower gas fees and in a highly scalable environment. This will provide developers with opportunities to enhance the capabilities of BASE by offering reliable price data and expanding the potential applications that can be built on its advanced infrastructure.</p>



<p>Additionally, a project by Lendvest aims to integrate CCIP for its decentralized credit scoring system. CCIP allows secure communication between blockchains, letting Lendvest aggregate borrowing and lending data from Ethereum and Avalanche. This integration will offer accurate credit scores through a secure and decentralized blockchain protocol, improving transparency and lending mechanisms in DeFi.</p>



<p>In a statement, Lendvest said: <em>“Currently, there is no established credit score framework that provides material benefits to crypto users. Lendvest aggregates on-chain data to create decentralized data feeds to form a verifiable credit score for DeFi protocols.”</em></p>

As market participants hold their breath for a potential breakout, intriguing developments involving Bitcoin whales have added fuel to the speculative fire.</p>



<p>JA Maartunn, the community manager at the crypto analytics firm Cryptoquant, set the stage for anticipation with a tweet earlier this Sunday. Maartunn&#8217;s message highlighted a noticeable uptick in activity among Bitcoin whales, particularly those on the BitMEX crypto exchange.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Bitmex whales have joined the party. During the last night, I&#8217;ve got 3 notifications from massive new long positions Something is brewing under the surface,&#8221;</em> said Maartunn.</p>



<p>This sentiment was echoed by the pundit’s previous observation on Saturday, highlighting substantial long positions on another notable exchange, Deribit. These observations point towards an atmosphere of anticipation, as major players seem to position themselves strategically in response to market dynamics.</p>



<p>Adding to the intrigue, prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez provided additional weight to the idea of imminent market movements. In a Saturday tweet, Martinez highlighted the historical correlation between spikes in buy volume on BitMEX and Bitcoin&#8217;s subsequent price movements. According to the pundit, the recent surge in the taker buy-sell ratio on BitMEX raises the possibility of a continuation of the ongoing Bitcoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mike-novogratz-reveals-two-catalysts-for-bitcoin-to-surge-back-to-all-time-highs/">bull market</a>.</p>



<p><em>“You rarely see big spikes in buy volume on BitMEX, but when you do, $BTC tends to enjoy significant gains. In May 2020, the taker buy-sell ratio rose to 192, leading to a 567% price increase. And in January 2023, the taker buy-sell ratio spiked to 140, resulting in an 88% price jump,”</em> wrote Ali.</p>



<p><em>“Notice that the taker buy-sell ratio on BitMEX recently surged to 194. If history repeats itself, we could be preparing for the continuation of the BTC bull market,”</em> he added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0HTaUaQMOVXP8U6BNdVSUtzwM1wgp8bh-pgkvyW0RA-Nio_1ZGt1XkHKdtdUM1bC-GWJ2MVGxY5Pl9vuhbxhOW5_93AnCRjmgNQzcA5FyaQEGfI4ACSZfnATlxkt7RWtLZzys5iCNezP9_0WGyuWRQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The excitement doesn&#8217;t end there, as Martinez also revealed a fascinating development involving Bitcoin whales. As per a Sunday tweet from the pundit, in the last two weeks, approximately 10 Bitcoin whales, each holding a minimum of 1,000 BTC (equivalent to at least $29.4 million), have entered the network.</p>



<p>Such a notable influx of substantial holders brings a new dimension of uncertainty to the market landscape, potentially signalling that these whales are either seeking diversification for their portfolios or simply increasing their Bitcoin holdings.</p>



<p>That said, technically, Bitcoin seems poised to take out the $31,000 considering the price has been in a macro uptrend. Recently, veteran markets analyst Sonny Moulder <a href="https://twitter.com/MulderSonny/status/1688817860217307136">predicted</a> a larger move by Bitcoin toward the $45,000 region. But first, the pundit noted that strategically clearing weaker market participants is essential.</p>

<p>A recent financial disclosure has revealed that former U.S. President Donald Trump holds a substantial Ethereum portfolio, estimated to be valued between $250,000 and $500,000.</p>



<p>The revelation, which had recently remained away from the public eye, has sparked intense speculation about Trump&#8217;s motivations and potential aspirations, given his <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-has-just-revealed-latest-stance-on-bitcoin-cryptos/">historical skepticism</a> towards the cryptocurrency realm. Notably, the disclosure has ignited discussions around Trump&#8217;s possible foray into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrencies, which have garnered significant attention due to their promise of anonymity and efficient fundraising mechanisms.</p>



<p>The allure of DeFi platforms, in particular, lies in their ability to facilitate seamless transactions without a centralized intermediary, potentially enabling Trump to gather funds discreetly and securely for his 2024 presidential campaign, especially considering his continued bad blood with the Biden administration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZiVmgknWiT2QobWbIPbnVExTmvakBKxEEUogTgClCmGz-kjSc0p-yVh6bZmYzKwe1TnaNM28oCSnZU84xC-Kai0Hf9ObZRQNuDcCQ0KltlAw8kNZHukr6cv22KP6V5ZV0bd5CoflaL1aN66c0DCSWj5LN9ZlrTBIm0CKgh7gn5kGY2jfDGAlpXofYw-J3VXC1jj1nw9tw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Notably, the recent development is marked by a striking contrast to Trump&#8217;s remarks about cryptocurrencies. In the past, the former US president publicly criticized digital currencies, even labelling them a &#8220;scam&#8221; and asserting that they were a disaster waiting to happen. Interestingly, Trump would later soften his stand with his involvement in NFTs, although emphasizing he was in them for the art, not the money.</p>



<p>Further scrutiny of Trump&#8217;s recent cryptocurrency holdings reveals a connection to non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The asset listed in Trump&#8217;s disclosure as a &#8220;cryptocurrency wallet (Ethereum)&#8221; is linked to a collection of NFTs he launched post his presidential tenure. These NFTs took the form of unique digital trading cards, portraying Trump in various distinctive attires, ranging from a hunter&#8217;s camouflage to a superhero costume. The NFT collection garnered immense attention and quickly sold out, generating close to $10 million in sales. Trump&#8217;s share of the earnings from this venture amounted to about $300,000 in licensing fees.</p>



<p>While a sum in the hundreds of thousands might be inconsequential for someone with a net worth of approximately $2.5 billion, Trump&#8217;s involvement in cryptocurrency-related ventures underscores his willingness to explore new revenue streams. Notably, his wife, Melania Trump, has had a good relationship with cryptocurrencies, even <a href="https://zycrypto.com/melania-trump-celebrates-bitcoin-despite-donald-trump-predicting-an-ultimate-crypto-explosion/">praising Bitcoin</a> once on hitting its 13<sup>th</sup> year since the Genesis block. The former first lady was also involved with various NFT-related ventures, including partnering with crypto payments firm Moonpay for her NFT line.</p>



<p>With the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intensifying its scrutiny of the cryptocurrency industry, it remains noteworthy that the regulatory agency has largely steered clear of intervening in the NFT sector, under which Trump&#8217;s NFT venture falls. Consequently, any potential legal ramifications from his cryptocurrency-related activities appear relatively limited. Trump&#8217;s involvement thus underscores the increasingly complex and dynamic relationship between influential figures and digital assets.</p>

<p>XRP price is slightly up on the 24-hour timeframe while having retracted 4% in the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This price development seems optimistic, given that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just filed a motion for leave to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-hanging-by-a-thread-as-sec-finally-moves-for-appeal-against-ripple-what-to-expect-next/">file an interlocutory appeal</a>.</p>



<p>While initial reactions to this have been negative, with some spreading “fear, uncertainty, and doubt” (FUD) that XRP’s status as a non-security may be under threat, this is clearly not the case. Judge Torres ruled that XRP is not a security and cited the SEC v Telegram case to establish digital assets like XRP as commodities. However, the focus of the SEC&#8217;s appeal pertains to allegations against Ripple and its executives regarding programmatic and individual XRP sales rather than individual peer-to-peer trading activities on exchanges.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-institutional-investors-see-ruling-positive-for-altcoins"><strong>Institutional Investors See Ruling Positive for Altcoins</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent report, Fineqia International Inc., a well-known fintech and digital asset investment business, saw an increase in investor interest, which led to a 70% increase in the total Assets Under Management (AUM) for worldwide Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) related to digital assets.</p>



<p>The AUM increased by 70% this year to $34 billion at the end of July, exceeding the 47.7% increase in the underlying value of digital assets. During July, there was an inflow of funds into cryptocurrencies, notably XRP, which witnessed a 57% gain in AUM after the SEC v. Ripple Labs decision.</p>



<p>It should be noted that, unsurprisingly, Bitcoin and Ethereum still dominate the digital asset and fintech investment business. As Fineqia CEO Bundeep Singh Rangar puts it, <em>&#8220;Despite net inflows, the fact that more than 90% of digital asset ETP AUMs comprise of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) weighed down on the value of AUMs&#8221;.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-can-the-sec-win-on-appeal"><strong>Can the SEC Win on Appeal?</strong></h2>



<p>Regarding the certification for interlocutory appeal by the SEC, Ripple can still respond before Judge Torres casts her judgment. And even then, the chances of success for the agency are modest, as many legal commentators have noted. MetaLawMan<a href="https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1689654814219833344"> stated</a> on “X” that he believes it to be a close call, adding that interlocutory appeals have a low success rate but that <em>“Judge Rakoff&#8217;s decision in the Terraform Labs case makes it far more likely that Judge Torres will take that unusual step and certify the interlocutory appeal”.</em></p>



<p>So, will XRP return to all-time highs above $3 in the foreseeable future? While no one can predict the future, XRP and the XRPL use cases must be closely monitored as crypto adoption increases. For example, developments such as the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/palau-stablecoin-advances-to-next-phase-on-xrpl-transitioning-from-island-paradise-to-blockchain-frontier/">Palau Stablecoin project</a> and Ripple joining the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundit-highlights-possibility-of-xrp-price-at-1800-as-ripple-enters-1-quadrillion-derivatives-market/">create euphoria</a>. One should note, however, that these developments, especially in the case of ISDA, do not impact XRP in the short term, and the investment in cryptocurrencies bears considerable risk.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;We began these reports voluntarily to provide updates on our XRP holdings. Unfortunately, they were used against us in the SEC lawsuit. However, we remain committed to transparency, though I expect they will look different going forward.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Garlinghouse&#8217;s statements were supported by Ripple&#8217;s attorney, John E Deaton, who <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1686627185774166016">explained</a> on Twitter that the reports were published for transparency and not out of obligation, as Ripple, being a private company, was not required to share them.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It is absolutely true that the SEC used the transparency of these reports against Ripple and its two executives. As a private company, Ripple was under no obligation to share this info. Other companies not only didn&#8217;t share token sales, but intentionally disguised those transactions.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The SEC attempted to use the information from Ripple&#8217;s XRP report against the company during the lawsuit, making allegations of fraud and market manipulation. This is despite the fact that the transparency of the reports was precisely intended to prove the opposite.</p>



<p>In the latest report for the second quarter of 2023, Ripple announced that it would change the format of the reports to focus on clarifying misunderstandings and providing transparency about its XRP holdings.</p>



<p>For example, Ripple highlighted that most of the monthly releases of XRP from the escrow account will be redeposited to be accessed in the future rather than being sold on the open market. However, Garlinghouse clarified that they may change the focus of the reports due to the SEC&#8217;s recent actions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-sec-vs-ripple-case-is-still-ongoing"><strong>The SEC vs. Ripple case is still ongoing</strong></h2>



<p>On July 13, Ripple secured one of its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-to-expand-presence-in-u-s-market-after-xrp-court-win-top-executive-reveals-big-plans/">major victories</a> in the case against the SEC, as Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple, determining that XRP cannot be considered an unregistered security. This led to major exchanges such as Coinbase, Bitstamp, and Kraken relisting XRP for U.S. users.</p>



<p>XRP had been delisted from many platforms due to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit filed in December 2020 and its intense regulatory scrutiny against cryptocurrency companies and exchanges, negatively impacting its price since then.</p>



<p>However, following Judge Torres&#8217; ruling, the price of XRP experienced an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-ripple-seeks-crypto-license-in-ireland-and-uk-following-courtroom-win/">impressive increase</a> of 99.84%, going from approximately $0.47 to a peak of $0.93 in a day. Currently, the price of XRP stands at $0.66, representing a 41% increase since Judge Torres&#8217; ruling.</p>
