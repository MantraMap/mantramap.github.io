In response to this pattern, the altcoin is currently experiencing minor corrections, which is likely to plunge the prices to $1500 support. However, this pullback is part of the aforementioned pattern and could offer exponential growth in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price needs a $1680 breakout to resume the bullish rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish divergence in the daily RSI slope increases the chance of a temporary pullback. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $10.5 Billion, indicating a 10% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UusdEcJh.png" alt="Ethereum coin price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the growing bullish sentiment in the crypto market, the Ethereum coin price showed a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">U-shaped recovery</a> in the daily time frame chart. This bull run registered 42.3% gains in the first three weeks of 2023 and pushed the altcoin to a local high of $1680.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the ETH coin price reverted from the $1680 resistance immediately, suggesting the bullish momentum must have been exhausted. Moreover,  this resulting pullback is important for the Ethereum price to neutralize the prior recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, this corrections phase is currently shaping the handle formation of the cup and handle pattern and trying to recuperate the bullish momentum. By the pressure time, the altcoin currently trade at $1617 and continues to wobble between $1500 and $1680.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, If the selling pressure persists, the altcoin could tumble 6.3% down to revisit the $1500 support. The traders looking for an entry opportunity can consider entering at this pullback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the influence bullish pattern, the ETH price is well likely to breach the $1680 neckline resistance in the coming weeks. This breakout will trigger the bullish pattern and offers a safer entry opportunity for traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, in ideal bullish conditions, this breakout could lead to a sustained recovery to the $2250 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>RSI</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: the<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/"> daily-RSI</a> slope turned down from the overbought region indicates the prices are trying to neutralize the excessive buying activity to resume the prior recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: a potential bullish crossover between 20-and-200-day EMA at the $1500 mark increases the support strength of this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1606</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1680  and $1800</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1500 and $1350</span></li>

The DNB <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.reuters.com/article/netherlands-coinbase-fine/dutch-central-bank-fines-cryptocurrency-exchange-coinbase-3-3-mln-euros-idUKA5N32P01H" rel="nofollow">stated</a> that it had taken into account the fact that Coinbase was one of the largest corporations dealing in cryptocurrencies and had a substantial number of customers in the northwestern European country.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Fined By Dutch Central Bank</h2>
<p>The authorities asserted that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> did not comply with the regulations over the time period extending from November 2020 to August 2022. And, in accordance with the Dutch Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act, businesses that operate in the Netherlands or intend to offer crypto-related services are required to register with the DNB first.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/"><em>Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</em></a></p>
<p>On May 21, 2020, the central bank made it a necessity for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchanges</a> and crypto service providers to register with the government body in order to comply with the requirement. This was done due to the increased threat of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">money laundering</a> and terrorism funding linked with crypto services &#8212; because of the anonymity that comes with it.</p>
<p>The Dutch Central Bank was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase has enjoyed a competitive advantage in that it has not paid any supervisory fees to DNB or incurred other costs in connection with DNB’s regular supervision activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the central bank disclosed that the exchange has previously violated the objectives of the instructions by operating in the Netherlands and providing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> services without first registering with the DNB. Because of this, Coinbase was unable to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit of the country during the period in which it was non-compliant and will be unable to do so until September 22, 2022. As a direct consequence of this, it is possible that the investigative authorities missed a significant number of suspicious transactions during this time period.</p>
<h2>Coinbase&#8217;s Growing Legal Troubles</h2>
<p>Notedly, Coinbase&#8217;s business practices have already drawn the attention of government regulators and authorities. A settlement agreement in the amount of $100 million was reached between Coinbase Global Inc. and the New York Department of Financial Services (<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/nydfs/">NYDFS</a>) earlier this month. According to a statement issued by NYDFS, the organization observed that Coinbase considered its onboarding requirements for consumers as a &#8220;simple check-the-box&#8221; and did not conduct necessary background checks.</p>
<p>Coinbase right now has time till March 2 to submit an appeal to the Dutch central bank over the proposed penalties. It is anticipated that the share price of Coinbase (COIN) would react to the news as soon as the U.S. market opens up for trading on Thursday morning. As things currently stand, COIN price is marginally holding above the $50 mark&#8211;at $52.76&#8211;witnessing a significant drop of 1.48% yesterday.</p>

Some optical illusions look so basic yet are interpreted differently by different people.</p>
<h2>Optical Illusion</h2>
<p>We all live in a three-dimensional world, so our brain gets clues about depth, shading, lighting, and position to help us interpret what we see. Optical illusions comprise numerous categories like abstract art, unrealistic optimism, geometrical-optical illusions, and much more that we perceive differently than they really are.</p>

<h2>An interesting fact about Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu, one of the most popular meme coins, was founded in 2020. It was founded by Ryoshi. But the truth is the person otherwise known as “Ryoshi” is anonymous and unknown. In a blog post, the founder calls himself “a nobody”.</p>
<p>Accompanied by a picture of a fisherman throwing his net into the water, Ryoshi – which means fisherman in Japanese – writes: “I have said from the beginning, I am a nobody, I am not important.”</p>

FM will present the country&#8217;s income and expenditure plans along with new announcements for the crypto community of India. Notably, in the Union Budget 2022, the Finance Minister announced a crypto tax policy. The government introduced the policy under the newly introduced Section 115BBH of the Income Tax Act. With it, the government levied a 30% tax on cryptocurrencies in addition to a 1% TDS.</p>
<p>However, the crypto tax policy didn&#8217;t have a positive impact on the Indian crypto community. According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.outlookindia.com/crypto/stung-by-tax-rules-indian-crypto-exchanges-transfer-rs-32-000-cr-offshore-from-feb-oct-2022-news-250814" rel="nofollow">study</a> conducted by the Esya Centre and Taxsutra, domestic <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> startups shifted nearly INR 32,000 crore in transaction volume to overseas <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchanges</a> between February and October 2022.</p>
<h2>Crypto Tax in India: What is the Crypto Community Saying?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency firms have reportedly requested that the government implements rationalized taxation policies ahead of the Union Budget 2023. Punit Agarwal, Founder of KoinX, believes that a systematic regulatory framework will provide more clarity and some relief. In a public statement, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We indeed hope for the best in lieu of everyone&#8217;s interest as crypto is advancing for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-regulation/">regulation</a> to support transparent investigations.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As stated earlier many investors have chosen to trade their assets on foreign exchanges without a system to deduct 1% TDS. They chose this path to protect their investments from the massive crypto tax imposed by the government. The high proportion of these transactions was unexpected by the authorities.</p>

<p>Bharat Web3 Association (BWA) has written to the finance ministry. This newly formed cryptocurrency and web3 industry body expressed its concerns in the letter. It further recommended taxation and regulatory uncertainty in advance of the Union Budget 2023-24. Tarusha Mittal, chief operating officer (COO) and co-founder, UniFarm and Dapps, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget/banking/story/budget-2023-crypto-exchanges-bat-for-regulatory-framework-and-lower-taxation-359564-2023-01-10" rel="nofollow">said</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bharat Web3 Association (BWA) has recommended that Sitharaman should highlight the impact of existing tax provisions such as TDS, tax on income from virtual digital assets (VDAs), and not allow carrying forward of losses on the wider industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to experts like Purushottam Anand excessive crypto tax after the Union Budget 2022 has significantly dampened customer interest. Crypto tax has further triggered a mass exodus of Indian crypto projects to other jurisdictions. Anand, the founder of Crypto Legal stated,</p>
<p>&#8220;The government introduced crypto taxation last year as a policy tool to maintain status quo and to discourage retail investors from entering crypto space till a regulatory framework is introduced.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the monsoon session of parliament in July 2022, FM stated that global collaboration can implement a common taxonomy standard on crypto. Now the Union Budget 2023 will show how much India has proceeded in accepting crypto.</p>

There are benefits and drawbacks to both cryptocurrencies and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fiat-money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiat money</a></strong>. The decision between the two for businesses depends on a variety of variables, including industry and national regulatory framework.</p>
<h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
<p>Cryptography is used to secure transactions in cryptocurrency, which is a digital or virtual currency. Since cryptocurrency is decentralized, neither a government nor a financial institution can control it.</p>
<p>The first and most well-known cryptocurrency, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a></strong>, was developed in 2009. Since then, thousands of additional cryptocurrencies have been developed. <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-vitalik-buterin-discover-eth-founders-home-net-worth-and-family/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a></strong>, Litecoin, and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/usdt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tether</a></strong> are some of the most well-known.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crypto vs Fiat | How Does Crypto Compare To Money?" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYcqFOms3LY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>What is Fiat Money?</h2>
<p>A currency that a government declares to be legal tender is known as fiat money. Fiat money, in contrast to cryptocurrencies, is heavily centralized and regulated by governments.</p>
<p>In today’s time, the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/us-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US dollar</a></strong> is the most widely used fiat currency. Japanese yen, the euro, and the British pound are a few other widely used currencies. In addition to being the preferred currency of the majority of central banks, fiat money is frequently used in international trade.</p>
<h2>Crypto Vs Fiat Money: Differences</h2>
<p>Fiat is a currency that is issued by the government and is accepted as payment in transactions. Since cryptocurrency is <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decentralized</a></strong>, its value cannot be controlled by a central authority. Additionally, not all nations permit it as a legitimate practice.</p>
<p>Fiat money has an unlimited supply in theory because more can be printed at any time. Most cryptocurrencies only ever produce a certain number of coins. Unlike digital currency, fiat can also be represented with actual notes and coins. Digital, or cryptocurrency, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wallets</a></strong> are required to <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/top-5-hot-crypto-wallets-in-january-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">store digital currency</a></strong>. Fiat can be stored in a variety of ways and can be represented physically or digitally.</p>

<h3>Crypto Vs Fiat Money: How crypto is better than fiat?</h3>
<p>As interest in crypto grows more and more on a global scale, it is crucial to look into why it is so popular. The following are some advantages of a cryptocurrency over traditional fiat currencies:</p>
<h3>1. Decentralized</h3>
<p>The decentralization model is the foundation of cryptocurrency. It denotes the absence of a central figure acting as a go-between for the sender and recipient. In reality, users own and have full control over their cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3>2. Digitalized</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies function like programmed software where transactions can only be completed after a small group of people (miners) has figured out difficult mathematical problems. Also, recorded their solution in a distributed ledger on the internet. Therefore, issues with currency damage and storage won&#8217;t arise.</p>
<h3>3. Security</h3>
<p>Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, making them more secure than traditional currencies. A set of private keys, which function like a password to unlock the recipient&#8217;s cryptos at the time of sale, is given for each verified transaction.</p>
<h3>4. Accessibility</h3>
<p>Users who frequently run out of cash might be intimidated by the idea of waiting in a long line at an ATM. But with cryptos, all a user needs to get started is a smartphone or computer with an internet connection. They can send or receive digital tokens across borders in just a few clicks.</p>
<h3>What does the future look like for fiat and crypto?</h3>
<p>Although fiat money is undoubtedly here to stay, digital tokens have applications and are likely to keep expanding. It&#8217;s a sure bet that fiat money will continue to rule the roost as a form of payment. Since users can spend fiat money almost anywhere, it is a much safer option and also much simpler to use when making purchases.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are applications for cryptography. It has gained popularity as an investment and can be used as a useful substitute for fiat money when sending money. With this market, caution is always advised, but since it will play a role in the future of money, it&#8217;s a good idea to at least be familiar with it.</p>

But over the last two-three months, one altcoin that&#8217;s been consistently doing well is Litecoin (LTC).</p>
<p>During the last 90 days, LTC has gained more than 80% while grabbing the attention of investors. As per the on-chain data, large whale addresses holding LTC have exploded in activity. On-chain data provider Santiment reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>Litecoin&#8217;s large whale transactions have exploded with activity, indicating a resurgence of transactions that are valued at $1 million or more. On the tail end of the last two similarly sized whale spikes, prices jumped +37% and +33% at their peaks.</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_136759" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136759" style="width: 2913px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-136759" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/26103154/Litecoin-Whale-Transactions.jpeg" alt="" width="2913" height="1816" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-136759" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy: <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1618453883029970945" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Market analysts believe that LTC will continue to be on investors&#8217; radars this year as the major <a href="https://coingape.com/litecoin-price-prediction-when-to-expect-ltc-rally-ahead-of-halving-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halving event</a> is approaching in the second half of 2023. This could serve as a major catalyst for the LTC to all even more. Some analysts are expecting Litecoin&#8217;s (LTC) price to rally all the way to $150 and around.</p>
<h3>dYdX Also Joins Litecoin In Party</h3>
<p>Over the last 24-hours, dYdX has jumped by a staggering 30% as the dYdX Foundation <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dydx.foundation/blog/lock-up-extension" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that they would be delaying the unlocking of its 150 million tokens from the next month of February to later December this year. As a result, there&#8217;s been huge whale participation in dYdX as of now.</p>
<p>As of press time, dYdX is trading at a price of $1.99. The Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1618292489051594752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>DYDX <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">has been a bright spot and is +22% on the day in an otherwise quiet </span><span class="r-18u37iz">#altcoin</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> market.

Additionally, there are already 10 $1M+ whale transactions today.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Along with Litecoin and dYdX, several other small and mid-cap altcoins have seen strong rallies this year. Some of the altcoins that have jumped 20% in the last 24 hours include LCX, SONM, Aptos, Nervos, Concordium, etc.</p>

<p>In its Federal lawsuit filed on Wednesday, January 25, Mango Labs said that the hacker &#8211; Avraham Eisenberg &#8211; had agreed to return $67 million of the ill-gotten funds. But Mango Labs now wants the rest of the money as well.</p>
<p>In a separate filing previously, the US Securities Commission and the U.S. CFTC had sued Eisenberg for perpetrating the crime. As both agencies accused him of manipulating the MNGO token, the trader faces parallel criminal charges. Last month in December 2022, Eisenberg was arrested in Puerto Rico, however, it&#8217;s not confirmed whether he&#8217;s been moved to New York, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mango-labs-sues-trader-to-recover-allegedly-stolen-tokens-1.1875005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> Bloomberg.</p>
<h3>The Mango Markets Hack</h3>
<p>Last month in October 2022, Avraham Eisenberg used two separate accounts on the Mago Markets Defi platform to manipulate the price of the MNGO tokens through perpetual swaps. These are basically futures trades that allow users to keep their positions open.</p>
<p>As per details, Eisenberg managed to push the price of the swaps up by 1300% in just 20 minutes and cash out. Amid this, the price of MNGO tokens dropped to just 2 cents with Mango Markets forced to suspend operations the day after the incident.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Eisenberg went out all on Twitter bragging that the team operated a &#8220;highly profitable trading strategy&#8221; while allegedly referring to the Mango scheme. Eisenberg also posted that he believed that his actions were legal.</p>
<p>Mango Markets has further accused Eisenberg of attacking the crypto lending platform Aave. The company <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/mango-labs-sues-trader-to-recover-allegedly-stolen-tokens-1.1875005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Since the attack, defendant has continued to plot to attack Mango Markets further, in public, and has used the converted funds to attack other cryptocurrency protocols as well&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The case is currently going on in the US District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Besides, Eisenberg hasn&#8217;t got a lawyer for himself yet. The last year of 2022 witnessed some of the biggest hacks in the DeFi space. The DeFi market lost $4 billion alone in hacks.</p>

Following the submission of both parties&#8217; final documents on the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp-lawsuit/">XRP lawsuit</a>, Ripple and the SEC, together with other interested parties&#8211;have since showcased summary briefings that are likely to influence the final outcome of the case.</p>
<h2>XRP Lawsuit&#8217;s New Update</h2>
<p>However, before the final briefings, defense counsel James Filan disclosed that the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/page/16/">United States</a>-based crypto firm had submitted a motion in opposition to a filing that was made by Investment Banker Declarant trying to conceal certain facts from being made public. The data contains, among other things, his name, job title, and company name. The declarant claims he should be shielded from liability since he voluntarily filed the declaration in support of the SEC&#8217;s summary judgment motion.</p>
<p>According to latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1618313473599115264" rel="nofollow">reports</a>, the “Investment Banker Declarant (IBD)” has filed a response to Ripple’s opposition to the motion. The official release states that none of the defendants&#8217; reasons are strong enough to outweigh the substantial privacy and safety concerns of Investment Banker Declarant in allowing the specifically targeted redactions. First and foremost, the Defendants&#8217; principal defense that IBD, an employee of an SEC-regulated entity, provided his declaration to the SEC &#8220;voluntarily&#8221; provides no legitimate justification for refusing leave to redact.</p>
<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</em></a></p>
<p>The IBD, who is employed by a broker-dealer that is registered with the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">SEC</a>, was unable to refuse a request for a declaration from the SEC, which serves as his company&#8217;s main regulatory body. The SEC&#8217;s other option, had Investment Banker Declarant declined to give a statement, was to compel his testimony to verify the document in question. It goes without saying that there cannot be a truly voluntary &#8220;decision&#8221; when a witness&#8217;s two options are to make a declaration or testify. Even if there were, voluntariness is not taken into account when analyzing redactions, and the defendants provide no evidence to the contrary. If anything, historical precedent clearly shows that where there are compelling grounds to redact, especially when it comes to the safety and privacy of other individuals involved in the dispute, those concerns take precedence over all other factors.</p>
<h2>The SEC Vs. Ripple Saga</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the report states, the court has already acknowledged that the risks to witnesses, in this case, are significant to warrant the redaction of any identifying information that may have been included in the documents. As a publicly-named witness in this high-profile matter, Investment Banker Declarant and his co-workers would face similar risks. In conclusion, the firm representing the IBD in the ongoing <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/">SEC Vs. Ripple case</a> &#8212; alleged that the Defendants&#8217; arguments if followed to their logical conclusion, would make any future government inquiries more difficult. The participation of individuals who may desire or need to maintain their anonymity is extremely important to investigators.</p>
<blockquote><p>If that confidentiality cannot be assured, cooperation will not be forthcoming.</p></blockquote>
<p>With all the hype and discussion surrounding the XRP lawsuit, the case development is anticipated to have a substantial effect on the price of XRP; which has received some bullish signals as a result of the situation. <span id="inputElements~dce916a38741450f" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8">As things stand, the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/">XRP token</a> is currently exchanging hands at $0.41.</span><span id="inputElements~821cca2d8e5ecb60" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8"> This represents a decrease of 2.47% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 6.11% during the week as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</span></p>

This bullish rally was led by a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">rising parallel channel pattern</a> and doubled the Ape Coin&#8217;s market value from its November 2022 low. However, in theory, this pattern is known as a bearish continuation pattern, intensifying the selling pressure upon the breakdown of the support trendline. Having said that, the buyers gave an upside breakout from the patterns trendline but is still struggling to offer a follow-up rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The multiple rejection candles at $6 indicate the sellers continue to defend this level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA could encourage the resumption of a bullish recovery</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Apecoin is $173. Million, indicating a 26% gain</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a strong bullish scenario, an upside breakout from the patterns resistance trendline will undermine this bearish thesis and increase the buying pressure. There, on January 21st, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/apecoin/">Apecoin price</a> gave a high momentum breakout from the pattern&#8217;s resistance trendline, offering an entry opportunity for sidelined traders. This breakout was supposed to trigger a significant rally, but instead, the coin price is moving sideways, struggling to breach $6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin currently trades at the $5.84 mark and shows several higher price rejection candles at $6 in the last five days. These rejection candles signal the exhausted bullish moment and the ability of buyers to sustain higher prices.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the selling pressure persists, the coin price will likely break the rising trendline and validate the prior breakout as a fakeout or <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-bull-trap-in-crypto/">bull trap.</a> This breakdown will encourage longer corrections and may plunge the price back to $4.47.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, the traders looking for a long entry opportunity should wait for a daily candle closing above $6.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: despite a rising price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> showing a downfall indicates a bearish divergence. This divergence with price action showcase and additional confirmation for coming correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the recently reclaimed 200-day EMA  moving the $5.2 mark increases the support power of this level.</span></p>

Overnight, the value of cryptocurrencies started to experience a downward trend, with <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> being the most negatively affected crypto asset in the top five currencies by <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/">market cap</a>.</p>
<h2>Stocks Pull Crypto Market Down</h2>
<p>According to market data obtained at the time of writing, the overall <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> decreased by 2.66%, bringing its value to $1.02 trillion. In addition, the total volume of trades executed fell by 0.82%, reaching almost $56.31 billion. Since the mid of December, there has been an increase in the degree to which <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s</a> price and that of equities have correlated with one another. Today&#8217;s drop in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> prices follows a downward trend in equity markets as well. The last time correlations were this high was during the pre-FTX collapse era. Prominent crypto analysts too have voiced the same opinion and are finding this dip as an opportunity to re-enter the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">S&amp;P coming down, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> comes down. </p>
<p>Easy play. </p>
<p>Waiting for my long fills to be hit.</p>

<h2>Crypto Stocks &amp; FOMC Meeting</h2>
<p>With all major indexes, such as the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sp500/">S&amp;P500</a> and Dow Jones falling over by 2% in the opening hours, Microsoft posted a fall of 4% while Amazon dipped roughly by 3% to $93 per share. Crypto-focused stocks were hit hard as well, with Silvergate dropping by 4.6% to $13. Although, the crypto-friendly bank saw its stock price surge early this week, today&#8217;s loss has given back majority of the gains it had made. Crypto giant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> also witnessed a decline of 6.4% to $50, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/jack-dorsey/">Jack Dorsey&#8217;s</a> Block dropped by approximately 5.9% to $76. MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock price dropped by 4.5% shortly after the opening bell.</p>

<p>Market participants are also divided on the upcoming <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/fomc/">FOMC</a> meeting scheduled to be held on the 1st of February. In a speech on January 20, Gov. Christopher Waller at the Council on Foreign Relations stated that he currently favors a 25 basis point increase at the next meeting. Other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> officials have also made similar comments.</p>

<p><span id="inputElements~dce916a38741450f" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8">As things stand, cryptocurrencies are taking a hit due to the falling prices in the traditional markets. Popular <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoins</a> like <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/shiba-inu-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20is%20also%20called,group%20or%20individual%20called%20Ryoshi.">Shiba Inu</a>, both witnessed significant losses, with the former falling 5.1% and the latter falling by 6.2%. Other significant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a>, including BNB, XRP and Cardano, also experienced price drops of over 4%. Whereas, crypto&#8217;s flagship asset&#8211;Bitcoin&#8211;witnessed a significant decline and is currently exchanging hands at $22,593.</span><span id="inputElements~821cca2d8e5ecb60" class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit css-1uk1gs8"> This represents a decrease of 1.5% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 7% during the week as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker.</span></p>

Moreover, the multiple higher-price rejections daily candles showcased a higher possibility of a minor pullback. Here&#8217;s how long this correction phase could extend, and should you buy it?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential pullback in Bitcoin price could assist traders in recuperating the bullish momentum. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 50-and-100 EMA encourages additional buyers in the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $26.2 Billion, indicating a 2% gain</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/z/zror2F5H.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two months, the Bitcoin price showcased a simple structure of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a>. This is one of the famous bullish patterns which is often spotted at market bottoms and displays a sign of sustained recovery in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U-shaped recovery visible in the daily chart has surged the BTC price to 36.7% higher since the beginning of 2023. On January 20th, the BTC price provided a massive breakout from the pattern&#8217;s neckline resistance of $21600 and local resistance of $22500.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This breakout should have accelerated the bullish momentum and extended the ongoing recovery, but instead, the Bitcoin price went sideways and hovered above the $22500 support. Over the past five days, the Bitcoin price showed several higher price rejections at the $23000 mark, indicating the birds are struggling to sustain breached levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These rejection candles suggest profit booking from short-term traders, hinting at a higher possibility of price correction. Anyhow a minor consolidation or pullback could benefit Bitcoin price to neutralize the excessive buying since January 1st.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-discord-groups-servers/">Top Crypto Discord Servers/Groups Worth Joining In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential pullback could tumble the BTC price 4.5% down to retest the $21600 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the influence of the rounding bottom pattern, the post-correction rally could rise 25% higher to hit the $28150 resistance. Thus, if the buying pressure persists, the buyers could surpass this pattern to chase $30000. mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the possible correction and daily candle closing below $21600 could weaken the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>&#8211; The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> falling from the oversold region indicates the prices are in process of stabilizing the bullish trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>:  the 20 and 200-day EMAs nearing a police crossover at the $21600 mark increase the support power of this level.</span></p>

Validators and projects running on the Terra Classic network commit to burn millions of LUNC tokens after <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance temporarily <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-suspends-terra-classic-lunc-burn-lunc-price-falls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suspended its LUNC burn</a> mechanism until March.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Validators Lead the Burns for Community</h2>
<p>CoinGape has been tracking the weekly burns by the Terra Classic community, believing in the revival of the Terra Classic as per the roadmap suggested by core developer Edward Kim. Also, the community plans to burn billions of LUNC tokens in 2023.</p>
<p>While the week still has a few days left, the community has already burned over 20 million LUNC tokens in the last 4 days. The LUNC burns have increased by almost 4 million week-over-week in January, indicating a move in the right direction.</p>
<p>The highest burn of the week came from <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/HappyCatKripto/status/1617988930489712640" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">validator</a> HappyCattyCrypto, which burned over 9 million LUNC tokens. It is followed by 7.2 million LUNC tokens burn by Cremation Coin, which aims to burn millions of tokens every week.</p>
<p>Validators LUNC DAO committed sent over 1.62 million LUNC tokens to the burn address. LUNC DAO is the fifth-largest contributor to the LUNC burn, with almost 435.79 million LUNC burned in total. The remaining burns came from members of the Terra Classic community including Yanis, a top contributor who sent 1 million tokens to the burn address.</p>
<p>Last week, the community burned over <a href="https://coingape.com/another-massive-lunc-tokens-burn-by-terra-classic-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16 million LUNC tokens</a>, which was also a 4 million increase as compared to the earlier week’s <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-burns-over-12-million-lunc-price-jumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million LUNC tokens</a>.</p>
<h2>LUNC Community Approves Crucial Proposal</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-community-passes-proposal-to-bring-back-binance-burns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proposal 11310 by Terra Classic</a> core developer Edward Kim was unanimously passed by the Terra Classic community. The proposal aims to upgrade the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a> from v1.0.4 to v1.0.5 and introduces codes to make future upgrades possible.</p>
<p>It will also enable the Joint L1 Task Force to make necessary changes to bring back burn Binance LUNC burn mechanism. Binance may stop its LUNC burn mechanism if the Terra Classic community fails to make these changes.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the LUNC price trades at $0.0001697, down over 5% in the last 24 hours.</p>

Last week, crypto lender <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-lender-genesis-filed-for-bankruptcy-amid-troubles/">Genesis Global filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> protection, as it fell prey to the FTX led contagion. Luno&#8217;s latest move comes as yet another setback to the DCG, which is facing the heat due to the liquidity crisis. The crypto exchange, with around 900 employees, is based in London. The company&#8217;s CEO, Marcus Swanepoel, said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;2022 has been an incredibly tough year for the broader tech industry and in particular the crypto market. Luno unfortunately hasn’t been immune to this turbulence, which has affected our overall growth and revenue numbers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Thus, amid this recovery, we are picking up the top crypto coins which are following the famous bullish pattern called the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">falling wedge.</a> Under the influence of this pattern, the selected coins could witness massive gains in 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">About The Falling Wedge Pattern</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern displays itself when an asset price is wobbling between two converging trend lines. With these trendline extending downwards, this pattern often showcases an established downtrend and provide a discount opportunity to market participants. Furthermore, the most common outcome of the pattern is a bullish breakout from the resistance trendline, triggering a fresh recovery rally. This breakout signals a switch in market sentiment from selling in rallies to buying on dips. In addition, the lower high formation during this pattern also acts as a potential target upon breakout.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum(ETH)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/s0KrhsGx.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent recovery, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum coin price</a> shows a strong green candle in the monthly time frame chart, This bullish candle breaks the long-coming trendline of the wedge pattern hinting at an early sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ETH price currently trades at the $1558 mark and is discounted 68.12% from the all-time high of $4891. Thus, with sustained buying, the coin price should chase the potential targets of $2140, $3630, and $4680.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ripple(XRP)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/8/8hwxMyaP.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/">Ripple(XRP) coin price</a> has been wobbling within the wedge pattern for nearly two years. Amid the new year recovery, the price shows a breakout attempt from the pattern trendline, which could ring a recovery opportunity for XRP holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price currently trades at the $0.4 mark and is 89.37% down from All time high of $3.84. Thus, a monthly candle closing above the downsloping will accelerate the bullish momentum and offer an entry opportunity for sidelined buyers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a wedge pattern, the potential target for XRP price could be $0.56, $0.936, $1.36, or $1.9.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano(ADA)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bMheaVvO.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the falling wedge pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/cardano/">Cardano coin price</a> showcased a steady downtrend for the past seven months, On January 12th, the Cardano coin price offered a bullish breakout from the long coming trendline, offering an entry opportunity for sidelined traders. So far, the post-retest rally has surged the coin price 12% higher to currently trade at the $0.36 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, if the buying pressure persists, the coin price could rise to the $0.43, $0.58, or $0.67 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot(DOT)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/M8scu27T.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/">Polkadot coin price</a> currently exchanges hands at $6.27 and is discounted 88.6% from an all-time high of $55.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 14th, the prices provided a massive breakout from the pattern resistance trendline and pushed the post-retest to rally 17% higher to hit the local resistance of $6.7.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, in response to the wedge pattern breakout, the prices could extend the bull run to $7.3, $9.6, or $11.8.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aave(AAVE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/RKfdO9eM.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/aave/">AAVE price</a> monthly chart showcases one of the textbook examples of a falling pattern. The coin price has been resonating within this pattern for nearly two years and has tumbled its market value by 87.77%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent recovery in the crypto market bolstered coin buyers to breach the pattern’s resistance trendline, suggesting an upcoming recovery in AAVE price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This altcoin currently trades at the $81 mark and provides potential targets of $114, $250, $425, or $584.</span></p>

And, as per latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://news.einfomax.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=4251784" rel="nofollow">reports</a>, prosecutors have asked for an arrest warrant to be issued for 41-year-old Mr. Kang Jong-hyeon, who is reported to be the real owner of the crypto exchange. The investigation into allegations of embezzlement by the core executives of the exchange is being conducted by the prosecution.</p>
<h2>Bithumb Owner Faces Arrest</h2>
<p>According to members of the legal community, on the 25th, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Financial Investigation handed down sentences to Kang and two executives of Bithumb affiliates on charges of misappropriation of funds and breach of trust under the Act of Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes as well as fraudulent illegal transactions under the Capital Markets Act.</p>

<p>Kang is the older brother of Kang Ji-yeon, who serves as the CEO of two firms affiliated with Bithumb called Inbiogen and Bucket Studio. It is believed that Kang played a significant part in the scheme to artificially inflate the share prices of Bithumb affiliate companies (Inbiogen and Bucket Studio) by issuing convertible bonds. The conditions under which Kang stole corporate money or manipulated stock prices were seized by the prosecutors, and in October of last year, the prosecutors seized and searched one after another of Bithumb&#8217;s affiliates such as Vident, Inbiogen, and Bucket Studio.</p>
<h2>Bithumb&#8217;s Growing Concerns</h2>
<p>With a stake worth 34.2% in Bithumb Holdings, Vidente is the single largest shareholder in the company. Inbiogen, on the other hand, holds the majority stake in Vident, while Bucket Studio appears to be the majority stake in Inbiogen. According to a prior report that was <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bithumb-exchange-faces-second-investigation-in-a-row/">published</a> on CoinGape, near the close of the year before, the body of the Vice President of Vidente was found outside the front yard of his home. The method of death was determined to be &#8220;suspected suicide&#8221; by the police after an investigation.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-136739" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/25193012/Screenshot-2023-01-25-192813.png" alt="" width="1595" height="562" /></p>
<p>Bithumb has also seen a significant drop in trading volume in recent months following the legal turmoil. Once, the second-largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> in South Korea, Bithumb has gradually been replaced by the likes of Coinone, Korbit, and Upbit. Recently, investigators also raised concerns about the irregularities found on taxes filed by Bithumb Korea, Bithumb Holdings, and its affiliates.</p>

On Monday, developers of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> said they have deployed the first mainnet shadow fork in preparation for the <a href="https://coingape.com/shanghai-upgrade-will-enable-stake-withdrawals-but-theres-a-catch/">Shanghai upgrade</a> in March.</p>
<h2>Here are the 7 Things to Know about Ethereum Shadow Fork</h2>
<p>1. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/vdWijden?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" rel="nofollow">Marius Van Der Wijden</a>, a software developer at the Ethereum Foundation, there were a few minor glitches on Geth clients — software used by nodes to operate the blockchain — but the team managed to resolve them and the shadow fork was applied successfully.</p>
<p>2. Ethereum shadow fork is a copy of the blockchain used to run tests before creating the public testnet. It will allow developers to test the waters before the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. The public testnet for Shanghai will go live in the coming days.</p>
<p>3. The Shanghai upgrade will be the first major update since Ethereum’s historic merge in September. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/">Ethereum merge</a> introduced the ability for users to deposit ETH with the network to become validators and help authenticate on-chain transactions.</p>
<p>4. There is some concern within the crypto industry that once the Shanghai upgrade goes live there will be increased sell pressure on the token from the sudden availability of 16 million unlocked Ether.</p>

<p>5. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/vitalik-buterin/">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Ethereum’s founder and current CEO, proposed the implementation of a feature he named “Stealth Addresses.” In an article, while highlighting the difficulty of ensuring privacy in the ecosystem, Buterin stated: “Fixing this state of affairs is a serious topic.”</p>
<p>6. Impact of Ethereum shadow fork: the argument against that is that 16 million Ether represents only 13.2% of the total circulating supply of the cryptocurrency. This upgrade will allow the around 16 million staked into the network to be unlocked, according to Etherscan.</p>
<p>7. Some Ethereum Devs Opposed the Rushed Upgrade: While most people are looking forward to the launch of Shanghai, a handful of Ethereum developers remain opposed to it. They believe that the unstaking of ETH is acceding to public demands and not so much about the long-term health of Ethereum.</p>
