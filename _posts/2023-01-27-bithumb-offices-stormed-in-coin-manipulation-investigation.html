Authorities noted that the operation was a &#8220;search and seizure&#8221; of transaction records tied to the token and had little to do with Bithumb itself. The crypto exchange is also being scrutinized for tax evasion and its Chairman Kang Jong-Hyun was accused of fraud in a separate case. Bithumb offices in South Korea were stormed on Thursday by local authorities investigating token [&#8230;]
