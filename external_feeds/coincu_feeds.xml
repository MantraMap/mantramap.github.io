<p>NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, have indeed made a significant impact on the digital assets space since their emergence. NFTs represent a unique form of digital ownership, allowing individuals to buy, sell, and trade one-of-a-kind digital assets using blockchain technology. Here are a few key ways in which NFTs have revolutionized the digital assets space:</p>



<ol>
<li>Unique Ownership: NFT provide a means to prove ownership and authenticity of digital assets. Unlike traditional digital files that can be easily copied or shared, NFTs are based on blockchain technology, which ensures a decentralized and tamper-proof record of ownership. This uniqueness has opened up new possibilities for artists, creators, and collectors.</li>



<li>Digital Art and Collectibles: NFT have gained significant attention in the world of digital art and collectibles. Artists can create and sell unique digital artworks, enabling them to monetize their creations directly without intermediaries. NFTs have also created new opportunities for collectors, who can now own and trade digital assets with provable scarcity and authenticity.</li>



<li>Tokenization of Real-World Assets: NFT have extended beyond the digital realm and are being used to tokenize real-world assets such as real estate, music rights, virtual real estate, and more. This allows for increased liquidity, fractional ownership, and easier transferability of traditionally illiquid assets.</li>



<li>Royalties and Secondary Market Sales: NFT provide a mechanism for artists and creators to earn ongoing royalties on their digital assets. Through smart contracts, creators can program their NFTs to receive a percentage of each subsequent sale, ensuring that they continue to benefit from the increasing value of their work in the secondary market.</li>



<li>Gaming and Virtual Worlds: NFT have found significant application in the gaming industry and virtual worlds. Players can own and trade in-game items, virtual land, and even characters, giving them true ownership and the ability to monetize their investments. NFTs enable interoperability between different games and platforms, allowing assets to be easily transferred and used in various virtual environments.</li>
</ol>



<p>While NFTs have brought about exciting possibilities, it&#8217;s important to note that the market is still evolving, and there are considerations regarding environmental impact, scalability, and market volatility that need to be addressed. Nonetheless, NFT have undeniably sparked a revolution in the digital assets space, providing new opportunities for creators, collectors, and investors alike.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Benefits of NFTs in the fashion industry</h2>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-1024x512.png" alt="NFTs in Fashion 3" class="wp-image-194624" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-1024x512.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-300x150.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-768x384.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-360x180.png 360w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-750x375.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3-1140x570.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NFTs-in-Fashion-3.png 1360w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="NFTs in Fashion: Unlocking the Future of Wearables 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>NFTs have the potential to bring several benefits to the fashion industry. Here are a few ways in which NFTs can make a positive impact:</p>



<ol>
<li>Authenticity and Counterfeit Prevention: NFTs can be used to verify the authenticity of fashion items. By tokenizing fashion products, brands can create a unique digital identifier for each item, ensuring that customers can easily determine if a product is genuine or counterfeit. This helps protect the brand&#8217;s reputation and provides consumers with greater confidence in their purchases.</li>



<li>Limited Editions and Exclusivity: Fashion brands can leverage NFTs to create limited editions or exclusive collections. By tokenizing these items, brands can offer a verifiable and scarce digital asset that represents ownership of a unique physical product. This concept of scarcity and exclusivity can increase the perceived value of the fashion items and attract collectors and fashion enthusiasts.</li>



<li>Traceability and Supply Chain Transparency: NFTs can be used to track and trace the entire lifecycle of a fashion item, from production to point of sale. By storing relevant information on the blockchain, such as materials used, manufacturing processes, and certifications, brands can provide transparency about the sustainability and ethical practices behind their products. This transparency can enhance trust and accountability within the fashion industry.</li>



<li>Ownership and Resale Opportunities: NFTs enable fashion items to be owned and traded digitally. This opens up new possibilities for consumers to buy, sell, or trade fashion items in the secondary market, much like collectibles or artwork. NFTs can be programmed with smart contracts that allow the original creators or brands to receive a percentage of each subsequent sale, providing ongoing royalties and incentives.</li>



<li>Brand Engagement and Fan Communities: NFTs can foster stronger connections between fashion brands and their customers. Brands can create interactive experiences, rewards, or perks exclusively for NFT holders. This can incentivize brand loyalty, foster a sense of community, and deepen customer engagement. NFTs can also enable brands to collaborate with artists, designers, or influencers, creating unique digital fashion experiences and collaborations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Fashion NFTs can be integrated into augmented reality (AR) settings in several ways, enhancing the digital fashion experience. Here are some examples:</p>



<ol>
<li>Virtual Try-On: AR technology can enable users to virtually try on fashion items represented by NFTs. By utilizing a smartphone or AR-enabled device, individuals can overlay digital representations of clothing, accessories, or even entire outfits onto their bodies in real-time. This allows users to visualize how the fashion items would look and fit on them before making a purchase.</li>



<li>Virtual Fashion Shows: Fashion brands can organize virtual fashion shows or presentations in AR environments. NFTs can be used to represent the showcased garments, allowing viewers to experience the designs in a dynamic and immersive way. Users can see the clothes in motion, interact with the virtual models, and explore different angles and details.</li>



<li>Digital Wardrobes: AR platforms or applications can integrate with users&#8217; digital wardrobes, which consist of their owned fashion NFTs. Users can create personalized avatars or digital representations of themselves and dress them in the virtual garments they own. This allows for self-expression and experimentation with fashion styles and trends without physical limitations.</li>



<li>Interactive Fashion Campaigns: Brands can launch interactive AR campaigns in which users engage with their fashion NFTs. For example, users might scan a specific NFT or QR code to unlock special AR content, such as behind-the-scenes footage, designer interviews, or additional digital fashion accessories that can be layered onto their AR environment.</li>



<li>Social Sharing and Community Building: AR can facilitate social interactions around fashion NFTs. Users can capture and share AR photos or videos of themselves wearing or interacting with virtual fashion items on social media platforms. This can spark conversations, inspire others, and foster a community of fashion enthusiasts who appreciate and engage with digital fashion experiences.</li>
</ol>

<p>NFTs-powered digital fashion has gained significant traction in the context of the metaverse, which refers to virtual worlds or immersive online environments. Here&#8217;s how NFTs are transforming digital fashion in the metaverse:</p>



<ol>
<li>Unique and Collectible Fashion: NFTs allow for the creation of unique and collectible digital fashion items. Designers and artists can create limited-edition virtual garments, accessories, and cosmetics that can be owned, traded, and displayed within the metaverse. These digital fashion items can be designed with intricate details, customization options, and rarity, making them highly sought after by collectors and fashion enthusiasts.</li>



<li>Avatar Customization: NFT-powered digital fashion enables users to personalize their avatars within the metaverse. Users can own and wear digital clothing and accessories represented by NFTs, allowing them to express their style and identity. Avatars can be dressed in a wide range of virtual fashion items, allowing for endless creativity and self-expression.</li>



<li>Virtual Fashion Marketplaces: NFT marketplaces within the metaverse serve as hubs for buying, selling, and trading digital fashion items. Users can browse through a diverse collection of NFT fashion assets, interact with 3D representations of the items, and complete transactions using cryptocurrency. These marketplaces create a dynamic ecosystem where designers, collectors, and users can engage with digital fashion.</li>



<li>Brand Collaborations and Digital Fashion Drops: Fashion brands can collaborate with metaverse platforms and NFT artists/designers to launch digital fashion drops. These limited-edition releases can include virtual versions of real-world fashion collections or exclusive digital creations. Such collaborations generate excitement, drive user engagement, and offer unique opportunities for brand exposure within the metaverse.</li>



<li>Virtual Fashion Shows and Events: NFT-powered digital fashion has expanded the possibilities for virtual fashion shows and events in the metaverse. Fashion brands can create immersive and interactive experiences, where avatars can attend and participate in virtual fashion shows, exhibitions, or runway presentations.

<li>Digital Fashion Ownership and Interoperability: NFTs ensure ownership and provenance of digital fashion items in the metaverse. Users can have a verified record of owning a particular virtual garment, which can be transferred across different metaverse platforms or even integrated into various virtual experiences or games. Interoperability allows users to leverage their fashion NFTs in multiple metaverse environments, enhancing their digital fashion presence.</li>
</ol>

<p>Phygital NFTs, a combination of physical and digital assets, have started to gain attention in the fashion industry. Here are some ways fashion companies are utilizing phygital NFTs:</p>



<ol>
<li>Limited Edition Collectibles: Fashion brands can create limited edition physical products, such as clothing items, sneakers, or accessories, and pair them with a corresponding digital NFT. The NFT serves as a certificate of authenticity and ownership, and it can unlock exclusive digital content, experiences, or benefits for the owner. This fusion of physical and digital assets enhances the collectibility and value of the fashion item.</li>



<li>Virtual Fashion Items: Fashion companies can design and release virtual fashion items as NFTs. These digital garments or accessories can be worn by avatars in virtual environments, virtual reality experiences, or metaverse platforms. Users can purchase and own these virtual fashion NFTs, allowing them to express their style and stand out in the digital realm.</li>



<li>Access to Events and Experiences: Phygital NFTs can grant access to exclusive fashion events, shows, or experiences. For example, a fashion brand might release NFT tickets to a runway show, granting holders the opportunity to attend the event physically while also receiving digital benefits, such as backstage footage, meet-and-greets, or virtual experiences tied to the show.</li>



<li>Enhanced Brand Engagement: Fashion companies can use phygital NFTs to deepen their connection with customers. By offering NFTs that blend physical and digital elements, brands can create interactive experiences or gamification opportunities. This can include scavenger hunts, augmented reality activations, or challenges where users can win physical products and exclusive digital rewards.</li>



<li>Gamified Fashion Experiences: Fashion brands can collaborate with gaming platforms or create their own gamified experiences using phygital NFTs. Users can engage in virtual fashion challenges, earn or purchase NFTs representing virtual fashion items, and use them within the game or metaverse environment. This allows for interactive brand integration, product placements, and increased brand exposure.</li>



<li>Royalties and Resale Opportunities: Phygital NFTs can be programmed with smart contracts that enable creators, designers, or brands to earn ongoing royalties from secondary sales. This means that even if a physical fashion item is resold, the brand or designer can receive a percentage of the transaction. This provides an incentive for collectors and investors, as well as a new revenue stream for fashion companies.</li>
</ol>



<p>Phygital NFTs offer fashion companies the opportunity to bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds, creating unique and engaging experiences for consumers. By leveraging the benefits of both realms, fashion brands can tap into new markets, enhance brand loyalty, and drive innovation in the industry.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">The future of NFTs in fashion</h2>



<p>The future of NFTs in fashion holds exciting possibilities and potential transformations for the industry. Here are some potential developments we may see:</p>



<ol>
<li>Customization and Personalization: NFTs can enable personalized fashion experiences, allowing consumers to customize and personalize their clothing, accessories, and virtual avatars. Users could have the ability to mix and match different NFT fashion items, create unique combinations, and tailor their digital wardrobe according to their preferences and style.</li>



<li>Virtual Fashion Marketplaces: As the metaverse and virtual worlds continue to evolve, we may see the emergence of dedicated virtual fashion marketplaces. These platforms would enable users to buy, sell, and trade NFT fashion items within immersive and interactive virtual environments. Users can explore a wide range of virtual fashion options, interact with digital representations, and engage in social interactions centered around fashion.</li>



<li>Blockchain-Based Supply Chains: NFTs can enhance transparency and traceability within fashion supply chains. Blockchain technology can be leveraged to create immutable records of every step in the supply chain, from sourcing materials to production and distribution. NFTs could be used to verify authenticity, ethical sourcing, sustainability practices, and fair labor conditions, providing consumers with greater confidence and trust in the fashion industry.</li>



<li>Digital Fashion Collaborations: Fashion brands and designers may collaborate with digital artists, virtual influencers, and gaming studios to create unique and exclusive NFT fashion collections. These collaborations could result in innovative and boundary-pushing designs that exist purely in the digital realm. These digital fashion collaborations would blend art, technology, and fashion, catering to a growing audience interested in virtual experiences.</li>



<li>Virtual Fashion Shows and Runways: NFTs could transform the way fashion shows and runways are presented. Virtual fashion shows could become immersive experiences within the metaverse, allowing attendees to witness the latest designs in real-time and interact with the digital fashion items. NFTs can serve as digital invitations, granting access to virtual events, and offering exclusive content and perks to attendees.</li>



<li>Integration of AI and AR: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and augmented reality (AR) technologies with NFTs can create hyper-realistic and interactive digital fashion experiences. AI algorithms could analyze users&#8217; preferences and create personalized recommendations for NFT fashion items. AR technology could enable users to try on virtual fashion items in real-time, enhancing the online shopping experience and bridging the gap between physical and digital fashion.</li>
</ol>

<p>The defendants <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67355465/kim-v-jump-trading-llc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in the most recent petition, filed on June 9, that the decision to bring the complaint in Illinois was an &#8220;effort at forum shopping,&#8221; since the plaintiff, Taewoo Kim, is a New Jersey resident represented by legal firms from New York and California. The practice of picking courts or jurisdictions that allegedly have the most favorable rules or regulations that support the plaintiff&#8217;s case is referred to as forum shopping.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“There is no legally compelling connection to Illinois, and nearly all of the relevant witnesses and documents either are located outside Illinois or are just as easily accessed elsewhere,” according to the court filing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187221-jump-trading-price-manipulation-terrausd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complaint</a>, Jump Trading and its CEO, Kanav Kariya, were engaged in a price manipulation scam involving the famed TerraUSD stablecoin, which resulted in a $1.3 billion windfall for the business.</p>



<p>Jump Trading was an early partner and key financial supporter of Terraform Laboratories, according to the complaint. Jump engaged in various agreements with Terraform and its affiliates between November 2019 and September 2020 to borrow tens of millions of LUNA tokens from Terra and offer market-making services for transactions in LUNA, UST, and aUST.</p>

<p>Moreover, the business and Kariya were charged with breaking Commodities Exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission laws, as well as common law unjust enrichment.</p>



<p>Taewoo Kim filed it on May 9, both personally and on behalf of those affected by the Terra/Luna ecological collapse. Selendy Gay and Robbins Geller Rudman &amp; Dowd LLP represent Kim.</p>



<p>The defendants also said that the plaintiffs have a concurrent and related complaint in California that has been pending for over a year and that both matters should be combined or coordinated.</p>

<p>Do Kwon, the project&#8217;s originator, was detained in March in Montenegro for allegedly using fraudulent travel papers.</p>



<p>Kwon is believed to be serving home bail in Montenegro after a Montenegrin court accepted his bail petition on June 5. Both Kwon and Terraform Labs&#8217; chief financial officer, Han Chang-Joon, are legally obligated to live in Montenegro at Chang-legal Joon&#8217;s abode until an extradition decision is reached. Kwon may face jail time in both the United States and South Korea.</p>

<p>NFT royalties refer to the contractual terms that entitle the original creator or rights holder of a non-fungible token (NFT) to receive a percentage of the subsequent sales or transfers of that NFT. When an NFT is sold or resold on a marketplace, the royalties clause ensures that a portion of the proceeds goes back to the original creator or rights holder, providing them ongoing financial benefits from the secondary market transactions.</p>



<p>Royalties are typically specified as a percentage of the sale price, often ranging from 5% to 20% or more, although the specific percentage can vary depending on the agreement between the creator and the platform hosting the NFT marketplace. The royalties can be set at a fixed rate or can be tiered, meaning the percentage may change based on the number of times the NFT has been resold.</p>



<p>NFT royalties are facilitated by blockchain technology, which allows for transparent and automated tracking of ownership and transactions. Smart contracts, often deployed on blockchain platforms like Ethereum, automatically enforce the payment of royalties upon each subsequent sale or transfer of the NFT. This feature provides creators with a potential ongoing revenue stream as their NFTs gain popularity and increase in value on the secondary market.</p>

<p>NFT royalties address a key concern for artists and creators in the digital age by providing them ongoing financial benefits and recognition for their work, even after the initial sale. Here are some reasons why NFT royalties are needed:</p>



<ol>
<li>Fair Compensation: Royalties ensure that creators receive a portion of the subsequent sales or transfers of their NFTs, allowing them to benefit financially as the value of their work increases over time. This provides a more equitable and sustainable revenue model compared to traditional art sales where artists may not benefit from the appreciation of their work in the secondary market.</li>



<li>Artist Support: NFT royalties can provide artists with a consistent revenue stream, supporting their ongoing creative endeavors. It allows them to earn income from the success of their NFTs beyond the initial sale, which can be particularly valuable for emerging artists or those in fields like digital art, where monetization can be challenging.</li>



<li>Incentivizing Creation: Royalties can serve as an incentive for artists and creators to embrace the NFT space and invest their time and effort in producing unique and high-quality digital content. By providing ongoing financial rewards, NFT royalties encourage artists to continue creating and contributing to the NFT ecosystem.</li>



<li>Ownership Recognition: NFT royalties also help maintain the connection between the creator and their work. As an NFT changes hands on the secondary market, the creator continues to receive recognition and compensation for their original creation. This recognition can be significant in fostering a sense of ownership and appreciation for artists, especially in a digital landscape where copies and reproductions can be easily created.</li>



<li>Transparent and Automated Payments: Blockchain technology enables the automatic execution and transparency of royalty payments through smart contracts. This removes the need for intermediaries and ensures that royalties are accurately and promptly distributed to the creators without relying on manual processes or potential disputes.</li>
</ol>



<p>NFT royalties offer a means to address the challenges faced by artists in the digital space, providing them with ongoing financial support, recognition, and an incentive to create and contribute to the expanding NFT ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How do marketplaces contribute to NFT royalties?</h2>

<p>NFT marketplaces play a crucial role in facilitating and enforcing NFT royalties. Here&#8217;s how they contribute to the royalty process:</p>



<ol>
<li>Royalty Structure: NFT marketplaces provide a framework for creators to define the royalty structure for their NFTs. Creators can specify the percentage of royalties they will receive from subsequent sales or transfers of their NFTs. This information is typically embedded in the NFT metadata or stored in the smart contract associated with the NFT.</li>



<li>Smart Contract Implementation: NFT marketplaces utilize smart contracts, typically deployed on a blockchain platform like Ethereum, to automate and enforce the payment of royalties. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement written into code. They automatically trigger royalty payments whenever an NFT is resold or transferred, ensuring that the specified percentage of the sale price goes to the original creator or rights holder.</li>



<li>Royalty Collection: When an NFT is sold or transferred on a marketplace, the platform automatically calculates and deducts the royalties from the transaction. The platform holds the royalties in escrow and distributes them to the creator&#8217;s designated wallet address. This process is transparent and eliminates the need for manual tracking and payment of royalties.</li>



<li>Marketplace Fees: NFT marketplaces may charge a fee or commission on each sale or transfer, which can include a portion of the royalties collected. The marketplace fees are typically separate from the royalties and cover the costs of hosting, promoting, and maintaining the platform. It&#8217;s important for creators to review the marketplace&#8217;s fee structure and understand how it impacts their overall earnings from NFT sales.</li>



<li>Secondary Market Tracking: NFT marketplaces often provide tools and features that track the secondary market transactions of an NFT. This allows creators to monitor the sales and resales of their NFTs, ensuring that they receive the appropriate royalties from each subsequent transaction. These tracking mechanisms contribute to the transparency and accountability of the royalty system.</li>
</ol>



<p>By incorporating royalty mechanisms into their platforms and leveraging blockchain technology, NFT marketplaces streamline the process of collecting and distributing royalties, providing a seamless experience for creators and ensuring that they receive their deserved share of subsequent NFT transactions.</p>

<p>Emerging NFT marketplaces have played a transformative role in the NFT space in several ways:</p>



<ol>
<li>Increased Accessibility: Emerging NFT marketplaces have expanded the accessibility of NFTs to a broader audience. They have introduced user-friendly interfaces, simplified onboarding processes, and reduced transaction costs, making it easier for artists, collectors, and enthusiasts to participate in the NFT ecosystem. These marketplaces have opened up new avenues for artists to showcase their work and reach a global audience.</li>



<li>Diverse Content Offerings: Emerging NFT marketplaces have brought a wide range of content categories beyond digital art, including music, videos, virtual real estate, virtual goods, and more. This diversification has attracted creators from various domains, providing opportunities for artists, musicians, gamers, and other content creators to tokenize and monetize their unique creations.</li>



<li>Secondary Market Development: NFT marketplaces have fostered the growth of secondary markets for NFTs. They provide platforms for buying, selling, and trading NFTs, creating liquidity and enabling collectors to participate in the resale market. The secondary market allows for increased exposure and potential value appreciation for NFTs, benefitting both creators and collectors.</li>



<li>Innovation in Royalty Structures: Emerging NFT marketplaces have introduced innovative royalty structures, enhancing the earning potential for creators. They have implemented flexible royalty mechanisms, such as tiered royalties, where creators receive higher percentages as their NFTs are resold multiple times. These new approaches incentivize artists and creators to engage with the NFT space and contribute more to its growth.</li>



<li>Curation and Discovery: NFT marketplaces have invested in curation and discovery mechanisms to help users navigate the vast array of available NFTs. They employ features like trending lists, recommended collections, and verified artist profiles, enabling users to discover and engage with high-quality and reputable NFTs. These curation efforts assist artists in gaining visibility and collectors in finding desirable NFTs.</li>



<li>Community Engagement: Emerging NFT marketplaces have focused on building vibrant and engaged communities around their platforms. They facilitate interactions between creators and collectors through social features, chat forums, and events, fostering a sense of belonging and collaboration within the NFT ecosystem. These communities provide valuable support networks for artists and contribute to the overall growth and adoption of NFTs.</li>
</ol>



<p>Emerging NFT marketplaces have democratized access to NFTs, diversified content offerings, facilitated secondary markets, introduced innovative royalty structures, enhanced curation and discovery mechanisms, and fostered vibrant communities. These transformative contributions have accelerated the adoption and evolution of NFTs as a significant digital asset class.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What does the future hold for NFT royalties?</h2>



<p>The future of NFT royalties is likely to see further evolution and refinement as the NFT ecosystem continues to develop. Here are some potential trends and possibilities for the future of NFT royalties:</p>



<ol>
<li>Standardization and Interoperability: As the NFT space matures, there may be efforts to establish industry standards for royalty structures and contracts. This standardization could enable greater interoperability between different NFT platforms and marketplaces, making it easier for creators to enforce royalties across various platforms and for collectors to trade NFTs without concerns about inconsistent royalty implementations.</li>



<li>Customizable Royalty Structures: NFT marketplaces might offer more flexibility for creators to customize their royalty structures. This could include options to set different royalty rates based on factors like time, number of resales, or specific conditions defined by the creator. Customizable royalty structures could provide greater control and alignment with individual creator preferences.</li>



<li>Dynamic Royalty Adjustments: Smart contracts could be enhanced to enable dynamic royalty adjustments based on market conditions or specified triggers. For example, royalty rates could automatically increase if an NFT achieves certain milestones, such as reaching a specific sale price or gaining significant attention. This would allow creators to participate in the increasing value of their NFTs.</li>



<li>Decentralized Royalties: With the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology, we might see the emergence of decentralized royalty protocols. These protocols could remove the reliance on centralized marketplaces and intermediaries, allowing for direct peer-to-peer royalty distributions based on predetermined rules and smart contracts.</li>



<li>Enhanced Royalty Tracking and Analytics: NFT marketplaces may improve the tracking and analytics features related to royalties. This could include more comprehensive reporting on royalty earnings, transaction history, and insights into the performance of an artist&#8217;s NFTs in the secondary market. Enhanced tracking and analytics would empower creators to make informed decisions and better understand the impact of their work in the NFT ecosystem.</li>



<li>Legal and Regulatory Considerations: As NFTs gain more mainstream adoption, there may be increased scrutiny and regulatory focus on royalties and their implications. Legal frameworks and industry standards could emerge to ensure transparency, fairness, and compliance in royalty structures and payments.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>NFT royalties have become a significant aspect of the non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem, providing creators with ongoing financial benefits and recognition for their work. These royalties ensure that artists receive a percentage of subsequent sales or transfers of their NFTs, allowing them to benefit from the increased value and popularity of their creations in the secondary market.</p>



<p>NFT royalties address the need for fair compensation, artist support, incentivizing creation, ownership recognition, and transparent and automated payments. They have transformed the NFT space by providing creators with a sustainable revenue model, expanding accessibility to a broader audience, diversifying content offerings, fostering secondary markets, and enhancing curation and discovery mechanisms.</p>



<p>The future of NFT royalties may witness standardization efforts, customizable structures, dynamic adjustments, decentralized protocols, improved tracking and analytics, and legal and regulatory considerations. These developments will shape the evolution of NFT royalties and contribute to the overall growth and maturation of the NFT ecosystem.</p>



<p>As the NFT space continues to evolve, it is essential for creators, platforms, collectors, and industry stakeholders to collaborate, innovate, and establish best practices that ensure the continued success and sustainability of NFT royalties.</p>

<li><em>North Korean hackers launder $35M stolen from Atomic Wallet through Russian crypto exchange Garantex and obfuscate the funds through Sinbad.io mixer; OFAC-sanctioned Garantex complicit in illicit transactions.</em></li>

<p>This is not the end of the story. In fact, Elliptic said that there had been a significant and successful cross-community effort between Elliptic and many exchange partners to freeze the stolen crypto. However, Lazarus has now found new ways to trade their assets for Bitcoin. This means that the funds are still at large and there is a risk of them being used for further illegal activities.</p>



<p>The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Garantex and the Russian Hydra dark web marketplace in April 2022. This was a significant move in the fight against money laundering and illegal cryptocurrency activities. Garantex was founded in late 2019 and originally registered in Estonia before moving the majority of its operations to Moscow, the Treasury Department noted at the time.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>In addition, the Treasury Department reported that &#8220;analysis of known Garantex transactions shows that over $100 million in transactions are associated with illicit actors and darknet markets.&#8221; This highlights the extent of the problem and the need for more stringent measures.</p>

<p>The Treasury Department also sanctioned <a href="http://blender.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blender.io</a> (the former iteration of <a href="http://sinbad.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinbad.io</a>) in May 2022, warning that the service was being used by North Korea to &#8220;support its malicious cyber activities and money-laundering of stolen virtual currency.&#8221; This further highlights the importance of cracking down on these services and those who use them.</p>



<p>On June 3, a number of Atomic Wallet user accounts were compromised, resulting in losses of up to $35 million in digital assets. Five days later, Atomic stated that it had engaged blockchain security and analyst company Chainalysis as the leading incident investigator. This is a positive step towards greater security and accountability in the crypto industry.</p>

<p>The &#8216;Fear &amp; Greed Index&#8217; created by <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alternative</a>, a virtual asset data supplier, was shown to be angry. To alternate statistics, the Fear-Greed Sentiment Index, which had 47 points on June 12, suggestive according to neutral, had 45 points on June 13, showing crypto market fear. The Fear &amp; Greed Index indicates that the market sentiment is closer to extreme fear as it approaches 0, and as it approaches 100, it means too greedy.</p>



<p>This is close to the 44 points stated when the SEC launched a series of cases against Binance and Coinbase on June 5 and 6.</p>

<p>The commission also accused <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194567-binance-responds-strongly-to-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, of misrepresenting trading volumes, diverting user cash, and deceiving customers about its controls in the lawsuit against Binance.</p>



<p>Since <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194533-the-sec-receives-no-positive-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SEC </a>believes that most cryptocurrencies should be classified as securities, most crypto firms and trading should be subject to its oversight and must adhere to regulatory frameworks that are presently in place for traditional securities.</p>

<p>The crypto market took notice. According to CoinMarketCap, four of the top ten most valued cryptocurrencies lost at least 20% of their value last week due to SEC cases.</p>



<p>The market&#8217;s worry was also reflected in the market price. According to the industry, the overall coin market capitalization dropped by $44.8 billion on June 10 alone. Among them, the market value of cryptocurrencies outside Bitcoin, such as Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL), declined by $35.3 billion, accounting for more than 80% of the entire market cap loss.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Korean digital asset management platform Haru Invest is suspected of shutting down its offices after suspending deposits and withdrawals.</em></li>



<li><em>According to information from the building staff, they have closed the office and left.</em></li>



<li><em>This morning, Haru announced that the platform is experiencing issues with its service partners and is under investigation. Looks like it was hacked</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a source from <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=2959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Asset</a>, the digital asset management platform Haru Invest Korea (referred to as Haru Invest) has officially closed its office after issuing a notice to suspend deposits and withdrawals.</strong></h5>

<p>On June 13, I visited the building where Haru Invest and its parent company Block Crafters moved in and inspected it. It appears they have closed the office and left. Block Crafters is located on the 17th floor of Daeryung Gangnam Tower in Yeoksam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul, and Haru Invest is on the 18th floor.</p>



<p>A cleaning worker in charge of the 17th and 18th floors said: &#8220;This morning, Block Crafters people returned the company keys and hurriedly left.&#8221;</p>



<p>This person also explained, &#8220;Until this morning, the company has not stopped working and is operating normally.&#8221;</p>



<p>Haru Invest has also deleted announcements and blogs such as Medium, LinkedIn, and Instagram, and the Twitter account has not been canceled. Additionally, Haru Invest co-founder and former CTO (jooddang.eth) tweeted that the closing of Haru Invest&#8217;s social media accounts may have been done in some internal situation.</p>

<p>It was recently shared that Haru is currently running a reset protocol and not rugpull. Their marketing team member was hacked, and Haru&#8217;s social media channels were down, but their Twitter is now back up.</p>

<p>Earlier today, the platform announced in an announcement that the platform is experiencing issues with its service partners. It is continuing to investigate the matter and look for contingency plans to remedy the situation. From 8:40 on June 13, all deposit and withdrawal requests will be paused until further notice to protect users&#8217; escrow assets.</p>

<p>The case is still evolving, and Haru Invest has yet to issue any statement regarding the hack.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>In response to the SEC complaint, Binance filed multiple motions in the US District Court for the District of Columbia.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC filed 13 accusations against Binance, Binance.US, and CZ last week, alleging he violated US securities laws.</em></li>



<li><em>According to Binance&#8217;s attorneys, the company has been in contact with the SEC since 2021.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Monday, <strong>Binance</strong> filed multiple papers in the US District Court for the District of Columbia in response to the action launched by the US Securities and Exchange Commission against the biggest cryptocurrency exchange by volume.</strong></h5>

<p>The SEC said in the exchange&#8217;s complaint last week that the giant exchange Binance, its CEO Changpeng &#8216;CZ&#8217; Zhao, and Binance.US violated securities laws and enriched themselves by billions of dollars while putting investors&#8217; funds in danger. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194533-the-sec-receives-no-positive-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The SEC</a> further claims that Zhao and his company participated in a &#8220;web of deception&#8221; that included conflicts of interest, failure to disclose, and intentional evasion of the law.</p>



<p>Daniel W. Nelson, the legal representative of Binance, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060/gov.uscourts.dcd.256060.43.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in a submission co-signed by various attorneys of the exchange:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The SEC’s request for a temporary restraining order should be denied for several reasons, but the most important is this: there is no risk to BAM’s customer assets. Indeed, there is no ‘emergency’ here at all, other than the one manufactured by the SEC for its own purposes, when the alleged securities law violations, according to the SEC, have been going on publicly and openly for years.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Binance&#8217;s attorneys questioned the timing of the SEC&#8217;s accusations, which coincided with a lawsuit against Coinbase, the biggest cryptocurrency in the United States, in more than 20 motions and declarations filed with the court.</p>



<p>According to the company&#8217;s legal team, the SEC ignored a basic security concern: whether this conduct was lawfully allowed by the commission since Chairman <a href="https://news.coincu.com/194473-house-republicans-to-fire-sec-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler </a>had personal meetings with Zhao and the exchange throughout the period in question.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s lawyers&#8217; state in the filings that the company has been in contact with the SEC since 2021. Even still, it wasn&#8217;t until February 2023 that they discovered they were probable targets of an inquiry into the Binance.US exchange.</p>

<p>On June 5 and 6, the SEC launched substantial litigation against Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest digital currency exchange, and Coinbase, the largest US-based exchange. While Gary Gensler has not been hesitant to issue enforcement actions against crypto companies, particularly following the collapse of FTX, these suits represent a significant new step in the SEC&#8217;s battle against crypto as well as its continued abdication of regulatory responsibility over the crypto landscape.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As alleged, Zhao and Binance misled investors about their risk controls and corrupted trading volumes while actively concealing who was operating the platform, the manipulative trading of its affiliated market maker, and even where and with whom investor funds and crypto assets were custodied. They attempted to evade U.S. securities laws by announcing sham controls that they disregarded behind the scenes so that they could keep high-value U.S. customers on their platforms. The public should beware of investing any of their hard-earned assets with or on these unlawful platforms,” Gensler said in a statement.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler confirmed to institutional investors in 2018 that BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are not securities.</em></li>



<li><em>The comments come at a time when the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market and more than two years before Gensler was appointed SEC chair.</em></li>



<li><em>Cryptocurrency lawyers said that this statement by Gary Gensler was only at the time, so it did not affect the current legal actions of the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Forbes, a new video shows <a href="https://news.coincu.com/193985-sec-satoshi-nakamoto-to-court-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gary Gensler</a>, Chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), telling institutional investors in 2018 that BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH are not  securities and 75% of the overall crypto market at the time was outside that legal category.</strong></h5>

<p>The comments come at a time when the cryptocurrency is in the midst of a bull market and more than two years before Gensler was appointed SEC chair. The video, from a crypto-themed institutional investor event hosted by Bloomberg and Fidelity in 2018, shows Gensler expressing a view that seems to contradict his recent statements that he currently believes that Bitcoin All cryptocurrencies other than cryptocurrencies are securities.</p>



<p>The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment about any potential conflicts between Gensler&#8217;s 2018 comments and the agency&#8217;s current legal position.</p>



<p>Prior to that, other videos from Gensler&#8217;s time at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) also appeared, showing him saying that Ethereum is not a security. The video is arguably more important as it shows the current SEC chairman providing guidance to hedge funds and other investors on the regulatory state of the crypto market.</p>



<p>The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any potential conflicts between Gensler&#8217;s 2018 comments and the agency&#8217;s current legal position.</p>

<p>However, these comments may anger the crypto industry and many crypto owners, who argue that Gensler did not provide guidance on the legality of specific tokens before embarked on what many describe as a &#8220;strategy of law enforcement.&#8221;</p>



<p>This could be a sensitive time for the SEC chairman as he is under fire from crypto fans due to strong legal actions against the two largest service providers in the market. are Binance and Coinbase. In addition, a pair of Republicans in the House of Representatives presented legislation to<a href="https://news.coincu.com/194473-house-republicans-to-fire-sec-chair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remove</a> the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Republicans object to Gensler’s &#8220;long series of abuses that have been permitted under the current SEC structure.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC has put forward a proposal to modify the definition of exchanges, which would encompass platforms trading in both crypto asset securities and certain DeFi platforms. </em></li>



<li><em>In April, the SEC declared its intention to reopen the exchange&#8217;s definition comment period, following its decision to broaden the scope to include crypto and DeFi.</em></li>



<li><em>The agency has not received any favorable comments during the comment period. </em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC polled on an offer to make bigger the definition of an alternate to DeFi companies in April however has now no longer obtained a positive reaction. The remark duration will quit on June 13.</strong></h5>

<p>The SEC first proposed an accelerated definition of what qualifies as an alternate again in January 2022. It claimed at the time that this changed into decorating transparency and oversight over Alternative Trading Systems (ATS). The SEC described ATS as entities that exchange Treasuries and different authorities&#8217; securities below the regulatory umbrella.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The reopening release reiterated the applicability of existing rules to platforms that trade crypto asset securities, including so-called ‘DeFi’ systems, and provides supplemental information and economic analysis for systems that would be included in the new, proposed exchange definition,” the SEC <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-77" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> in a press launch.</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The upshot of this technological reality is that holding DeFi protocols to the requirements of the regulatory regimes governing national securities exchanges and ATSs would result in their de facto expatriation from the United States.

<p>DEF said that the SEC’s thought fails to perceive opportunity regulatory techniques and does now no longer provide a complete, cogent, or defensible qualitative or quantitative cost-advantage evaluation. The agency has now no longer accurately considered DeFi’s function within the broader crypto marketplace.</p>



<p>On behalf of the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain, Tavonia Evans stated that not all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) involve the trading of cryptocurrencies for fiat currencies. Some DEXs primarily focus on the trading of cryptocurrencies, which may include stablecoins. However, the proposed rule lacks clear guidelines on how it would apply to DEXs that do not facilitate crypto-to-fiat transactions. Therefore, she urged the SEC to provide explicit guidance on this issue to ensure that such DEXs can operate within the regulatory framework.</p>

<p>Paradigm also <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_f997b07bbb6d43b8a3b6c0626f57cdf3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized</a> the SEC&#8217;s proposal, arguing that the Commission would be presenting a &#8220;Hobson&#8217;s choice&#8221; similar to what it did with Coinbase if it proceeds to regulate DEXs. Additionally, Paradigm deemed the SEC&#8217;s approach to the proposal as &#8220;haphazard.&#8221;</p>



<p>The SEC representatives have contended that the suggested explanation would encompass multiple cryptocurrency enterprises.</p>



<p>SEC chair Gary Gensler stated that several digital currency trading platforms are already considered to be exchanges based on the current definition and must adhere to the regulations governing securities. It is essential that individuals investing in the digital currency market are afforded the same established protections offered by securities laws in other markets, according to him.</p>

<p>Polygon Labs has recently announced its vision to build the Value Layer of the internet through the proposed set of upgrades, Polygon 2.0. With the aim to democratize access to the global economy, Polygon 2.0 will enable decentralized finance, digital ownership, and new mechanisms for coordination. The upgrades are set to reimagine almost every aspect of Polygon, ranging from protocol architecture to tokenomics to governance.</p>

<p>The Polygon team plans to detail each component of Polygon 2.0 over the coming weeks through a series of informative blog posts, community meets, and AMAs with the founders and engineers. Polygon 2.0 will become the Value Layer of the internet, offering unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through ZK technology. The network will consist of ZK-powered L2 chains unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol, making the entire network feel like using a single chain. Furthermore, cross-chain interactions can happen safely and instantly without additional security or trust assumptions.</p>



<p>Polygon 2.0 aims to expand Ethereum to become what it was always intended to be, a Value Layer that looks and acts like the rest of the internet. This will be achieved by supporting a practically unlimited number of chains while maintaining unified liquidity. Individual blockchains are not infinitely scalable, and adding capacity by creating new chains fragments liquidity and reduces security and capital efficiency.</p>

<p>The team at Polygon Labs plans to delve into topics like the future of the Polygon PoS chain, the utility and evolution of the Polygon token, and the transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury over the coming weeks. This will provide the Polygon community with a clear roadmap for how Polygon will become the Value Layer of the internet.</p>
