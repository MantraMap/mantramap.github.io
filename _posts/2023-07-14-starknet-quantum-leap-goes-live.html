<p>The transactions per second on the Etheruem blockchain will receive a significant boost now that Starknet&rsquo;s Quantum Leap upgrade has been deployed on the Ethereum mainnet.&nbsp;</p>
Ethereum TPS To Scale Up&nbsp;
<p>In a groundbreaking development for the Ethereum blockchain, the scaling barrier has been shattered, according to an announcement by Uri Kolodny, co-founder and CEO of StarkWare. Kolodny expressed his excitement, stating that the implementation of the new upgrade has finally made high transactions per second (TPS) a reality on the Ethereum mainnet.</p>
<p>Starknet, which is a Layer-2 blockchain or &ldquo;rollup&rdquo; to the Ethereum blockchain, was created by the Starkware team to allow Ethereum to scale securely. Originally aiming for a potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, the StarkWare team was pleasantly surprised by the results of the stress test.&nbsp;</p>
Quantum Leap Exceeds Expectations
<p>Kolodny revealed that they had expected a few dozen TPS at this early stage, but the actual figure far surpassed their expectations, reaching a consistent 37 TPS. Moreover, during peak moments, the transfer transactions per second approached the impressive figure of 100.</p>
<p>Kolodny said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We said this upgrade would deliver potential TPS of hundreds within Q3, and only hoped from the stress test to check we&rsquo;re on target. A few dozen TPS at this early point would have left us excited &ndash; but we got more than we bargained for.&rdquo;</p>

Last Week&rsquo;s Testnet Run Big Success
<p>The team had previously deployed the Quantum Leap on the Goerli testnet on July 5, followed by a community vote in which 97.91% of voters agreed to push forward to the mainnet as it demonstrated speeds higher than the team&rsquo;s expectations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anticipating a "time to inclusion" of approximately 15 seconds, the team was amazed to discover that the vast majority of transactions were confirmed in under 10 seconds. This achievement meant that decentralized applications (dApps) could validate on-chain transactions within seconds, significantly enhancing the speed and efficiency of the Ethereum network.</p>
Short-Term And Long-Term Benefits
<p>Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder and president of StarkWare, described the impact of this breakthrough as granting the community a "supercharged power tool." This newfound capability empowers developers to create projects that were previously unattainable, opening doors to innovative and transformative applications.</p>
<p>He also highlighted the more immediate and long-term benefits of this achievement, stating that in the short term, DeFi will benefit from increased speed and smoother user experiences. On-chain gaming will become more seamless, enhancing the overall gameplay and user engagement. Looking ahead, the long-term effects of this development are expected to reshape how we interact with technology and each other, giving rise to new and creative projects.</p>
<p>The achievement of smashing the scaling ceiling represents a significant milestone for the Ethereum blockchain, signaling its readiness to handle increased transaction volumes and support a wide range of decentralized applications. As the network evolves, the potential for further innovation and growth becomes even more promising.</p>
