<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) orbited the 29000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair traded as high as the 30050.66 level, representing a test of a downside price objective associated with selling pressure that intensified around the 30463.84 area.&nbsp; Major selling pressure quickly knocked BTC/USD lower to the 27230.77 area, a test of a recent relative low from earlier in the month, before a recovery took place to back above the 29000 figure.&nbsp; Stops were elected above the 27929.17, 28525.56, 29007.57, and 29489.58 areas during the recent surge higher, retracement levels associated with the recent depreciating range from 31050 to 26965.14.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also elected above the 28036.96 and 29370.70 areas during the appreciation, upside price objectives associated with recent buying pressure around the 27194.51 and 28161.74 areas.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Filecoin's (FIL) price has been adversely impacted by the bearish market, falling below the $6 threshold, as bears have the upper hand. Moreover, the struggle of Bitcoin to maintain its value above $30,000 has also affected other coins, preventing them from climbing their nearest resistance levels.</p>
<p class="s7">As Filecoin (FIL) struggles in the market, investors have turned their attention to other promising projects, one of which is Sparklo (SPRK). Analysts have predicted that Sparklo's (SPRK) value has the potential to skyrocket by 40x due to precious metals' overall appeal to investors</p>
<p class="s9">Filecoin (FIL) Witnesses Sharp Sell-Off</p>
<p class="s7">Filecoin (FIL) is currently experiencing consolidation on the daily chart, with a slight decrease of 1.2%. However, over the past week, the coin has seen a significant depreciation of almost 17%. </p>
<p class="s7">The technical analysis suggests a bearish trend with reduced accumulation and demand. If the sellers continue to drive the price down, it will add more pressure to the bearish market.</p>
<p class="s7">For Filecoin (FIL) to exceed the $5.50 price, more buyers need to enter the market in upcoming trading sessions. A decline in market capitalization indicates mounting selling pressure, emphasizing the significance of the overall market strength of Filecoin (FIL). </p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Filecoin (FIL) trades at $5.20, with resistance at $5.60, and a successful surpassing of this level could propel it towards $6 and possibly even $6.30.</p>
<p class="s7">If Filecoin (FIL) fails to trade at its current level, it will establish local support at $4.90. However, if the price falls below this mark, it will intensify the bears, driving the coin down to $3.80. Moreover, in the previous session, the amount of Filecoin (FIL) traded indicated a drop in demand, reflecting a bearish sentiment in the market.</p>
<p class="s10">Sparklo (SPRK) Unveils Fractionalized NFT Investments InPrecious Metals</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Filecoin's (FIL) price has been adversely impacted by the bearish market, falling below the $6 threshold, as bears have the upper hand. Moreover, the struggle of Bitcoin to maintain its value above $30,000 has also affected other coins, preventing them from climbing their nearest resistance levels.</p>
<p class="s7">As Filecoin (FIL) struggles in the market, investors have turned their attention to other promising projects, one of which is Sparklo (SPRK). Analysts have predicted that Sparklo's (SPRK) value has the potential to skyrocket by 40x due to precious metals' overall appeal to investors</p>
<p class="s9">Filecoin (FIL) Witnesses Sharp Sell-Off</p>
<p class="s7">Filecoin (FIL) is currently experiencing consolidation on the daily chart, with a slight decrease of 1.2%. However, over the past week, the coin has seen a significant depreciation of almost 17%. </p>
<p class="s7">The technical analysis suggests a bearish trend with reduced accumulation and demand. If the sellers continue to drive the price down, it will add more pressure to the bearish market.</p>
<p class="s7">For Filecoin (FIL) to exceed the $5.50 price, more buyers need to enter the market in upcoming trading sessions. A decline in market capitalization indicates mounting selling pressure, emphasizing the significance of the overall market strength of Filecoin (FIL). </p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Filecoin (FIL) trades at $5.20, with resistance at $5.60, and a successful surpassing of this level could propel it towards $6 and possibly even $6.30.</p>
<p class="s7">If Filecoin (FIL) fails to trade at its current level, it will establish local support at $4.90. However, if the price falls below this mark, it will intensify the bears, driving the coin down to $3.80. Moreover, in the previous session, the amount of Filecoin (FIL) traded indicated a drop in demand, reflecting a bearish sentiment in the market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">After a stellar start to the year, Ethereum (ETH), the leading altcoin and second-largest cryptocurrency began showing strong bearish signals. This has made traders and investors to look elsewhere for promising investment opportunities. </p>
<p class="s7">There is no shortage of investment opportunities in the crypto industry, but one cryptocurrency that has caught their attention is Sparklo (SPRK), a token which presents a chance for people to invest in gold. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s9">Ethereum (ETH) Displays Bearish Signals </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) started the year with a significant bullish presence, as the crypto market entered a new bull cycle. Ethereum sparked calls for the start of an altseason as it outperformed Bitcoin (BTC) in the aftermath of the Shapella launch. However, the calls were short-lived as regulatory pressure and debate on ETH&rsquo;s status caused the bears to take hold of the market. </p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) tried to recover from the $1,820 area but struggled to surpass the $1,850 resistance, just like Bitcoin (BTC). It reached $1,889 before falling again, breaking below $1,820 and forming a new weekly low around $1,807. Currently, Ethereum (ETH) is consolidating losses below $1,900 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</p>
<p class="s7">On the ETH/USD hourly chart, a significant bearish trend line is forming with resistance around $1,845. Immediate resistance is near the trend line and the $1,845 zone, which is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from $1,889 to $1,807. </p>
<p class="s7">The next major hurdle for Ethereum (ETH) is at $1,860 or the 61.8% Fib retracement level. If Ethereum (ETH) manages to break above this level, it could rise towards $1,900, with the major resistance still at $1,920.</p>
<p class="s7">A bullish increase may occur if the bulls manage to push Ethereum (ETH) beyond the $1,920 level, which could lead to a rise towards the $2,000 resistance. Further gains may result in Ethereum (ETH) testing the $2,080 resistance level.</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK): Your Chance To Invest In Precious Metals</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) is a blockchain-based Web3 platform that aims to enable the trading of precious metals like silver, gold, and platinum. Its primary objective is to make these rare metals more accessible, especially for retail investors. </p>
<p class="s7">To achieve this goal, Sparklo intends to use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to fractionalize investments, allowing investors to purchase small amounts of precious metals that fit their budget.</p>
<p class="s7">The precious metals industry is a highly lucrative sector, with a market cap surpassing $14.99 trillion. Gold has the highest market cap in the industry at $13.3 trillion, silver follows with a market cap of $1.42 trillion, and platinum is estimated at $273 billion. </p>
<p class="s7">Getting involved in an industry of this magnitude gives Sparklo the potential to grow by 4,000x, making it one of the most promising investment opportunities for investors and traders alike, with the potential to become one of the top 100 cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo is presently in its presale phase, providing tokens at a rate of $0.015. This is a fantastic opportunity for crypto enthusiasts and early investors to join in.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Among the various updates going around, the spectacular showings of a 40% price surge and forecasted 35x returns for Collateral Network (COLT) have caught the most attention. In that regard, many observers have opined that the currency is primarily poised to edge out Arbitrum(ARB) and Optimism (OP) in profit earnings. For more on this trend, keep reading.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Collateral Network (COLT) Current Antics Sets It Up For Higher Earnings</p>
<p class="s7">The Collateral Network (COLT) approach toward profit earning continues to grab attention due to its feasibility. Because initiatives like Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) tend to follow similar patterns, they are usually susceptible to comparable market pressures, which impacts their profitability. However, that's not the case with Collateral Network (COLT), and let&rsquo;s see why. </p>
<p class="s7">The blockchain-based, ground-breaking crowdlending platform, Collateral Network (COLT), is backed by real-world assets that are not easily influenced by market volatility. So with the help of Collateral Network (COLT), borrowers can quickly and easily unlock the value of their assets, and lenders of the community can make passive income by lending small sums of money to the assets represented by NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">At the core of the Collateral Network (COLT) innovative strategy lies its use of fractionalized NFTs, which reflect borrowers' assets that are then allocated to lenders in small amounts to fund the loans the borrowers need. With this arrangement, Collateral Network (COLT) lenders receive interest payments as the borrower settles a loan.</p>
<p class="s7">But that's not all. COLT owners are also entitled to several benefits, including lesser borrowing rates, access to premium auctions and staking rewards. </p>
<p class="s7">Moreover, several forecasts have indicated a 35x surge in the value of Collateral Network (COLT) at the expiration of its presale. With its price already up 40% to $0.014, this forecast surely seems plausible. Given all it has to offer, many observers believe Collateral Network (COLT) is poised to surpass both Arbitrum (ARB) and Optimism (OP) in profit earnings.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s7">Arbitrum (ARB) Token Holders Reject Proposal</p>
<p class="s7">The focus of circulating reports has been the outright rejection of a proposal put forth by Arbitrum (ARB). A proposal to return 700 million $ARB, worth around $1bn, to the DAO treasury has been rejected by the Arbitrum (ARB) community almost unanimously. The aforementioned Arbitrum (ARB) governance proposal, termed &lsquo;AIP 1.05,&rsquo; asserts that the DAO's treasury resources were clearly overstepped when 700 million Arbitrum (ARB) tokens, worth at least $1bn, were issued preemptively and without authorization.</p>
<p class="s7">The voting started on April 8th and is scheduled to end on April 15th. Over 113 million people, which is equivalent to 83% of all votes cast, have voted against the idea thus far. Whereas only 20 million Arbitrum (ARB) token holders, equivalent to 15% of votes cast, support moving through with the proposal. </p>
<p class="s7">Meanwhile, the Arbitrum (ARB) price has risen 11.80% in the previous 24 hours, at the time of writing, to $1.57. Also, it has a $1,996,647,034 market cap.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s7">Optimism (OP) Move For A Major Upgrade Garners Approval</p>
<p class="s7">From the latest updates making the rounds, Token House, the body in charge of the Layer 2 Optimistic Rollup network Optimism (OP), has approved the Mainnet upgrade for Optimism Bedrock. The Bedrock network upgrade gives the L2 network more modularity, simplicity and Ethereum parity to enhance Optimism (OP) performance and security. The Bedrock update aims to lower Optimism (OP) transaction fees, enhance throughput properties and increase sync speeds. As per the projections, the change can cut protocol and security expenditures by 47%.</p>
<p class="s7">Reports from the initiative highlighted that the Bedrock expansion proposal received the largest voter turnout in OP Governance history. At least 27.945 $OP were in favor of the plan, while 37.217k $OP were opposed to it.</p>
<p class="s7">Optimism (OP) is currently available for $2.67, having increased in value by 7.73% over the previous 24 hours, at the time of writing. The current market capitalization for Optimism (OP) is $839,385,294.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A single person has been traced to be the mastermind behind the launch of 114 questionable memecoins in just two months</p>
ZachXBT Uncovers Memecoin Connection
<p>MyEtherWallet (MEW) is a popular online wallet for storing and managing multiple cryptocurrencies. However, according to the latest report, a MEW user launched 114 memecoins with no real purpose or value. Instead, they were designed to attract investors and generate profit for the wallet's owner. This has raised concerns within the crypto community about the potential for scams and fraud in the industry and the need for greater regulation and oversight.</p>
<p>Blockchain detective ZachXBT and other internet sleuths discovered that only one person was behind 114 meme coin scams. After every rug pull, the funds stolen were deposited in the same wallet address - 0x739c58807B99Cb274f6FD96B10194202b8EEfB47. After tracking all the coins, he uncovered that the scammers successfully collected these cryptos while staying relatively hidden by using multiple alternate wallet addresses and splitting the proceeds.&nbsp;</p>
BSC Criticized For Lack Of Oversight
<p>The memecoins were launched on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) platform, which has become a popular destination for creating and trading new cryptocurrencies. However, the lack of oversight and regulation on the platform has made it a prime target for fraudulent activities, including the propagation of such memecoin scams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report also highlights that the creators of the memecoins did not reveal their identities, which raises suspicions about their intentions and credibility. This lack of transparency is a common tactic scammers use to avoid detection and prosecution.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, the Binance Smart Chain has stated that it is taking steps to improve its security measures and crack down on fraudulent activities. The platform has also encouraged users to exercise caution when investing in new cryptocurrencies and conduct due diligence before making investment decisions.</p>
Experts Call For Regulation
<p>The crypto industry is rife with hacks and attacks, many of which were uncovered by ZachXBT himself. The North Korean Lazarus group has also posed a serious threat to the market as the mastermind behind a series of attacks on crypto companies from the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These reports highlight the need for greater regulation and oversight in the crypto industry. While the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies has many benefits, it also makes it challenging to regulate and monitor the activities of individuals and organizations operating within the industry.</p>
<p>Experts have called for increased collaboration between industry players, regulators, and law enforcement agencies to address these issues and prevent fraud and scams from tarnishing the entire industry's reputation. They also recommend that investors exercise caution and only invest in well-established cryptocurrencies with a proven track record of success.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The dollar has weakened, and risk assets trade inversely to the dollar. As the dollar loses strength, it becomes less appealing to investors, and this capital quickly finds its way into the digital asset space. Analysts have given a price prediction for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and have outlined a new protocol called Uwerx set to change the freelancing industry.&nbsp; NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Price Prediction NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a layer one blockchain that boasts massive throughput. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) powers thanks to its unique Nightshard sharding technology. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) gained support from developers due to the ease of deploying DApps on the network. NEAR Protocol (NEAR) introduced human-readable wallet addresses making it popular with users.NEAR Protocol (NEAR) currently trades close to $1.86, down close to 90% from its all-time high in January 2022, where NEAR Protocol (NEAR) traded above $20. Analysts acknowledge NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has lots of work ahead of it, but the trajectory has been solid, and analysts expect NEAR Protocol (NEAR) to trade above $5 by the end of 2023. How Will Uwerx (WERX) Change Crypto? Uwerx has big plans and will launch a decentralized freelance marketplace. Trust has been a huge issue for freelancers and employers alike, hence the rapid growth of centralized intermediaries to mediate the process, ensuring that the work gets done and the freelancer gets paid. Industry-leading platforms like Upwork have made record profits in recent years with the growth of the freelance economy, but Upwork still relies on the same procedures as it did in 2015. Uwerx will launch a decentralized and trustless model that removes the middleman and reduces fees by 75%. By leveraging blockchain, Uwerx can deliver a model that fits the current market demand, and as a result, the platform could grow exponentially. Analysts have predicted that the WERX token may trade as high as $9 before the end of year 2024. Taking Part In Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale According to Velocity Global, 44% of gig economy gross volume comes from customers in the United States. And this gives global freelancers a chance to earn dollars. Uwerx will connect people globally, and its presale price of $0.00751 could be an exceptional opportunity to join a blue chip project in the early stages. Audited by InterFi Network and SolidProof, with a 25-year liquidity lock after the presale ends, analysts have become highly bullish on Uwerx&rsquo;s prospects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe now is the best time to invest to enjoy a 25% purchase bonus and stand a chance to win $5,000 in a competition that ends tomorrow!Find Out More Here: Presale: invest.uwerx.network</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitget &mdash; the largest global copy trading platform, ranked 8th on Coingecko by trading volume, is pledging up to $10 million to the development of the Fetch.ai blockchain-based artificial intelligence and machine-learning platform after signing a partnership agreement. The statement highlights that the funds will be directed at the future growth of the promising startup, with options for listing of promising projects launched within its ecosystem on the native Bitget Launchpad.</p>
<p>The blockchain sector is becoming the next arena for the deployment of AI-based solutions, which have stormed the global digital industry with the successful launch of OpenAI&rsquo;s ChatGPT model. Among the leading companies in the blockchain space developing such neural network solutions is the Fetch.ai startup &ndash; an ecosystem comprising a number of modules leveraging decentralized AI agents.</p>
<p>The services Fetch.ai offers include AI-facilitated trading tools, decentralized machine-learning software, and an automated smart wallet supporting GPT model API integration. Other solutions provided within the Fetch.ai ecosystem include CLI tools, indexer services, and a client library, allowing it to act as an off-chain bridge for traditional layer 1 blockchain networks for facilitating P2P interactions in a decentralized environment.</p>
<p>The strategic partnership with Bitget and the $10 million pledge come as the exchange launched a fund dedicated to supporting promising startups that foster a positive approach towards blockchain on the part of global users. The Bitget team will be providing consultations on marketing to Fetch.ai in an effort to ensure higher exposure before potential partners. Projects deploying on the Fetch.ai infrastructure will also be eligible for listing on the Bitget Launchpad, with support for sales events and feature showcasing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know value when we see it. Fetch.ai already consists of a host of functioning and applicable technological AI solutions that can have a real impact on the way businesses and individuals interact. That is the main reason we have decided to pledge our support to this promising startup and will continue to do so as we identify others in need of assistance from our dedicated fund. Blockchain progress is unstoppable, but it can be accelerated if we lend it a helping hand, which is what we at Bitget intend to do,&rdquo; as Gracy Chen, the Managing Director of Bitget, commented regarding the announcement of the pledge.</p>

<p>The rising wave of hype surrounding AI-based solutions has permeated blockchain space as well, making such partnerships as the one between Bitget and Fetch.ai essential for maintaining the traction of technological development in the industry and related areas. Bitget is also interested in supporting such initiatives and startups, as it goes in line with its new expansion strategy that has already seen the exchange engage in corporate social responsibility projects with global brands in an effort to promote blockchain adoption and education to attract new audiences of users.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong, the soon-to-be promised land for crypto, will reportedly issue regulatory guidelines on its licensing regime for crypto exchanges in May. </p>
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is set to publish guidelines on its licensing framework for cryptocurrency exchanges in May.</p>
<p>According to reports by Bloomberg, which cites the SFC&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung, the consultation process leading up to the regulatory framework, garnered over 150 responses from industry players.</p>

Trading Platforms to Offer Retail Trading Services from June
<p>According to Bloomberg, the licensing regime will welcome support to crypto trading platforms that will offer trading services to retail investors from June 1.</p>
<p>Christian Hui, the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury in Hong Kong, said during a speech in March that the city received overwhelming interest from more than 80 crypto-related firms that want to set up shop in the city. Secretary Hui added that regulations planned since last year to establish a licensing regime for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) would take effect in June.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that OSL and Haskey are among the only trading platforms already receiving licenses from the SFC.</p>
Hong Kong&rsquo;s Crypto Ambitions
<p>In October, the city announced its desire to become the next global crypto hub. Since indicating its ambitions, Hong Kong regulators have been adjusting its regulatory framework to attract crypto firms struggling to establish themselves in an environment conducive to developing and using crypto assets.</p>
<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s commitment to virtual assets has grabbed the attention of firms struggling with the lack of clear guidelines in the US. Several firms such as Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance have warned that they might exit the US if regulators fail to provide clear rules.</p>
<p>In response to regulatory confusion in the US, many crypto firms have begun the process of applying for operating licenses in the city.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The security firm CertiK is planning to launch a compensation plan to return the funds stolen in the $2 million Merlin DEX exploit.&nbsp;</p>
CertiK Working To Recover Stolen Funds
<p>The blockchain security company has jumped in to help the Merlin decentralized exchange in its dire situation. The latter lost around $2 million during a public sale of its MAGE token, despite being audited by the smart-contract auditor, CertiK. To help recover a portion of the lost funds, CertiK is launching a compensation plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security firm has revealed that it is investigating the scam and has even worked with some members of the Merlin team to launch the compensation program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On April 26th, CertiK said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Initial investigations indicate that the rogue developers are based in Europe, and CertiK will collaborate with law enforcement authorities to track them down if direct negotiation is unsuccessful.&rdquo;</p>

USDC Stolen During Public Sale
<p>The decentralized exchange was conducting a three-day public sale of its MAGE token when it was targeted by a rogue developer. The latter made away with around $850,000 of USD Coin and other relatively illiquid tokens. To sum it up, a total of $1.8 million worth of tokens were stolen in the attack. CertiK has dived into the blockchain data available on the attack and surmised that the culprit behind the attack must be someone who had control over the liquidity pool and could easily remove the funds.&nbsp;</p>
CertiK&rsquo;s Audit Under Question
<p>The root of the hack was uncovered by the eZKalibur team, which is a community-driven decentralized exchange. Their initial investigations helped them identify the malicious code responsible for the depletion of funds. Specifically, the initialize function contains two lines of code that grant approval to the feeTo address, allowing it to transfer an unlimited amount of token0 and token1 from the contract's address. This enables the feeTo address to call the transferFrom function and transfer tokens from the contract's address to itself.</p>
<p>The eZKalibur team had also questioned CertiK&rsquo;s auditing, which had given the Merlin DEX a high ranking before the attack happened.&nbsp;</p>
CertiK&rsquo;s Plan Offers 20% Bounty
<p>The CertiK team is trying to appeal to the rogue developer with a compensation plan, where they would get to keep a white hat bounty of 20% of the stolen funds after returning 80% to the exchange platform. According to CertiK's preliminary findings, the developers of the project are located in Europe, and the company is collaborating with law enforcement agencies to locate them.</p>
<p>The security firm also said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although we raised the private key privilege issues in the audit report, we want to assist impacted users. We are determined to track down those behind this rug pull.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>DAO4ART is changing the game for art and collectibles investors and collectors, leveraging the power of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) to create a Web3-enabled AIGC market valued at $136 billion in 2022. And that was before ChatGPT, Midjourney, or other increasingly popular projects booming.</p>
<p>The art and collectibles market has been a sought-after investment for centuries, and with the advent of technology, this market has become more accessible than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the traditional art and collectibles market is still riddled with issues such as lack of transparency, high transaction fees, and limited liquidity. To solve these problems, DAO4ART was born.</p>
How AIGC is Changing the Face of NFTs Forever
<p>NFT investors and creators are bouncing back from a tough 2022 bear market. Although over 101 million NFT transactions occurred last year, the NFTs sold had significantly less value than in 2021, causing the market to collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, this year's NFT projects show little innovation, except for AI tech's potential. However, even AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generative Content) market has some pros and cons which are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High Value - The AIGC market has a high potential for value creation, with the ability to generate large quantities of content faster than humans.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High Participation - The market is open to all, enabling individuals and businesses to create, monetize, and engage with AIGC content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High Productivity - AIGC can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for creators to focus on more strategic work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Yet-to-be-defined Workflow - There is no standard workflow for AIGC content creation, leading to confusion and inconsistency in the market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No New Paradigm Yet - The AIGC market is still in its infancy and has not yet established a new paradigm or framework for content creation and distribution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No Monetization - Creators often struggle with monetizing their AIGC content due to a lack of knowledge or resources, leading to missed opportunities for revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that's how DAO4ART takes the scene and solves this problem for artists, DAOs, game developers, and others who want to integrate AI technology into their projects but face monetization and other roadblocks.</p>
DAO4ART: Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Digital Investments for Art and Collectibles
<p>In order to understand the innovation brought by DAO4ART, we first need to know the problems of the NFT market because DAO4ART can be a nurturer for the NFT market as well.</p>
<p>The NFT market, despite being innovative, is facing concerns about its long-term sustainability. This is mainly due to its low volume and the lack of fundamental innovation, which has resulted in many NFTs remaining inactive after the sale with unclear monetization strategies. While NFTs can revolutionize the art and collectibles market, these pain points must be addressed to unlock their full potential and ensure a truly sustainable market. And that's what DAO4ART did.</p>
<p>Its Web3-enabled AIGC Market is a testament to the platform's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create a transparent, secure, and efficient investment environment.</p>
<p>What sets DAO4ART apart is its decentralized approach to investment. By building the platform on the Ethereum blockchain, DAO4ART ensures that investors can access the AIGC market without the need for intermediaries or central authorities. This approach not only increases transparency but also lowers costs and reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation.</p>
<p>The team behind DAO4ART comprises experienced professionals committed to delivering the highest level of service and support to their users. The platform is constantly evolving, with new features and capabilities being added on an ongoing basis to meet the market's changing needs.</p>
A DAO-Oriented Model
<p>DAO4ART, in addition to the above, as you can intuit, is a DAO-based production collaboration model. This decentralized autonomous organization allows artists to create and launch their own NFT collection on the platform through a collaborative process between the artists, curators, and investors.</p>
<p>The D4A DAO also includes a new and improved built-in royalty tokenization system, which allows artists to earn long-term income from their NFTs. This means that whenever their NFT is sold or traded on the platform, a percentage of the transaction value is automatically paid to the artist as a royalty.</p>
<p>The royalty tokenization system is implemented through smart contracts and self-executing programs that automate payment. This ensures that artists are fairly compensated for their work and can continue to earn income from their NFTs even after being sold.</p>
<p>However, what makes DAO4ART different from these royalties compared to the traditional model is that DAO4ART is tokenizing, implying that the royalty-embedded tokens will become a tradable asset class.</p>
<p>Besides, the nice thing about DAO4ART (as with any DAO) is that people can actively participate in the platform's development decisions. DAO4ART's governance framework enables users to participate in decision-making processes, creating a sense of community and ownership that is rare in traditional investment markets.</p>
Beyond the Marketplace: Understanding the Role of DAO4ART in the NFT Ecosystem
<p>DAO4ART (D4A) primarily focuses on creating and managing DAOs for art projects. While NFT marketplaces generally serve as platforms to buy and sell existing NFTs, D4A is more focused on the early stages of content creation and helping artists collaborate on creating new collections of NFTs.</p>
<p>As such, DAO4ART has recently initiated a 100x100 series involving AI-generated content created by community members.</p>
<p>In contrast to other marketplaces, D4A is more of a community-driven platform that fosters collaboration and creativity among artists. D4A is the starting point for artists to create content and launch their NFT collections, which can then be traded on NFT marketplaces.</p>

<p>NFT investors and creators are bouncing back from a tough 2022 bear market. Although over 101 million NFT transactions occurred last year, the NFTs sold had significantly less value than in 2021, causing the market to collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, this year's NFT projects show little innovation, except for AI tech's potential. However, even AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generative Content) market has some pros and cons which are worth mentioning:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High Value - The AIGC market has a high potential for value creation, with the ability to generate large quantities of content faster than humans.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High Participation - The market is open to all, enabling individuals and businesses to create, monetize, and engage with AIGC content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">High Productivity - AIGC can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up time for creators to focus on more strategic work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Yet-to-be-defined Workflow - There is no standard workflow for AIGC content creation, leading to confusion and inconsistency in the market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No New Paradigm Yet - The AIGC market is still in its infancy and has not yet established a new paradigm or framework for content creation and distribution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">No Monetization - Creators often struggle with monetizing their AIGC content due to a lack of knowledge or resources, leading to missed opportunities for revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, that's how DAO4ART takes the scene and solves this problem for artists, DAOs, game developers, and others who want to integrate AI technology into their projects but face monetization and other roadblocks.</p>
DAO4ART: Bridging the Gap Between Traditional and Digital Investments for Art and Collectibles
<p>In order to understand the innovation brought by DAO4ART, we first need to know the problems of the NFT market because DAO4ART can be a nurturer for the NFT market as well.</p>
<p>The NFT market, despite being innovative, is facing concerns about its long-term sustainability. This is mainly due to its low volume and the lack of fundamental innovation, which has resulted in many NFTs remaining inactive after the sale with unclear monetization strategies. While NFTs can revolutionize the art and collectibles market, these pain points must be addressed to unlock their full potential and ensure a truly sustainable market. And that's what DAO4ART did.</p>
<p>Its Web3-enabled AIGC Market is a testament to the platform's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies to create a transparent, secure, and efficient investment environment.</p>
<p>What sets DAO4ART apart is its decentralized approach to investment. By building the platform on the Ethereum blockchain, DAO4ART ensures that investors can access the AIGC market without the need for intermediaries or central authorities. This approach not only increases transparency but also lowers costs and reduces the risk of fraud or manipulation.</p>
<p>The team behind DAO4ART comprises experienced professionals committed to delivering the highest level of service and support to their users. The platform is constantly evolving, with new features and capabilities being added on an ongoing basis to meet the market's changing needs.</p>
A DAO-Oriented Model
<p>DAO4ART, in addition to the above, as you can intuit, is a DAO-based production collaboration model. This decentralized autonomous organization allows artists to create and launch their own NFT collection on the platform through a collaborative process between the artists, curators, and investors.</p>
<p>The D4A DAO also includes a new and improved built-in royalty tokenization system, which allows artists to earn long-term income from their NFTs. This means that whenever their NFT is sold or traded on the platform, a percentage of the transaction value is automatically paid to the artist as a royalty.</p>
<p>The royalty tokenization system is implemented through smart contracts and self-executing programs that automate payment. This ensures that artists are fairly compensated for their work and can continue to earn income from their NFTs even after being sold.</p>
<p>However, what makes DAO4ART different from these royalties compared to the traditional model is that DAO4ART is tokenizing, implying that the royalty-embedded tokens will become a tradable asset class.</p>
<p>Besides, the nice thing about DAO4ART (as with any DAO) is that people can actively participate in the platform's development decisions. DAO4ART's governance framework enables users to participate in decision-making processes, creating a sense of community and ownership that is rare in traditional investment markets.</p>
Beyond the Marketplace: Understanding the Role of DAO4ART in the NFT Ecosystem
<p>DAO4ART (D4A) primarily focuses on creating and managing DAOs for art projects. While NFT marketplaces generally serve as platforms to buy and sell existing NFTs, D4A is more focused on the early stages of content creation and helping artists collaborate on creating new collections of NFTs.</p>
<p>As such, DAO4ART has recently initiated a 100x100 series involving AI-generated content created by community members.</p>
<p>In contrast to other marketplaces, D4A is more of a community-driven platform that fosters collaboration and creativity among artists. D4A is the starting point for artists to create content and launch their NFT collections, which can then be traded on NFT marketplaces.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Robert Kiyosaki has gone to Twitter to warn his followers of the excesses of the banks, and advises gold and bitcoin.</p>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, continues to tweet out on his Twitter account, giving his view that the Federal Reserve and the banks are not to be trusted.</p>
Free speech
<p>For such a well-respected and influential person to be able to make these kinds of remarks at least says something for the ability to have free speech in US society.</p>
<p>However, Kiyosaki was scathing of the owners of Fox News, who &lsquo;released&rsquo; both Tucker Carlson and Dan Bongino from the news channel. According to Kiyosaki, both were voices for freedom.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don&rsquo;t cry for Tucker Carlson or Dan Bongino. They are rock stars who will become greater rock stars. They are the next Jordan Peterson,,,free human beings&hellip;empowered by our freedom of speech. Our freedom of speech is worth fighting for and dying for. God bless America.</p>
&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 25, 2023
<p>

</p>
Banks
<p>On the banks, and particularly the Federal Reserve, Kiyosaki was even more vociferous in his condemnation. He tweeted on how the Treasury and US government had decided to back any banks that were deemed to be &ldquo;systemically important&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He saw this as being totally detrimental to the smaller regional banks, and he suggested that they could be wiped out by the Fed.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">By supporting only Big Banks like JP Morgan WTFed wipining out regional banks. Cruel. Regional banks heart and soul of America. Please support small banks and small businesses. Fed is criminal.</p>
&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 27, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Could Kiyosaki be right about this? Banks have become far fewer over the passing years. With the current Fed policy towards them, many more could go out of business, leading to a future monopoly of the last big 5 or 6 banks.</p>
Bitcoin
<p>On Bitcoin, Kiyosaki has never wavered, telling his followers to buy it, as well as gold and silver, in order to protect themselves from the terrifying times to come.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">WHY I ❤️BITCOIN: Years ago I watched BC climb to $20k then drop to 0. I thought BC finished. Slowly watched BC climb to $6 k &amp; I bought lots. WHY? Because people support BC not FED or Gov. BC did not need FED or Gov bailout because BC people&rsquo;s money. BC to $100k. Long live BC.</p>
&mdash; Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 21, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>The famous entrepreneur says that Bitcoin does not need Fed bailouts because it is the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s money&rdquo;, and he forecasts that the king of the cryptocurrencies is going to $100,000 this cycle.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin was sailing higher on Wednesday when suddenly there was a strong pullback. News of Mt Gox and the US Government moving their BTC caused panic selling.</p>
A topsy-turvy day
<p>The day had gone well as Microsoft earnings came in much better than the market had expected. The Nasdaq had risen on the news and this possibly helped the bitcoin price to rise strongly around the middle of the day.</p>
<p>The price touched $30,000 and then started to take a breather and go sideways for several hours. However, around 8pm BST the price dropped fairly dramatically, plunging nearly 7% over the next hour down to $27,700.</p>
<p>The BTC price continued to fall, and got right down to strong support at around $27,250 before bouncing robustly back above $28,000. Since then the price has recovered to hover at $29,000. What caused this seesaw action?</p>
What caused the seesaw price action?
<p>It appears that what caused all the initial panic was a tweet from the db Twitter account stating that an Arkham Alert had triggered, suggesting that Mt Gox and the US government were moving their BTC.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">[DB] Mt Gox and US Govt Wallets Making Transactions: Arkham Alert</p>
&mdash; db (@tier10k) April 26, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Panic ensued and the long positions that had opened on the good earnings news were instantly liquidated. Open interest for BTC tanked 11% over a 4 hour period and $277 million was liquidated over 12 hours.</p>
<p>However, the alert turned out to be false and as soon as the market realised this the price whipped back up in the opposite direction, wiping out those who had jumped in to short the dump.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have conducted an investigation of the DB Alert situation, and determined that the Arkham alerts were sent accurately in this case.DB set two alerts on all Bitcoin transactions above $10k USD, with no counterparties set, then named the alerts &ldquo;Mt Gox&rdquo; and &ldquo;US Gov&rdquo;. When we&hellip; pic.twitter.com/8OITiygNhL</p>
&mdash; Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) April 26, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>So the fact was that Arkham had fixed a bug which had led to all the panic and confusion. So this begs the question, what will happen when Mt Gox and the US government do sell their Bitcoin?</p>
The Mt Gox/US gov sell overhang
<p>The Mt Gox Bitcoin holding amounts to 142,000 BTC. October 30 2023 is the deadline for distribution of this amount. The deadline has been moved back a few times already, so it would not be surprising if it was put back again. Nevertheless, staggered payments are potentially going to be made leading up to October or beyond.</p>
<p>The US government still has 41,000 Bitcoin. It sold 9,800 in March and the bitcoin selling pressure was absorbed relatively easily by the market. According to the US government, the remaining BTC is to be sold in four tranches across the rest of this year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Investment giant Franklin Templeton has announced that its Nasdaq-listed OnChain US Government Money Fund is now supported on the Polygon Network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The OnChain US Government Money Fund is the first US-registered mutual fund to process transactions and record share ownership using the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
Greater Compatibility With The Digital Ecosystem&nbsp;
<p>Franklin Templeton is one of the world&rsquo;s largest asset managers, with over $1.4 trillion worth of assets under management. According to the asset manager, integrating its On Chain US Government Money Fund (FOBXX) with the Polygon Network would allow it to be &ldquo;further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem.&rdquo; In a press release, the asset manager stated that it continues to see greater operational efficiency through the use of a blockchain-integrated system. Benefits include faster transaction speeds, better security, and significantly lesser costs. Additionally, the Fund&rsquo;s transfer agent maintains an official record of the share ownership using a proprietary blockchain-integrated system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton, Roger Bayston, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain. This furthers our distribution reach through a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain that has a proven track record.&rdquo;</p>

A World Of Possibilities For Investors&nbsp;
<p>Access to the Ethereum ecosystem opens a host of possibilities for investors in the Fund. The Fund is a regulated 1940 Act fund that gives investors a competitive yield, investing at least 99.5% of its total assets into cash, government securities, and repurchase agreements, all fully collateralized by government securities or cash. The Fund aims to give investors a high-income level consistent with preserving shareholders&rsquo; capital and liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund share is represented by one BENJI token. BENJI token holders can also get exposure to the app through the Benji Investments App. Speaking about the developments, the Global Head of Institutional Capital at Polygon Labs, Colin Butler, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing to have a legacy institution like Franklin Templeton bringing transparency, interoperability, and secure, democratized access to their financial instruments, all things afforded with Polygon. When we take a step back and look at these things less as blockchain products and more as benefits created by utilizing blockchain rails, we start to see the &lsquo;why.&rsquo; Tokenized assets are going to positively rewire the global financial system, and Franklin Templeton is at the forefront of this movement.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>He further added that investors would be able to access a $260 billion market, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Polygon blockchain ecosystem spans many L2, sidechains, and sovereign blockchains, and our suite of Ethereum scalability solutions has seen significant adoption across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprises. The Polygon blockchain also provides access to a $260 billion market &mdash; the approximate aggregate value of all ERC-20 (Ethereum-based) assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Other Traditional Finance Companies Using Blockchain
<p>Polygon is the entity behind the MATIC cryptocurrency, which is the 10th largest cryptocurrency in the market. It acts as a scaling platform for Ethereum, helping make it faster and more efficient. On the other hand, Franklin Templeton has a long association with the crypto space. Stellar, an open-source platform designed to facilitate currency payments, stated that the Templeton Fund is also available on its network. Several other traditional finance companies have also incorporated blockchain technology in their offerings. In 2022, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab, and others from Wall Street created EDX Markets, a digital asset exchange.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Stablecoin issuer Circle has launched its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) on the mainnet, enabling permissionless transfers of USDC natively across supported blockchains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">With the new transfer protocol, developers can now build applications that support different native versions of USDC. It is now available across seven primary networks in addition to Ethereum: Solana, Avalanche, TRON, Algorand, Stellar, Flow, and Hedera. Crypto infrastructure providers such as Celer, Hyperlane, LayerZero, LI.FI, MetaMask, Multichain, Rarimo, Router, Socket, Wanchain, and Wormhole have already integrated CCTP.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This move from Circle aims to establish an open dollar developer platform for internet-based money transfers. The newly launched CCTP allows USDC to be "teleported" across chains, effectively being destroyed on the source chain and recreated 1:1 on the destination chain, with its U.S. dollar reserves remaining intact.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Recently, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire has voiced concerns over the growing trend of "de-dollarization" as more countries, particularly in Asia and Latin America, move away from the use of the U.S. Dollar as base currency for international trade and finance. At a recent crypto conference, Allaire called for the U.S. government to expedite stablecoin regulation and issue a digital dollar CBDC, warning that failure to do so would be a "giant missed opportunity" for the country.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The technology behind CCTP hence attempts to overcome the fragmentation of USDC's $31 billion market cap across various blockchains. Although Circle issues "native" USDC on several top networks, including Ethereum and Avalanche, these asset tranches were essentially partitioned. Users wanting to bridge the gap had to engage in complex and sometimes costly cross-chain transfers. CCTP seeks to replace bridges, which created derivative tokens called wrapped assets, through the aforementioned mechanism of destroying USDC on the source chain and near-instantly recreating it on the destination chain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Circle Product Vice President Joao Reginatto claims that CCTP is a permissionless protocol designed for developers to take advantage of this transport primitive. DeFi apps can integrate relevant smart contracts to streamline stablecoin transfers for users.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC. This milestone makes USDC a natively multi-chain digital dollar," Reginatto shares.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">While USDC is the second-largest stablecoin behind Tether (USDT), its circulation has been shrinking over time, with a current supply at $31 billion, according to blockchain data from CoinMarketCap. This represents a decline of 30% since the beginning of the year and 45% since its all-time high, resulting in a decrease in USDC's market share to 23.5%. In contrast, Tether holds a 62% share of the stablecoin market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance.US has withdrawn from its planned $1 billion acquisition of Voyager, citing the "hostile and uncertain" regulatory climate in the United States.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Voyager, which filed for bankruptcy in 2022, will now distribute cash and crypto directly to its clients through its own platform. In the wake of the collapse of the FTX deal, Voyager struck a $1 billion buyout agreement with Binance.US. However, the acquisition faced strong opposition from regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and U.S. Attorney Damian Williams.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite these challenges, the deal received court approval, but has now been terminated from the end of Binance.US.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">https://t.co/AZwoBOgsqS has made the difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase agreement with Voyager.

&mdash; Binance.US 🇺🇸 (@BinanceUS) April 25, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Voyager initially filed for a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection plan in July 2022 (approved March 7, 2023), after crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital defaulted on a $650 million loan. The company then decided to auction off its crypto assets as part of its restructuring plan, with FTX emerging as the highest bidder. When FTX's implosion forced Voyager to seek a new buyer, the company entered into negotiations with Binance.US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao has previously hinted that the company's sudden decision may be due to regulatory pressure.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"While our hope throughout this [acquisition] process was to help Voyager's customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the U.S. has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community," a spokesperson from Binance disclosed.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Voyager announced on Twitter that it had received a letter from Binance US "terminating the asset purchase agreement." Although the announcement was "disappointing" for Voyager, the company assured its customers they would still receive their cash and crypto through a "direct distribution" via the Voyager platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Voyager's Committee of Unsecured Creditors also expressed disappointment upon learning of the termination of the deal with Binance. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"The Committee is incredibly disappointed with this decision and is investigating potential claims against Binance US," the account tweeted.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">With Voyager now set to directly distribute cash and crypto to its clients, the future of the company remains uncertain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance.US, meanwhile, has been developing new integrations to expand its services. The U.S. arm of the global exchange recently announced a partnership with Unstoppable Domains to offer web3 domain names on Polygon, patterned after its brand (with a .BinanceUS TLD).</p>
