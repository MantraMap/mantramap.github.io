Nelson Mupunga, the director of economic research at the central bank, reportedly said the digital currency will act as an alternative to foreign currency.</strong></p>
<h2>Local Residents&#8217; Insatiable Demand for the Greenback</h2>
<p>The Zimbabwean central bank has commenced a &#8220;dry run&#8221; to test the feasibility of issuing a gold-backed digital currency which is set to be used as a means of payment, a <a href="https://businesstimes.co.zw/rbz-begins-digital-dollar-dry-run/">report</a> has said. The digital currency, which will be accepted as legal tender for peer-to-peer transactions, is part of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)’s raft of measures which are aimed at stabilizing the local currency.</p>
<p>The latest revelation by the Zimbabwean central bank official comes just a few weeks after the RBZ initially <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-zimbabwes-central-bank-set-to-launch-p2p-platform-for-facilitating-gold-backed-digital-currency-transactions/">announced</a> plans to launch the P2P platform. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the launch of the platform will make it possible for holders of digital gold tokens to trade them. John Mangudya, the RBZ governor, has in the past stated that the gold-backed tokens will help the country <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/zimbabwes-de-dollarization-central-bank-to-issue-gold-backed-digital-currency-in-early-may/">diminish</a> its insatiable need for foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Gold-Backed Digital Currency as a Store of Value</h2>
<p>According to Nelson Mupunga, the director of economic research and policy implementation for the RBZ, the digital currency will act as an alternative to the greenback and other foreign currencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at an advanced stage; we are at the testing stage now. Soon, we will allow the gold digital token to be used for transaction purposes just like someone buys foreign currency from the parallel market. But at the same time, we can transact with. So, the token is coming and will satisfy the same function,&#8221; said the RBZ official.</p>
<p>The official also added that the central bank had chosen to launch the gold-backed digital currency after observing local residents’ practice of ditching the floundering local currency for the greenback. Therefore, instead of using the greenback to store value, residents in the inflation-hit country will be able to do this using gold-backed digital tokens.</p>

The test concluded that, using the RLN, the proposed CBDC might allow for near real-time dollar payments and cross-border settlements.</strong></p>
<h2>New York Federal Reserve and Bank Working Group Finish Programmable Dollar-Based Wholesale CBDC Test</h2>
<p>The New York Federal Reserve and other banks and payment firms have announced the <a href="https://www.rlnuspoc.org/home#subpage/introduction/section/w3rk7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conclusion</a> of a 12-week proof-of-concept test of the <a href="https://regulatedliabilitynetwork.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regulated Liability Network</a> (RLN), a system using shared ledger technology to provide programmability to regulated money.</p>
<p>The working group, comprising BNY Mellon, Citi, HSBC, Mastercard, PNC Bank, TD Bank, Truist, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo, examined the performance of a dollar-based wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC) in different use cases.</p>
<p>The role of the Federal Reserve New York Innovation Center was &#8220;limited to the simulated operation of tokenized central bank deposits as a settlement asset,&#8221; according to the released report. Furthermore, the document clarifies that this participation is &#8220;not intended to advance any specific policy outcome, nor to signal that the Federal Reserve will make any imminent decisions about the appropriateness or design of tokenized central bank deposits or wholesale CBDC.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Examined Use Cases</h2>
<p>One of the use cases for the system had to do with examining the performance of the dollar-based CBDC as a tool to complete domestic interbank payments (such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-fednow-the-first-step-towards-a-central-bank-digital-currency-speculations-rise-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fednow</a>), concluding that it &#8220;could operate successfully as a payment system on a new technology platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second use case examined in the proof-of-concept pilot test had to do with using the designed dollar CBDC as an instrument for offshore settlements, finding that its usage could &#8220;improve cross-border payments through the orchestration of customer payments and settlements across the payment chain, and the introduction of parallel processing of payment proposals.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the supposed benefits of adopting the proposed system would be the high availability and interoperability of the liquidity stored in the form of CBDC, allowing for 24/7 movements across baking entities of different countries. On this, Isabel Schmidt, co-head of payments products at BNY Mellon, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is incumbent upon our industry to expand the availability and efficiency of dollars for all our clients across the globe, particularly given the U.S. dollar’s vital role in global payments, trade, and financial markets.</p></blockquote>

However, FTX executives reportedly convinced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to reconsider and abandon the $100-million deal with Swift.</strong></p>
<h2>Taylor Swift Reportedly Signed Agreement With FTX</h2>
<p>Taylor Swift, a famous singer-songwriter who has won 12 Grammy Awards from 46 nominations, reportedly signed a deal with the now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange FTX, contrary to previous reports. The Financial Times reported that the size of the deal was approximately <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-execs-offered-taylor-swift-100m-to-endorse-the-exchange-source-says-singer-never-considered-the-deal/">$100 million</a>.</p>
<p>Adam Moskowitz, one of the attorneys spearheading a $5 million class-action lawsuit against 16 celebrity endorsers of FTX, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/taylor-swift-rejected-crypto-exchange-ftxs-sponsorship-offer-over-unregistered-securities-concerns/">disclosed</a> on the Block&#8217;s Scoop podcast in April that Swift sought legal advice when approached by former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). According to him, the famous singer inquired: &#8220;Can you assure me that these assets are not unregistered securities?&#8221; Moskowitz’s comment led to headlines that Swift subsequently decided to withdraw from the deal.</p>
<p>However, the New York Times confirmed Thursday that Moskowitz said he had no inside information about the talks between FTX and Swift. Citing three people with knowledge of the deal, the news outlet detailed that in reality, Swift signed a tour sponsorship agreement with FTX after more than six months of discussions while turning down some promotion options. In addition, the people told the publication that it was Bankman-Fried who pulled the plug at the last minute, leaving Swift&#8217;s team frustrated and disappointed.</p>
<p>CNBC described Thursday, independently citing a person familiar with the matter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Swift did ultimately agree to the deal … The signed agreement was sent to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s email inbox, where it remained unanswered for a period of a few weeks.</p></blockquote>

<p>The publication added that “ultimately, a group of FTX executives persuaded Bankman-Fried not to follow through with the reported $100 million deal.”</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in November last year. Bankman-Fried is currently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/5-charges-temporarily-suspended-in-ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-frieds-legal-battle/">facing</a> multiple fraud and campaign finance violation charges. Three other FTX executives, namely Gary Wang, Caroline Ellison, and Nishad Singh, have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-gary-wang-and-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud-duo-is-cooperating-with-feds/">pleaded guilty</a> to various charges. Meanwhile, the new FTX management is seeking to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-continues-to-explore-potential-relaunch-court-records-reveal/">relaunch</a> the crypto exchange internationally.</p>

Hayes maintains that moving forward, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will be the favored currency for AIs since they &#x201C;must use a system that is available at all times, digital, and completely automated.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Arthur Hayes Envisions AI and Bitcoin Forming an Alliance, Predicts Price Soaring to $760,000</h2>
<p>The ex-chief executive of Bitmex has shared several essays on his cryptohayes substack.com blog, and on July 6, 2023, he <a href="https://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/massa">delved</a> into bitcoin and artificial intelligence (AI). Hayes envisions bitcoin playing a crucial role in AIs&#x2019; future as he contends in his latest essay that the dominant crypto asset will serve as &#x201C;food of AI.&#x201D; Hayes proposes that AI and robotics mainly focus on eradicating mundane tasks, freeing more individuals to chase their dreams and produce art and culture. He anticipates this leading to a resurgence of innovation and contentment.</p>
<p>In the essay, Hayes argues that <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> will ultimately emerge as the preferred currency for AIs. He expounds on how AIs necessitate a digital, automated, and censorship-free payment infrastructure, which traditional banking and fiat currencies fail to deliver. Blockchain-driven systems present desirable features, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> being the optimal choice due to its limited supply, censorship resistance, and energy-buying power. He contrasts this with gold and fiat currencies by emphasizing their shortcomings and absence of digital efficacy. In the essay, Hayes declares:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is the monetary instrument closest to representing pure energy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former head of Bitmex clarifies that artificial intelligence (AI), akin to humans, demands resources that must be procured and paid for. Hayes asserts that since <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> closely embodies pure energy, it is uniquely qualified as AI currency given its inherent need to conserve energy purchasing capacity. Gold and fiat fall short when compared to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s censorship resistance, long-term value retention, and demonstrable scarcity, according to Hayes. He does concede, however, that in terms of a currency offering verifiable longevity, gold stands on equal footing with bitcoin.</p>

<p>Should AI and bitcoin intersect in this manner, Hayes believes that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price will skyrocket. In his essay&#x2019;s latter portion, he ponders the potential price of bitcoin given his theoretical union between the crypto asset and AI. In fact, Hayes&#x2019; calculations &#x2014; which factor in the AI economy&#x2019;s size and other BTC-related metrics &#x2014; suggest that the digital asset could reach $760,000 within the next two to three years.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Remember &#x2014; the market will overpay for Bitcoin network growth if it believes there is a possibility that my assumptions could be true in the future,&#x201D; Hayes concluded in his latest missive. &#x201C;The most money is made when the market price adjusts from &#x2018;can never happen&#x2019; to &#x2018;maybe could happen.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on Arthur Hayes&#x2019; bold claim that bitcoin will become the favored currency for AI? Do you believe this potential intersection could lead to a surge in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s price?

Techopedia and Changelly have released price prediction reports with varying estimates, suggesting that bitcoin&#x2019;s value could range from $25,175 to $40,836 per unit by the close of the year.</strong></p>
<h2>Techopedia vs. Changelly: Clash of Bitcoin Price Predictions for 2023&#x2019;s Year End</h2>
<p>Throughout the years, countless market observers have taken on the challenge of forecasting the price of <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a>, yielding a mix of wildly inaccurate predictions and astutely accurate projections.</p>
<p>In late January 2023, a panel consisting of 56 experts in the crypto and fintech fields, as conducted by product comparison website finder.com, confidently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/finders-experts-predict-bitcoin-to-peak-at-29k-in-2023-but-forecast-a-low-of-13k/">stated</a> that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> would reach its peak at $29,095 by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has already surpassed this anticipated peak, surging beyond the $31K threshold as of July 6. In a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/30k-to-50k-6-ai-powered-chatbots-attempt-to-predict-bitcoins-price-by-the-years-end/">recent survey</a> conducted by Bitcoin.com News, six distinct artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots were asked to share their predictions for bitcoin&#x2019;s year-end price.</p>
<p>The responses varied significantly, with price projections spanning from $30K to $50K per unit. Building upon this price exploration, we now turn our attention to two comprehensive bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) price prediction reports provided by Techopedia and Changelly.</p>
<p>These reports offer a diverse range of forecasts, each with its own unique perspective. Notably, Techopedia&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-price-prediction">analysis</a> takes a more cautious stance, suggesting that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could reach a &#x201C;potential high&#x201D; of $25,175 by the end of December.</p>
<p>Amidst the summer trading season, Techopedia sheds light on the current state of bitcoin trading, highlighting a notable decline in trade volume and a subsequent stall in momentum.</p>

<p>In the analysis, author Michael Graw delves into the worst-case scenario for Bitcoin&#x2019;s price, emphasizing the possibility of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> testing its support level at $18,650 or even revisiting its 2022 low of $15,760.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the year 2024, Techopedia&#x2019;s examination paints a less optimistic picture compared to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">bullish forecasts</a> circulating today. Notably, Techopedia&#x2019;s analysis suggests a potential 2024 low of $15,500 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> and a potential high of $31,000 per coin.</p>
<p>When it comes to price predictions, Changelly&#x2019;s analysis takes a more upbeat stance compared to Techopedia&#x2019;s examination, offering three distinct price ranges for the end of 2023.</p>

<p>The lower end of the spectrum stands at $35,608.47, while the average price hovers around $37,149.69. However, the most exciting estimate points to a potential year-end price of $40,836.62, reflecting a sense of bullish optimism.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Changelly&#x2019;s <a href="https://changelly.com/blog/bitcoin-price-prediction/">projections</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> could soar to $36,438 per unit by July 31, 2023, marking an impressive surge of over 20% above the current price. Turning our attention to the year 2024, Changelly&#x2019;s predictions continue to climb higher.</p>
<p>The analysis anticipates a minimum price of $51,084.24 and an average price of $52,941.72. Yet, it&#x2019;s worth noting that Changelly&#x2019;s 2024 forecast falls short of surpassing the peak price reached in 2021, with a maximum quoted price of $61,458.72 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>

<p>Looking further ahead to the future, Changelly&#x2019;s 2025 prediction surpasses the 2021 all-time high. The projection spans a range reaching from $79,422.87 to $88,660.00. However, it&#x2019;s not until 2026 that bitcoin breaches the six-digit mark, according to the analysis.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Techopedia&#x2019;s estimates for 2025 reveal a potential low of $21,500, contrasting with a more optimistic high of $53,000 for that year. Zooming further into the horizon, Techopedia&#x2019;s 2030 prediction presents a wide spectrum, ranging from $30,000 to $100,000 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>

Projections indicate that this event is slated to take place between April 21 and 27, 2024, leading to a substantial reduction of 50% in the earnings of mining participants. Such a development is bound to bring about a significant transformation in the landscape of mining distribution, as miners will witness a substantial decrease in the amount of bitcoin they receive compared to previous cycles.</strong></p>
<h2>Balancing Act: Can Bitcoin&#x2019;s Halving Strike a Sustainable Equation for Miners and Network Security?</h2>
<p>In just nine months, the Bitcoin halving will make its presence known, presenting the mining industry with a formidable challenge &#x2014; a substantial decrease in revenue, particularly if market prices remain stagnant or decline. Typically, the price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) experiences a noteworthy surge roughly six months to a year before the halving event.</p>
<p>In the span of six months, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-leaves-major-assets-in-the-dust-surges-80-in-the-first-half-of-2023-soars-to-12th-largest-global-asset/">already soared</a> by over 80% in 2023. At present, approximately 900 brand new bitcoins enter the market each day (144 blocks), generating a daily sum of around $26 million for miners, alongside transaction fees, based on current exchange rates.</p>

<p>However, in a mere nine months, if prices were to remain within the same range, mining participants would witness a sharp decline, earning a reduced daily amount of $13 million, in addition to fees. <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoin-miner-revenue-monthly">Statistics</a> show miner fees have accounted for only a small portion of the revenue earned by bitcoin miners.</p>

<p>According to data from July 7, 2023, fees represented <a href="https://insights.braiins.com/en">1.89%</a> of the earnings generated from 144 blocks. In June, bitcoin miners collectively earned $783.76 million in revenue, with block rewards alone (excluding fees) amounting to $745.45 million. In May, miners acquired a total of $919.22 million in revenue, with $793.3 million coming from the block subsidy, according to the data.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/bitcoin/bitcoin-miner-revenue-monthly">fees collected</a> for May amounted to $125.92 million, a relatively high figure considering fees had not exceeded $20 million per month from December 2021 until March 2023. While fees reached $246 million in April 2021, the increase compared to May was only $121 million. The miners&#x2019; highest monthly fee revenue to date was in December 2017, when they earned $297 million.</p>

<p>A low ratio of fees carries several implications for the network&#x2019;s long-term sustainability as rewards decline with each halving. Some proponents argue that fees must rise to achieve a higher fee-to-rewards ratio to avert potential issues. For instance, as the block reward diminishes, bitcoin miners may grow less incentivized to engage in network participation, particularly if mining costs surpass potential rewards.</p>

<p>Reduced mining participation could result in a decline in hashrate, thereby increasing the network&#x2019;s susceptibility to potential attacks like a 51% attack. Larger mining operations may be the sole entities capable of sustaining mining activities, potentially concentrating power in the hands of a few. If smaller miners exit the market, there are two potential solutions to compensate for the lack of hashpower: either the price of bitcoin must increase significantly, or the mining difficulty must decrease by the same magnitude.</p>

<p>The 2024 halving will test the theories more than any previous halving. This time, the reward will decrease from 6.25 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to 3.125 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> per block after the halving. Following the halving, the annual inflation on the Bitcoin network will drop from the current 1.7% to 0.84%. If the hashrate declines due to the next halving, block intervals are likely to remain at the average of 10 minutes when the network difficulty adjusts to the lower hashrate.</p>
<p>Whether it&#x2019;s the 2024 halving or the subsequent one, there is a finite supply of 21 million bitcoins, so the low fee ratio may need to rise to compensate miners. To address these concerns, finding a balance between reducing the block reward and ensuring adequate incentives for miners is crucial for the Bitcoin network. This balance may involve factors such as transaction fees, network scalability, and overall adoption to maintain the network&#x2019;s long-term sustainability and security.</p>

<p><em>**Editor&#8217;s Note: This article was updated at 2:00 p.m. (ET) on Friday, July 7, 2023, with three additional paragraphs reflecting a statement from Digital Currency Group and a response to that statement from Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss. </em></p>
<h2>Gemini Proceeds With Lawsuit Against DCG and CEO Barry Silbert</h2>
<p>Gemini has proceeded with the filing of a lawsuit against Barry Silbert and DCG regarding the purported losses resulting from DCG&#8217;s alleged decisions. In a cautionary open letter posted on Twitter last week, Cameron Winklevoss <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/accept-the-best-and-final-offer-or-face-legal-action-geminis-cameron-winklevoss-tells-dcg-founder/">warned</a> that legal action would ensue unless DCG accepted the &#8220;best and final offer.&#8221;</p>
<p>“When Gemini notified Genesis it would be terminating the Earn program in October 2022, Barry reached out to set up a meeting to induce Gemini to continue Earn. He did this knowing Genesis was massively insolvent,” Winklevoss <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1677327397790666752?s=20">tweeted</a> sharing the lawsuit on Twitter. “Barry claimed that Genesis faced only a timing issue – a lie that hid the gaping hole on Genesis’s balance sheet,” the Gemini co-founder added.</p>
<p>Gemini Trust Company is listed as the plaintiff in the <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/jg6lo9a2ukvr/1xKyURWTEqN9ZgOZWMOsYw/05b3e97823d3e2534e1d4a06b2ec794a/2023-07-07_Gemini_v._DCG_and_Silbert_Filed_Complaint.pdf">court filing</a>, while Digital Currency Group and Barry Silbert are named as defendants. &#8220;This lawsuit seeks to recover from Defendants the damages and losses that Gemini has incurred as a direct result of DCG’s and Silbert’s false, misleading, and incomplete representations and omissions to Gemini, and Defendants’ role in encouraging and facilitating Genesis’s fraud against Gemini,&#8221; the filing alleges. The court filing further insists:</p>
<blockquote><p>This lawsuit is about fraud. The assets involved—bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—are relatively novel, but the fraud and deception committed by Defendants are all too familiar.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Digital Currency Group Responds to Lawsuit</h2>
<p>While he retweeted a post on Twitter on July 3, Silbert has not made a statement on the platform since <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1667664168520917000?s=20">June 10, 2023</a>. “DCG — and Barry personally – are direct participants in the fraud that has damaged Gemini and hundreds of thousands of Earn users. This complaint is an important step in holding them accountable for what they have done,” Winklevoss <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1677327417839349760?s=20">concluded</a> in his Twitter thread. At 12:00 p.m. (ET) on Friday, DCG responded to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is yet another publicity stunt from Cameron Winklevoss to deflect blame and responsibility from himself and Gemini, which operated the Gemini Earn program. Any suggestion of wrongdoing by DCG or any of its employees is baseless, defamatory, and completely false,&#8221; the company <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco/status/1677346741409173508?s=20">stated</a> in a shared message on Twitter. &#8220;From day one, DCG has remained committed to reaching an amicable solution for all parties to the Genesis bankruptcy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Senior DCG leadership has been working around the clock over the course of multiple months in active negotiation with representatives of the Official Unsecured Creditors Committee and Ad Hoc Committee to reach a deal while Gemini&#8217;s leadership was MIA or only issuing press statements,&#8221; DCG added in its defense. &#8220;To be clear, neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss have been involved in any of the recent in-person meetings. The mediation process is nearing a close and we expect to bring the Genesis Chapter 11 case to a conclusion soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tyler Winklevoss also <a href="https://twitter.com/tyler/status/1677364963684360194?s=20">replied</a> to DCG&#8217;s statement. “[DCG and Silbert] fail to address or deny a single assertion in our 33-page complaint,” Tyler Winklevoss said in response to DCG’s statement on Friday. “Exactly which parts are ‘baseless, defamatory, and completely false?’ The indisputable fact is that DCG and Barry were directly involved in misleading creditors as to the financial condition of Genesis.”</p>

The move came as markets reacted to June&#x2019;s nonfarm payrolls report, which came in at 209,000, below expectations of 229,000. On the other hand, cardano ended a three-day losing streak.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) rallied for a second straight session on Friday, as the token rose above a ceiling at $20.00</p>
<p>SOL/USD hit an intraday peak at $21.22 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which came in response to the latest U.S. nonfarm payrolls report.</p>
<p>As a result of the surge, solana hit its strongest point since June 5, when the price peaked at $22.06</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move came as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a resistance level of 65.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 68.30, which is its highest level since April 14.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance appears to be at the 70.00 level, and in the event it reaches this point, it is likely that SOL will hit $22.50.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) rebounded in today&#x2019;s session, as the cryptocurrency snapped a three-day losing streak.</p>
<p>After falling to a low of $0.278 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD jumped to a high of $0.2874 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move saw cardano rebound from a one-week low, as bulls reentered the market close to a floor at $0.2875.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts of this rally was the 14-day RSI, which bounced on its own support point at the 43.00 zone.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is now tracking at 45.25, a point that is marginally below a ceiling at 46.00.</p>
<p>Earlier gains have somewhat eased as a result of this, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> now trading at $0.2842.</p>

While the Multichain team has urged users to stop using the cross-chain protocol, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) told his followers that the incident does not affect Binance users or the exchange itself. </strong></p>
<h2>Users Told Revoke All &#8216;Contract Approvals Related to Multichain&#8217;</h2>
<p>Just over a month after the disappearance of the Multichain CEO known only as Zhaojun sent shockwaves through the crypto community, users of the cross-chain protocol were on July 6 informed of an abnormal transfer of &#8220;lockup assets to an unknown address.&#8221; According to a statement shared via the cross-chain protocol’s verified Twitter handle, the Multichain &#8220;team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating.&#8221;</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mysterious-disappearance-of-multichain-ceo-sends-shockwaves-through-crypto-community/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News on June 3, Zhaojun&#8217;s unavailability saw the router technology problems experienced by the cross-chain protocol cause disruptions to regular cross-chain services. The team revealed then that several chains including Kekchain, Publicmint, Dyno Chain, Red Light Chain, Dexit, Ekta, HPB, ONUS, Omax, Findora, and Planq had been affected. At the time, the team did not ask users to stop using the protocol even as rumors grew that Zhaojun had been arrested in China.</p>
<p>However, more than 30 days after Multichain&#8217;s problems came to the fore, the team behind the cross-chain protocol has told users to stop utilizing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain,&#8221; the team said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Multichain service stopped currently, and all bridge transactions will be stuck on the source chains. </p>
<p>There is no confirmed resume time.</p>
<p>Please don’t use the Multichain bridging service now.</p>
<p>&mdash; Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677180114227056641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 7, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Reacting to Multichain&#8217;s tweet, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) told his followers that the &#8220;hacking&#8221; incident does not affect users on Binance or the cryptocurrency exchange itself. He added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have swapped all assets out and closed deposits a while back. Regardless, we offer our assistance in helping with the situation.</p></blockquote>
<h2>&#8216;Attacker Is Probably Not a Hacker&#8217;</h2>
<p>While the Binance CEO has characterized the transfer lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address as hacking, a Twitter user going by the name Oxloki said their analysis suggests that the attacker may not be a hacker.</p>
<p>&#8220;The transferor has enough time. Considering the technical characteristics of MPC, the transferor may have completely obtained control of private key shards exceeding the threshold in some way. The &#8216;attack method&#8217; is very simple, it is a simple transfer operation, there is no contract, and there is a test, the attacker is probably not a hacker,&#8221; the Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/Loki_Zeng/status/1677141663867871235">explained</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a notice shared via Twitter, Kyber Network, a blockchain-based liquidity hub, urged users to &#8220;revoke all permissions and not use any Multichain service.&#8221; According to the team, Kyber Network is in the process of &#8220;disabling the bridge function on our UI.&#8221;</p>
<p>DIP Exchange, a decentralized exchange platform, <a href="https://twitter.com/DIP_Exchange/status/1677169418210803714">said</a> that while the latest incident on Multichain may slow it down this will not stop it from continuing to build.</p>
