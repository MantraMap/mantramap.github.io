Bitcoin dominance has been under 40% since Aug. 27, 2022, with a brief instance of rising above the 40% range 52 days ago, on Oct. 15.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Market Superiority Lost 41% in 35 Months</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s market capitalization has been above the $325 billion region since Nov. 29, 2022. At the time of writing, bitcoin&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) overall market valuation is around $328 billion, which represents around 38.3% of the crypto economy&#x2019;s entire $856,947,917,107 market cap.</p>
<p>The second leading crypto asset, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), on the other hand, has a market cap today of around $155.38 billion or 18.1% of the aggregate $856 billion. In the early days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market supremacy was above the 90% region from when it first gained value in 2010, all the way up until the second week of Nov. 2014.</p>
<p>Crypto market dominance, among the thousands of digital asset market capitalizations, refers to the relative size of the coin&#x2019;s capitalization compared to the overall market capitalization of the entire crypto economy. After mid-Nov. 2014, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market dominance slid below the 90% region but remained above the 80% range all the way until the first week of March 2017.</p>

<p>Essentially, during those early days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market superiority was 90% for 61 months and after Nov. 2014, it was above 80% for 33 months. However, there were a brief few instances in Jan. 2015, March 2016, May 2016, and Sept. 2016, that saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market dominance drop below the 80% region.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dominance has been lower than 80% for 68 months to date, and it&#x2019;s been struggling to hold the 40% range in more recent times. On May 15, 2021, and up until Aug. 27, 2022, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market supremacy in terms of capitalization had been above the 40% range which was around 15 months.</p>

<h2>Ethereum, Tether, and Dogecoin Market Dominance Levels Rise</h2>
<p>Today, it&#x2019;s been more than a solid three months of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dominance below the 40% range and dominance has not been this low since May 2018. From a logarithmic perspective, ethereum&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) market dominance, among all the other digital assets, has shown a significant rise since Jan. 2020.</p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> dominance increased 130.86% since Jan. 2020, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dominance gradually slid 41.96% in that time frame. From January 2020 until today or roughly 35 months, tether&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) market dominance jumped 285%, in comparison to the aggregate value of more than 20,000 listed crypto assets.</p>

<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> saw its market dominance grow by 440% over the last 35 months and usd coin&#x2019;s (USDC) dominance jumped by 2,500%. Like bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), xrp&#x2019;s (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>) market supremacy has dropped during the last 35 months, sliding 47% since January 2020.</p>
<p>Out of the top ten digital assets in terms of market valuations, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s dominance levels have seen the worst declines. The meme token dogecoin&#x2019;s (DOGE) dominance level, on the other hand, jumped 1,100% higher during the past 35 months.</p>

<p>There&#x2019;s a great deal of people who don&#x2019;t put much value into market capitalization and dominance data when it comes to digital currencies. For instance, a bitcoin maximalist would say that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s market cap is all that matters, and others may say that a meme coin like DOGE shouldn&#x2019;t be compared to blockchains that were not meant to be a joke.</p>
<p>However, many crypto supporters do believe market dominance levels offer meaningful data. Bitcoin and ethereum, for instance, can be viewed against their competitors as having high market superiority levels, which can have a significant influence on the market. More often than not, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s prices go up or down, alternative crypto assets follow the dominant crypto&#x2019;s market patterns.</p>

A strong dollar means demand for cryptocurrencies typically plummets, with the global market cap trading in the red as of writing. Ethereum was also lower today, falling as it remained below $1,300.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) continued to consolidate in today&#x2019;s session, as prices hovered around the $17,000 mark on hump-day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,939.92 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $17,109.38 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw bitcoin continue to trade under its recent resistance level of $17,180, which has mostly been in place for the last month.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the consolidation comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also remained below its own ceiling of 50.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is currently tracking at the 47.80 level, and seems to be heading to a floor at the 45.80 mark.</p>
<p>Should we see this decline occur, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will likely be trading at a support point of $16,800 in the upcoming days.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the red during Wednesday&#x2019;s session, following a false breakout of a key resistance point.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD remained below its long-term ceiling of $1,300 today, which comes as volatility in crypto markets heightened.</p>
<p>The world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency slipped to a bottom of $1,247.63, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $1,272.69.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, this took place despite the 10-day (red) moving average still somewhat trending higher.</p>
<p>Momentum seems to be slowly shifting however, with the RSI currently tracking at 49.56, which is below a ceiling of 51.00.</p>
<p>Turbulence in the market may continue up until next week&#x2019;s Federal Reserve meeting, where it is expected that the bank will pivot its current policy.</p>

Africa, where the cost of sending $200 averaged 7.8% in 2022, is the &#8220;most severely exposed to the concurrent crises.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Impact of the Appreciating Ruble and Weaker Euro</h2>
<p>According to the latest World Bank Migration and Development Brief (MDB), total remittances to the so-called low and middle-income countries (LMICs) in 2022 went up by 5% to $626 billion. The increase, which is lower than the 10.2% seen in 2021, came despite the global headwinds that have characterized much of 2022, the report said.</p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.knomad.org/sites/default/files/2022-11/migration_and_development_brief_37_nov_2022.pdf">brief</a>, the factors that contributed to the slower rate of growth in the U.S. dollar value of remittances sent to LMICs include the Russian currency’s appreciation, the weaker euro, as well as the scarcity of foreign currency in some countries.</p>
<p>Commenting on the report, Michal Rutkowski, a global director for social protection and jobs at the World Bank, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Migrants help to ease tight labor markets in host countries while supporting their families through remittances. Inclusive social protection policies have helped workers weather the income and employment uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such policies have global impacts through remittances and must be continued.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Africa Most Exposed to &#8216;the Concurrent Crises&#8217;</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, according to the MDB, Africa is the region “most severely exposed to the concurrent crises.” To illustrate, the report notes that while remittances to Sub-Saharan Africa grew by 5.2% to $53 billion, this increase is markedly lower than the increase of 16.4% that was achieved in 2021. In terms of the cost of remitting funds, the brief said the cost of sending $200 to the region is 7.8% which is the highest among the six global regions covered by the study.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Concerning the use of digital channels when sending remittances, the report acknowledges that while the cost of remitting funds via these channels is much lower, several factors still render them less ideal alternatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;Digital technologies allow for significantly faster and cheaper remittance services. However, the burden of compliance with Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism regulations continues to restrict access of new service providers to correspondent banks. These regulations also affect migrants’ access to digital remittance services,&#8221; the MDB noted.</p>

The machine was designed by iPod creator, Tony Fadell, and the France-based firm Ledger says the new device was built with “uncompromisingly secure architecture.”</strong></p>
<h2>iPod Creator Tony Fadell Partners With Ledger to Launch a New Crypto Hardware Wallet Called Stax</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.ledger.com">Ledger</a> has <a href="https://shop.ledger.com/pages/ledger-stax">revealed</a> a new hardware wallet that’s roughly the same size as a credit card. Ledger Stax also features an e-ink touch screen that’s customizable and offers capacitive touch. The France-based crypto hardware wallet manufacturer is well known for creating hardware wallets such as the Nano. Similarly, Stax allows users to secure their cryptocurrency assets and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in a EAL 5+ certified secure element-equipped setting.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-562823" title="Ledger Reveals New Crypto Hardware Wallet Designed by iPod Creator Tony Fadell" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-scaled.jpg" alt="Ledger Reveals New Crypto Hardware Wallet Designed by iPod Creator Tony Fadell" width="612" height="437" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-300x214.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-768x548.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-2048x1463.jpg 2048w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/stax5-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" /></p>
<p>The new machine was designed by Tony Fadell, an American engineer and former senior vice president of the iPod division at Apple. Reports <a href="https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E3DB123AF936A15757C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3">explain</a> that in 2001, Apple supported Fadell’s idea to create an MP3 player and online music store. That year, Fadell was hired to assemble and run the iPod and special projects division in April. Beside’s the iPhone, Apple’s iPod was one of the company’s most successful products. Fadell claims as far as crypto hardware wallets are concerned, he tested a number of competitors.</p>
<p>“Digging into Ledger’s proven security technology and trying all the ‘best’ hardware wallets out there convinced me to build a next-gen device with Pascal, Ian, and the amazing Ledger team,” Fadell explained in a press release sent to Bitcoin.com News. “We need a user-friendly…no! A ‘user-delightful’ tool, to bring digital asset security to the rest of us, not just the geeks,” Fadell added.</p>
<p>According to the press release, the Stax “battery can last for weeks or even months on one battery charge.” Further, Stax offers Qi wireless charging and a magnet array for magnetic stacking. The new hardware wallet leverages a USB-C connection to connect to a computer and Bluetooth technology so it can connect with Ledger’s mobile application. “The new user interface enables clear, intuitive interaction,” Ledger noted on Tuesday. The company added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Out of the box, Ledger Stax lets you manage your NFT collection and over 500 coins and assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Tony Fadell has both the circuit board and the billboard in mind when he builds a product,” Ian Rogers, the chief experience officer at Ledger said on Tuesday. “With Ledger Stax we have made a device which is cool, beautiful, and fun.” According to the hardware wallet manufacturer, Stax will be available to the general public by March 2023 and Ledger is currently taking pre-orders. Ledger also says that beyond the sale on its website, select retailers like Best Buy will also carry the Stax device.</p>

The Binance boss calls SBF &#8220;a master manipulator&#8221; and &#8220;one of the greatest fraudsters in history.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s CEO on &#8216;Wrong Narratives&#8217; About FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>
<p>The CEO of crypto exchange Binance, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), took to Twitter Tuesday to address what he called &#8220;wrong narratives&#8221; that he has seen recently about the collapsed crypto exchange FTX and its co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF).</p>
<p>The first narrative he addressed was &#8220;CZ wants to be the savior of crypto,&#8221; the Binance boss described. He explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto doesn&#8217;t need saving. Crypto is fine. It&#8217;s the beauty of decentralization. We are just part of it. We want to help other good projects that may be in a cash crunch because of recent events. It&#8217;s in our collective best interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second narrative is &#8220;FTX was killed by xyz (ie, a 3rd party),&#8221; CZ continued, emphasizing: &#8220;No, FTX killed themselves (and their users) because they stole billions of dollars of user funds. Period.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next narrative Zhao countered was &#8220;CZ&#8217;s tweet destroyed FTX,&#8221; the Binance CEO said, arguing: &#8220;No healthy business can be destroyed by a tweet.&#8221; On Nov. 6, days before FTX filed for bankruptcy, CZ <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-dumping-all-ftx-tokens-on-its-books-ceo-cites-recent-revelations/">tweeted</a> that Binance is dumping all FTX tokens on its books.</p>
<p>While Zhao has denied destroying FTX with his tweet, he pointed out that an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-18/ftx-s-point-of-no-return-was-ellison-s-tweet-trade-data-show">article</a> published by Bloomberg suggested that a tweet by Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison led to the collapse of FTX and caused investors to dump the FTT token. The Binance chief wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Caroline&#8217;s tweet 16 minutes after mine on Nov 6 &#8230; Data shows it was the real cause for people to dump FTT … She gave her floor price away&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Zhao also addressed some narratives about Bankman-Fried. One is &#8220;SBF had good intentions, but just made some mistakes,&#8221; Zhao noted, stressing: &#8220;Lying is never with good intentions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another narrative is &#8220;SBF perpetuated a narrative painting me and other people as the &#8216;bad guys,'&#8221; CZ added, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was critical in maintaining the fantasy that he was a &#8216;hero.&#8217; SBF is one of the greatest fraudsters in history, he is also a master manipulator when it comes to media and key opinion leaders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people have compared the FTX meltdown and Bankman-Fried to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-regulator-likens-ftx-and-sam-bankman-fried-to-bernie-madoff-and-his-ponzi-scheme/">Bernie Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme</a>. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last week that the FTX collapse was &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasurys-yellen-says-crypto-doesnt-have-adequate-regulation-calls-ftx-collapse-a-lehman-moment/">a Lehman moment</a> within crypto.&#8221;</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11 and Bankman-Fried stepped down as the CEO. An estimated one million customers and investors lost billions of dollars from the exchange collapse. The company is now being investigated for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-doj-investigate-ftx-regulators-suspect-crypto-exchange-mishandles-customer-funds/" target="_self" rel="noopener">mishandling customer funds</a>. FTX&#8217;s new CEO, John Ray, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-ceo-says-ftx-is-the-worst-case-of-corporate-failure-with-untrustworthy-financial-data-and-unacceptable-practices/" target="_self" rel="noopener">told</a> the bankruptcy court: &#8220;Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here.&#8221;</p>

SBF’s spokesperson further explained that the FTX co-founder is being consulted by a professor at Stanford Law School, David Mills.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Hires Attorney Who Represented Ghislaine Maxwell</h2>
<p>The disgraced former CEO of FTX, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> (SBF) is reportedly being represented by Mark Cohen from the litigation firm Cohen &amp; Gresser. Cohen is the well-known attorney that represented <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jeffrey-epstein-confidant-ghislaine-maxwell-reddit-post-bitcoin/">Ghislaine Maxwell</a> during her sex trafficking case. Maxwell, a close friend of the now-deceased and convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, was convicted on five out of six counts which included the sex trafficking of a minor. She was sentenced to 20 years in June and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-29/ghislaine-maxwell-now-faces-another-criminal-trial-for-perjury">still faces other charges</a>. Cohen is a lawyer licensed in New York and Florida and the now convicted Maxwell was also represented by Christian Everdell, the attorney that prosecuted the Mexican drug lord Joaquin &#8220;El Chapo&#8221; Guzman.</p>

<p>Cohen’s representation of SBF was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftxs-bankman-fried-hires-white-collar-defense-attorney-mark-cohen-2022-12-06/">reported</a> by Reuters after the news outlet was told the information by SBF’s spokesperson Mark Botnick. Reuters reached out to Cohen &amp; Gresser and “Cohen could not be reached for comment,” the news publication detailed on Tuesday. Botnick further disclosed that SBF was being consulted by David Mills, a professor at Stanford Law. SBF’s father, Joseph Bankman, is also a Stanford Law professor, and the San Francisco Standard recently <a href="https://sfstandard.com/business/sam-bankman-frieds-stanford-professor-dad-cancels-classes/?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20221205&amp;instance_id=79339&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=86022775&amp;segment_id=115063&amp;te=1&amp;user_id=64917b90392b88500b462854a74c61b4">reported</a> that the Stanford Law academic has canceled his previously scheduled classes at the university.</p>
<p>Semafor reported <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/17/2022/sam-bankman-fried-parts-ways-with-paul-weiss-lawyers">that</a> the 30-year-old SBF was represented by Martin Flumenbaum at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison but that relationship has since ended. The San Francisco Standard’s Liz Lindqwister and Anna Tong highlight how “SBF is surrounded by a star-studded and ever-changing team of white-collar crime experts and legal bigwigs.” This is despite the fact that the former FTX CEO has said he was down to $100,000 and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-boss-speaks-at-dealbook-event-says-he-didnt-knowingly-co-mingle-funds/">a single credit card</a>. He also <a href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1DXxyvQZzdnKM?s=20">detailed</a> in another interview that retaining a lawyer was one challenge he has been dealing with, but the <a href="https://sfstandard.com/business/who-is-sbfs-lawyer-a-stanford-lawyer-with-celeb-connections/">white-collar litigation firms</a> surrounding SBF suggest he’s had no problems seeking legal advice.</p>

<p>Cohen is the managing partner of his litigation firm and he operates the company’s New York office. The lawyer who represented Maxwell was also an assistant to the United States attorney in the Eastern District of New York. Besides Maxwell’s case, Cohen is also known for <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sec-insidertrading/sec-loses-insider-trading-case-against-new-york-fund-manager-idUSKBN0EA26Q20140530">winning a case against</a> the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that sought to prosecute a New York fund manager. Reuters report says that sources familiar with the matter have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/manhattan-us-attorneys-office-investigates-ftx-downfall-source-2022-11-14/">said</a> the SEC and “Federal prosecutors in New York” have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-doj-investigate-ftx-regulators-suspect-crypto-exchange-mishandles-customer-funds/">investigating</a> the FTX collapse.</p>

Bankman-Fried says he will testify when he has finished &#8220;learning and reviewing what happened.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Bankman-Fried Responds to Rep. Waters&#8217; Invitation</h2>
<p>The U.S. House Committee on Financial Services will hold a congressional hearing on the collapse of crypto exchange FTX on Dec. 13. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), the committee&#8217;s chair, has been trying to get former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) to attend the hearing. However, instead of issuing a subpoena for him to testify, Waters politely asked him on Twitter Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;We appreciate that you&#8217;ve been candid in your discussions about what happened at FTX. Your willingness to talk to the public will help the company&#8217;s customers, investors, and others. To that end, we would welcome your participation in our hearing on the 13th,&#8221; she <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/maxine-waters-criticized-for-praising-sbf-lawmaker-says-we-appreciate-that-youve-been-candid/">tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried responded to Waters on Twitter Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain. I&#8217;m not sure that will happen by the 13th. But when it does, I will testify.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Waters Insists SBF Must Attend Next Week&#8217;s Hearing</h2>
<p>Congresswoman Waters responded to Bankman-Fried Monday: &#8220;Based on your role as CEO and your media interviews over the past few weeks, it&#8217;s clear to us that the information you have thus far is sufficient for testimony.&#8221; In a follow-up tweet, she wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>As you know, the collapse of FTX has harmed over one million people. Your testimony would not only be meaningful to members of Congress, but is also critical to the American people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Waters stressed: &#8220;It is imperative that you attend our hearing on the 13th, and we are willing to schedule continued hearings if there is more information to be shared later.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bankman-Fried has not replied to Waters further.</p>

<p>Many people on social media criticized Waters for her politeness towards Bankman-Fried. A number of people urged the lawmaker to stop asking SBF nicely on social media and issue a subpoena to force him to testify.</p>
<p>However, some suspect that Waters is polite to Bankman-Fried because the former FTX boss was the second-largest donor to the Democratic Party during the 2021-22 election cycle. According to Opensecrets, he donated $39,884,256 to Democrats before FTX imploded and had to file for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/" target="_self" rel="noopener">bankruptcy</a>. However, Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-suspects-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-donated-over-1-billion-to-support-democrats/" target="_self" rel="noopener">believes</a> that SBF&#8217;s actual support to Democrats was over $1 billion.</p>

<h2>Brian Armstrong on SBF&#8217;s &#8216;Accounting Error&#8217; Claim</h2>
<p>The CEO of the Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), Brian Armstrong, has slammed FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) for blaming his collapsed exchange&#8217;s $8 billion hole on an &#8220;accounting error.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried was asked in an interview with Bloomberg, published Friday, how he &#8220;misplaced $8 billion.&#8221; The former FTX boss replied: &#8220;Misaccounted.&#8221; He further explained that FTX customers sometimes wired money to his trading firm, Alameda Research, instead of sending it directly to FTX. The crypto exchange&#8217;s internal accounting system then double-counted the money, crediting it to both the exchange and the customers.</p>
<p>Many people do not believe Bankman-Fried&#8217;s excuse, including the CEO of Coinbase. Armstrong tweeted Saturday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t care how messy your accounting is (or how rich you are) — you&#8217;re definitely going to notice if you find an extra $8B to spend.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Even the most gullible person should not believe Sam&#8217;s claim that this was an accounting error,&#8221; the Coinbase executive stressed.</p>

<p>Armstrong emphasized in a follow-up tweet:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s stolen customer money used in his hedge fund, plain and simple.</p></blockquote>
<p>While most people in the crypto space agree with the Coinbase boss and believe that Bankman-Fried should go to jail for what he&#8217;s done, there are some people who refuse to admit that SBF is a fraud.</p>
<p>Shark Tank star <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-slammed-for-saying-hed-back-former-ftx-ceo-again-insists-sbf-is-a-brilliant-crypto-trader/">Kevin O&#8217;Leary</a>, for example, has insisted that SBF is one of the best traders in the crypto space and he would back the former FTX executive again if he has another venture. Billionaire hedge fund manager <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-bill-ackman-slammed-for-defending-sam-bankman-fried-i-think-sbf-is-telling-the-truth/">Bill Ackman</a> also said that he believes Bankman-Fried was telling the truth when he said he &#8220;didn&#8217;t knowingly commingle funds.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s &#8220;accounting error&#8221; excuse for FTX&#8217;s $8 billion hole? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="b0281f1c-2576-4820-9a4d-3447bd85a90b">It is the web 3 version of the iconic Japanese 3DMMO &#8220;Elemental Knights Online,&#8221; which won the &#8220;Game of the Year Gold Award 2012&#8221; in Taiwan and accumulated more than eight million downloads worldwide.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="3e6d3933-54d0-4d13-8437-e4163ee139ed">The new web3 release will introduce the trading of avatars and in-game items as NFTs &#8211; the Genso metaverse will consist of a 3DMMORPG and a Polygon-based economy. This fantasy world will be built around Genso&#8217;s governance token $MV, a token that has already achieved numerous milestones; a record-breaking 69,000 people participated in Bybit&#8217;s launchpool event, the fastest sell-out on Trustpad, and the Kickstarter hall of fame on MEXC.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="86875ef0-d0bf-41a5-b801-2db80c3eafb7">Known as a 3DMMORPG, it already has an active user base and a fully functioning 3D metaverse that allows users from around the globe to connect with one another. With this game, players <span class="issue-underline underline text-gray-darkest font-body decoration-2 underline-offset-4 transition decoration-primary-main hover:bg-primary-lightest" data-issueid="93bf96a48e346351c66f3a751d790548" data-testid="issue-underline:venture">go</span> to dungeons, defeat monsters together with friends, and interact with other players worldwide in real-time.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="7d20f3b2-7256-4df9-aef0-1458d5936b43">Skins for character avatars are NFTs and are referred to as Cosplay NFTs in Genso. Several top game designers have collaborated on these Cosplay NFTs, including Yoshitaka Amano, whose avatars are already available on the official marketplace.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="cd286d91-c4c3-486a-b024-e8e4e020bf2b">It is also noteworthy that the game&#8217;s in-game currency can be converted into $ROND, which is an actual crypto currency issued by Genso. The $ROND cryptocurrency is listed on the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="223a2b91-5e56-4757-a394-570795a53fdd">As opposed than most social games, items acquired through play can be taken out of the game at any time.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="d103d72e-2cb4-4cb8-8f35-199227c0b653">The game also offers players the opportunity to strategically equip themselves with weapons (NFTs) of optimal strength in order to defeat the monsters in each dungeon. The Genso community has already seen many users decorate themselves in their own unique style in order to attack monsters.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="2d0af8b1-52fb-493d-9b4e-e5b5e715cd30">The official release coincides with the opening of new shops at the renowned Genso Mall. Among them is Ledger, the world&#8217;s most renowned manufacturer of hardware wallets. GENSO anticipates an influx of new players who are unfamiliar with web3 gaming, so the Ledger shop will serve as a learning center for those interested in blockchain security and hardware wallets. In addition, players may purchase the &#8220;Ledger Nano Sword&#8221; &#8211; an in-game item offered by Ledger. A special GENSO collab Ledger Nano X will be gifted to the first 80 people who purchase the item.</p>
<p data-private="redact" data-wt-guid="b35be3fc-4ec4-4aca-a46c-1ea15944f97b">In contrast to many blockchain games that require an initial investment and a wallet connection, Genso is a free-to-play MMORPG. In addition to welcoming web 3 gamers, Genso also welcomes the vast majority of web 2 gamers.</p>

The ruling comes from a case over a dispute between a customer and a platform hired to sell a collection of tokens. </strong></p>
<h2>Hangzhou Internet Court Hears Case Involving Property Rights Over NFTs</h2>
<p>A court in Hangzhou, the capital of the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang, has reviewed a dispute between a client and a local digital art platform which canceled a sale of NFTs on his behalf. The user sued the company claiming the operation was terminated without his consent.</p>
<p>The platform, which issued a refund, explained that its move had to do with the inaccurate personal information it received from the plaintiff. According to its know-your-customer procedures, orders placed without real-name authentication should be canceled, an <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/WWnZAxqiIVJ-dHO90eoBVw">announcement</a> detailed.</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Internet Court said that NFT collections bear the characteristics of property rights such as value, scarcity, controllability, and tradability while the digital collectibles are virtual properties. In the statement, <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1599595886438658048">quoted</a> by Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu, also known as ‘Wu Blockchain’ on Twitter, the judicial authority also emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>The contract involved in the case does not violate the laws and regulations of our country, nor does it violate the actual policy and regulatory guidance to prevent economic and financial risks, and should be protected by the law.</p></blockquote>

<p>The court further elaborated that “as a virtual artwork, an NFT digital collection itself condenses the creator’s original expression of art and has the value of related intellectual property rights. At the same time, NFT digital collections are unique digital assets formed on the blockchain based on the trust and consensus mechanism between blockchain nodes.”</p>
<p>Therefore, the Hangzhou court concluded, NFT collections belong to the category of virtual property. It also expressed its position that the transaction in the case represents the business activity of selling digital goods through the internet, hence it belongs to e-commerce activities and should be regulated as such under China’s “E-commerce Law.”</p>
<p>Last year, the Chinese government launched a nationwide crackdown on crypto-related activities like the issuance, trading, and mining of digital coins such as bitcoin. While allowing NFTs to be issued, regulators tried to curb speculation with them. To avoid associations with the crypto space, they are often called “digital collectibles” rather than “non-fungible tokens.”</p>
<p>In April of this year, reports revealed that the popular Chinese messaging app Wechat is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-messaging-app-wechat-reportedly-suspends-accounts-linked-to-nfts/">suspending accounts</a> linked to NFTs.
