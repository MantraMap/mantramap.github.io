										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Nasdaq has refiled an application for a Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock with more details.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase will offer market monitoring for the ETF, addressing surveillance concerns.</em></li>



<li><em>Major financial institutions joining the Bitcoin ETF battle bring renewed confidence, despite Coinbase facing a lawsuit from the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to an <a href="https://listingcenter.nasdaq.com/assets/rulebook/NASDAQ/filings/SR-NASDAQ-2023-016_Resubmission.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">application</a> made public on Monday, Nasdaq refiled an application with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list an exchange-traded fund (ETF) by BlackRock that would represent the price of Bitcoin to include more specifics.</strong></h5>

<p>The exchange filed additional paperwork with the SEC indicating that Coinbase Global Inc. would offer market monitoring in support of the world&#8217;s biggest asset manager&#8217;s proposed ETF. The action occurred after the regulatory body said that issuers&#8217; first filings were unsatisfactory and lacked crucial information.</p>



<p>Fidelity Investments, Invesco, VanEck, 21Shares, and WisdomTree all amended their bids last week, as did a number of other firms.</p>



<p>Cboe Global Markets also submitted applications on behalf of major asset management Fidelity Investments and Ark Invest, both of whom picked Coinbase as its SSA partner.</p>



<p>According to the recent Nasdaq filing, the exchange agreed to a surveillance-sharing deal with Coinbase on June 8. Year to far, Coinbase has accounted for around 56% of dollar-to-Bitcoin trade on US-based platforms.</p>

<p>Based on a view of the SEC&#8217;s earlier judgments, the sponsor of a Bitcoin trust must engage in a surveillance-sharing arrangement with a regulated market of considerable scale to achieve regulatory approval.</p>



<p>Analysts believe that monitoring the crypto market will be critical to obtaining SEC clearance for a spot Bitcoin ETF. The monitoring might significantly minimize fraud and market manipulation, which were the primary reasons the SEC rejected about 30 spot Bitcoin ETF applications to yet.</p>

<p>For years, the SEC has denied such petitions, and there was a time in 2022 when most corporations hoped that the agency would modify its approach in the near future. But, the entry of big conventional financial institutions into the battle has sparked renewed confidence.</p>



<p>Last month, the government also sued Coinbase for failing to register as an exchange. Coinbase said in a letter filed last month in federal court in Manhattan that it will ask a judge to dismiss the SEC lawsuit, arguing that the regulator lacks the authority to pursue civil claims because the crypto assets trading on its platform are not &#8220;investment contracts,&#8221; and thus not securities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin&#8217;s price surpassed $31,000, leading to gains in the shares of crypto companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy.</em></li>



<li><em>The rise in Coinbase&#8217;s stock can be attributed to partnerships formed through Bitcoin ETF spot applications.</em></li>



<li><em>While crypto stocks surged, traditional equity markets like Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 remained relatively unaffected, indicating a perceived negative correlation between Bitcoin and conventional equities.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://coincu.com/199788-bitcoin-2nd-consecutive-week-of-inflows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> price surpassed $31,000 on Monday after a volatile trading week, which sparked excitement among crypto companies, sending their shares soaring.</strong></h5>

<p>Despite the news of filings for spot ETFs and speculation about whether the US Securities and Exchange Commission will approve them, Bitcoin has had a strong start to the week.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the BTC price is at $31,000, with trading volume up more than 57% in the past 24 hours. This is the 3rd time BTC has reached this price level in 2023.</p>

<p>As soon as BTC hit $31,000, the shares of crypto companies like <a href="https://coincu.com/198580-microstrategy-now-holds-4-6-billion-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MicroStrategy</a>, <a href="https://coincu.com/199344-coinbase-support-valkyrie-bitwise-btc-spot-etfs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, Riot Blockchain, and Marathon Digital saw impressive gains.</p>



<p>On Monday, shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN), which was designated as the market for surveillance-sharing agreements in the ETF applications, jumped more than 10% to more than $80. MicroStrategy (MSTR) had its stock rise by roughly 10% to $375.</p>

<p>The increase in the price of COIN can be seen as a positive move from each exchange&#8217;s partnerships extended through adjustments of Bitcoin ETF spot applications.</p>



<p>Cboe has been working with a number of providers, including Fidelity, WisdomTree, and ARK Invest, to finally get an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF authorized by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the meanwhile, BlackRock is doing the same thing with Nasdaq.</p>



<p>Cboe refiled after their petitions were denied by the SEC for failing to name the exchange with whom they were collaborating on surveillance-sharing arrangements.</p>



<p>The Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 indices, on the other hand, stayed essentially unaltered, underlining Bitcoin&#8217;s apparent negative association with conventional equities markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cryptocurrency spot trading volumes dropped significantly in Q2, hitting the lowest level since 2020. Binance saw a notable decline of over 10%.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC charged the exchange for operating an unregistered securities exchange, impacting the exchange&#8217;s market share.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance.US experienced a dramatic increase in quarterly volumes, surpassing Bitcoin and Ethereum trading with altcoins during the bull run.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Kaiko&#8217;s recent <a href="https://25446524.fs1.hubspotusercontent-eu1.net/hubfs/25446524/Kaiko_Research_Q2_Market_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, spot trade volumes decreased drastically in the second quarter, dropping to the lowest level since 2020, with <a href="https://coincu.com/198927-binance-custody-license-in-germany/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> plummeting over 10%.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151-1024x682.png" alt="Binance Drops Over 10% Spot Volume Market Share In Q2: Report" class="wp-image-199796" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151-1024x682.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151-768x511.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151-750x499.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151-1140x759.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-151.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Drops Over 10% Spot Volume Market Share In Q2: Report 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://coincu.com/196317-binance-is-under-siege-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> headlines in June when it initially charged Binance, <a href="https://coincu.com/197209-binanceus-now-reject-sec-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance.US</a>, and CEO Changpeng Zhao with running an unregistered securities exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency.</p>



<p>According to the report, Binance.US&#8217;s quarterly volumes increased dramatically, rising from $5 billion to $42 billion to $106 billion in only three quarters. Importantly, altcoin volume exceeded BTC and ETH volume combined over the duration of the bull run, which is quite rare for US exchanges.</p>

<p>Binance ended the previous quarter by reintroducing trading fees for the BTC-USDT and BTC-BUSD spot pairings, the report said. This, together with large SEC and CFTC cases, has resulted in the exchange market share of spot volumes falling from 64% to 53%. Its portion has gone to a number of exchanges, with Bybit and OKX faring the best in what is clearly a better market framework for exchange competition. Coinbase&#8217;s market share has fallen from 8% to 5.4%.</p>

<p>The report also mentions the USDT event temporarily fell to $0.995 in mid-June ahead of CoinDesk and Bloomberg publications revealing the stablecoin&#8217;s backing in 2021, which revealed that some money was in commercial paper issued by Chinese financial institutions. </p>



<p>The following chart depicts Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) for key USDT pairings, including those traded on DEXes. It suggests that there was significant USD selling on Binance exchange four days before the article was revealed and three days before USDT depegged, implying that bigger holders were aware of the upcoming news.</p>



<p>DEXs also facilitated considerable selling, with Uniswap V3 enabling $150mn net selling and Curve&#8217;s 3pool supporting $150mn net selling, divided approximately equally between USDT-USDC and USDT-DAI.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery with a net influx of assets into digital asset funds for the second consecutive week, led by Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto funds received $124.7 million in the week prior to June 30, following an inflow of $199.1 million the previous week.</em></li>



<li><em>Bitcoin dominated the inflows, receiving $123 million, while other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano also saw net inflows. </em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>While the cryptocurrency market recovered, there was a net influx of assets into digital asset funds for the second week in a row, with Bitcoin (BTC) leading.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a CoinShares report <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/digital-asset-fund-flows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> on July 3, all crypto funds received $124.7 million in the week before June 30.</p>



<p>After $199.1 million the previous week, more than $100 million in money poured into digital asset funds for the second week in a row, reflecting the market&#8217;s general sentiment.</p>



<p>According to the report, net inflows into cryptocurrency funds during the last two weeks were $334 million, or over 1% of total digital asset fund assets under management.</p>



<p>$123 million was pumped into Bitcoin funds by asset last week, representing 98% of overall inflows. The Ethereum fund received $2.7 million. Funds for Litecoin, XRP, and Cardano also had net inflows.</p>

<p>A short Bitcoin fund that bets on Bitcoin&#8217;s collapse has lost money for 10 weeks in a row, with $900,000 withdrawn. Notwithstanding the current bearishness for short bitcoin, the report states that it is still the second-best performing asset in terms of inflows year so far, with $60 million.</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s price increased for the second quarter in a row. The price of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency grew by more than 8% between April and June.</p>



<p>Once BlackRock, the world&#8217;s biggest asset management, Fidelity Investments, and others filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, investors grew more hopeful.</p>



<p>Bitcoin trade volume has increased by more than 60% in the last 24 hours. The coin is still trading for more than $30,500.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Archway, a Cosmos-based incentivized smart contract platform, has launched its mainnet.</em></li>



<li><em>The blockchain aims to reward dApp developers and validators with its token supply.</em></li>



<li><em>Archway&#8217;s protocol utilizes a value capture engine to calculate gas generated by smart contracts in dApps and distribute tokens accordingly.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Archway, a Cosmos-based incentivized smart contract platform, has <a href="https://twitter.com/archwayHQ/status/1675837247537704961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> its mainnet.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145-1024x538.png" alt="Layer 1 Blockchain Archway Is Now Live On Cosmos Ecosystem" class="wp-image-199785" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145-1024x538.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145-768x403.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145-750x394.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145-1140x599.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-145.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Layer 1 Blockchain Archway Is Now Live On Cosmos Ecosystem 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>The network intends to dedicate a part of Archway&#8217;s token supply to decentralized apps, with 25% going to app creators and the remaining 75% going to validators.</p>



<p>Developers that create apps using Archway, according to Archway co-founder Griffin Anderson, will have a major interest in the underlying protocol, similar to how validators and miners get paid for verifying the network.</p>



<p>On March 24, Phi Labs concluded a $21 million initial round of funding headed by CoinFund and Hashed, with participation from 1confirmation, IDEO CoLab, Figment, Blockchain Capital, Wintermute, Chorus One, stake.fish, Lemniscap, Cosmostation, and Hypersphere Ventures. The increased funds would be used to expand the company&#8217;s employees, create new products, and build up the Archway protocol.

<p>The Archway protocol, invented by Phi Labs, is considered to be an incentivized smart contract platform built on <a href="https://coincu.com/189300-cosmos-serious-chaotic-legal-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos</a> and paying developers. Its dApp developers will be paid in proportion to the value they generate. The value capture engine module, in particular, allows the protocol to compute the amount of gas created by each smart contract in the Dapp and immediately transfer the proportion of tokens gained via time distribution to the wallet address of each relevant smart contract.</p>



<p>For example, if a developer creates a stablecoin project utilizing Archway&#8217;s infrastructure, the network will give ARCH tokens to the originator every time a stablecoin is moved. Moreover, if a contract on Archway is called by another contract, both the calling contract and the originating contract will get ARCH tokens. This implies that if the stablecoin is utilized on another network&#8217;s dApp, both the stablecoin issuer and the calling contract will get ARCH.</p>



<p>There are many ways that project owners might use ARCH incentives to enhance the economics of minting, transferring, and burning stablecoins. Stablecoin issuers, for example, may choose to deposit their ARCH rewards into a reserve pool, and these ARCH tokens can then be utilized for specific DeFi transactions through issuance/transfer.</p>



<p>Earlier, on June 16, CoinList began selling ARCH tokens. Last year, CoinFund and Hashed launched a $21 million seed round for Archway creator Phi Labs.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>AzukiDAO&#8217;s governance token contract, AzukiDAO, was exploited due to a contract vulnerability, resulting in a 35 ETH loss.</em></li>



<li><em>The community proposed hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the founder of Azuki, accusing the organization of having many rug projects.</em></li>



<li><em>Jeremy Cahen, founder of Not Larva Labs, offered to help the Azuki community take legal action against the co-founder of Azuki Zagabond, who allegedly fraudulently appropriated over $100,000,000 from the community.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AzukiDAO&#8217;s contract vulnerability was exploited, causing a 35 ETH loss amidst the community proposing legal action against the founder.</strong></h5>



<p>Recently, AzukiDao&#8217;s governance token contract, AzukiDAO, was exploited due to a contract vulnerability. This allowed two attackers to make a profit of 35 ETH. According to MetaSleuth, the contract was paused because the signatureClaimed variable was not properly checked, which allowed for replay attacks.</p>

<p>The first attacker, 0x85d231c204b82915c909a05847cca8557164c75e has reportedly made a profit of 34.47ETH, while the other, known as chandog.eth has made a profit of 0.614ETH.</p>

<p>Previously, Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/199468-azuki-nft-floor-price-dropped-54-last-7-days/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/199468-azuki-nft-floor-price-dropped-54-last-7-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that the <a href="https://coincu.com/199658-azuki-elementals-crisis/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/199658-azuki-elementals-crisis/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azuki NFT</a>, one of the most successful NFT collections of all time, is going through a rough time with strong criticism from the community. The floor price of Azuki NFT has dropped by 16% at the time of the report.</p>



<p>Besides, Jeremy Cahen, founder of NFT marketplace Not Larva Labs, <a href="https://coincu.com/199572-azukidaos-lawsuit-zagabond-founder/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/199572-azukidaos-lawsuit-zagabond-founder/" rel="noreferrer noopener">said </a>he would happily help the Azuki community take legal action against co-founder Azuki Zagabond. Cahen also said that Zagabond and his team fraudulently appropriated more than $100,000,000 from the community. He would love to testify in court about all this and has full personal information about many of the team members involved in these scams.</p>



<p>In response to this, the community proposed hiring an attorney to assist in recovering 20,000 ETH from Zagabond and suing him. The proposal includes hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zagabond, accusing the organization of having many rug projects, withdrawing 20,000 ETH issued by Elementals from the team, and distributing it to the DAO to promote the growth of the entire Azuki community and provide rewards and incentives for artists, content creators, and builders. So far, the vote has exceeded the majority to pass it.</p>

<p>FTX has announced the upcoming launch of its customer claims portal, allowing users affected by the company&#8217;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy to file claims. Following a court order, the portal was initially scheduled to be launched on July 3, 2023, but has since been delayed due to revisions in the submission timeline. The firm has stated that the portal will now be launched in the coming weeks. Once the portal is open, clients will be notified via email and the official FTX Twitter account.</p>



<p>FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliated debtors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11 and November 14, 2022, respectively, in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On June 14, 2023, the FTX Debtors filed the Customer Bar Date Motion seeking to establish the deadline for customers to file proofs of claim and approve the procedures for doing so. On June 28, 2023, the Court approved the Motion.</p>

<p>The Debtors&#8217; Customer Claims Portal was created to enable users to file claims in connection with bankruptcy proceedings. The portal serves as a platform for users to file proofs of claims and access relevant information about bankruptcy. Customers will be notified when the portal is open and can access it via the official FTX Twitter account.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, FTX&#8217;s customer claims portal will soon be launched to allow users to file claims related to the company&#8217;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The portal was delayed due to revisions in the submission timeline, but clients will be notified via email and the official FTX Twitter account when it is open. The portal will serve as a platform for users to file proofs of claim and access relevant information about the bankruptcy.</p>
