<h2>Goldman Sachs Expects U.S. Inflation to Decline Slower Than Market Anticipates</h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs’ strategists, led by chief interest rates strategist Praveen Korapaty, warned in a note Friday that inflation in the U.S. is projected to decrease at a slower pace than what is currently being priced by the markets, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>The Goldman strategists explained that investors may be assuming that a sharp slowdown in economic growth would result in a more rapid decline in inflation. Moreover, they could also be more bearish about energy prices compared to what is implied by commodity futures. However, the strategists argued that these factors will have a limited impact on inflation, emphasizing that markets are additionally ignoring the potential for &#8220;delayed-onset inflation&#8221; in sectors like healthcare. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Although we expect further declines in inflation going forward, markets appear considerably more optimistic than we are about the pace of cooling.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-pauses-interest-rates-after-10-consecutive-hikes-committee-likely-to-raise-rates-somewhat-further-this-year/">paused</a> raising interest rates after 10 consecutive rate hikes at their Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week. Their decision followed the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reporting that inflation had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-cools-to-4-annual-rate-setting-stage-for-feds-decision-on-interest-rates/">cooled</a> from 4.9% to 4% in May — the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021. However, core inflation remains elevated at 5.3%.</p>
<p>While many people expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates soon, Fed Chair <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-us-dollar-decline-will-be-far-greater-than-yellen-warns-fed-chair-powell-clearly-worried-about-financial-crisis/">Jerome Powell</a> said at a press conference Wednesday that while “it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we’re talking about a couple years out.”</p>

The global investment bank cited the historical experience of when the U.S. overtook Great Britain as the world&#8217;s largest economy.</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan Discusses Future of U.S. Dollar Amid China&#8217;s Projected Economic Dominance</h2>
<p>Global investment bank JPMorgan’s strategists recently <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/dedollarization-dollar-dominance-china-yuan-economy-buck-greenback-currency-markets-2023-6">discussed</a> the potential impact on the U.S. dollar in the event that the Chinese economy surpasses the U.S. as the world&#8217;s largest economy. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), one of the U.K.&#8217;s leading economics consultancies, China is projected to surpass the United States as the world&#8217;s largest economy by 2030.</p>
<p>The JPMorgan strategists explained that even if China surpasses the U.S. economy, the USD is unlikely to lose its status as the world&#8217;s reserve currency immediately, citing historical experience suggesting that any transition would be gradual.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the U.S. surpassed Great Britain as the world&#8217;s largest economy in the latter part of the 19th century, the U.S. dollar is commonly perceived to have overtaken the British pound as the world&#8217;s foremost reserve currency only by the end of WWII,&#8221; the JPMorgan strategists wrote, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historical experience thus suggests that if China were to overtake the U.S. as the world&#8217;s largest economy around 2030, dollar dominance may persist even into the second half of the 21st century.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to JPMorgan, China is the only country that could replace the dollar and the U.S. economy in the long term. However, the global investment bank&#8217;s strategists believe that this is unlikely to happen, given the US&#8217; economic, technological, demographic, and geographic advantages. Furthermore, the Chinese yuan&#8217;s potential for growth is contingent on China easing capital controls.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the JPMorgan strategists reiterated the possibility of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-emerging-but-greenback-will-retain-its-dominance-jp-morgan-strategists/">gradual de-dollarization</a>, stating that the process could be expedited by either diminishing confidence in the U.S. dollar or positive developments outside the U.S. that boost the credibility of an alternative currency. A potential alternative to the USD is the proposed common <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-discusses-viability-of-brics-currency-says-pegging-to-chinese-yuan-would-be-first-major-step/">BRICS currency</a>. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the Chinese yuan will replace the USD as the world&#8217;s reserve currency. The chairman of Russia&#8217;s second-largest bank, for example, expects the yuan to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-yuan-to-replace-us-dollar-as-worlds-reserve-currency-says-russian-banker/">replace</a> the USD as the world&#8217;s main reserve and settlement currency &#8220;as early as the next decade.&#8221; A senior economist at financial services firm TD recently stated that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-yuan-euro-digital-currencies-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-td-economist-says/">largest challengers</a> to the dollar today are the euro and the Chinese renminbi. Economist Stephen Jen, a former Morgan Stanley managing director, expects a shift “from a unipolar reserve currency world to a multipolar world,” with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-predicts-shift-to-tripolar-reserve-currency-world-yuan-euro-to-disrupt-us-dollars-dominance/">the Chinese yuan, the euro, and the U.S. dollar</a> forming a “tripolar” reserve currency configuration.</p>

<h2>From Bitcoin to Ethereum: Ethscriptions Take Center Stage in Crypto Community</h2>
<p>This weekend crypto enthusiasts have been discussing a new technology that is similar to Bitcoin&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-records-over-12-million-ordinal-inscriptions-miners-accumulate-46-million-as-brc20-market-cap-declines/">Ordinal inscriptions</a> except this idea leverages the Ethereum blockchain. The new concept is called Ethscriptions and it was created by the co-founder of the Capsule 21 podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers">Tom Lehman</a>. The Ethscriptions creator is also the co-founder and former CEO of genius.com.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>To ensure uniqueness, no previous Ethscription in a block or in the same transaction block can have the same content. Ethscription transfers occur when a transaction&#x2019;s input data is the hash of a valid Ethscription, and the transaction&#x2019;s sender is the Ethscription&#x2019;s owner. A file used for an inscription on the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> chain must be under the 96-kilobyte threshold.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The recipient of the creation transaction is the Ethscription&#x2019;s initial owner. The sender of the creation transaction is the Ethscription&#x2019;s creator,&#x201D; the Ethscription creator said. Lehman has also launched a website called <a href="https://ethscriptions.com/">ethscriptions.com</a>, which enables visitors to view all the Ethscriptions or browse them by address.</p>

<p>The website also facilitates the creation of inscriptions on the Ethereum chain. Since Lehman&#x2019;s launch of the concept, <a href="https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/status/1670063380726423554?s=20">thousands</a> of Ethscriptions have been <a href="https://ethscriptions.com/all">generated</a>. Ethscriptions can be <a href="https://twitter.com/adamamcbride/status/1669933433051553792?s=20">found</a> on Opensea, and the <a href="https://twitter.com/EmblemVault">Emblem Vault</a> team has enabled the trading of a collection of Ethscriptions on the non-fungible token (NFT) platform.</p>

The current custodians of the 3AC estate are now pursuing a daily fine of $10,000 against him for his non-compliance with the New York court&#8217;s inquiries.</strong></p>
<h2>3AC Co-Founder Faces Contempt of Court</h2>
<p>In July of last year, the crypto hedge fund 3AC, which is no longer in operation, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-embattled-crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-files-for-chapter-15-bankruptcy/">filed</a> for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection. The crypto hedge fund incurred substantial losses due to the meltdown of the Terra blockchain ecosystem. Additionally, significant losses were incurred from the fund&#8217;s large holdings in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p>
<p>One month before filing for bankruptcy, reports <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-three-arrows-capital-liquidated-for-millions-sources-say-crypto-hedge-fund-may-face-insolvency/">predicted</a> that the company could potentially become insolvent following liquidations that resulted in multimillion-dollar losses. As the bankruptcy proceedings and liquidations commenced, reports surfaced indicating that co-founder Kyle Davies purportedly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/3ac-co-founder-kyle-davies-fails-to-respond-to-liquidators-subpoena-despite-twitter-delivery/">neglected to comply</a> with court subpoenas.</p>
<p>The liquidation team and estate managers also served subpoenas to both Davies and co-founder Su Zhu <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/three-arrows-capital-founders-served-subpoenas-via-twitter-in-bankruptcy-process/">through Twitter</a>. “[Davies] is, without question, aware of the subpoena … having been tagged in 41 replies and 64 retweets … and has, once again, chosen to ignore his duties to Three Arrows,” the liquidators stated at the time.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/15/3ac-seeks-contempt-of-court-ruling-on-founder-kyle-davies-for-failing-to-respond/">report</a> by Jack Schickler of Coindesk on June 15, the estate of the hedge fund filed documents stating that Davies should be held in contempt of court due to his lack of response. The report also mentioned that the estate proposed a daily fine of $10,000 as a penalty for disregarding the requests.</p>
<p>In the court filing, it is stated that “Davies’s failure to respond is not due to an inability to engage with the court or any credible qualms with its jurisdiction. It cannot be clearer that the court can—and should— exercise personal jurisdiction over Davies, hold him in willful contempt of court, and impose sanctions.” Schickler&#8217;s report further states that a hearing to address the contempt request has been scheduled for August 8, 2023.</p>

Opinions on the matter are divided, with opponents of the idea expressing their reservations, while proponents are receptive to the notion of a revamped FTX 2.0. </strong></p>
<h2>FTX Reboot Sparks Twitter Debate</h2>
<p>Speculations are circulating about the potential revival of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">failed</a> FTX cryptocurrency exchange, despite its staggering collapse and subsequent bankruptcy proceedings. Notably, Flood, a prominent crypto enthusiast on Twitter with a sizable following of 216,000, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThinkingUSD/status/1670144111762894848?s=20">expressed</a> his willingness to partake in public discourse regarding &#8220;FTX 2.0&#8221; with its most fervent supporters. Flood disclosed his substantial FTX claim in the range of millions and expressed his current skepticism towards the revival, citing the scarcity of information provided thus far.</p>
<p>The grapevine is abuzz with rumors, speculation, and fervent discussions, all stemming from the recent reports in late May unveiling the efforts of the trading platform&#8217;s newly appointed CEO, John Ray III, in delving into a resurrection strategy for the incapacitated cryptocurrency exchange. Reacting to Flood&#8217;s tweet, a singular individual chimed in with a <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoken_board/status/1670147640384782338?s=20">reply</a>, “How exactly are you [going] to have FTX 2.0 when the token underpinning its AMM is down 95%?” Another person <a href="https://twitter.com/brandonbrown3d/status/1670204325241450496?s=20">wrote</a>, “FTX 2.0 won’t work. Terrible idea from new leadership trying to save their new job. Sorry, you lost that amount of money.” One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/chipflare/status/1670144326846885888?s=20">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t 2.0 proponents think it&#8217;s a little unethical to rope people back into ‘the casino?’</p></blockquote>
<p>The question has been echoing through the minds of many. “Will you trust FTX 2.0?” <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1667460665064271873?s=20">inquired</a> the Twitter account known as Whale Chart, only to be promptly met with a <a href="https://twitter.com/WhaleChart/status/1669462016451399682?s=20">resolute response</a>: “I will never support FTX 2.0. Probably controlled by the U.S. government.” Stirring further engagement, an individual initiated a poll, attracting a total of 547 active participants on Twitter as of 8 a.m. Eastern Time on June 18, 2023.</p>
<h2>Twitter Polls Emerge and 2.0 Reboot Advocates Come Out of the Woodwork</h2>
<p>“Let’s have an FTX 2.0 poll that actually produces useful data and isn’t click-baiting nonsense,” the person <a href="https://twitter.com/wassielawyer/status/1670302935073579008?s=20">tweeted</a>. “If you are a creditor &#8211; are you for or against FTX reboot? If you are not a creditor, would you use an FTX 2.0 (i.e. deposit new funds and trade given equivalent incentives)?” As of 8 a.m., the poll results painted a vivid picture of the sentiments among FTX creditors. A striking 49.3% stood in favor of the proposed idea, while 11.7% expressed their opposition. Interestingly, 8.6% of respondents, despite not being creditors themselves, eagerly anticipated utilizing FTX 2.0.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a notable 30.5% declared that they were neither creditors nor inclined to embrace the rebooted version. “FTX 2.0 is a terrible idea,” Scott Melker, otherwise known as the Wolf of All Streets, <a href="https://twitter.com/scottmelker/status/1667271228791439360?s=20">tweeted</a>. &#8220;There is no possible combination of 3 letters in the English language that will instantly alienate and terrify the mainstream, no matter how it is presented. Everyone associates FTX with fraud, and that perception will not change. Kill the idea,” Melker added. Wayne Vaughan responded and <a href="https://twitter.com/WayneVaughan/status/1667291775281537026?s=20">said</a> “Rebrand FTX to WTF,” while Bruce Fenton also replied to Melker and <a href="https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1667272396384903169?s=20">stated</a>: “It’s not worth very much IMHO.”</p>
<p>The clamor for an FTX reboot <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=ftx%202.0%20&amp;src=typed_query">continues unabated</a>, with a multitude of individuals passionately advocating for its return. Some fervent supporters have even gone so far as to add the moniker &#8220;FTX 2.0&#8221; to their Twitter names, serving as a visible display of their unwavering support. In the realm of Twitter, an account named the &#8220;<a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor">FTX 2.0 Coalition</a>&#8221; has emerged, wholeheartedly championing the cause of reviving the defunct exchange.</p>
<p>Sharing screenshots of sentiment polls showcasing widespread approval, the account confidently <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1665105492241252352?s=20">affirmed</a> on June 3, “The FTX brand has unexpected staying power.” Simultaneously, <a href="https://twitter.com/dgcryptonews/status/1667432698737041417?s=20">rumors</a> of the impending fruition of FTX 2.0 have gained traction, with whispers suggesting that it will operate as an offshore exchange, situated beyond the borders of the United States.</p>

<p>The total value locked in defi today is still above the <a href="https://defillama.com/">$42 billion mark</a> and $24.87 billion of that value is tied to Ethereum-based defi protocols. This means Ethereum&#x2019;s TVL dominates by more than 58% in comparison to the 195 defi-enabled blockchain networks recorded by defillama.com. Out of all the protocols, Lido&#x2019;s liquid staking platform holds the most with $12.69 billion and while nine out of the top ten defi protocols saw losses last month, Lido&#x2019;s is up by 6.75%.</p>

<p>The biggest loser of the defi protocol top ten was Makerdao which shed 16.88% in 30 days. One notable riser was Blur which saw a rise of 11.48% during the past month alongside Conic Finance which jumped 23.04% higher. While Ethereum <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">dominates by 58%</a> with $24.87 billion, the second largest chain in terms of TVL size is Tron with 12.65% or a total of $5.37 billion on June 18. Tron is followed by the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arbitrum, and Polygon, respectively, in terms of chains by TVL size.</p>

<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>)-based liquid staking derivatives represent $16.969 billion of the $42 billion locked in defi today. Approximately <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">9,745,831 ETH</a> is locked into 21 different liquid staking platforms as of 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on June 18. Most of the TVL action has been lackluster due to the top smart contract token economy taking losses this past week. However, the top smart contract token economy has risen 1.4% higher today resulting in a $315 billion market valuation.</p>

However, the BRC20 economy, experiencing a significant decline in value, has suffered the consequences of bitcoin&#x2019;s recent price plunge throughout the past week. </strong></p>
<h2>BRC20 Market Faces Decline as Bitcoin Blockchain Records More Than 12 Million Inscriptions</h2>
<p>As of the latest count, there are over 12 million Ordinal inscriptions linked to the Bitcoin blockchain, with the current tally reaching approximately <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/de20c9b7d7a74f0f1f2e5b88e08a903129742e56dd5341d7f8a95009c3d2997di0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">12,494,695</span></a>. This sustained trend has contributed to a backlog of more than 300,000 unconfirmed transactions <a href="https://mempool.space/">documented</a> by mempool.space.</p>
<p>On Saturday, bitcoin miners confirmed these types of transactions, as well as traditional financial transfers, accumulating a total of <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">1,737.50 BTC</a> valued at $46.10 million from inscriptions. Three days ago, on June 15, the total number of Ordinal inscriptions surpassed the 12 million mark.</p>

<p>Present <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">statistics</a> reveal that 90.7% of all inscriptions consist of plain text, while the remaining portion comprises various file formats such as JPEGs, PNGs, SVGs, GIFs, video files, software files, and applications. Out of the overall inscriptions, a significant 11,259,647 are composed solely of plain text.</p>
<p>While the count of Ordinal inscriptions continues to increase, the BRC20 economy has experienced a substantial decline in value. <a href="https://brc-20.io">Present data</a> from brc-20.io indicates that there are currently 34,296 BRC20 tokens valued at $141.97 million.</p>

<p>The BRC20 trade volume within the past 24 hours stands at approximately $25.51 million. Not long ago, this BTC-based crypto token economy was valued at nearly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/while-markets-consolidate-value-of-bitcoins-brc20-token-economy-has-risen-over-1500-in-39-days/">half a billion dollars</a>. However, the recent downturn in the crypto market has significantly impacted the values of several top BRC20 tokens.</p>
<p>For instance, the token ordi (ORDI) was trading at <a href="https://archive.is/mwZya#selection-275.0-275.6">$11.36 per unit </a>on June 3, but today it has plummeted to $6.263 per token. Similarly, the BRC20 token pepe (PEPE) was valued at $0.20 per unit on June 3, but it has now dropped to $0.050 per token.</p>

<p>Despite the considerable decline in the BRC20 market valuation this month, the number of BRC20 tokens has experienced significant growth, increasing by over 38% since June 3. Marketplaces such as Magic Eden, Okx, Ordinals Market, Ordswap, Ordinals Wallet, Open Ordex, Gamma, and Unisat continue to witness <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">active trading</a> of BRC20 and Ordinal inscriptions.</p>
<p>According to data from cryptoslam.io, sales of Bitcoin-based non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have decreased by more than 22% in the past week, totaling <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/blockchains/bitcoin">$21.49 million</a> in sales. The second highest-priced NFT sold during this period was Bitcoin-based &#x201C;<a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/uncategorized-ordinals/mint/8c0a0eeadc77481c862f800abd3000dff20d4585aa6e15c98279fda127353161i0">uncategorized Ordinal</a>,&#x201D; fetching $3.52 million.</p>

The firm urged users with assets on its platform &#8220;to continue to withdraw them via Wyre’s dashboard until Friday, July 14th.&#8221; A statement released by the firm said parties interested in acquiring Wyre or its subsidiaries should contact 88 Partners via email.</strong></p>
<h2>No Pressure From Regulatory Agencies</h2>
<p>United States-based crypto payments firm Wyre said on June 16 that it is winding down operations. According to a <a href="https://blog.sendwyre.com/wyre-operations-update-712a6d084229">statement</a>, Wrye’s decision to shut down was made in order to &#8220;protect the best interests&#8221; of its stakeholders and customers. The payments firm insisted that the move was not forced on Wyre by some regulatory agency.</p>
<p>The firm’s decision to wind down comes more than six months after the CEO Ioannis Giannaros denied reports the payments platform had shut down. At the time, Giannaros instead claimed that Wyre was scaling back.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Users Urged to Remove Assets From Platform</h2>
<p>However, in the statement announcing the payment platform’s shutdown, Wyre cited market conditions as one of the reasons why it was winding down. The statement also informed users of the next steps they should take.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have assets on the Wyre platform, you can continue to withdraw them via Wyre’s dashboard until Friday, July 14th. After then, we will have a separate process to recover assets remaining on the platform. We will post details on the process on our website and blog. We will share more information over the coming weeks,&#8221; the payments service provider said.</p>
<p>Wrye also instructed individuals or companies interested in acquiring the crypto payments firm or any of its subsidiaries to contact 88 Partners via email.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-firm-bolt-scraps-deal-to-acquire-crypto-company-wyre/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in Sept. 2022, Wyre’s woes seemingly started after the U.S. tech company Bolt abruptly pulled out of a deal to acquire the San Francisco-based crypto payments service provider for $1.5 billion. This was followed by reports in early January which stated that Wyre had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wyre-announces-modification-of-withdrawal-policy-pushing-topps-to-temporarily-suspend-nft-marketplace-transactions/">modified</a> its withdrawal policy in response to deteriorating market conditions.</p>

The central bank’s decision to allow the naira to &#8220;float&#8221; came a few weeks after Nigerian president Bola Ahmed Tinubu pledged to end the CBN’s multiple exchange rate regime.</strong></p>
<h2>The Naira Devaluation</h2>
<p>The Nigerian currency’s official exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar plunged to an all-time low of NGN634 per greenback on June 14. The naira’s fall by more than 30% came just days after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) denied devaluing the currency’s exchange rate to NGN631 per dollar from just NGN470 per dollar. The central bank’s decision to allow the naira to &#8220;float&#8221; also came a few weeks after Nigerian president Bola Ahmed Tinubu pledged to end the CBN’s multiple exchange rate regime.</p>

<p>&mdash; Central Bank of Nigeria (@cenbank) <a href="https://twitter.com/cenbank/status/1669650851105853442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Before the central bank’s apparent devaluation of the naira, the Nigerian apex bank had kept the naira-to-dollar exchange rate under NGN500:USD1 for more than a year. During the same period, the naira’s exchange rate ranged between NGN600 and NGN800 per dollar. During this period the CBN is reported to have repeatedly rejected calls to devalue the naira.</p>

<p>However, after Tinubu assumed office on May 29, some in Nigeria speculated that the CBN was on course to devalue the naira. For others, the Nigerian leader’s abrupt <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/security-agency-detains-nigerias-suspended-anti-bitcoin-central-bank-governor/">suspension</a> of CBN governor Godwin Emefiele proved that Tinubu intended to fulfill his inauguration day pledge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a June 16 tweet, the CBN attempted to explain to Nigerian residents and businesses why they need a flexible foreign exchange rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The I and E [import and export] market functions by a willing buyer willing seller system, where an entity with demand for FX seeks out another entity with foreign exchange to sell at an agreed price through an authorized dealer,&#8221; the central bank said.</p>
<p>The Nigeria central bank also said the country’s other foreign exchange rates regimes would &#8220;cease to exist.&#8221;</p>
