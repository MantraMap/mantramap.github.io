<p class="s5">Investors seeking massive returns in 2023 should consider Toncoin (TON), Conflux (CFX), and Tradecurve (TCRV). Specifically, Tradecurve (TCRV), a new hybrid exchange token, is set to reward investors with 50x gains.</p>

● Toncoin gains the backing of popular hardware wallet SafePal

<p class="s10">Toncoin gains the backing of popular hardware wallet SafePal</p>
<p class="s5">Toncoin is a decentralised layer-1 blockchain that provides its customers with fast, transparent, and secure payment services, facilitating transactions with minimal fees and third-party applications. While the general crypto market was on a steady decline last year, $TON had a different story as the year wrapped up.</p>
<p class="s5">Capital.com reports that Telegram-backed cryptocurrency Toncoin (TON) rallied significantly as the number of wallet holders was on a steady increase in December 2022. Earlier, Toncoin made headlines as popular hardware wallet SafePal announced it would be the first wallet to support the coin. The announcement led to a surge in the token&rsquo;s price by around 8%.</p>
<p class="s5">Following data on Changelly, $TON has been in a good upward trend for the last 7 days, increasing by 13.5%.</p>
<p class="s10">Tradecurve introduces a challenger trading platform</p>
<p class="s5">Tradecurve is a new platform that allows users to trade a variety of financial assets from one account. It aims to give users the best trading experience while allowing them to enjoy DeFiprivacy.</p>
<p class="s5">Users on Tradecurve do not need to complete KYC. Once they sign up with email and deposit any crypto of their choice, they can explore other financial markets like stocks, forex, and commodities. Also, they enjoy high leverage, algorithmic trading, access to a decentralisedwallet, excellent customer support, exclusive deposit bonuses and level-up perks. Additionally, they don&rsquo;t have to bother about prevailing problems in regular exchanges like high fees, lack of transparency, limited asset class, regulatory issues, etc. This is because Tradecurve allows users to trade crypto and financial markets all from one account. And as a permissionless exchange, users can connect their wallets, deposit crypto and trade 24/7 non-stop. Furthermore, holders of the $TCRV token enjoy a discount on trading fees, staking rewards, and more. Interested investors can purchase the token from the ongoing presale and expect 50x gains as predicted by experts.</p>

<p class="s12">Conflux scales up with Zk technologies</p>
<p class="s5">Conflux is a public layer-1 blockchain designed to power dApps, e-commerce, and Web 3.0 infrastructure by being more scalable, decentralised, and secure than existing protocols. Recently, Conflux announced a new zero-knowledge (ZK) strategy in partnership with Accseal, a company that specializes in building ZK-accelerating chips.</p>
<p class="s5">This partnership aims to seek out the most advanced ZK technologies and solutions that can be integrated into the Conflux ecosystem. Also, the project will leverage this development to ramp up scalability.</p>
<p class="s5">Already, Conflux boasts a thriving NFT ecosystem, with over 150 enterprises minting and selling NFTs on the network. Now with ZK solutions, the number of NFTs will continue to grow exponentially and positively impact the token&rsquo;s price. Conflux (CFX) is trading at $0.296 as of press time.</p>
