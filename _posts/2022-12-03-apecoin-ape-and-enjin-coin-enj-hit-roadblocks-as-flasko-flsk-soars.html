<p class="s4">The cryptocurrency industry has been devastated by the negative downturn this year, with the second most popular crypto exchange filing for bankruptcy a few weeks ago. These events have made some investors doubt the viability of renowned currencies like ApeCoin (APE) and EnjinCoin (ENJ). New initiatives have responded to the situation and shined a bright beacon of hope due to sharply lowering costs.</p>
<p class="s4">One of these initiatives, Flasko, has attracted much interest and is presently in the second round of its presale.</p>
<p class="s4">ApeCoin (APE) To Soon Introduce Staking </p>
<p class="s4">Implementing ApeCoin (APE) staking is now the most vital driver for the coin. Horizon creator Horizon Labs has been focusing on the capability to stake ApeCoin (APE) these last few months. </p>
<p class="s4">Unfortunately, the unique weekly members of ApeCoin (APE) have been progressively falling over the past few months and haven't yet reached the currency's initial high. Even though ApeCoin (APE) is intended to be used as a transaction token in the APE ecosystem, its price is currently $4.10, and holders are jumping ship. </p>
<p class="s4">Enjin Coin (ENJ) Under Serious Pressure</p>
<p class="s4">Players may purchase game goods in various Metaverses and virtual worlds using the Enjin Coin (ENJ). It acts as a standard currency that users may trade for advantages in addition to being employed to buy NFTs. But, with the Metaverse not taking off like predicted, the Enjin Coin (ENJ) has also suffered. </p>
<p class="s4">The Enjin Coin (ENJ) is currently worth $0.3139, a 31% drop in the last month. This fall is a bad omen, and Enjin Coin (ENJ) holders are looking for another coin with more profit potential to add to their investment portfolio. </p>
<p class="s4">Flasko (FLSK) To Offer Substantial Improvements </p>
<p class="s4">While Enjin Coin (ENJ) and ApeCoin (APE) are waiting for broader Metaverse adoption, the presale for Flasko is advancing. But what does it offer? </p>
<p class="s4">Flasko presents an alternative investment platform that enables purchases of premium champagne, wines, and whiskeys which Flasko will create as fractionalized NFTs. The benefit of purchasing a full NFT over a fractional one is that you can get the actual bottle(champagne, whiskey, or wine) underpinning the NFT. </p>
<p class="s4">When we mention Flasko, we also must mention security. Flasko excels with an audit complete through Solid Proof and locked liquidity for 33 years; these are significant measures to prevent rug-pull scares! </p>
<p class="s4">Flasko is relatively young but has reached Stage Two in just a blink of an eye. And with a current price of just $0.099, we can see why interest keeps growing. Buying early will bring you more profits in the future. And that notion is true, with crypto experts predicting a 4,000% surgeand a price of $4 by May 2023. </p>
