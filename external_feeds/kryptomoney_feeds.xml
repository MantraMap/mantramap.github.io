										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an emerging player in the rapidly evolving financial landscape, blockbank is spearheading an integration of the best features of traditional banking, decentralized finance (DeFi), and centralized finance (CeFi) into a single platform. This groundbreaking approach addresses inefficiencies in conventional banking and complexity in DeFi while also emulating the structure and security of CeFi, aiming to fill gaps in each system while capitalizing on their strengths.</p>
<p>blockbank’s unique amalgamation promises a revolutionary shift in our interaction with <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ncfa-and-kabn-na-announced-a-collaborative-partnership/">financial systems,</a> creating a more transparent, and efficient financial infrastructure. By packaging these varied services into one application, it meets a wide range of financial needs and caters to both new and experienced users in the digital age.</p>
<p>With this fusion, blockbank enhances convenience, and security in the financial ecosystem. It offers users the flexibility to navigate between traditional banking, DeFi, and CeFi, tailoring their financial management based on comfort, risk tolerance, and specific needs. In doing so, blockbank signifies a considerable stride in the digital transformation of finance, truly placing financial control in users&#8217; hands.</p>
<p>Among its many features, the standout element is undoubtedly its native utility token, $BBANK. This token forms the backbone of the blockbank ecosystem, offering users compelling benefits through a tiered reward system.</p>
<h2>The Power of $BBANK Token</h2>
<p>Users who lock $BBANK tokens can unlock various reward tiers, each offering increased annual percentage yields (APY) and enhanced cashback rewards (up to 8%) for transactions using blockbank&#8217;s debit card. The structure encourages active user engagement, making $BBANK more than just a digital asset—it becomes a key to unlocking enhanced benefits within the blockbank ecosystem.</p>
<h2>blockbank (BBANK) Price Analysis</h2>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-65197" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-300x159.png" alt="blockbank Price Analysis" width="300" height="159" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-300x159.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-768x407.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank-750x398.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/blockbank.png 960w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>The current price of blockbank tokens stands at $0.0022, with a market capitalization of $880,000. Over the past 24 hours, the trading volume has surged by 99% to reach $35,416. Meanwhile, the circulating supply of blockbank tokens is approximately 400 million, which aligns with the total supply of 400 million tokens which means there are no more token unlocks.</p>
<h2>Looking at the Future: Exciting Developments on the Horizon</h2>
<p>blockbank has some exciting features in its pipeline that could potentially stimulate the demand for $BBANK tokens, potentially propelling its price upwards. The most imminent is the launch of the blockbank card, expected to roll out in the next two months. This development could spur increased usage of $BBANK, as users lock tokens to climb the reward tiers and maximize their debit card benefits.</p>
<p>Further, there are also rumors of a lending and borrowing feature being added to blockbank. If realized, this feature would solidify blockbank&#8217;s standing in the DeFi space, potentially driving further demand for $BBANK as users look to take advantage of borrowing and lending opportunities.</p>
<h2>Projecting Potential Returns</h2>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s delve into the hypothetical scenario of a $100 investment in $BBANK, assuming the token price eventually rises to $1. At the current token price of $0.0022, your $100 would get you approximately 45,454 $BBANK tokens. Should $BBANK reach $1, your initial investment would surge to a whopping $45,454.</p>
<p>This means you could pocket a 45,354% profit on your investment.</p>
<h2>The Path Forward: blockbank and Its Promising Prospects</h2>
<p>blockbank represents a significant evolution in the fintech industry, offering a complete financial solution that bridges the gap between traditional banking and DeFi. With the anticipated release of its debit card and potential lending and borrowing features, <a href="https://blockbank.ai/">blockbank</a> is poised to secure its position as a leading player in the digital banking revolution.</p>
<p>However, as with all investments, it&#8217;s essential to conduct thorough research and consider seeking advice from a financial advisor. The potential returns may be exciting, but it&#8217;s equally vital to assess the inherent risks. Only invest within your means, and remember the golden rule of investing: never invest more than you&#8217;re prepared to lose.</p>
<p>And last but not the least, <a href="https://bbank.onelink.me/s0LE/ddbitvnm">download the blockbank mobile app</a> or <a href="https://app.blockbank.ai/sign-in">access the blockbank application</a> directly from your browser. Get your KYCs done and start trading like a boss!</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cardanos-defi-industry-might-expand-rapidly-in-2023/">Cardano</a>, a well-known blockchain platform, has experienced an impressive surge of 91% in decentralized exchange (DEX) volume within the past week, as reported by <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs/chains/cardano">DeFiLlama</a> data.<br /><br />The DEX volume on Cardano has now reached a substantial $68.5 million, primarily driven by a notable increase in activity on Cardano-based DEX platforms, particularly Minswap. Minswap, which is the leading DEX on Cardano, witnessed a staggering weekly change of 99.72%.<br /><br />In terms of volume, Minswap accounted for the majority, with $6.91 million in the last 24 hours and $60.52 million over seven days. This impressive figure represents a significant 90.4% of the total DEX volume on the Cardano platform.<br /><br />While other <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cardano-defi-acardex-launches-car-nfts-grants-higher-opportunities-to-its-token-holders/">DEX</a> platforms on Cardano, like WingRiders and SundaeSwap, also contributed to the overall volume, their impact was relatively smaller. Despite the remarkable growth in DEX volume, Cardano&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) currently stands at $91.27 million, which only represents 0.69% of the combined TVL across all platforms.<br /><br />Ethereum maintains its dominance in the DeFi landscape with a TVL of $7.8 billion, accounting for 37.6% of the total. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Arbitrum follow suit with 27.98% and 14.67%, respectively.<br /><br />The surge in DEX volume aligns with a 4.6% increase in the price of Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, over the past week. This positive price movement, coupled with the substantial growth in DEX volume, highlights the growing interest and activity within the Cardano ecosystem.</p>

<p>In a surprising turn of events, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/chinese-law-enforcement-freezes-4000-crypto-bank-accounts-over-illicit-transactions/">Chinese</a> government appears to be shifting its perspective on cryptocurrencies and is now eager to explore the possibilities offered by related sectors. According to local news outlet <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23250778">The Paper</a>, the government has released a white paper aimed at fostering innovation and development within the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/how-web3-is-shaping-the-future-of-finance/">Web3</a> industry.<br /><br />Titled <em>&#8220;Web3 Innovation and Development White Paper (2023),&#8221;</em> the document was unveiled by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Zhongguancun Chaoyang Park). It emphasizes the inevitability of web3 technology as a future trend in the Internet industry.<br /><br />The white paper focuses on key research areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), XR interactive terminals, and content production tools. It also acknowledges the rapid growth of emerging applications like digital populations and collections.<br /><br />While recognizing the challenges faced in the development of the Internet 3.0 industry in Beijing, including technical capabilities, talent support, and legal norms, the white paper proposes policy changes to address these issues.<br /><br />Yang Hongfu, the director of the Zhongguancun Chaoyang Park management committee, revealed that the Chaoyang district plans to allocate a minimum of 100 million yuan ($14 million) annually until 2025 to support this initiative. Zhongguancun, known as China&#8217;s Silicon Valley, will play a crucial role in driving this ambitious endeavor.<br /><br />The release of the white paper has caught attention, given China&#8217;s history with the cryptocurrency sector. Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, expressed his interest in a <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1662334590332153868">tweet</a>, highlighting the interesting timing of the white paper&#8217;s release alongside the upcoming implementation of crypto regulations in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Recent developments suggest a potential shift in China&#8217;s stance on cryptocurrencies, fueling speculation about a policy change after years of bans. <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1661391542504902664">Zhao noted</a> that the state broadcaster, China Central Television (CCTV), aired a segment featuring the Bitcoin logo, which is seen as a significant event. In the past, such coverage has been associated with increased market activity and price surges.<br /><br />The CCTV segment showcased a Bitcoin ATM in Hong Kong, featuring a prominent blue Bitcoin logo and the option to <em>&#8220;Buy Bitcoins,&#8221;</em> further fueling speculation about China&#8217;s evolving perspective on cryptocurrencies.<br /><br />This news is significant, considering the profound impact it carries. In 2021, China implemented a major crackdown on digital assets, particularly mining, which had a substantial impact on the crypto market. However, the market eventually recovered, with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high in late 2021.<br /><br />Despite other factors affecting Bitcoin&#8217;s value, such as macroeconomic elements, the cryptocurrency continues to trade below $27,000 and is currently valued at $26,700.</p>

<p>TradeBlock, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), is set to cease operations, as reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-25/digital-currency-group-closes-tradeblock-institutional-platform?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google&amp;sref=3REHEaVI">Bloomberg.</a> <br /><br />A spokesperson from <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/digital-currency-groups-2022-balance-sheet-in-red-with-1-1-billion-loss/">DCG</a> explained that the decision to close down the institutional trading platform side of the business was influenced by the challenging regulatory environment for digital assets in the United States, compounded by the state of the broader economy and the prolonged crypto winter.<br /><br />CoinDesk, another subsidiary of DCG, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210105005308/en/CoinDesk-Acquires-TradeBlock-the-World%E2%80%99s-Leading-Crypto-Index-Provider">acquired</a> TradeBlock in January 2021. Following the acquisition, some aspects of TradeBlock&#8217;s operations were integrated into CoinDesk, while other components were spun off into a separate entity, according to Bloomberg.<br /><br />DCG has faced other setbacks this year, including the closure of its wealth management unit, HQ Digital, due to economic headwinds. Additionally, DCG&#8217;s subsidiary, Genesis, has encountered difficulties with its lending arm, which filed for bankruptcy in January. With a significant debt of $3.5 billion owed to creditors, Genesis has been engaged in discussions with capital providers to address the situation.<br /><br />Furthermore, Genesis has been involved in a dispute with Gemini, a former collaborator, over a missed payment of $630 million related to their Earn product, which enabled users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency investments.<br /><br />DCG&#8217;s other subsidiaries have also been impacted by various circumstances. HQ Digital, the wealth management subsidiary, was closed down in January, while Luno, DCG&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange, discontinued interest-bearing savings wallets in November 2022.</p>

This expansion comes in the wake of the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong&#8217;s decision to allow retail trading in cryptocurrencies, signaling a significant shift after a tumultuous year for the industry.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/crypto-exchange-huobi-announces-plans-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/">Huobi</a> Hong Kong, the new venue situated in the special administrative region of China, aims to be fully compliant with local regulations while offering customers a wide range of trading pairs and services. Upon its launch, users will have the opportunity to trade popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tron (TRX), and Huobi Token (HT).<br /><br />This venture marks the initial step in Huobi&#8217;s expansion plans, following a rebranding effort in November of the previous year, after being acquired by About Capital Buyout Fund. The company sought to establish its presence in the Caribbean market. Furthermore, Huobi intends to intensify its investments across Southeast Asia, Europe, and other regions, while simultaneously exploring strategic mergers and acquisitions to expand its ecosystem.<br /><br />However, Huobi faced a setback in its engagement with the Malaysian regulatory agency. On May 22nd, the Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM) issued a statement declaring that Huobi Global had failed to register as a crypto exchange operator, resulting in an order to cease all activities. Additionally, the SCM directed the company to disable its website and mobile applications available on the Apple Store and Google Play.<br /><br />Despite these challenges, Hong Kong remains committed to positioning itself as a leading crypto hub, amidst a broader industry crackdown in the Western world. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po reinforced the city&#8217;s dedication to cryptocurrencies during the Hong Kong Web3 Festival in April.<br /><br />In line with this objective, the SFC of Hong Kong recently released a<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/"> report</a> outlining policy recommendations. The report allows licensed virtual asset providers (VASPs) to serve retail investors, provided that operators demonstrate an understanding of the associated risks.<br /><br />Guidelines for VASPs will include requirements concerning asset custody safety, cybersecurity standards, and client asset segregation. All digital asset platforms in Hong Kong must apply for licenses under the new regulatory framework, failure to comply could result in fines and potential jail terms.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/trezor-and-ledger-announce-investigation-into-claims-its-database-is-on-sale/">Trezor</a>, a leading hardware wallet provider, has experienced a remarkable surge in sales volume, with a reported 900% week-on-week growth, according to a press statement released on May 25. This surge in demand comes as a response to the controversy surrounding Ledger&#8217;s seed recovery feature, which has faced strong opposition from the crypto community.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Trezor, a leading hardware wallet provider, has experienced a remarkable surge in sales volume, with a reported 900% week-on-week growth, according to a press statement released on May 25. This surge in demand comes as a response to the controversy surrounding Ledger&#8217;s seed recovery feature, which has faced strong opposition from the crypto community.</p>
<p>Trezor&#8217;s CEO, Mat?j Žák, emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to ensuring the utmost security and control for its users. He stated, <em>&#8220;At Trezor, we firmly believe that hardware wallets, as cold storage solutions, should never expose the seed phrase to anyone other than the user, ensuring 100% self-custody.&#8221;</em><br /><br />Trezor differentiates itself as a fully open-source company that subjects all its processes to rigorous scrutiny by independent technical experts. This approach guarantees that remote extraction of seed phrases is impossible and has never been implemented in their products.<br /><br />Concerns among users regarding Ledger&#8217;s seed recovery feature, as well as the associated online storage of seed phrases and the need for a know-your-customer process, have further contributed to the increased demand for Trezor wallets. The 2020 data breach experienced by Ledger has already cast doubt on the company&#8217;s data handling practices, leading users to question the security of their devices and seed phrases, even if they opt out of Ledger&#8217;s recovery feature.<br /><br />In response to these concerns, Ledger has decided to pause the feature&#8217;s release to rework the code and prioritize transparency and verifiability. During a recent Twitter space event, Charles Guillemet, Ledger&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer, outlined the company&#8217;s open-source roadmap. He revealed plans to expedite the process and make the white paper on the Ledger Recover protocol and the firmware that implements the feature publicly available.<br /><br />Amidst these developments, a security firm called Unciphered <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/crypto-security-firm-unciphered-claims-ability-to-physically-hack-trezor-t-wallet-1032349192">reportedly</a> claimed to have discovered a vulnerability that allowed them to hack into Trezor T&#8217;s hardware wallet. This discovery has raised concerns about the overall security provided by the wallet service provider.<br /><br />Trezor&#8217;s CTO, Tomáš Sušánka, acknowledged the existence of the RDP downgrade attack vulnerability in a <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/our-response-to-the-read-protection-downgrade-attack-28d23f8949c6">blog post</a> from 2020. Sušánka clarified that this type of attack requires the physical theft of a device and a high level of technical knowledge and advanced equipment. <br /><br />Furthermore, he stated that Trezor wallets can be safeguarded by employing a strong passphrase, which adds a layer of security that renders an RDP downgrade useless.<br /><br />To address these concerns, Trezor has taken significant steps by developing the world&#8217;s first auditable and transparent secure element through its sister company, <a href="https://tropicsquare.com/press-releases/tropic-squares-initial-testing-of-their-first-batch-of-prototype-chips-moves-them-one-step-closer-to-production">Tropic Square</a>. This further demonstrates Trezor&#8217;s commitment to providing robust security measures for its hardware wallet users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Amid a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N37M0MH">volatile period</a> in the cryptocurrency sector, European Union authorities have received recommendations from the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), an EU watchdog, to implement stricter regulations on leveraged bets involving crypto assets. The objective is to prevent potential shocks from the crypto sector that could pose risks to the overall financial stability of broader markets.<br /><br />The ESRB&#8217;s proposals encompass a range of strategies, including mandating regular reporting from all firms involved in crypto asset dealings and establishing specific rules for the largest players in the sector. This call for action comes as the crypto industry experiences significant price volatility, exemplified by Bitcoin&#8217;s staggering 77% drop and the notable decline of Luna, another cryptocurrency. The bankruptcy of FTX, previously known for its Super Bowl advertising, has further underscored the challenges faced by the industry.<br /><br /><em>&#8220;The emergence of systemic risks can occur rapidly and unexpectedly,&#8221;</em> cautions the ESRB in a report, emphasizing that the ongoing rapid growth of crypto assets could potentially endanger financial stability. One of the ESRB&#8217;s key recommendations is the implementation of leverage limits for investment funds exposed to crypto assets, representing a notable departure from recent EU regulations.<br /><br />In addition, the watchdog proposes restrictions on crypto firms&#8217; ability to lend tokens to clients, a common practice for facilitating leveraged bets. <br /><br />The ESRB also suggests imposing higher collateral requirements for decentralized finance products and stablecoins. Although the ESRB&#8217;s recommendations are not legally binding, they are expected to wield influence over the EU&#8217;s forthcoming efforts to refine its regulation of crypto assets under the Markets in Cryptoassets Regulation (MiCA).<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ecb-says-stablecoin-laws-must-be-enforced-with-urgency/">European regulators</a>&#8216; push for stricter crypto regulations reflects concerns that a potential economic downturn in traditional markets may drive more investors toward the crypto market, necessitating a robust regulatory framework to safeguard financial stability. These proposed changes, aimed at preserving market stability, demonstrate a cautious and proactive approach from European regulators to managing the dynamic and volatile crypto market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The forex trading industry has seen a massive surge in the number of users. More and more people are diving into the world of trading currencies, hoping to strike it big. It&#8217;s like the whole world is hooked on forex. So why would you miss a chance? In this article, we are going to talk about two important ways to take part in forex trading if your dream is to become a forex broker and start your business!</p>
<h2>What is White Label?</h2>
<p>A White Label business partners up with an existing forex brokerage firm. They have a special <a href="https://fxview.com/whitelabel">agreement</a> with the brokerage that allows them to use the broker&#8217;s trading platform and liquidity but under their own brand. They have more control and freedom to make their mark. They can put their logo on the trading platform, decide the amount of spread (the difference between buying and selling prices), and manage their clients. Let’s find the advantages and disadvantages of a White Label forex Solution.</p>
<h3>Pros:</h3>
<h4>Cost Effective</h4>
<p>Cost-effectiveness means getting the most out of what you spend. White-label forex brokerage is affordable compared to starting as an independent forex broker, where you need a larger amount of capital upfront. With a white-label forex brokerage, you can enjoy the benefits of a ready-made platform and infrastructure without the hefty price tag. Instead of building everything from scratch, you partner with an established broker who provides you with their technology, trading software, back-office support and other forex tools, which can come in handy for your clients. The upfront investment is significantly lower, allowing you to allocate your resources more efficiently.</p>
<h4>Quick to Get Started</h4>
<p>Becoming a white-label <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/mastercards-crypto-head-security-and-simplicity-vital-for-blockchain-full-potential/">forex</a> broker requires minimal effort on your part, so you can hit the ground running in no time. Instead of going through all the painstaking steps of building your own brokerage from scratch, you team up with an established broker and get access to a ready-made platform with all the bells and whistles, top-notch trading software, and even support from the back-office wizards. Basically, with a white-label solution, you can bypass all the time-consuming tasks that come with starting from scratch.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to worry about dealing with complicated regulations, building your own trading platform, or finding banking partners. Moreover, you won&#8217;t be scratching your head over coding or software configurations. Nope, none of that! The whole process is designed to be smooth and hassle-free. You sign up with a primary broker who offers a white-label solution, and they take care of all the technical mumbo jumbo for you. You will get the same trading platforms that they offer, so in case the broker offers MT4 and MT5, then you can <a href="https://fxview.com/mt5">offer</a> the same platforms to your clients. Some primary brokers offer lightning-fast onboarding, where you can go from signing up to trading within just a few weeks. That&#8217;s right &#8211; weeks, not months or years! You don&#8217;t have to wait for ages to start making those forex moves.</p>
<h4>Flexibility</h4>
<p>You have the freedom to customise and establish your own platform according to your preferences. How awesome is that? You get to create a unique brand image that&#8217;ll draw traders to your Forex platform, setting you on the path to building a loyal customer base. You can customise your Forex platform by choosing the colours, the logo, and even the layout to reflect your brand&#8217;s personality. Whether you want it to be sleek and professional or vibrant and exciting, it&#8217;s up to you! You set yourself apart from other brokers by building a unique brand image.</p>
<h4>Guidance and Support</h4>
<p>The primary broker has already been around the forex block and knows the ins and outs of the business. They&#8217;ve got the experience and knowledge to guide you through the process, ensuring you&#8217;re on the right track. Some primary brokers go the extra mile and offer training programs as part of their white-label forex solution. These programs are designed to give you the skills and know-how you need to succeed. You&#8217;ll learn from the experts themselves, following in their footsteps as they share their industry secrets and strategies.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<h3>Brand Establishment is Time-consuming</h3>
<p>Establishing a brand name takes time and effort. Traders tend to lean towards well-known brand names when choosing a forex broker. They want to feel secure and confident in their choice. If you&#8217;re a fresh-faced broker entering the scene, it might take a little while to win the trust and attention of traders. By showcasing what makes your platform unique, offering exceptional services, or providing enticing promotions, you can grab the attention of traders and build your brand faster than you&#8217;d expect. You&#8217;ll need to come up with ideas that make traders go, &#8220;Wow, this is something different!&#8221;</p>
<h4>Limited Control</h4>
<p>When you opt for a white-label setup, a parent organisation (the boss, if you will) offers the core services. They call the shots on certain key aspects, and you need full control over them. The parent organisation decides things like which financial assets can be traded or the operational times. It means you don&#8217;t have complete freedom to shape every aspect of your Forex business. You&#8217;ll need to abide by the rules and limitations the parent organisation sets.</p>
<h2>What is an Introducing Broker (IB)?</h2>
<p>An Introducing Broker, or IB for short, is like a middle person that helps connect traders with the main broker. As an IB, you&#8217;re an independent agent working with the main broker. Your job is to find traders who are interested in trading with your main broker, and you guide them through the sign-up process.  However, the main broker handles everything else, like transactions and technology. They have the expertise and resources to take care of all the details.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<h4>Opportunity to Build Connections</h4>
<p>When you become an IB broker, you&#8217;re opening the door to a world of exciting prospects and building valuable contacts. It&#8217;s like your debut into the industry, and trust me, it&#8217;s a big deal! This path offers you a lucrative opportunity to establish yourself with a solid client base, connect with investment managers, and even rub shoulders with the big shots in the industry. Building your contact base is like laying the foundation for long-term success. Those connections you make as an IB broker can tremendously impact your future career. They&#8217;re like stepping stones that lead to greater opportunities and bigger achievements down the road.</p>
<h4>No Strict Requirements</h4>
<p>The essential requirements for IB are way fewer compared to a regular brokerage. Regular brokerages have to invest big bucks in all sorts of technical requirements to keep things running smoothly. But as an IB broker, you get to skip all that.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<h4>Irregular Incomes</h4>
<p>Your main source of income as an IB broker comes from commissions. Therefore, your earnings as an IB can be a bit unpredictable. When you successfully enrol clients with your parent brokerage partner, you earn a commission based on their trading activities. The more trades they make, the more money they can make. It&#8217;s like a partnership where your income is tied to your trading success. It can be inconsistent at times. Some months you see a surge in commissions, while others might not be as booming.</p>
<h4>No Individual Identity</h4>
<p>One of the biggest concerns is that you&#8217;re seen as an extension of the parent brokerage rather than a standalone player. As an IB broker, you&#8217;re kind of hitching a ride on someone else&#8217;s success train. You don&#8217;t have your own logo or office. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re borrowing someone else&#8217;s brand and reputation. Without your own identity and infrastructure, it&#8217;s hard to carve out your own path in the industry.<br />
Key Differences Between WL &amp; IB?</p>
<p>As an IB, you&#8217;re like the middle person between the existing broker and the traders. You need to have your own brand identity or full control over your clients. On the other hand, White Labels are proper businesses with more independence and control. You have the freedom to build your own brand and have your own brokerage infrastructure.</p>
<p>As an IB, you must follow the rules and regulations set by the brokerage firm you&#8217;re working with. You&#8217;re bound by their terms and conditions. You need more freedom to decide things on your own when it comes to dealing with traders. As a WLB, you can manage your own relationships with the traders. You have the power to set your own terms and conditions.</p>
<p>As an IB, your income depends on the number of successful referrals you make to the broker firm. You get a reward for each referral, but it&#8217;s based on the pre-decided terms. It&#8217;s like a commission-based gig, my friend. On the other hand, WLBs have different earning games. Your income as a WLB depends on the magnitude of trading done by the traders through your firm. The more they trade, the more potential earnings you have.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Introducing Broker (IB) and White Label (WL) work to bring in new clients who will trade on the Main Broker&#8217;s platform. Both IB and WL rely on the trading volumes of their clients. The more those clients trade, the more revenue the broker earns. The success of an IB or WL depends on how active their clients are. When clients trade more frequently and in larger volumes, it means more profits for the broker. And when the broker makes money, it also means success for the IB or WL partner.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/mastercard-and-binance-jointly-introduce-new-prepaid-card-in-brazil/">Mastercard</a>, a global leader in the financial industry, is confident that crypto and blockchain technology can deliver significant value to financial sectors once they address the fundamental challenges of security and simplicity. Raj Dhamodharan, Executive Vice President and Head of Crypto and Blockchain at Mastercard, emphasized this<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/mastercard-blockchain-crypto/?tpcc=tcplustwitter&amp;guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jcnlwdG9zbGF0ZS5jb20v&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAD4Bn4I9ub1n4eNn8yb63N4JyFF3bFYGJzCvVUX4IG18tzpqmlMZYmShj-Aqos4J1OXbMsb4S_Ctt_b_UnbPaINUgjl5THBwHE_kT1a_34MXRz2eEMN1TIPhJumtZ6GU2BsNZu_FXSDOb6a9FAAfcPaDeG6kgE83n5ngp6FPxaWB"> viewpoint</a> during a blockchain-focused panel at Mastercard&#8217;s North America Innovation Day on May 23.<br /><br />Dhamodharan acknowledged that crypto and blockchain technology has been gaining increasing global traction. However, their current use cases are limited due to insufficient security measures and complex user interactions. He stressed the criticality of establishing trust in the blockchain ecosystem, stating that resolving these issues would boost confidence among brands and companies, leading to increased engagement with the web3 industry.<br /><br />Highlighting the technology&#8217;s untapped potential, Dhamodharan mentioned that while many perceive crypto primarily as an investment opportunity, the technology itself holds significant promise beyond its role in capital movement and storage.<br /><br />Johan Berger, Mastercard&#8217;s EVP of Security and Cyber Innovation, echoed Dhamodharan&#8217;s sentiments during the panel, stating that the global scalability of the technology depends on interoperability and a secure foundation of trust. Mastercard has been among the first traditional financial institutions to actively engage with the crypto industry.<br /><br />Over the years, the company has expanded its range of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/paypal-partners-with-paxos-to-offer-crypto-services-to-325-million-customers/">crypto services</a> through partnerships with industry players such as Binance, Gemini, and Paxos. Many exchanges offer debit and credit cards powered by Mastercard. Additionally, Mastercard is actively involved in assisting governments in their exploration of central bank digital currencies and the underlying payment infrastructure.<br /><br />Dhamodharan, who joined Mastercard in 2010 and assumed the role of head of the crypto division in 2019, has spearheaded the company&#8217;s ambitious foray into the crypto space. He considers the industry an opportunity rather than a threat to Mastercard&#8217;s dominance in the payments sector.<br /><br />In a 2022 interview with Protocol, Dhamodharan expressed that Mastercard doesn&#8217;t perceive crypto as a threat, emphasizing the maturity cycles of various crypto technologies, with crypto as an investment asset class being the most mature. He also highlighted that Mastercard ventured into crypto due to customer demand for purchasing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and the company intends to provide a secure avenue for users to engage with crypto.</p>

<p>In a remarkable feat for the XRP ecosystem, the XRP Ledger has recently achieved the closure of an impressive 80 million ledgers in approximately 10.5 years, as reported by <a href="https://twitter.com/xrpscan/status/1661441862656294921">XRPScan</a>, a renowned blockchain explorer dedicated to the XRP Ledger. For those unfamiliar with the term, a ledger serves as a comprehensive record of transactions within a blockchain network.<br /><br />This milestone serves as a testament to the rapidity, dependability, and increasing popularity of the XRP ledger as a groundbreaking technology for processing transactions on the Ripple network. Launched in December 2012, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-ledger-records-impressive-growth-in-q1/">XRP Ledger</a> (also known as XRPL) has played a pivotal role in enabling real-time, cross-border payments. As an open-source and decentralized blockchain technology, it offers a seamless solution for fast and cost-effective international transactions.<br /><br />The XRPL empowers individuals to effortlessly send any currency to anyone around the globe within a matter of seconds, making it an ideal choice for cross-border transactions. While the XRP ledger has received accolades for its speed and low transaction fees, it has also faced scrutiny regarding its level of centralization.<br /><br />Although technically decentralized, skeptics argue that the XRP Ledger&#8217;s close association with Ripple Labs and the substantial amount of XRP held by the company have resulted in a degree of centralization that distinguishes it from other blockchain systems.<br /><br />In September 2019, the network celebrated its 50 million ledger milestone, and within just over a year, it had successfully added 10 million. This rapid pace underscores the growing acceptance and utilization of the XRP ledger, along with the Ripple network&#8217;s expanding capacity to handle a substantial volume of transactions.<br /><br />The journey of the XRP Ledger has not been without controversy. Critics, including Blockstream CEO Adam Back, have frequently pointed out the permanent loss of the first week of the XRP Ledger&#8217;s existence. Despite such criticism, reaching this new milestone symbolizes the resilience and perseverance of the XRP ledger in the ever-evolving realm of blockchain technology.</p>
