<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) are increasingly seeing a drop in investor interest. This is reasonably expected because the average crypto investor is not just in the market for the tech; they want to see gains as well. </p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) and Cosmos (ATOM) have recently failed to deliver on this front. Despite their seemingly strong fundamentals, Cosmos (ATOM) and Chainlink (LINK) have underperformed in the market, even during rallies. &nbsp;This has seen investors look elsewhere to take advantage of the market's profit opportunities. </p>
<p class="s3">One cryptocurrency currently in the investor spotlight is Sparklo (SPRK). There is so much optimism around Sparklo (SPRK) that some analysts expect it to reach the top 100 once the presale is over. </p>
<p class="s7">Chainlink (LINK) Whale Selling Stagnates The Price</p>
<p class="s3">Chainlink (LINK) saw one of the best price runs in 2020 and early 2021. From under $5, Chainlink (LINK) made highs of $50 on some exchanges. However, after April 2021, Chainlink(LINK) stagnated, and the price never saw new highs, even in the crypto peak out of November 2021. </p>
<p class="s3">Analysts believe that despite Chainlink (LINK)&rsquo;s strong fundamentals, it continues to face pressure from those who got in at ICO selling. This continued selling will likely keep the price depressed, especially now that crypto is still in a bear market. </p>
<p class="s3">This explains why savvy investors are looking beyond what Chainlink (LINK) can do as a technology and more toward where the profits will come from next. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s presale has seen a lot of inflow from Chainlink (LINK) investors, and analysts expect this to push Sparklo (SPRK) to unprecedented highs. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">Cosmos (ATOM) Inflationary Tokenomics Drives Away Investors</p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) has some of the best fundamentals in interconnecting Dapps from blockchains. </p>
<p class="s3">However, analysts don&rsquo;t expect Cosmos (ATOM) to give much in exponential returns on investment going into the future. Many believe Cosmos (ATOM)&rsquo;s biggest undoing is its inflationary tokenomics. </p>
<p class="s3">As long as new tokens keep flooding the market, Atom (ATOM) will likely underperform the rest of the market long term. </p>
<p class="s3">Investors are beginning to understand this, and the trend has been shifting towards new upcoming cryptocurrencies with better profit potential. </p>
<p class="s3">Cosmos (ATOM) investors are particularly intrigued by Sparklo (SPRK). It is a good chance at exponential gains since it is still in the presale stage, meaning a lot of upsides once exchange listings start. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo PreSale Drawing Investors With a 30% Bonus Offer</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) presale has been drawing in many investors tired of holding underperforming cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p class="s3">One of the biggest draws to Sparklo (SPRK) is that the presale price is quite competitive. At only $0.015 and a bonus of 30% for the tokens bought, investors can&rsquo;t get enough of Sparklo (SPRK).</p>
<p class="s3">Investors are also rushing to buy Sparklo (SPRK) ahead of the price increase scheduled for 30th April 2023. After that, the price will rise to $0.017.</p>
<p class="s3">However, the use case interests Sparklo (SPRK) investors the most. Sparklo (SPRK) has a strong use case, unlike most new cryptos founded on hype. It wants to make it possible for investors to buy small units of precious metals like Gold, Silver, and Platinum in NFTs. </p>
<p class="s3">The transparency of this project also inspires Sparklo (SPRK) investors. InterFi Network audits Sparklo (SPRK)&rsquo;s; no issues were found. There is also a KYC audit which is also above board. </p>
