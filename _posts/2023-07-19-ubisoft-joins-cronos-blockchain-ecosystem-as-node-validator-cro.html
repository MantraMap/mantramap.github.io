<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ubisoft, a leading video game creator and publisher, is expanding its exploration of blockchain technology with a new partnership.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Joining the Cronos blockchain ecosystem as a node validator, Ubisoft adds its experience and expertise to this expanding digital network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ubisoft is set to join 27 other node operators contributing to the Cronos open-source blockchain. These node validators play a vital role in ensuring the stability and security of the network. As a validator, Ubisoft will participate in blockchain governance and network update approvals.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decision to join the Cronos ecosystem aligns with Ubisoft's ongoing exploration of blockchain technology, spearheaded by its Strategic Innovation Lab. The inclusion of Ubisoft in the ecosystem aligns with Cronos' strategy of collaboration with technical contributors, which include Crypto.com, Blockdaemon, Dora Factory, and Allnodes, among others.</p>
An Extension of Ubisoft-Cronos Relationship
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The partnership is a progression of the existing relationship between Ubisoft and Cronos. Ubisoft previously participated as a start-up mentor in the Cronos Accelerator program, marking their initial collaborative efforts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ken Timsit, Managing Director of Cronos Labs, a blockchain startup accelerator, commented on the partnership as well, expressing optimism about Ubisoft's contributions, given their understanding of blockchain's potential and limitations in creating deeper engagement between game creators and gamers. Timsit also mentioned the open-source Cronos project, where Ubisoft is expected to participate as a validator.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"They have unparalleled understanding of the potential and the limitations of blockchain technology when it comes to creating deeper engagement between game creators and gamers," Timsit said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cronos' ecosystem stands to benefit from Ubisoft's expertise, particularly in providing feedback on technology upgrades to support gaming use cases. Ubisoft's Strategic Innovation Lab, tasked with anticipating the future and integrating innovative technologies, will play a pivotal role in this endeavor.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cronos has been active in the gaming industry with Cronos Play, a suite of developer tools and integrations for blockchain-based games. The developer tools are now available as a plugin in the Unreal Engine Marketplace, with more than 15 Web3 games launched or in the pipeline for launch on the Cronos blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Cronos (cronos.org) is an EVM-compatible layer 1 blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK. It's supported by Crypto.com, Crypto.org, and more than 500 app developers and partners. The platform is adopted by over 1 million users and supports an ecosystem of more than 80 million users worldwide with the Cronos ($CRO) cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ubisoft's venture into the Cronos ecosystem reinforces the growing interest of leading technology firms in blockchain technology and its myriad applications.</p>
