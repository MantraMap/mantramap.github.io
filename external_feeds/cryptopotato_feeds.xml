			            <description><![CDATA[The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, is close to securing almost $100 million for his global crypto ID project Worldcoin.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worldcoin is in advanced talks to raise fresh capital as it nears launch in the next few weeks, according to the Financial Times. The project aims to use iris-scanning technology to create a secure global cryptocurrency called Worldcoin.</p>
<p>Previous investors in Worldcoin include Andreessen Horowitz’s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/andreessen-horowitz-still-has-billions-to-invest-in-crypto-and-web3-founder/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto fund</a>, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, and internet entrepreneur Reid Hoffman.</p>
<p>The firm was founded in 2019 and has been working on digital identification technology using retina-scanning orbs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a $100 million private token sale early last year valued the total supply of the Worldcoin tokens at $3 billion, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f1de2aee-ee13-45e1-bd61-0a269cd650d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> added.</p>
<h2>Worldcoin Launch Imminent</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Worldcoin claimed to have surpassed a million signups and between 100 and 200 Orbs operational at any given time.</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a bear market, a crypto winter. It’s remarkable for a project in this space to get this amount of investment,” said an FT source close to the project.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the firm, the orbs use “iris biometrics to establish an individual’s unique personhood, then create a digital World ID that can be used pseudonymously in a wide variety of everyday applications without revealing the user’s identity.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">gm Miami! The Orb world tour has officially landed in Florida.</p>
<p>Stop into the grand opening of <a href="https://twitter.com/thecanvasglobal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@thecanvasglobal</a>&#8216;s newest independent web3 &amp; digital creator gallery in Wynwood starting @ 6pm EST to verify your World ID, learn more about the protocol &amp; join the community! <a href="https://t.co/OsxMuFLuZd" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/OsxMuFLuZd</a></p>
<p>— Worldcoin (@worldcoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/worldcoin/status/1657487098268483586?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">May 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Users will be eligible for free Worldcoin tokens once their identity has been established in the system.</p>
<p>However, the project has received some criticism over privacy issues related to biometrics. The firm stated that it will not store personal data from iris scanning.</p>
<h2>Potential Issues Found</h2>
<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to TechCrunch, hackers have already managed to install malware on devices of multiple Worldcoin Orb operators.</p>
<p>Password-stealing malware, such as the RedLine information stealer, had been detected pilfering some of the credentials saved in browsers, including login details for the Orb operator app, it noted.</p>
<p>On May 11, the Worldcoin Foundation <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-commits-optimism-superchain-vision-ahead-mainnet-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announced</a> a commitment to support the Optimism Collective and bring the World ID system to the Optimism ecosystem.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Miners are contributing to Bitcoin’s local dip as they reduce their reserve balance, but this analyst thinks they may soon reverse course. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin recovered slightly over the weekend, but still remains suppressed at a relative seasonal low of $27,360. What’s behind the latest slump?</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">According to crypto market analysis firm CryptoQuant, the downward price pressure may be coming from miners.</span></p>
<h2>Miners ‘Unload Their Bags’</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a </span><a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/645fe95efb92892124b73c0c-Miners-continue-to-sell-Bitcoin-but-it-is-possible-that-the-unloading-of-bags-ma" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">post</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from BaroVirtual on Saturday, the analyst noted that miners have been drastically reducing their holdings since May 5, with miner net position change turning negative on May 9. The metric gauges how much miner reserves are growing – or shrinking – each day, helping measure whether miners are HODLing or selling their newly mined coins. </span></p>
<figure style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://img.cryptoquant.com/35304/quicktake/Fx1ySv_4efb40142bc6206cb55ba68e973cbd24b17b4ed0819ff240e22350e3083b56e5.png" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.cryptoquant.com/35304/quicktake/Fx1ySv_4efb40142bc6206cb55ba68e973cbd24b17b4ed0819ff240e22350e3083b56e5.png" alt="quicktake-image" width="1034" height="430" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Minerr Reserve (USD). Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chart shows that miners were heavily accumulating Bitcoin from mid-March until mid-April, after which a wave of sell pressure helped push the asset down from over $30,000 to below $27,300 within three days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That selling pressure has remained roughly consistent until today, culminating in Bitcoin </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepes-crash-and-burn-bitcoin-tumbles-to-26k-crypto-markets-in-freefall-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">tumbling</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to a multi-month low of $26,260 on Friday.</span></p>
<h2>The BRC-20 Fee Spike</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before Bitcoin’s dip last week, miners were having a field day in new revenue netted from new hype surrounding Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, which are bringing Ethereum-like utility (NFTs and tokenization) to Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The phenomenon also </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-fees-explode-amid-brc-20-memecoin-mania-miners-benefit/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">drove up</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bitcoin’s fees much like Ethereum’s, reaching an average of $30 per transaction on May 8. These fees went straight into miners&#8217; pockets, providing a massive bonus atop the 6.25 BTC they typically earn per block. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miners’ net position briefly went positive during the days of the BRC-20 hype but has quickly returned to negative since fees went back down to normal. Thankfully for bulls, CryptoQuant has reason to believe the selloff will end soon. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Currently, the miner net position values are in the zone where Bitcoin bounced off in previous times, and the local uptrend continued,” explained BaroVirtual. “In this regard, it can be assumed that miners can significantly reduce their pressure, i.e., slow down sales or cancel sales when Bitcoin hits the $24,000 target.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/institutions-intend-to-buy-bitcoin-in-late-2023-interview-with-cryptoquant/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> last month, CryptoQuant analysts told </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">CryptoPotato </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">that Bitcoin’s value could return to its previous all-time high of $69,000 by early next year, as institutions buy-in during late 2023. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Korean authorities raided the offices of Upbit and Bithumb as part of the investigation against the politician Kim Nam-kuk. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">South Korean prosecutors have reportedly raided the offices of the two leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the country &#8211; Upbit and Bithumb &#8211; as part of an ongoing investigation against Kim Nam-kuk. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The politician faced public scrutiny after several reports indicated he acquired 800,000 Wemix tokens by bypassing necessary regulations. He transferred the coins from Bithumb to Upbit last year, and the authorities suggested the platforms could have been involved somehow. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Inspection Spreads Further</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a local media outlet, the Korean authorities </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/2023/05/15/national/politics/korea-upbit-bithumb/20230515201129323.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">searched</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the headquarters of Upbit and Bithumb in Seoul in a bid to unravel the case of Kim Nam-kuk. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Democratic Party (DP) recently </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/korean-politician-agrees-to-sell-his-crypto-assets-following-public-scrutiny-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">urged</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> him to sell his 800,000 Wemix coins following accusations that he could have used insider information to accumulate them a few years ago. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The politician allegedly withdrew the assets at the beginning of 2022: several months before the enforcement of legislation that requires crypto entities to report personal information when transferring over $758. He was also part of the team that proposed a delay of income taxation on digital assets in South Korea. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Nam-kuk said he would fulfill the DP&#8217;s requirement and sell the holdings, currently worth approximately $660,000.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I received the recommendation from the party to sell my crypto assets. I will faithfully implement the recommendation. I will transparently disclose data to the investigation team and undergo the inquiry faithfully.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Wu Blockchain </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1658069446802702336" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">argued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Nam-kuk sent 800,000 Wemix coins from Bithumb to Upbit in 2022, which could have sparked the investigation against the exchanges. Upbit believed this was &#8220;an improper transaction&#8221; and reported it to the government at the time. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Second Investigation on Bithumb This Year</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Korean prosecutors </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bithumb-offices-raided-as-legal-woes-pile-up-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">raided</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the offices of Bithumb in January following rumors that the company or a person working for it manipulated the price of an undisclosed coin listed on its platform.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;This is a search and seizure to secure the transaction details of a specific coin, and it has nothing to do with Bithumb,&#8221; the authorities stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The inspection came shortly after the prosecutors </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bithumbs-real-owner-faces-arrest-warrant-on-embezzlement-charges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">requested</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> an arrest warrant for Kang Jong-Hyun (the exchange&#8217;s owner) over embezzlement charges and market manipulation. His sister also faced issues with domestic law after the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office claimed she artificially inflated the share price of certain firms by issuing convertible bonds. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, Bithumb has been surrounded by certain levels of controversy for years. Park Mo &#8211; the largest shareholder of Bithumb Holdings Co. (the company behind the platform), was </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/vp-of-bithumb-linked-company-found-dead-in-seoul-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">found</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> dead in December 2022 in front of his house in southern Seoul. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While the initial investigation found no signs of violence and estimated that the death may have been suicide, the crypto community cast doubts on it. For one, Mo was close to Jong-Hyun and his sister and supposedly discussed the potential purchase of his organization to the now-bankrupt FTX. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The exec had previously shared his firm's plans to release Bitcoin Lightning Network-powered software and solutions in 2023.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Business intelligence company MicroStrategy is doubling down efforts on bringing Bitcoin layer 2 scaling solution &#8211; Lightning Network &#8211; capabilities this year.</p>
<p>Its executive chairman Michael Saylor shared an update notifying that the company is working on a product aimed at delivering a Bitcoin wallet and Lightning address to every corporate account holder.</p>
<ul>
<li>The main <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1657807531664605185" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">intention</a> behind the move is to enable quick and easy development as well as deployment of Bitcoin rewards applications to employees, customers, prospects, and partners.</li>
<li>The Lightning Network is a layer-2 payment protocol layered on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain that enables off-chain transactions, ramping up payment throughput, and reducing transaction fees.</li>
<li>Reports <a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/daily-market-brief/the-valkyrie-market-brief-02-06-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">suggest</a> that LN adoption has been picking up speed in emerging markets such as South America and Africa, which can be attributed to efforts of the Bitcoin payment company and wallet provider Strike.</li>
<li>Back in December, Saylor <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-to-introduce-bitcoin-lightning-applications-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">shared</a> that MicroStrategy is exploring software and solutions that leverage LN, including solutions that support enterprise marketing in addition to a cybersecurity solution aimed at corporate websites.</li>
<li>The 58-year-old billionaire also announced integrating Bitcoin’s Lightning Network into his corporate email address in April this year. This means that anyone can send BTC to Saylor using his company email address as an identifier.</li>
<li>Besides focusing on LN, MicroStrategy has continued its Bitcoin purchase, making it the largest corporate holder of the flagship crypto-asset.</li>
<li>According to data compiled by Bitcoin Treasuries, MicroStrategy currently owns 140,000 BTC, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/microstrategy-increased-its-btc-holdings-for-11-consecutive-quarters/" data-wpel-link="internal">purchasing</a> more portions of the asset througout all previous 11 quarters.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Pepe coin price hopped up the chart again Friday, May 12. The weekend rally followed a slide from the meme coin's record high price of $0.00000431 on May 6. Here are some key factors to keep in close consideration.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pepe (PEPE) price correlated with Bitcoin (BTC) over the seven-day chart. While the froggy new ERC-20 token powered by the Ethereum blockchain fell in price on the days BTC did, it rallied along with BTC on Friday into the weekend.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price dive over the last week was a two-month low. Moreover, it was the leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s worst week of the year.</p>
<h3>Feels good, man</h3>
<p>As CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/a-pepecoin-trader-turned-dollar263-into-millions" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">notes</a>, the Pepe coin launched in 2023 is distinct from Pepe Cash (PEPECASH):</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Pepe is not to be confused with Pepe Cash, another meme coin that was launched in 2016 and is used to buy and sell rare Pepe artworks on the Counterparty platform.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Pepe coin (PEPE) did not exist before April 16, 2023. Its anonymous creators launched the deflationary supply, fungible token meme coin without a presale or marketing muscle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the new blockchain tadpole swelled into a billion-dollar bullfrog in a matter of days. Furthermore, in 20 days, the PEPE coin price hopped so high that the total market cap topped $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>After retracing back from its flash-in-the-pan launch rally, Pepe remains capitalized in an amount in excess of $700 million.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an impressively fast market capitalization.</p>

<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-pepe/" data-wpel-link="internal">Pepe coin</a> is more than a smart logo and name referencing a legendary Internet meme. The meme coin&#8217;s Ethereum smart contract has some clever economics built in.</p>
<p>The supply of PEPE is deflationary, with a limit above 420 trillion tokens. It also has a burn mechanism to shore up scarcity by burning LP tokens from liquidity providers and voiding contracts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, PEPE has a &#8220;no taxes&#8221; policy, which means very low fees to execute transaction orders. Additionally, PEPE chain redistributions are built in to favor long-term stakers to stave off inflation.</p>
<p>The coin&#8217;s debut on crypto trading platforms was designed to be as fair as possible. While many new crypto projects have allocated an unfair amount of the supply to founders and devs, 93.1% of the tokens were allocated to liquidity for sales. Meanwhile, 6.9% remained in a multi-sig wallet for strategic deployment.</p>
<p>The project&#8217;s first phase, &#8220;Meme&#8221; is already complete and was an outstanding success. The rapid flow of capital into PEPE put the project on par with crypto memecoin blue chips. In under a month, it became a peer of DOGE, SHIB, and popular <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/nft-traders-sell-bayc-below-floor-price-to-buy-pepe/" data-wpel-link="internal">NFT collections like BAYC</a>.</p>
<p>With incentivizing economics like that, PEPE coin bears will be hard pressed to keep their shorts covered.</p>
<h2>Meme Coin Power</h2>
<p>The Pepe meme is one of the Internet&#8217;s most epic ones, with a thriving community that goes back many years. There&#8217;s no telling who exactly is Pepe&#8217;s most devoted memester, but anyone who&#8217;s ever used Reddit can tell you a lot of them, and users who post Shiba Inu memes are the same people.</p>
<p>As a result, it has not been really much of a surprise that Pepe coin launched with the kind of success it had. It was tailor-made to appeal to and serve a vast, anonymous market of veteran crypto investors with deep pockets full of juicy ROI from other meme coin investments.</p>
<p>Crypto whale investor support for Pepe coin has been mixed. Whales snapped up $10M USD worth of tokens, stocking up 7% of the PEPE supply a week after its launch. They controlled around one-third of its liquidity on markets at the beginning of the rally.</p>
<p>Around 30 &#8220;smart wallets&#8221; (large and active traders) bought a million dollars worth of the new coin at the start of its rally, according to Nansen Ethereum blockchain data. Over the last week&#8217;s price plummet, some whale addresses took profits. Meanwhile, three crypto whales were spotted buying $4 million worth of PEPE by Lookonchain.</p>
<p>Tesla and SpaceX CEO and Dogecoin bull Elon Musk boosted PEPE Saturday with a meme of Pepe &#8220;Explaining constitutional amendments.&#8221; The meme featured two panes with the meme frog depicted alternatively as a super cute browser of dank memes and a modern battlefield combat soldier.</p>

<h2>How to Find the Next Pepe?</h2>
<p>The successful premiere of Pepe on Ethereum is an exciting development for crypto investors. It&#8217;s also an excellent case study on how to get into hugely successful projects early.</p>
<p>Many early investors in Pepe were able to turn a couple hundred of dollars into a million in just a few days. One trader who goes by the pseudonym dimethyltryptamine.eth bought $263 worth of PEPE that turned into $12.8 million practically overnight.</p>
<p>That kind of profit from a single investment could suddenly change many people&#8217;s lives. Here are some daily practices to keep that will increase your odds of hitting a home run like this.</p>
<h3>Get New Coin Listing Alerts.</h3>
<p>When new cryptos hit an exchange, you&#8217;ll get an alert.</p>
<p>Search volume on Google for &#8220;pepecoin&#8221; registered spikes on Google Trends starting the day it launched. So there was some buzz going around the community about it the day PEPE went for sale.</p>
<p>With a coin listing alert, you can stay apprised of new opportunities. But be advised that there are multiple new listings a day. So you will need an efficient process and working, a historically back-tested system for sifting through leads this way.</p>
<h3>Use Uniswap and Get Notifications for Updates from DeFi Exchanges.</h3>
<p>One pattern in the Pepe coin saga is how many early buyers got it on <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-uniswap-in-simple-words/" data-wpel-link="internal">Uniswap</a>. Defi volumes for Pepe exchanges soared ahead of the Pepe coin price going parabolic on May 1.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here is a short guide with warnings about the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-to-use-uniswap-guide-and-must-read-risks-before-swapping/" data-wpel-link="internal">risks of using Uniswap</a>.</strong></em></p>
<p>The trader who made a multi-million dollar profit on a $263 investment used Uniswap. Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Gate.io, and MEXC are other exchanges where PEPE is currently listed.</p>
<h3>Bottom Line: Frog Coin Flies</h3>
<p>Pepe coin&#8217;s super bullish debut validates the thesis of meme coin investors who buy and trade coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Furthermore, it is more overwhelming evidence of the Internet&#8217;s enormous and relentless appetite for Ethereum services to store savings.</p>
<p>It is remarkable here, as the blockchain industry has enthusiastically advertised, that these open-source finance platforms are open to being utilized by anyone who learns how to write Ethereum&#8217;s scripts and design financial products.</p>
<p>Additionally, these blockchain platforms are autonomous, decentralized, and artificially intelligent. Anyone can build a defi (decentralized finance) app and go to work for Ethereum without the need for any approval or support from other humans.</p>
<p>The software is designed so that it can be utilized by anyone with sufficient working knowledge of the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">instructional manuals</a> for programming Ethereum (ETH).</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently unfollowed Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk after what seemed like a long and friendly history between the two parties. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though neither executive has left any explicit clues, crypto Twitter has some theories about what may be driving tension between the tech billionaires. </span></p>
<h2>Did Twitter Shun Binance?</h2>
<p><b><br />
</b><span style="font-weight: 400">Twitter account @BigCryptoAlert called attention to the turn of events on Saturday, noting that CZ – whose </span><a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">account</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> follows over 1600 users – no longer counts Musk’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">profile</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> among them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One Twitter user named Lucra </span><a href="https://twitter.com/lucrafund/status/1657801320139485187?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">speculated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that CZ may be distancing himself from Elon ever since Twitter invited eToroUS – a social investments company for crypto, and other financial instruments – to be the social network’s partner crypto exchange, rather than Binance. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because Elon invited <a href="https://twitter.com/eToroUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@eToroUS</a> to be Twitter&#39;s crypto exchange instead of Binance, even though it was CZ who helped fund his acquisition of Twitter.</p>
<p>&mdash; Lucra (@lucrafund) <a href="https://twitter.com/lucrafund/status/1657801320139485187?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">May 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The partnership </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/twitter-partners-with-etoro-to-enable-users-access-to-financial-instruments/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">enabled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> users to easily access stocks and crypto from Twitter in April, letting them view market charts for such assets and buy/ sell them through eToro. Though the platform doesn’t support nearly as many crypto assets or crypto volume as Binance, it&#8217;s been subject to far less </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-addresses-the-cftc-in-house-trading-allegations/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">regulatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-is-not-a-chinese-company-declares-ceo/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">jurisdictional</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> criticism than the latter – and supports a wider range of financial assets in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, Binance was one of the companies that helped Musk acquire Twitter last year, putting $500 million towards the cause. The exchange was also </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-wants-to-use-crypto-and-blockchain-to-help-twitter-fight-bots/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">prepared</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to help Musk organize a blockchain-based solution to its spam bot problem, which the tech tycoon considered one of his principal motivations for acquiring the company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, other Twitter users </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ANoNakamoto/status/1657784706837151744" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">speculate</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that CZ may now disapprove of the direction in which Musk is taking Twitter. The former boss recently announced that he would </span><a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/twitter-new-ceo-1.6841431" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">step down</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> as Twitter’s CEO in favor of Linda Yaccarino – a former executive at NBC. </span></p>
<h2>Pepe Wallet Soon?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s also speculation that the unfollowing may be related to the new memecoin Pepe. Musk </span><a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1657318313532313600" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">posted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a Pepe-related meme on Twitter over the weekend, which was predictably followed by a short-lived price pump. </span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Explaining Constitutional Amendments <a href="https://t.co/oYkMPBe9Zi" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/oYkMPBe9Zi</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, rumors are circulating that Twitter soon plans to launch its own crypto wallet. Some users believe the wallet will feature Pepe as its native currency, sparking another wave of bullish momentum for the coin. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a fact that CZ is furious about Elon Musk’s plans to launch a Twitter crypto wallet,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Pauly0x/status/1657896165994528772" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Pauly0x on Twitter on Sunday. “That’s why CZ recently unfollowed him. Pepe will be a native currency at launch. It just makes sense. The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.”<br />
</span></p></blockquote>
<p>Musk also travelled to France on Monday to speak with President Emmanuel Macron. France happens to be where the verified Pepe memecoin account is located.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Cape Town, South Africa, May 15th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://nftfi.com/?utm_source=Press+Release&amp;utm_medium=Chainwire&amp;utm_campaign=EARN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">NFTfi</a>, a leading NFT lending platform, has launched the next phase of its loyalty program NFTfi Rewards. In <strong>Earn Season 1</strong>, users can get rewarded with exclusive reward points for borrower-friendly loans and responsible lending behavior.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The NFT space is growing rapidly, and healthy credit markets are fundamental to its overall growth. NFTfi’s Earn Season 1 reward structure has been designed with this in mind to incentivize responsible NFT lending and contribute positively to the overall NFT ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Stephen Young, Co-Founder and CEO at NFTfi says: </strong>&#8220;We believe that NFT lending is a crucial part of the future of the NFT space, and we&#8217;re committed to promoting a healthy and non-predatory lending environment through our new loyalty program.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The principles by which Earn Points are calculated are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Only repaid loans earn points: </strong>Aims at motivating lenders to carefully manage default risk via conservative LTVs, and borrowers to not take out excessive debt they might not be able to repay.</li>
<li><strong>Larger and longer loans earn more points: </strong>Aims at motivating lenders to provide borrowers with flexible access to various loan sizes and loan durations.</li>
<li><strong>Lower interest rate (APR) loans earn the most points: </strong>Aims at motivating lenders to provide borrower-friendly interest rates and risk-adequate LTVs as a consequence.</li>
</ul>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Earn Points are earned by repaying an eligible loan. Upon taking out a new loan, the associated Earn Points can be seen under “unsecured points” in the NFTfi Rewards cockpit. If the loan gets repaid, these points turn into “secured points”.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The NFTfi Leaderboard shows unsecured Earn Points (upon starting a loan) and secured Earn Points (upon repayment). The 500 wallets with the most secured points by the end of Season 1 will get a multiplier of 2.5x max. on their final balance.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">NFTfi is committed to rewarding real users, not washlenders. The program disincentivizes wash loans through various measures, including no points for loans with APRs below 2%, no points for loans with a duration of fewer than 3 days, and no points for related wallets.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Earn Points are non-transferable and not redeemable at present. They merely reflect the loyalty level of NFTfi users. Certain persons, such as US residents, other US persons, and persons located in the US, are not eligible to participate in the NFTfi Rewards loyalty program.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Earn Season 1 is only the beginning of a long and exciting #NFTfiSummer. NFTfi has many surprises planned for all NFT collectors out there. For more information, check the <a href="https://app.nftfi.com/reward/earn?utm_source=Press+Release&amp;utm_medium=Chainwire&amp;utm_campaign=EARN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Earn Points cockpit</a> and the <a href="https://nftfi.com/faq/?utm_source=Press+Release&amp;utm_medium=Chainwire&amp;utm_campaign=EARN#nftfi-rewards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">FAQs</a> section.</p>
<h2 class="ql-align-justify">Market Information</h2>
<p class="ql-align-justify">NFT lending is a rapidly growing market, with the global NFT market expected to reach $13.6 billion USD by 2027, according to <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/non-fungible-tokens-market-254783418.html#utm_source=globenewswire&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=paidpr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">MarketsandMarkets</a>. NFT lending offers benefits such as liquidity, enabling NFT holders to use their assets as collateral for loans. It also helps tackle issues such as the lack of traditional financing options for NFT holders and the need for a healthy credit market in the NFT space.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Investments in loans carry inherent risks, and the value of NFTs can be highly volatile. Users should carefully consider their risk tolerance and investment objectives before taking out loans.</p>
<h2 class="ql-align-justify">About NFTfi</h2>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><a href="https://nftfi.com/?utm_source=Press+Release&amp;utm_medium=Chainwire&amp;utm_campaign=EARN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">NFTfi.com</a> is a decentralized peer-to-peer lending platform that enables NFT holders to borrow ETH, USDC, and DAI cryptocurrency, secured by their non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform is non-custodial and built on the Ethereum blockchain, where smart contracts facilitate secure and transparent transactions directly between borrowers and lenders. NFTfi provides a new way for NFT holders to unlock the value of their assets and access liquidity while also enabling lenders to earn interest on their funds. Since its first loan in May 2020, users have transacted over $400 million on the NFTfi smart contracts.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has reached the crucial level of the 100-day moving average at $1760. The PA at this significant support region should be closely monitored, as a breakdown will potentially lead to a massive cascade.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>After a short-term consolidation phase, the price experienced a decline and reached the 100-day moving average of $1.7K. Although Ethereum&#8217;s recent PA has not shown a clear direction, it initiated a slight uptrend after touching the 100-day moving average, leaving the market uncertain.</p>
<p>However, the price currently faces two crucial levels, the 100-day moving average at $1748 and the $1.6K support region.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has the potential to start a rally aiming for the $2.1K resistance area, but only if the moving average successfully holds Ethereum from further decline.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>On the 4-hour timeframe, after a short-term consolidation correction stage around the channel&#8217;s middle boundary, the price continued plummeting toward the $1.7K support region. However, after reaching it, the cryptocurrency experienced a slight rebound, initiating a slow uptrend rally.</p>
<p>Ultimately, a downward break of the $1.7K support zone and the ascending channel&#8217;s lower boundary would lead to a cascade resulting from long positions getting liquidated. Conversely, if supported, the price could potentially aim for the channel&#8217;s mid-boundary and even the $2.1K resistance region.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p>The following chart demonstrates the Exchange Inflow (Top 10) metric alongside Ethereum&#8217;s price. The metric respectfully measures the total amount of coins from the top ten transactions that flow into the exchanges.</p>
<p>High values indicate an increase in investors depositing a large amount at once. This could mean higher selling pressure and a potential future price drop.</p>
<p>Considering the chart, the Exchange Inflow (Top 10) metric&#8217;s 50-day moving average has been in a significant downtrend since July 2022, when the market was experiencing a consolidation stage without a clear direction.</p>
<p>However, despite Ethereum&#8217;s recent uptrend, the metric has continued to decline, suggesting that the selling pressure is not at concerning levels yet. Hence, its overall outlook remains bullish for the mid-term.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripples price has been sinking over the last few months following a clear rejection from a key resistance level. It is currently within a decisive area, and the outcome would likely determine the mid-term trend of the market.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></p>
<h3>XRP/USDT Daily Chart</h3>
<p>The price has been making lower highs and lows recently, following the significant rally in early May. The bearish reversal at the $0.6 area has initiated the current downtrend, but the cryptocurrency is currently testing a key support level around both the $0.42 mark and the 200-day moving average.</p>
<p>A break below these levels would be catastrophic for Ripple, as the market could rapidly plunge toward $0.3, and potentially even lower, in the short term.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a rebound occurs, the 50-day moving average, located near the $0.48 mark, would be the first likely target in the coming days.</p>
<figure id="attachment_250681" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250681" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-250681 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_1505231" width="2560" height="1441" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT-Daily-May-15-2023-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-250681" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>XRP/BTC Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Against BTC, the price is still trapped inside a large descending channel after failing to break above it on numerous occasions. The 50-day moving average near the 0.000017 level has also been broken to the downside, and the 0.000015 support is currently being penetrated.</p>
<p>A breakdown of this level would likely result in a deeper decline toward the 0.000013 level. The RSI is also showing values below 50%, as momentum is clearly in favor of the bulls.</p>
