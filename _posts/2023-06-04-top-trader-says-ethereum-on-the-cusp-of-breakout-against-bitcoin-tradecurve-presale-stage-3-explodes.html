<p>Ethereum and Bitcoin have long been regarded as two top giants battling for supremacy in the crypto ecosystem. However, according to a top trader, Ethereum might be having the upper hand soon. In other news, Tradecurve's presale stage 3 has recorded immense growth in the past few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) Set for a Breakout Against Bitcoin (BTC) - Top trader</p>
<p>An influential trader within the crypto community known as Bluntz has recently shared his optimistic outlook on Ethereum in relation to Bitcoin. With over 223,100 on Twitter, Bluntz suggests that the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair is on the brink of a potential breakout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Year-to-date, Bitcoin has performed Ethereum, gaining 63% compared to the latter&rsquo;s 56%. However, Bluntz believes the trend could change in the coming weeks, with Ethereum performing better than Bitcoin in the bull market. According to his analysis, if this breakout occurs, Ethereum's value would increase against Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Displaying a chart on his tweet, Bluntz pointed out a falling wedge pattern on the ETH/BTC pair, which typically indicates a bullish trend. On the other hand, he expresses concerns about Bitcoin's performance against the USD, emphasizing the breach of a crucial support level. As a result, the trader advised investors to limit their exposure to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
