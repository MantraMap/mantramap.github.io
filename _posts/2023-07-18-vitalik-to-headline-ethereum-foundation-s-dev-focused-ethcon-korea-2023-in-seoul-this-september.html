Quadratic Funding is a weighted voting and resource allocation method, which will combine votes from judges, sponsors and attendees to participate in the selection based on their contribution. Quadratic Funding is designed to combine community support for new ideas with the interests of larger contributors in a synergistic process.&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Ethcon Korea is accepting submissions for proposals and talks until July 18, aiming to foster a diverse background of active researchers and lesser known developers, with the key goal of sharing useful experiences with each other.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">The event will be held at Platz2 (&#54540;&#46972;&#52768;2) in Seoul, a cozy and spacious co-working space in the middle of Seoul.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">About Ethcon Korea 2023</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Ethcon is an annual developer-focused conference and hackathon held in Seoul, South Korea.
