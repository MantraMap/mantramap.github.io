<p>Vodafone and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">Cardano</a> may seem like an unlikely match on the surface, but there may be more to it than meets the eye. It all started with a Tweet by Vodafone Germany asking if Cardano had NFTs.</p>



<p>“Does Cardano have NFTs ? Moving the chains,” the mysterious tweet read.</p>



<p>This was followed up a day later on an official Vodafone Germany social media Discord channel.</p>



<p>Vodafone representative Luca wrote: <em>“Yes, we are planning to release an NFT collection this year, and we want to utilize the Cardano chain for this. The reason we chose this particular chain comes down to community, sustainability as well as cross-chain possibilities.”</em></p>



<p>Vodafone&#8217;s choice to use the Cardano network for minting NFTs has increased Cardano&#8217;s visibility and likelihood of widespread adoption. Vodafone&#8217;s cooperation, coming from a significant international company, illustrates the potential and capabilities of the Cardano blockchain for hosting large-scale projects. Cardano adoption may increase due to this exposure among other companies and developers who may be motivated to learn more about the capabilities and advantages of the platform.</p>



<p>By selecting Cardano as the NFT minting platform, Vodafone expresses confidence in the network&#8217;s technical capabilities and infrastructure. This can bolster the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-surging-adoption-in-the-u-s-fueling-super-bullish-ecosystem-growth-for-ada/">Cardano ecosystem</a> and support its long-term expansion and sustainability.</p>



<p>Additionally, ADA is the native coin of the Cardano blockchain. The value and demand for ADA may benefit from increased Cardano network adoption and usage, pushed by major corporations like Vodafone. Increased transactions, staking of ADA, and involvement in the management of the Cardano blockchain may occur when more companies and individuals interact with the Cardano ecosystem. These activities can increase interest in ADA and raise prices.</p>



<p>Cardano enthusiasts and ADA holders alike will be pleased with the development as Cardano is gaining real-life use cases on top of a solid foundation. As one Twitter user Dave, noted, Cardanos&#8217; uptime has just passed 2100 days.</p>



<p>And Patrick Tobler, the founder of NMKR, the platform that will help mint Vodafone NFTs on Cardano, targeted a tweet at Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stating, “Real-World Enterprise Adoption, what do you say?</p>



<p>While Hoskinson did not directly comment on the development or respond to the tweet, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">he said</a>, “Lots of noise in crypto. Look for the signal. Cardano is getting real adoption and growing as an ecosystem under the harshest conditions our industry knows. Like Bitcoin, this is being done in a completely decentralized way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has proposed a common protocol for the use of digital money, such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized bank deposits, and stablecoins on a distributed ledger.</p>



<p>The details are contained in a whitepaper released on June 21, 2023. The whitepaper encourages greater research among central banks, FIs, and FinTechs to understand the design considerations in using digital money.</p>



<p>According to the whitepaper, although digital money offers the possibility of programming unique characteristics into the individual bearer asset and hence dictates how the digital money is to be used, this would modify its properties and acceptance as a medium of exchange.</p>



<p>To understand how the fungibility of digital money can be retained, the whitepaper studied different programmability models, namely, the programmable payments model, the programmable money model, and the Purpose Bound Money (PBM) model.</p>



<p>According to the white paper, the programmable payment’s advantage is its ability to define a set of programming logic or conditions that could be applied across a variety of different forms of money. The programmable money model has the advantage of being self-contained and having conditional logic transferrable on a peer-to-peer basis between parties.</p>



<p>Consequently, there is a growing need to ensure a common framework for interacting with different forms of digital monies and ensuring interoperability with existing financial infrastructure.</p>



<p>The PBM model has the advantages of containing digital money as a store of values and programming logic denoting its use. The whitepaper provides a technical overview of the concept of the PBM model.</p>



<p>As per the whitepaper, the PBM model builds upon both the programmable payment and programmable money models and works with different ledger technologies. PBM enables users to access and transfer digital money using the wallet provider of their choice without the need for customization.</p>



<p>The whitepaper, developed in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund, Banca d’Italia, Bank of Korea, financial institutions and FinTech firms, further discusses potential uses of the PBM model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This collaboration among industry players and policymakers has helped achieve important advances in settlement efficiency, merchant acquisition, and user experience using digital money. More importantly, it has enhanced the prospects for digital money becoming a key component of the future financial and payments landscape&#8221;, said Mr Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>



<p>The MAS has previously stated that there is no urgent need for a retail CBDC in Singapore. The MAS says that this whitepaper is neither seeking to advance specific policy objectives nor to endorse any technical solution.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, recently saw substantial growth, market observers look to the cause of this. One reason for the price driver may be the increase in applications for exchange-traded funds (ETF) for Bitcoin by several financial institutions, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity&#8217;s latest move to re-file for an ETF</a>. As the market continues to grow, investors are keenly speculating whether increasing demand for a Bitcoin-ETF is the leading cause of its price increase.</p>



<p>Fidelity has resubmitted a requisition to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), being the latest major player in financial services to enter the battle for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity is initiating a bid for a Bitcoin ETF for the second time with this action, demonstrating its belief in the likelihood of a successful launch.</p>



<p>The number of Bitcoin ETF applications submitted to the SEC this year has increased, with Fidelity becoming the seventh to do so. The increased interest in Bitcoin ETFs is evidence of the traditional financial community&#8217;s growing acceptance and acknowledgement of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Spot Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust&#8221; is intended to expose investors to Bitcoin through a product that trades on regulated exchanges, according to the filing. Shares of the trust, which would hold Bitcoin as its main asset and reflect a proportional investment in the virtual currency, would be available for purchase and sale on the open market to investors.</p>



<p>As the American economy recovers from the pandemic-related slowdown, Fidelity decides to re-file for a Bitcoin ETF. The demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as alternative investments has risen as economic activity picks up and investor confidence grows.</p>



<p>The industry&#8217;s increasing interest in a Bitcoin ETF reflects its understanding of the enormous potential for institutional adoption and its desire to offer regulated investing options for conventional investors. A Bitcoin ETF, if approved, may function as a spur for increased mainstream adoption and draw large capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s decision on any pending Bitcoin ETF applications is still in the air, despite Fidelity&#8217;s re-filing indicating optimism and a favourable forecast for the cryptocurrency sector. Due to worries about market manipulation and investor protection, the SEC has typically been wary of adopting such investment vehicles.</p>



<p>Fidelity&#8217;s action will likely increase competition among financial firms vying for a seat in the Bitcoin ETF race. Applications from other well-known parties, including Grayscale Investments and VanEck, show the rising desire to give investors regulated access to Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The recent price increases in the cryptocurrency market and Fidelity&#8217;s renewed campaign for a Bitcoin ETF highlight the rising demand and general interest in digital assets.</p>



<p>Investors and enthusiasts alike will be keenly watching developments to determine the influence on the price and broader acceptance of Bitcoin in the global financial scene as the market excitedly anticipates the SEC&#8217;s verdict on Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, blockchain payments firm Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">unleashed </a>the controversial Hinman emails as a key aspect of a defensive plan designed at putting the SEC on the back foot.</p>



<p>And these documents could not only help the XRP originator evade a billion-dollar suit but also help another crypto giant in the SEC&#8217;s crosshairs: Coinbase, the biggest digital asset exchange in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase has filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s complaint. In the legal document on June 29, the exchange’s legal team cited the infamous Hinman emails to highlight a major “regulatory gap” and “greater confusion” regarding the rules in the crypto market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-denies-sec-jurisdiction"><strong>Coinbase Denies SEC Jurisdiction</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has filed its first legal response to SEC’s lawsuit.</p>



<p>In its answer filed Thursday with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Coinbase voiced concerns about the SEC violating its due process and reaching beyond its legal authority. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1674271484263661569">tweeted </a>on Thursday, saying that the SEC’s claims in the suit “go far beyond existing law” and should, therefore, be dismissed.</p>



<p>According to Coinbase, the 12 digital tokens considered as securities in SEC&#8217;s complaint are not &#8220;investment contracts,&#8221; hence the assets don’t qualify as securities under the Howey Test.</p>



<p>The exchange’s lawyers note that without a &#8220;contractual undertaking&#8221; to yield profits or a business whose &#8220;management owes enforceable obligations to investors,&#8221; it&#8217;s just an &#8220;asset sale&#8221; and cannot be deemed an &#8220;investment contract.&#8221;</p>



<p>Coinbase further argued that the SEC was fully aware of the exchange’s listing processes for crypto tokens and did not express any disapproval before lodging the lawsuit. Moreover, six of the 12 coins now under dispute were already being traded on the exchange when the SEC affirmed the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s registration statement.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s motion also notes that the SEC’s current Chair, Gary Gensler changed his position on the regulator&#8217;s authority over crypto toward the end of 2022. Gensler testified before Congress in May 2021 saying that &#8220;only Congress&#8221; can address the gap in regulating crypto assets as &#8220;there is not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges.&#8221; But by the end of 2022, the SEC boss had determined that his agency had &#8220;enough authority&#8221; to bring enforcement actions.</p>



<p>“Even if the SEC were correct that the assets and services it identifies are within the scope of its existing regulatory authority, this [legal] action must be dismissed on independent grounds that it violates Coinbase’s due process rights and constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process,” Coinbase’s legal team wrote in the filing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase’s Motion To Dismiss Has “Real Teeth”: Pro-XRP Lawyer</strong></h2>



<p>XRP holders’ attorney John E Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1674401125846458368">noted </a>that Coinbase’s argument had “real teeth” while pointing out some compelling points to buttress his point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a>’s Motion to Dismiss, based on the Major Questions  Doctrine, has real teeth. I’m not saying that it will be granted for sure, I’m just saying it’s not your garden variety motion to dismiss where denial can easily be predicted. The motion has teeth because of… <a href="https://t.co/qVkwY31Zkm">https://t.co/qVkwY31Zkm</a></p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1674401125846458368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>For starters, Deaton pointed out that the U.S. Congress has commenced the process of legislation for the crypto industry, which is a sign that lawmakers are finally ready to address the core issues raised. The CryptoLaw founder then mentioned the regulatory gap argument that was publicized through the Hinman emails in the XRP v. SEC case, which also gave Coinbase a stronger defense.</p>



<p>Deaton also believes Gensler’s previous acknowledgement that there is no clear rulebook developed for the crypto assets ecosystem can also strengthen the exchange’s case.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Coinbase lawsuit is whether the exchange sold some assets as investment contracts. Speaking on this, the attorney observed that there has never been a case in the past where the court declared that assets purchased at the secondary market were an investment contract. Moreover, there is not even one case in history where the judge has found an investment contract when there was no connection between the issuer and the buyer.</p>



<p>While he believes the motion is strong, Deaton clarified that it does not mean the presiding judge will grant it. In other words, Coinbase’s motion isn’t “your garden variety motion to dismiss where denial can easily be predicted.”</p>

<p>Two weeks after BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF application, Boston-based financial services giant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-fidelity-investments-rumored-to-be-close-to-filing-for-blackrock-like-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity </a>is trying its luck with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fidelity Officially Reenters The Ring</strong></h2>



<p>Fidelity, a notable asset management company with at least $11.1 trillion in assets under administration, has refiled paperwork for its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, joining a long list of spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls.</p>



<p>As per a filing by Cboe BZX Exchange with the SEC dated June 19, Fidelity said its spot BTC offering would help investors in the U.S. avoid risk.</p>



<p>&#8220;To this point, the lack of a Spot Bitcoin ETP exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto asset exposure through a Spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,&#8221; the filing stated, adding that investors have previously stored their assets on now-defunct cryptocurrency exchanges like FTX.</p>



<p>Fidelity’s application bears a striking resemblance to BlackRock’s and ARK Invest’s as it includes the &#8220;surveillance sharing agreement&#8221; with an unspecified United States spot-based bitcoin trading platform. The purpose of this key aspect is to help alleviate SEC concerns regarding market manipulation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-race-for-spot-etf-heats-up-amid-growing-institutional-interest"><strong>Race For Spot ETF Heats Up Amid Growing Institutional Interest</strong></h2>



<p>Fidelity’s application comes after the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed paperwork</a> with the SEC for a spot BTC ETF on June 15. The BlackRock news sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency market, enticing more financial institutions, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">Invesco</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shoots-up-with-30000-in-sight-following-fresh-wave-of-spot-etf-applications/">Wisdom Tree</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">ARK Invest</a> to hop on the crypto wagon and submit similar applications in the following days. Like these firms, Fidelity was making a second shot at a spot bitcoin product after the SEC denied its first application in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the SEC approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF last week, the agency is yet to decide on any of the new spot ETF filings. Notably, most crypto observers are optimistic about BlackRock’s application owing to its sheer financial power and the fact that the investment giant has received a green light for all of its previous 575 ETF applications except one. Additionally, hopes are high for BlackRock, seeing that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/theres-a-50-chance-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-gets-greenlight-from-sec-top-bloomberg-analyst-predicts/">Grayscale may likely win its suit</a> against the SEC for denying its spot bitcoin ETF request.</p>



<p>Institutional investors appear hungry for such spot crypto ETFs, pundits claim, because it would let them be involved with Bitcoin without worrying about storing the asset.</p>



<p>All these major traditional investment companies filing applications for spot bitcoin ETFs with the SEC have catalyzed bitcoin’s steady rise past the psychologically important $30,000 level. The largest crypto by market cap is changing hands at $30,819.93 at publication time, with a 0.8% gain.</p>

<p>The recent volatility in crypto prices has opened up enticing prospects for shrewd investors, specifically those who hold a significant amount of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-moon-time-ripple-eyes-upper-hand-in-sec-lawsuit-as-ceo-garlinghouse-sheds-light-on-case-outcome/">XRP</a> to acquire additional coins.</p>



<p>Earlier today, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the unusual buying activity of XRP whales during the recent market dip. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1674366754322104325">tweet</a>, Martinez noted that despite XRP&#8217;s price dropping by 12% between June 22 &#8211; June 28, whales seized the opportunity and purchased a staggering 360 million XRP tokens, equivalent to a substantial $170 million.</p>



<p>Notably, the so-called &#8220;whales&#8221; are often seen as trendsetters in the crypto space, and their actions can influence market dynamics. By acquiring such a significant amount of XRP during a dip, these whales are likely signalling their belief in a future price increase. This move may attract other investors and reinforce positive sentiment around Ripple and XRP.</p>



<p>The gargantuan purchase comes just days after the pundit highlighted the correlation between previous price jumps in XRP and a spike in the number of active XRP addresses.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The last three instances $XRP price jumped were preceded by a spike in the number of active XRP addresses. On-chain data from Santimentfeed has recorded a spike in network activity over the past few days. Could history repeat itself?&#8221;</em> Ali tweeted on June 26, sharing the chart below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DA8w7vg_JupCKqUgzsaE7ImIxYRqZA-P5jezJ2bn9jazTRvNkYT0nQD2uB-SXvgLsaY-sAQtqXdYdFHQiyXTB04T5rS3lVcIqDUxePnOZFOinjrNczwdFn34wOcWr32YNDWWRcxE8ipD7CMIRLWvQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>These developments send a clear message about investor confidence in Ripple&#8217;s vision and its underlying XRP token. Ripple, San Francisco, a blockchain-based payment company, has garnered attention for its potential to revolutionize cross-border transactions.</p>



<p>Recently, Ripple secured an In-Principle approval of a major payments institution license from Singapore, allowing it to offer regulated digital asset products and services and scale customer use of its On Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. This and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-sees-ultra-bullish-use-cases-after-colombias-central-bank-taps-ripple-to-pilot-cbdc/">partnerships</a> with financial institutions can amplify the utility and demand for XRP, ultimately exerting an influence on its value.</p>



<p>Notably, the surge in Ripple and XRP interest can also be attributed to the optimism surrounding Ripple&#8217;s ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-continues-to-see-new-twists-and-turns-as-alderoty-reveals-ripples-benefits-in-sec-case/">legal battle</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP as a security. It is worth noting that Ripple&#8217;s victories against the SEC, including the recent disclosure of the highly disputed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">Hinman documents</a>, have been widely regarded as a substantial reinforcement of Ripple&#8217;s arguments.</p>



<p>That said, the outcome of this case holds substantial importance, as a favourable ruling for Ripple could fuel investor confidence and bolster the prospects of XRP as a prominent cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, XRP has been experiencing a consolidation phase after encountering significant resistance at $0.55. Nevertheless, when examining the hourly time frames, the trend appears promising as the price establishes higher lows. According to the crypto analyst known as &#8220;Altcoin Sherpa,&#8221; this <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1674021807924314112">suggests</a> the need for patience until the resistance level is surpassed.</p>

<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.47 after a 0.60% drawdown in the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Joe Lubin, Ethereum Co-Founder and the CEO of ConsenSys is not worried about ether (ETH) being classed as a security in the United States after the crypto’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model.</p>



<p>Speaking during a June 28 <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetSignsCNBC/status/1673884919632904192">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, Lubin noted that a regulatory decision on ether has already been made. “The CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,” he stated.</p>



<p>Notably, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) boss Rostin Benham has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/blockchaintpsht/status/1633516089245147167">said </a>that the top three cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether’s USDT, belong under his agency’s purview as commodities. </p>



<p>Benham’s opinion, however, directly contradicts that of Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions indicated that “everything other than Bitcoin” fits the definition of securities. Earlier this month, Gensler’s hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.</p>



<p>The commission’s chairman has also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chief-gary-gensler-hints-ethereums-move-to-proof-of-stake-might-transform-eth-into-a-security/">hinted </a>that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network’s monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>



<p>But Gensler wasn’t always so trenchant a detractor. Before becoming the chair of SEC, he taught courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulted with that school’s Digital Currency Initiative. During this time, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gensler-asserts-bitcoin-and-ether-are-not-securities-at-a-bloomberg-conference-in-2018/">believed </a>ether had graduated from being a security into a commodity by 2018.</p>



<p>“The SEC has spoken,” Lubin opined, referencing former SEC director William Hinman’s 2018 speech Ethereum speech where he declared the asset a non-security. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">Recently unmasked documents </a>revealed that Hinman dismissed warnings from other SEC staffers who believed his comments would cause immense market confusion.</p>



<p>Notably, Gensler refused to say whether ether was a security during a five-hour-long hearing in April. “It’s really a forgone conclusion at this point,” Lubin observed. “There may be a regulator or two in the United States that can’t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don’t know why that’s the case.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, industry figures and billionaires like Mark Cuban are <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1667914770651987970">calling out</a> the SEC for failing to provide crypto firms with a clear registration process to comply with.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, the founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-insane-growth-as-sundaeswap-hits-major-milestone-signaling-surging-adoption-for-ada/">Cardano</a>, has expressed his perspective on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the importance of looking for the signal amidst what he termed &#8220;lots of noise in crypto&#8221;.</p>



<p>Hoskinson, responding to recent adverse claims surrounding Cardano&#8217;s institutional interest and the health of its DeFi sector, passionately highlighted the ecosystem&#8217;s exceptional growth in a June 28 tweet, emphasizing its real adoption and commitment to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, Hoskinson confidently stated that Cardano is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-surging-adoption-in-the-u-s-fueling-super-bullish-ecosystem-growth-for-ada/">experiencing real adoption and significant growth</a> even under the harshest industrial conditions. Drawing a parallel to Bitcoin, he emphasized that Cardano&#8217;s progress is being completely decentralised.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Lots of noise in crypto. Look for the signal. Cardano is getting real adoption and growing as an ecosystem under the harshest conditions our industry knows. Like Bitcoin, this is being done in a completely decentralized way,&#8221; </em>Said Hoskinson.</p>



<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s response was prompted by a tweet from popular Cardano proponent Chris O, who highlighted claims made on a popular YouTube channel regarding Cardano&#8217;s lack of Total Value Locked (TVL) and institutional interest. In response, Chris offered a powerful rebuttal by highlighting various institutional players already involved in the Cardano ecosystem.</p>



<p>He listed prominent institutions such as Grayscale, Hong Kong Vectors Capital, Bitwise Investments, WisdomTree Europe, and 21Shares, all of whom have expressed interest or established products related to Cardano. He further pointed out the growing number of institutional funds and indexes associated with Cardano, specifically mentioning the WisdomTree Cardano ETP and the 21Shares Cardano ETP. Notably, these investments demonstrate institutional players&#8217; confidence in Cardano&#8217;s potential and further validate its increasing adoption.</p>



<p>Dan Gambardello, a popular crypto analyst and host of the Crypto Capital Venture YouTube channel, also highlighted the thriving nature of Cardano&#8217;s De-Fi sector. In a video, the pundit stated that some investors are achieving significant gains despite the bear market and challenged the misconception that all altcoins performed poorly during bear markets.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are people within Cardano outpacing these losses with gains, and they&#8217;re stacking ADA as a macro-minded investor or as a value investor for the long term. They&#8217;re stacking their AdA and outpacing these losses with gains</em>,&#8221; said Dan.</p>



<p>Dan then presented data illustrating Cardano&#8217;s rapid growth and adoption in the DeFi space. He emphasized the substantial increase in total value locked (TVL) within Cardano&#8217;s DeFi space, with an impressive growth rate of 148% from January to June. He also mentioned specific successful projects in the Cardano ecosystem, such as IAG, VPhi, Indie, and Milk, which achieved remarkable gains ranging from 255% to 590% over the same period.</p>



<p>That said, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment towards crypto, it is vital to acknowledge the potential and value that Cardano offers, especially considering the network&#8217;s strengthening fundamentals. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.27 following a brutal week, which saw its price plunge about 8%.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California filed charges against the investment fund founder of Ichioka Ventures, William K. Ichioka, of New York, New York, with several cryptocurrency fraud schemes.</p>



<p>According to a June 22, 2023 press release, the SEC charged Ichioka with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>



<p>The SEC complaint states that Ichioka raised US$25 million from individual investors primarily in California and Oregon, making false claims about his investing success, and promising large anticipated returns.</p>



<p>The SEC’s complaint further alleges that from at least June 2019 to October 2021, Ichioka solicited investments for his unregistered investment fund, claiming that he was an accomplished investor, promising investors oversized returns and guaranteeing investors’ principal. Ichioka agreed to the entry of a partial final judgement, subject to court approval.</p>



<p>In a typical Ponzi scheme-styled fraud, Ichioka promised attractive returns and used money from new investors to repay other investors. As per the SEC complaint, Ichioka falsified a bank statement and other documents to create an appearance of success, and also misappropriated investors&#8217; funds for personal use.</p>



<p><em>“As we allege in our complaint, Ichioka lured investors by falsely stating that he was a self-made multimillionaire investor able to generate significant investment returns, but the real story was that Ichioka stole investor funds to enrich himself,” said Monique C. Winkler, Director, SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.</em></p>



<p>In a June 22, 2023 press release, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a civil enforcement action charging William Koo Ichioka with fraudulently soliciting and misappropriating investors’ funds. Ichioka did not contest his liability on the CFTC’s claims.</p>



<p>According to the CFTC press release, Ichioka operated a fraudulent scheme from 2018 through November 2021, where he solicited funds from several individuals for trading digital asset commodities and for forex transactions.</p>



<p>On June 22, 2023, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California also filed a criminal complaint against Ichioka charging him with multiple criminal counts including wire fraud and assisting in the preparation of a fraudulent tax return.</p>



<p>As per the court filings, Ichioka is further charged in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, and commodities fraud. Ichioka’s initial federal court appearance is yet to be scheduled.</p>



<p>The above concurrent charges against Ichioka further add to the debate of oversight over crypto activities and regulation in the United States and the collaboration of law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Invest has made a strategic move that potentially gives it an edge in the race for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The firm has amended its application to include a surveillance-sharing agreement, similar to BlackRock’s recent filing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ark-amends-spot-etf-filing-to-include-blackrock-like-feature"><strong>ARK Amends Spot ETF Filing To Include BlackRock-Like Feature</strong></h2>



<p>ARK Invest has updated its Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028-Amendment-No-1.pdf">update </a>includes a surveillance sharing agreement with the Cboe BZX Exchange — on which the ETF would be listed —  and a U.S.-based crypto exchange, most “likely Coinbase,” <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1674055780058771463">according to</a> Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.</p>



<p>“The Exchange is proposing to take additional steps to those described above to supplement its ability to obtain information that would be helpful in detecting, investigating, and deterring fraud and market manipulation in the Commodity-Based Trust Shares,” Cboe BZX said in the revised application.</p>



<p>A surveillance-sharing agreement entails sharing data regarding market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer verification to guard against possible market manipulation.</p>



<p>ARK requested permission to list its native spot BTC ETF a third time in April after previous applications were rejected by the SEC back in 2021 and 2022. As a reason for the denials, the securities regulator indicated that it did not fully satisfy the rules of practice and Exchange Act provisions for listing a financial product.</p>



<p>The amended 19b-4 filing potentially puts ARK in competition with BlackRock to gain the first-ever approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States, as the original filing for the fund came earlier than BlackRock&#8217;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per Balchunas, the SEC’s decision is expected in August, and any potential delays could be seen as a really bad sign for approval unless the delay is followed by green-lighting of BlackRock’s ETF, which could signal a hint of “favoritism.”</p>



<p>BlackRock already tapped Coinbase to be its Bitcoin custodian if and when it&#8217;s granted approval. As such, there are concerns about whether the investment giant would allow Coinbase to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with another entity that could potentially overtake it on the market.</p>

<p>Colombia&#8217;s central bank, Banco de la República, recently joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ripple and software development company Peersyst to pilot a project exploring the use of blockchain technology on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-seals-major-partnership-with-canadas-biggest-university-to-launch-xrp-ledger-validator/">XRP Ledger</a>. The initiative, overseen by Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (MinTIC), aims to leverage Ripple&#8217;s recently launched central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform.</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ripple Partner Peersyst stated, “The objective: Evaluate potential efficiencies of a solution using the Ripple CBDC Platform based on the core technology of the XRPLedger to improve use cases on the high-value payment system.<em>”</em></p>



<p>The partnership between Banco de la República, Ripple, and Peersyst is a crucial step towards incorporating blockchain technology into the nation&#8217;s financial infrastructure. The pilot project will examine blockchain&#8217;s possible use cases on the XRP Ledger and how they relate to central bank digital currencies. Banco de la República hopes to improve the effectiveness, security, and transparency of the nation&#8217;s financial transactions by utilizing Ripple&#8217;s CBDC platform.</p>



<p>The partnership may affect the value of XRP, the cryptocurrency behind the XRP Ledger. Although the cooperation might increase interest in XRP, it is important to consider other market factors that may affect the price. It must also be stressed that a Colombian CBDC will likely not use XRP itself, but rather the underlying XRPL distributed ledger technology (DTL). The success of the collaboration will therefore rely on how well the pilot project is carried out and how widely blockchain technology is embraced in Colombia&#8217;s banking sector.</p>



<p>This is a hugely significant collaboration in the context of digital currencies issued by central banks. The fact that Banco de la República is investigating Ripple&#8217;s CBDC technology demonstrates the growing awareness of the potential of blockchain to revolutionize conventional financial systems. The central bank of Colombia has shown that it is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/colombian-government-launches-national-land-registry-on-xrp-ledger-for-over-50-million-people/">committed to staying</a> on the cutting edge of technological advancement in the financial sector by cooperating with Ripple and Peersyst.</p>



<p>The partnership between Banco de la Republica, Ripple, and Peersyst comes as central banks worldwide investigate the advantages of blockchain technology and virtual currencies. Blocks like this open the path for broader adoption and the mainstream integration of blockchain-based solutions as governments and financial institutions come to understand the revolutionary potential of decentralized technologies.</p>



<p>The collaboration raises promise for the future of digital money in the nation, even though the pilot project&#8217;s specific use cases and results have not yet been determined. Colombia intends to strengthen its financial infrastructure, increase security, and promote innovation by utilizing the possibilities of blockchain technology and Ripple&#8217;s CBDC platform.</p>



<p>It is crucial to understand that the pilot project&#8217;s success will depend on several variables, including legal requirements, technological viability, and public acceptance. Stakeholders should closely follow the project&#8217;s progress and evaluate the possibilities for growing blockchain solutions in Colombia&#8217;s financial ecosystem as it develops.</p>

<p>A leaked draft document from the European Commission has shed light on the institution&#8217;s plans for the digital euro, providing an intriguing glimpse into the future of digital currencies. According to the draft, the EU Commission wants to establish an openly available digital euro while also putting some limitations on programmability and interest rates.</p>



<p>According to the leaked document, the EU Commission&#8217;s fundamental goal is to make sure that everyone can use the digital euro, regardless of their socioeconomic level. In addition to highlighting the value of financial inclusion, the statement aspires to close the digital gap by granting everyone access to digital currency. The concept aims to provide a trustworthy and secure digital payment system that both individuals and companies can utilize.</p>



<p>But the leaked draught also clarifies that the EU Commission plans to restrict how the digital euro can be programmed. According to the document, the currency&#8217;s programmability would be limited to stop potential abuse and illegal acts. The goal is to balance innovation and regulatory monitoring, even though the precise details of these constraints have not yet been decided.</p>



<p>The leaked document also highlights an interesting development involving interest rates for the digital euro. It looks like the EU Commission is thinking about making interest in digital currency holdings illegal. This action is probably intended to avoid hoarding, discourage large-scale stockpiling of the digital euro, and encourage spending to boost the economy. Experts and economists are expected to disagree over the potential effects of the proposed interest rate restriction on the uptake and use of digital currency.</p>



<p>Smart contract proponents have expressed alarm at the leaked draught. According to the document, smart contracts may be de facto outlawed in the framework of the digital euro. Given that smart contracts might create complications and risks that call for meticulous regulation, this restriction is likely meant to safeguard the stability and integrity of the digital currency. However, critics claim that such a limitation would prevent the advancement and innovation of smart contract-based blockchain applications.</p>



<p>Even though the leaked draft provides valuable insights into the EU Commission&#8217;s plans for the digital euro, it is crucial to keep in mind that the document is not final and subject to parliamentary revisions. Before putting the plan in writing, the EU Commission will probably undertake more stakeholder meetings and consultations.</p>



<p>The EU Commission&#8217;s commitment to investigating and realizing the possibilities of central bank digital currencies is reflected in the leaked letter. The digital euro aspires to establish the European Union as a pioneer in the field of digital currencies while solving issues with accessibility, programmability, and interest rates as the world of finance continues to change. Although the future of the digital euro is still up in the air, this leaked memo provides an exciting look at potential developments for the European digital currency market.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethscriptions akin to BTC inscriptions are a new way for users to create non-fungible tokens on Ethereum.</li>



<li>Barely 48 hours after the launch, the project has recorded over 30,000 image NFTs with slight congestion on the blockchain. </li>



<li>Unlike BTC ordinals, the project has received widespread optimism among developers and users, although some feel it&#8217;s just a “<em>copycat.”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Ethereum developers have drawn inspiration from Bitcoin in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an area of speciality for the decentralized blockchain giant.</p>



<p>A new protocol that offers users a new way to create NFTs hit Ethereum over the weekend with lots of buzzes over its possibilities. Developed by Tom Lehman, the co-founder of Genius.com, the project is <a href="https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/status/1670063380726423554?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">termed</a> Ethscriptions, coined like inscriptions in Bitcoin because of the shared similarities. </p>



<p>Ethscriptions allow for non-financial data to be written on the Ethereum network so far as it is under 96 kilobytes. It currently only allows for image-based NFTs, but developers say it will be expanded in the future. Lehman noted that Ethscriptions utilize “call data” which is data derived within a call to a smart contract making it cheaper and more decentralized than others. </p>



<p>“<em>It guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions. it&#8217;s skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>The launch has already sparked significant interest in major players in the Ethereum network. Within hours of its launch, over 10,000 inscriptions were recorded. The figure grew to over 30,000 over the weekend, with its debut project, “Ethereum Punks” being claimed in a few hours. </p>



<p>Lehman hailed the project as a success, claiming that its high adoption almost led to a temporary crash of the official Ethscription site. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-backs-innovation">Community backs innovation</h2>



<p>Modelled along the lines of Bitcoin Ordinals, the developers Ethscriptions hope to achieve the same results as the community moved in unison, at least for now. BTC Ordinals was launched with huge dissenting views, with many calling it an “<em>attack” </em>against the normal use of the network.</p>



<p>These views got louder when the blockchain was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-surging-transaction-fees-viewed-as-direct-attack-by-a-cross-section-of-the-community/">congested</a> due to the high inscription volume recorded in May. For Ethscriptions, most users focus on the positives calling for more innovation and adoption. Adam McBride, an NFT enthusiast, capped off the community’s sentiment with his views.</p>



<p>“<em>The exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology. It’s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,” </em>he stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, McBride also noted that technology has existed on the network for years with few artists deploying it, noting that this would be the first time it gets massive publicity.</p>

<ul>
<li>A new study shows that CBDCs could make retail payments cheaper and more efficient with the right technology.</li>



<li>The study carried out by the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England backs CBDCs for a digitized economy. </li>



<li>Despite the successful trial, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England insists that Britcoin is still “<em>some years away”</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The report from Project Rosalind shows that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are beneficial to a digitized economy, especially a two-tier CBDC model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bank Of England, alongside the Bank of International Settlements, embarked on a joint experiment in July 2022 to determine how an application programming interface (API) could be deployed in retail CBDC transactions. The report was <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp69.pdf">released</a> on June 16 and states clearly that CBDCs make payments between individuals and businesses less expensive. </p>



<p>According to the report, a two-tier CBDC model will allow firms to create new financial products to reduce fraudulent activities. There are widely two systems for launching CBDCs: single-tier and double-tier. The Central Bank fully operates the single-tier model, while the two-tier model leverages financial institutions making it more decentralized.</p>



<p>The Central Bank provides core infrastructure, while private firms handle service providers through APIs. Project Rosalind explored how these APIs would improve the overall experience of the digital currency. An intriguing discovery in the report is the way the model would drive adoption with its numerous use cases, explore decentralization and create an interoperable model. </p>



<p>The study developed 33 API functionality with over 30 CBDC use cases, including its deployment on smartphones, vendors, and retail stores. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-britcoin-is-still-years-away"><strong>Britcoin is still years away </strong></h2>



<p>“<em>The Rosalind experiment has advanced central bank innovation in two key areas: by exploring how an API layer could support a retail CBDC system and how it could facilitate safe and secure CBDC payments through a range of different use cases,” </em>Francesca Road, Head of BIS London said in a statement. </p>



<p>With success recorded in Rosalind, many observers say that all roadblocks have been removed, paving the way for UK’s Central Bank’s Digital Currency, popularly called Britcoin. However, the deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Jon Cunliffe, had pushed the date further when he stated that the country’s launch of the currency “<em>is still years away.” </em></p>
