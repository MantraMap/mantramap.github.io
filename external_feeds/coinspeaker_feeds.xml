										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec-proposal/">Valkyrie&#8217;s Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC Accepts Proposal for Review</a></p>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has accepted Valkyrie’s application for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) and will now continue with an official review. The proposal, which was filed confidentially in June 2023, was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nasdaq.htm#SR-NASDAQ-2023-019">revealed</a> on July 17 after the Nasdaq stock exchange refiled for a proposed rule change allowing the listing of the Bitcoin ETF.</p>
<p>The proposal acceptance follows within a week of the SEC’s acceptance of Blackrock’s ETF application. Recall that on June 15, BlackRock <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF with the SEC. The filing proposed Coinbase as the crypto custodian and BNY Mellon as the cash custodian.</p>
<p>Following Blackrock’s filing, several companies, including WisdomTree, Invesco, and Valkyrie also refiled their previously rejected filings.</p>
<h2>Valkyrie’s Initial Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing</h2>
<p>The Nashville-based crypto asset management firm, Valkyrie, filed its first application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF in January 2021, under the ticker BTF. Co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments Steven McClurg had expressed optimism about their chances. However, about 11 months later, the SEC rejected the filing alongside applications from Wisdom Tree, Krypton, and Global X.</p>
<p>Since then, the SEC has gone on to reject many Bitcoin ETF applications. In fact, the SEC has not approved any spot Bitcoin ETFs despite multiple applications. Instead, the regulator has cited concerns about market manipulation, fraud, and investor protection as reasons for its rejections or delays.</p>
<h2>Optimism Over the New Filing</h2>
<p>Valkyrie resubmitted its Bitcoin ETF application days after BlackRock&#8217;s ETF proposal application. Like BlackRock, it also enlisted Coinbase as its surveillance-sharing partner. The Bitcoin ETF is listed under the ticker ‘BRRR’. Unlike the firm’s existing <a href="https://valkyrie-funds.com/btf/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external noopener">BTF fund</a>, this fund will be leveraged.</p>
<p>With the application on the SEC docket, members of the public will have 21 days to comment on Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal. Following this, the SEC can then decide to approve, reject, or extend its review of Valkyrie&#8217;s proposal. It may also request more information from the company before making a decision.</p>
<p>If approved, Valkyrie&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF would be the first of its kind in the US and could attract significant demand from investors. However, there is no guarantee that the SEC will change its stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs anytime soon, as it has been historically cautious and conservative on crypto-related products.</p>
<p>Regardless of the approval, Bitcoin rallied after several firms submitted their Bitcoin ETF applications. However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $29, 995 according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/evergrande-81b-loss-two-years/">China&#8217;s Largest Indebted Property Developer Evergrande Reports $81B Loss in Two Years</a></p>
<p>Evergrande Group, China&#8217;s largest indebted property developer, has finally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/evergrandes-long-delayed-2021-2022-results-show-significant-losses-2023-07-17/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">unveiled</a> its long-awaited earnings report, disclosing a staggering $81 billion combined loss for 2021 and 2022. According to the company&#8217;s financial earnings report released on July 17, the real estate developer acknowledged a net loss of 476 billion yuan ($66.36 billion) in 2021 and an additional loss of 105.9 billion yuan ($14.76 billion) in 2022.</p>
<p>These substantial losses were primarily attributed to write-downs of properties, return of land, losses on financial assets, and mounting finance costs. Notably, the reported loss represents a significant reversal from the net profit of 8.1 billion yuan recorded in 2020 when Evergrande&#8217;s operations were relatively stable.</p>
<p>The repercussions of Evergrande&#8217;s massive debt burden have reverberated throughout China&#8217;s property sector, a vital pillar of the country&#8217;s economy. The company&#8217;s struggles have resulted in defaults and unfinished homes, leaving suppliers and creditors in a precarious position.</p>
<h2>Evergrande Shares Suspended from Trading on Hong Kong Stock Exchange</h2>
<p>The company&#8217;s financial woes started when it failed to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/breaking-evergrande-defaults-the-148-million-bond-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repay</a> a debt of $148 million in 2021. In order to compensate its suppliers and creditors, the real estate giant sold some of its assets and shares but was unable to meet the demand of investors, thereby going into <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/evergrande-shares-trading-loss-default/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">default.</a> The company&#8217;s total liabilities at the time amounted to $300 billion after the default</p>
<p>The following year, Evergrande announced that it had received an order from local authorities to halt trading its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange, pending the release of the long-overdue financial results and ongoing investigations into seized deposits. The indefinite suspension raises questions about potential delisting if the shares remain halted beyond the 18-month threshold.</p>
<p>The company is now <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/evergrande-repayment-default-looms/">restructuring</a> and confirmed that its shares will remain suspended.</p>
<h2>Evergrande&#8217;s Total Liabilities Reached $340 Billion</h2>
<p>According to the financial earnings report, Evergrande&#8217;s total liabilities have surged from $300 billion at the time of its default to $340 billion by the end of 2022, underscoring the significant financial hurdles faced by the company. The increase represents a 23% percent rise compared to the previous year, revealing the mounting challenges the company, the government, and investors encounter as they work towards resolving weaknesses within a sector that contributes to over a quarter of China&#8217;s economic activity. Additionally, the financial report indicated a substantial drop in revenue, with Evergrande&#8217;s earnings plunging by 55% to 230.1 billion yuan in 2022 compared to the more prosperous period of 2020.</p>
<p>In contrast, the company&#8217;s total assets experienced a decline of 20%, amounting to 1.8 trillion yuan. This drop in assets further accentuates the financial strain faced by Evergrande and its ongoing struggle to maintain stability amidst challenging market conditions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Evergrande&#8217;s auditors, Prism Hong Kong and Shanghai Limited, refrained from expressing opinions on the company&#8217;s financial statements. The auditor cited insufficient audit evidence as the reason behind this decision, raising concerns about transparency and accuracy.</p>
<p>The reported losses align with analysts&#8217; expectations, given the decline in Evergrande&#8217;s contracted sales, which amounted to 443 billion yuan in 2021 and a mere 31.7 billion yuan in 2022, compared to 723 billion yuan in 2020.</p>
<p>As Evergrande grapples with its financial challenges, the company has been actively pursuing an offshore debt restructuring plan. It recently announced that hearings for the reorganizational schemes will be held in Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands, allowing creditors to consider and approve the proposed plan.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celo-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celo-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2/">Celo Blockchain Preps to Transition to Ethereum Layer-2 Network as Token Jumps Nearly 10%</a></p>
<p>The Celo blockchain currently seeks to transition from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celo-blockchain-ethereum-layer-2/">Celo Blockchain Preps to Transition to Ethereum Layer-2 Network as Token Jumps Nearly 10%</a></p>
<p>CLabs, the developer behind the Celo blockchain, is currently eyeing a transition to the Ethereum ecosystem. The team proposed this via a Twitter announcement where it said that the decision comes after &#8220;months of research and initial discussions with Celo and Ethereum community members&#8221;.</p>
<p>Per the announcement, the proposal seeks for the Celo blockchain to transition from an independent layer-1 blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution. However, a final decision will only be reached after the community votes on Saturday, July 22.</p>
<h2>Celo Blockchain to See Massive Gains from Move, Experts Say</h2>
<p>The Celo team appears to be in high spirits for the anticipated migration. According to a technical analysis of the proposed migration to the Ethereum ecosystem, the blockchain stands to gain a lot of benefits. That includes improved security, greater liquidity, as well as more compatibility among other things.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the migration is expected to initially rely on Optimism&#8217;s OP Stack. And as it was appraised in a <a href="https://forum.celo.org/t/clabs-proposal-for-celo-to-transition-to-an-ethereum-l2/6109" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post</a> on the Celo Forum:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Migrating Celo to utilize the OP stack eliminates the need to monitor compatibility, making it easy for Celo developers to utilize the full gambit of Ethereum tooling/libraries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides, Celo already works well with the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM. So, as far as compatibility is concerned, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> developers can simply just move their existing apps over. And if they want to create new ones, they can do so easily, using many of the same tools they are already familiar with.</p>
<h2>CELO Token Surges</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, CELO, the native token of the blockchain, has reacted positively to the announcement. Although that is not exactly unexpected.  Token surges are common when major upgrades such as this are about to take place. And as of publication, CELO has surged nearly 9.96% in the past week to reach $0.545. According to CoinMarketCap <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celo/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a>, the token has gained more than 35% over the last month.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/euro-stablecoin-market-regulations/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/euro-stablecoin-market-regulations/">Euro Stablecoin Market Set to Grow with Real-World Applications and Clear Regulations</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union has recently proposed a comprehensive regulation called the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA). MiCA aims to offer legal certainty and consumer protection for crypto-asset issuers and service providers.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/euro-stablecoin-market-regulations/">Euro Stablecoin Market Set to Grow with Real-World Applications and Clear Regulations</a></p>

<p>The euro stablecoin market is poised to expand in the coming years, according to Patrick Hansen, European Union strategy and policy director at Circle. Hansen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF__4bId9zU" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a> this while speaking at the EthCC conference in Paris on Monday, July 17. Circle currently has one of the top 5 Euro-pegged stablecoins, the Euro Coin (EUROC). The firm will also be looking to grow its market share.</p>
<h2>A Dollar-Dominated Market</h2>
<p>According to Hansen, the stablecoin market is currently worth about $120 billion. However, euro stablecoins have a meager market share of about $300 million. This represents barely 0.3% of the entire stablecoin market.</p>
<p>At first glance, this may seem like the norm because the US dollar is the most-preferred currency by central banks for trading. However, the Euro is worth up to 20% of the traditional money market. This suggests the euro stablecoin market has more potential for growth. Hansen believes the stablecoin market is dominated by the dollar because it began with the US dollar. Hence, the dollar-pegged assets have been able to gain a first-mover advantage.</p>
<p>Armin Schmid, Head of Pay &amp; Stablecoins at Bitcoin Suisse AG also <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/cryptocurrency/blockchain/top-reasons-why-stablecoins-are-mostly-backed-by-us-dollar/articleshow/90796351.cms">opined</a> that the dollar-pegged stablecoins are preferred due to the negative interest rates and regulations attributable to the Euro. This, Hansen explained, is because “Liquidity begets liquidity”. With lower liquidity in the market, euro stablecoin users face higher risks and usage costs.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Clarity and Real-World Use to Aid Euro Stablecoin Market Growth</h2>
<p>As the crypto market transitions from mere speculation to real-world utility, Hansen expects the use of stablecoins to grow. Already, there are calls to begin using stablecoins in remittances and business-to-business transactions. There are also calls to integrate euro stablecoins into existing European payment systems. Hansen believes this will make users demand stablecoins in their local currency.</p>
<p>Again, decentralized finance uses like mortgage payments and car loan payments will need to be delivered in local currency. Hansen argued this should increase the size of regionalized liquidity pools and boost the euro stablecoin market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Union has recently proposed a comprehensive regulation called the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/european-union-mica-crypto-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a>. MiCA aims to offer legal certainty and consumer protection for crypto-asset issuers and service providers. Per the framework, MiCA considers payment stablecoins as a means of payment, similar to traditional fiat currency and electronic money.</p>
<p>While they will be subject to more stringent rules and supervision than other crypto-assets, the clarity will help many crypto firms. When the framework kicks off in 2024, it will create a harmonized and innovation-friendly environment that can boost the euro stablecoin market.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/att-stock-30-year-low/">AT&#038;T Stock Slumps to 30-Year Low amid Toxic Lead Cable Scandal</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/att/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&amp;T Inc</a> (NYSE: T), one of the world’s largest telecommunications companies has witnessed a significant drop in its stock value, reaching its lowest point in three decades. Shares of the company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-shares-hit-three-decade-172251397.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> tumbled by nearly 7% on Monday, as news of its involvement in the distribution of toxic lead cables spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>A recent report published by The Wall Street Journal on July 9 has brought to light a disturbing revelation involving major telecommunications giants AT&amp;T and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/verizon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verizon Communications Inc</a> (NYSE: VZ). The report names these corporations, among others, as having abandoned an enormous network of underground wires containing hazardous lead.</p>
<h2>Implications for AT&amp;T Stock</h2>
<p>AT&amp;T now faces the challenge of restoring investor confidence amidst the ongoing toxic lead cable scandal. The stock has lost a quarter of its value this year, plummeting more than 12% since the Wall Street Journal report. The stock touched a low of $13.68 on Monday, the lowest since March 1993.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T’s forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 5.95, as reported by Eikon data, stands below the industry median of 8.78. This suggests that AT&amp;T’s stock is trading at a lower valuation than its peers in the industry.</p>
<p>Notably, Verizon has also experienced a decline in its stock price, falling 5.5% to $32.14, reaching a nearly 13-year low. Since The Wall Street Journal report, Verizon’s stock has lost over 10% of its value.</p>
<p>Citi analysts, led by Michael Rollins highlighted in a recent investor note that AT&amp;T’s potential significant exposure to toxic lead cables poses unquantifiable financial risks for the company, creating a long-term overhang on its stock. With its extensive network reaching about 40% of US homes, the financial implications related to environmental cleanup, remediation efforts, and legal liabilities are causes for concern.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment, AT&amp;T Inc did not provide an immediate response to debunk the hanging fears from investors and users. However, US Telecom, a lobby group representing AT&amp;T, Verizon, and other telecoms firms, issued a statement shedding light on the considerations involved in the decision to remove or leave buried cables.</p>
<p>The group emphasized that there is currently no evidence indicating that “legacy lead-sheathed telecom cables” are the leading cause of lead exposure or public health issues.</p>
<h2>Analysts Downgrade AT&amp;T Ratings</h2>
<p>Analyst Michael Rollins from Citigroup has downgraded his rating on the company’s stock and significantly reduced the price target. Rollins downgraded the stock from “buy” to “neutral” and slashed the price target from $22 to $16. Similarly, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM) analysts, led by Philip Cusick, have joined the list of analysts downgrading their rating on AT&amp;T Inc’s stock. The analysts lowered their rating from “overweight” to “neutral” in response to the series of concerns.</p>
<p>The downgraded rating by JPMorgan further underscores the growing apprehension among analysts regarding AT&amp;T’s financial outlook and potential challenges the company may face in its core business areas.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Morningstar analyst Michael Hodel has commented that while the situation warrants attention, he does not expect the telecom industry to bear substantial legal liability.</p>
<p>Hodel’s statement reflects the belief that the potential legal consequences and financial liabilities associated with the toxic lead cables may not have a significant impact on the overall telecom industry. However, constant monitoring and assessment of the situation will be required to properly grasp the scope of any legal or financial consequences.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/barclays-xrp-ruling-coinbase/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>Several top Wall Street firms stated that Coinbase is likely to benefit the most from the improved confidence and regulatory clarity coming from the XRP ruling. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/barclays-xrp-ruling-coinbase/">Banking Giant Barclays Explains How XRP Ruling Will Be Positive for Coinbase</a></p>
<p>On Monday, July 17, British banking giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/barcays/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barclays</a> said in a research report that the recent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> ruling by the US Southern District Court shall be &#8220;incrementally positive&#8221; for crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a>.</p>
<p>“We view the ruling as incrementally positive for Coinbase, given the interpretation that in some cases a token may not be a security. This may also provide incremental clarity for future token issuances,” noted Barclays.</p>
<p>However, Coinbase has also retained the underweight rating of the Coinbase (COIN) stock with a target price of $70. On July 13, Barclays lowered the rating for the Coinbase stock from equal weight to underweight. As of Monday&#8217;s closing, the COIN stock has been trading at $105 levels.</p>
<p>The Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) stock has been the talk of the town with a staggering 142% price surge over the last five weeks. Also, the massive rally in the COIN stock price came after financial giant BlackRock named Coinbase as its preferred custodian for its spot Bitcoin ETF application.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Firms Have Bullish Call on Coinbase</h2>
<p>Other Wall Street firms like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan</a> and Needham have also given bullish calls for Coinbase. In a note last Friday, banking giant JPMorgan gave a neutral call for the COIN stock. It noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Coinbase is in the best position to benefit from the improved confidence and regulatory clarity given Coinbase’s market leading position and respected reputation in the industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Needham analyst John Todaro, who has a buy rating and a price target of $120, the recent ruling regarding Ripple&#8217;s XRP token should somewhat reduce regulatory concerns surrounding Coinbase&#8217;s stock. On Thursday, a U.S. judge ruled that XRP should not be classified as a security when sold on an exchange or through programmatic sales. Following this announcement on July 13, Coinbase&#8217;s stock has increased by approximately 30%.</p>
<p>Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management, has also mentioned that she remains bullish on Coinbase following the XRP ruling. Although the ruling didn&#8217;t fully favor Ripple, Wood expressed her satisfaction with the outcome, particularly highlighting its positive implications for crypto exchanges. Wood acknowledged that despite facing regulatory challenges, including a Wells notice in March and an SEC lawsuit in June, Coinbase&#8217;s stock price remained resilient and did not reach new lows. This resilience indicates the strong value and stability of Coinbase stock.</p>
<h2>SEC vs Coinbase</h2>
<p>The US SEC slapped a lawsuit against crypto exchange Coinbase last month over the allegations of operating as an unregistered securities exchange. As per the latest report, Coinbase chief <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brian Armstrong</a> is planning to meet the House Democrats on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sources <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-set-to-meet-with-house-democrats-1.1947023" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> that Armstrong will have private discussions with lawmakers from the New Democrat Coalition to address digital asset legislation and related concerns such as taxation, national security, privacy, and climate. This meeting is taking place while Coinbase is facing a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The Coinbase chief has been actively advocating for clearer regulations on digital assets in Washington. Coinbase, being based in the US, has been urging lawmakers to consider two circulating bills that would offer better guidance on how crypto exchanges can register with regulatory authorities.</p>
<p>The New Democrat Coalition, consisting of 100 center-left members, aims to collaborate across party lines to promote innovative, inclusive, and forward-looking policies, as stated on its website.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-bitcoin-trading-volumes-rally/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>The XRP price surge to its highest in 15 months while the trading volumes also shot up to a 10-month high following a favorable ruling in the SEC lawsuit. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/xrp-bitcoin-trading-volumes-rally/">XRP Price Surpasses Bitcoin in Trading Volumes, Rally Ahead?</a></p>
<p>On Monday, July 17, Ripple&#8217;s native cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> surpassed <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> trading volumes. Ever since the court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.879.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruling</a> of XRP not being &#8216;security&#8217;,  the trading volumes of XRP have surpassed all other cryptocurrencies in monthly trading volumes, reported Kaiko.</p>
<p>According to a research report published on July 17, there has been a significant surge in XRP trading activity since the court ruling. The report reveals a 61% increase in XRP trading volume. As of Monday morning, XRP accounted for 21% of the global trade volume, surpassing Bitcoin, which stood at 20%. Ether, on the other hand, accounted for 8% of the trading volume during that period.</p>
<p>XRP has reached its highest price in 15 months, and the trading volume has also reached its highest level in 10 months. However, the report suggests that global trading activity remains relatively low, which may explain the moderate increase in trading volume. Interestingly, the volumes of other altcoins, excluding XRP, did not experience the significant boost that was anticipated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XRP</a> has surpassed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BTC</a> as the highest volume asset 👀</p>
<p>Since last week&#39;s court ruling, 21% of all crypto trade volume has been for XRP. <a href="https://t.co/OLdTQrk1kO">pic.twitter.com/OLdTQrk1kO</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Kaiko (@KaikoData) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1680865430741700608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Soon after its ruling, Ripple&#8217;s XRP added more than $21 billion to its market cap. Although the XRP price has seen some retracement since the July 13 rally, it is still holding around $0.75 as the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of over $38 billion.</p>
<p>Kaiko&#8217;s report highlighted that XRP managed to withstand the SEC lawsuit filed in 2020 with minimal negative effects, largely due to international support. Notably, there was sustained interest, especially in South Korea, with Upbit and Bithumb reporting substantial trading volumes of $467 billion. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> also recorded over $600 billion in trades during that time.</p>
<h2>Judge Netburn Asks US SEC and Ripple to Settle Case</h2>
<p>In the recent court filing in the Southern District of New York, Judge Analisa Torres has assigned the US SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn for general pretrial matters and potential settlement discussions.</p>
<p>Judge Netburn has instructed Ripple and the US SEC to coordinate and agree upon three suitable dates for a settlement conference, provided they believe it would be beneficial at this stage.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that settlement conferences must be scheduled well in advance, typically 6-8 weeks, due to the court&#8217;s busy calendar. “The Court will likely be unable to accommodate last-minute requests for settlement conferences, and the parties should not anticipate that litigation deadlines will be adjourned in response to late requests for settlement conferences,” the filing notes.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-cbdc/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-cbdc/">Florida Governor and 2024 US Presidential Candidate Ron DeSantis Says CBDC Will Not Happen Under His Administration</a></p>
<p>The high adoption of digital assets in the United States is expected to play a crucial role in next year’s presidential election. Already, several presidential candidates have taken a stance on digital assets and the rollout of a Central Backed Digital Currency (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>). Furthermore, the digital asset economy is expected to run into more trillions of dollars in the coming years amid mainstream adoption. Moreover, institutional investors led by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK) have shown increased interest in the digital asset industry to hedge against rising inflation.</p>
<p>However, the topic of CBDC has remained extra sensitive, especially regarding government censorship and the role of the Fed on people’s funds. Furthermore, several central banks including the Brazilian and Chinese have veered away from privacy-centric CBDC. Notably, these central banks have reserved the right to freeze users’ digital currencies in a bid to remain in control.</p>
<h2>DeSantis Calls against CBDC Roll Out</h2>
<p>According to the Current Florida Governor and GOP presidential candidate Ron DeSantis, the CBDC rollout is not the future of American history. Notably, DeSantis highlighted at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa last Friday that he will revert any move to roll out a dollar digital currency in the United States as soon as he is in power.</p>
<p>“Done, dead, not happening in this country,” said DeSantis. “If I am the president, on day one, we will nix central bank digital currency.”</p>
<p>On the contrary, DeSantis has been supportive of the adoption of Bitcoin among other crypto assets describing them as a threat to the current regime. Moreover, the Biden administration has tried to use all its machinery to ban crypto assets to no avail. For instance, the US SEC has indicated that most crypto assets have been opening without proper securities registration. However, the recent SEC vs <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple</a> summary judgment has significantly vindicated the crypto community in the country.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some lawmakers have argued that the recent SEC vs Ripple judgment ruling should be passed into law. In that case, crypto assets could be classified either as a security or commodity depending on the circumstance and nature of transactions.</p>
<p>Mid-March this year, DeSantis announced comprehensive legislation to protect Floridians from the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Furthermore, DeSantis argued that CBDCs will diminish the role of community banks and credit unions in our financial system, which would hurt many enterprises in the country.</p>
<p>“The Biden administration’s efforts to inject a Centralized Bank Digital Currency is about surveillance and control,” DeSantis <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2023/03/20/governor-ron-desantis-announces-legislation-to-protect-floridians-from-a-federally-controlled-central-bank-digital-currency-and-surveillance-state/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>. “Today’s announcement will protect Florida consumers and businesses from the reckless adoption of a ‘centralized digital dollar’ which will stifle innovation and promote government-sanctioned surveillance. Florida will not side with economic central planners.”<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-hackers-key-authentication/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-hackers-key-authentication/">Microsoft Blocks All Actor Activity after Hackers Stole Key to Forge Authentication Tokens</a></p>
<p>After announcing a hit from hackers that targeted customer email, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a> has yet to release more details on how the criminals penetrated the system. The company <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/07/11/mitigation-china-based-threat-actor/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> the activity of the threat actor tracked as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/11/storm-0978-attacks-reveal-financial-and-espionage-motives/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Storm-0558</a>. Before now, hackers have targeted military and government bodies primarily in Europe, and their activities have affected the telecommunications and finance industries.</p>
<p>Microsoft explained that the China-based actor accessed email accounts, affecting about 25 organizations. As government agencies fall victim to this unpleasant situation, individuals likely to be related to these organizations were not left out. A few days later, the American technology company emphasized that an investigation is ongoing concerning the matter, and it has made efforts to enhance its protection of the systems involved. Microsoft further analyzed the techniques the hackers used to gain unauthorized access to email data, tools, and unique infrastructure characteristics.</p>
<h2>Hackers Get Hold of Microsoft Consumer Signing Keys</h2>
<p>According to Microsoft, the hackers got hold of one of its consumer signing keys, or MSA key. Meanwhile, the technology company utilizes this technology to protect consumer email accounts. At first, Microsoft assumed the hackers would forge authentication tokens with a stolen enterprise signing key, which they could use to gain control of corporate and enterprise email accounts. However, they used an acquired Microsoft account (MSA) consumer signing key to access users&#8217; email. The team noted that this was possible “by a validation error in Microsoft code”. The criminals made a mistake, making it easy for the investigators to fish them out.</p>
<p>“The use of an incorrect key to sign the requests allowed our investigation teams to see all actor access requests which followed this pattern across both our enterprise and consumer systems. Use of the incorrect key to sign this scope of assertions was an obvious indicator of the actor activity as no Microsoft system signs tokens in this way,” wrote the company.</p>
<p>Notably, the company assured that it had applied measures to block all actor activities regarding this incident. Could Microsoft mean the storm is still and the hackers have lost access? While the team did not specify how exactly it lost control of its own keys, the good news is the company has “hardened key issuance systems”.</p>
<p>Even if the threat is over and the hackers have lost control, Microsoft still needs to answer to regulators. The company now faces scrutiny over its handling of the incident. According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/12/politics/china-based-hackers-us-government-email-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CNN</a>, the State Department first detected the attack, after which it reported the matter to Microsoft. Meanwhile, not all government agencies have such facilities to notice criminal activity. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-hacking-was-undetectable-for-some-who-had-less-expensive-microsoft-services-58730629" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a> that such a level of security logging is only available to Microsoft accounts with higher-paid tier. Microsoft is indeed looking at scrutiny coming its way following the attack.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/reddit-r-cryptocurrency-moons-moon-kraken/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<p>The r/CryptoCurrency Moons (MOON), an ERC-20 token based on the Arbitrum nova and used to tip individual contributions to the subreddit, has recorded significant gains in the recent past amid the XRP-induced altcoin pump. According to the latest crypto market data, MOON is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moon/#:~:text=MOON%20Price%20Live%20Data,market%20cap%20of%20not%20available." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">trading</a> at around $0.267 during the early Asian market on Tuesday, which represented a gain of more than 82 percent in the past 24 hours. Additionally, the MOON daily traded volume spiked by more than 243 percent to about $862,243 on Tuesday. The sudden spike in MOON tokens was largely attributed to the heightened discussion of possible listing on the Kraken exchange, a leading CEX with deep liquidity and trading volume.</p>
<p>Notably, the MOON upsurge in on-chain activity began last Sunday when the token traded below 10 cents, but has since rallied more than 159 percent since then. FOMO altcoin traders have significantly proliferated the crypto market in search of a bullish trade in the past few days. However, most traders often get trapped after buying on the top when early investors are taking profits.</p>
<p>Notably, a Kraken support team responded to the Moons enthusiasts on Reddit where the response was positive for a possible listing. The Kraken support team was highlighting the importance of listing the Moons token, which could be mutually beneficial to both entities. Moreover, the MOON community would benefit from enhanced trading liquidity while Kraken would attract more cryptocurrency traders.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Kraken support team on Twitter highlighted that the listing of MOONS tokens will only be revealed through the company’s social media handles and blog posts.</p>

<p>Currently, MOON tokens are available for trading on MEXC, Gate.io, and Sushiswap V3.</p>
<h2>Closer Look at Reddit and Moons Crypto Asset</h2>
<p>Reddit has made significant entrance into the blockchain and cryptocurrency market mostly through the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> market. Furthermore, Reddit is already working closely with the Polygon (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MATIC</a>) team in providing users a scalable and secure Ethereum access. The social media platform has in the past struggled to make profits amid increased competition, especially from Twitter in the same category.</p>
<p>As a result, Reddit has changed its terms of service to fit in with the evolving Web3 industry. Moreover, social media users are more attracted to engaging platforms that reward them for their contributions. In the updated terms of service on Reddit, users can trade virtual items that are cryptographically verified including avatars.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The interesting part:</p>
<p>Verified Goods:</p>
<p>“You may be able to earn, claim, purchase, sell, or give certain virtual avatars, goods, currencies, or items that can be cryptographically verified”</p>
<p>Unlike the previous TOS where trading Points were prohibited.<a href="https://t.co/n3O4DZCLGm">https://t.co/n3O4DZCLGm</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Reddit is exploring ways to get profitable in the highly competitive market and an Initial Public Offering (IPO) is reportedly likely during the second half of 2023.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-gensler-court-ripple/" rel="prev">next</a></p>
