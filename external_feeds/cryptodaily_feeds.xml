			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The ambitious social metaverse and Web3 startup Peer has hit a major milestone with the launch of its next-generation social app, available to download on iOS devices from today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Peer app is a novel social experience created using augmented reality technology and a proprietary ecosystem that enables people to explore and interact with the world around them in new ways, the startup explains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the world&rsquo;s a game and Peer makes everyone a player,&rdquo; said Peer founder and Chief Executive Tony Tran. &ldquo;Get ready for a new kind of social network that&rsquo;s all about fun, joy and gamification at its core.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to Peer, the app combines geo-location technology with adaptive 3D maps to create a &ldquo;game-like experience&rdquo; of the physical world. With Peer, users will be able to customize and share maps of their own, unique social world, pinning their stories, memories and moments to real-world locations for others to find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand what Peer is really about, try to think of it as a social network experienced in AR graphics overlaid across the real world. With it, users will be able to explore their physical location and locate digital objects and information that&rsquo;s posted within their surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peer will make it possible to overlay 3D graphics on top of the real world, integrating new experiences into our everyday lives. Unlike other social networks which simply focus on getting people to scroll through a newsfeed with their eyes glued to their device, Peer genuinely wants to get people out and about, interacting with real people and locations in the physical world. As part of this approach, users will be incentivized to post and explore digital content that&rsquo;s tied to specific geographic locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone who&rsquo;s feeling hungry will be able to use Peer to facilitate their search for a bite to eat. Simply open up the Peer map and look for nearby restaurants, and you&rsquo;ll find directions overlaid onto the real world to make it easier to find them. As that person arrives at their chosen eatery, they may be able to pick up a digital coupon posted outside by the owner of the business, giving them a 10% discount on their meal. At the same time, the user will be able to check reviews from previous customers, helping them to decide if they want to give the menu a try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses will be able to use Peer to enhance their marketing efforts in creative ways. As an example, Peer created a video showing how an aquarium or dinosaur museum might get the attention of visitors by creating marine animals that swim across the skies, or virtual dinosaurs that roam around outside, enticing people to come and take a closer look.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Peer explains, the Peer app is designed to enable discovery, community-building and other kinds of real-life activities. It will act as a creative canvas anyone can use to design and develop digital experiences that enhance our lives in the real world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an ambitious idea that has the potential to achieve one of the major promises of the metaverse, morphing digital elements into physical reality.</p>
<p>Peer said the Peer app is available to download on iOS devices now from the Apple App Store, and will be joined by an Android version that&rsquo;s due to launch later this year. The company is also reported to be working on an AR headset that will make it possible to experience Peer in the most immersive way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, iOS users can expect to see additional features arrive in Peer soon. &ldquo;In the coming months, we will deepen AI integration and deploy features that are sure to spark a new era of global interconnectedness,&rdquo; Tran promised. &ldquo;No social network puts the world in your hands like Peer.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Large Stops Below 27991:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 9 August 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) awaited fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair remained unable to sustain moves above the 29500 area and continues to battle with areas of technical resistance.&nbsp; &nbsp;The inability to revisit last month&rsquo;s multi-month high around the 31862 area has resulted in bearish momentum and has seen the pair orbit the 28960 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the appreciating range from 19568.52 to 31862.21.&nbsp; &nbsp;Large Stops are cited below the 27991.29 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 15460 to 31862.21.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional areas of technical support and potential buying pressure in these appreciating ranges include the 27466, 27166, 26428, 26272, and 25715 areas.</p>
<p>Additional downside price objectives linked to recent selling pressure include the 28432, 28213, 28137, 27979, 27757, 27430, 27409, 27338, 27312, 27246, 26501, 26348, and 26199 levels.&nbsp; Also, the 28095.44 area represents the 23.6% retracement of the historic depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the market, upside price objectives include the 30526, 30611, 30762, and 31145 areas.&nbsp; Upside price objectives related to other levels of buying pressure include the 32125 and 33569 areas, and Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 32043, 34531, 34658, and 35912 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 29176.03 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 29041.31.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett, the US government debt is predicted to rise to $50 trillion by 2033.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the astonishing and ridiculous state our financial system has got into, and the vast majority of US citizens will probably just shrug their shoulders and carry on.</p>
An unfair downgrade?
<p>That the US was recently downgraded from triple A to double A+ was heavily lamented in US government and banking circles. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called it &ldquo;puzzling&rdquo;, &ldquo;entirely unwarranted&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;flawed assessment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, said that the downgrade was &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t really matter&rdquo;, and that the markets would decide rather than the Fitch rating agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these heads of finance were hardly going to say that Fitch was absolutely right to make the downgrade, and so their hollow protests were probably to be expected. However, many will take them at their word and wonder why Fitch made this awful decision&hellip;</p>
Of course we can print money out of thin air, we&rsquo;re the US government
<p>So the already impossible and insurmountable US debt figure is set to rise from the current $32.5 trillion to around $50 trillion over the next 10 years. Given that this is a figure produced by a banker, perhaps the eventual figure might even be much higher.</p>
<p>In congress, there are those who revel in the special privilege that the US wields with the dollar as the world&rsquo;s reserve currency. Brad Sherman is a staunchly anti-crypto congressman, always using his power and influence to malign and demean Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When accusing &ldquo;crypto bros&rdquo; of printing $1 trillion from thin air during a key congressional committee, he speculated that these same people might accuse the US government of doing the same thing. He said &ldquo;perhaps we do&rdquo; and vindicated the act by saying &ldquo;we&rsquo;re the US government&rdquo;. When certain congressmen/women and senators have such a view, it is no wonder the US is in the impossible situation it is in.&nbsp;</p>
From the dollar sinking ship to the Bitcoin liferaft
<p>So, we know that the US is going to add to its debt mountain over the next 10 years at least, as it spends like a drunken sailor, injecting scandalous amounts of new currency into the system, leading to currency debasement on a massive scale and leaving its citizens to shoulder the cost.</p>
<p>Bitcoin on the other hand has a fixed supply built into its code. As its halving approaches in April of next year and its supply is cut in half, expect a tsunami of wealth to leave the sinking ship which is the dollar and climb aboard the Bitcoin liferaft.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The law firm representing FTX, Fenwick &amp; West, has been slapped with a class action lawsuit by a group of FTX customers for allegedly aiding in fraud. </p>
<p>Fenwick &amp; West, the law firm representing the fallen crypto exchange FTX, has been sued by a group of former FTX customers. The customers accused the firm of aiding in fraud via its legal advice to the exchange, Reuters reports.</p>
FTX Lawyers Face Class Action Lawsuit
<p>According to the complaint lodged on August 7, Fenwick &amp; West allegedly offered service to the exchange that &ldquo;went well beyond those a law firm should and usually does provide.&rdquo; The complaint states the firm&rsquo;s services included structuring transactions to avoid regulatory attention and setting up entities that helped FTX&rsquo;s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and other exchange executives engage in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>The current complaint is the second to be lodged against Fenwick concerning its dealings with FTX. Previous reports state that the firm Gibson Dunn was appointed to represent Fenwick on similar issues related to the exchange, including in the criminal case against SBF and a federal class action lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, Fenwick acted as the primary outside legal representative for the now-bankrupt exchange and therefore had a unique insight into FTX&rsquo;s &ldquo;convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices,&rdquo; Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The dealings between Fenwick and FTX also extend to Daniel Friedberg. Mr Friedberg was a leading regulatory attorney for the exchange and joined FTX in 2020 from Fenwick. FTX&rsquo;s new management is now suing Friedberg.</p>
Fenwick Allegedly Helps Conceal FTX Executives&rsquo; Use of Customer Fund for Speculative Investments
<p>The complaint further alleges that Fenwick &amp; West assisted in setting up two entities used to hide exchange executives&rsquo; use of customer funds to make speculative investments and political donations.</p>
<p>The law firm allegedly also advised on transactions that helped the exchange obtain regulatory licenses without having to apply directly to the necessary regulators.</p>

<p>According to the complaint lodged on August 7, Fenwick &amp; West allegedly offered service to the exchange that &ldquo;went well beyond those a law firm should and usually does provide.&rdquo; The complaint states the firm&rsquo;s services included structuring transactions to avoid regulatory attention and setting up entities that helped FTX&rsquo;s former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, and other exchange executives engage in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>The current complaint is the second to be lodged against Fenwick concerning its dealings with FTX. Previous reports state that the firm Gibson Dunn was appointed to represent Fenwick on similar issues related to the exchange, including in the criminal case against SBF and a federal class action lawsuit.</p>
<p>According to the court filing, Fenwick acted as the primary outside legal representative for the now-bankrupt exchange and therefore had a unique insight into FTX&rsquo;s &ldquo;convoluted organizational structure, abject lack of internal controls, and dubious business practices,&rdquo; Reuters reports.</p>
<p>The dealings between Fenwick and FTX also extend to Daniel Friedberg. Mr Friedberg was a leading regulatory attorney for the exchange and joined FTX in 2020 from Fenwick. FTX&rsquo;s new management is now suing Friedberg.</p>
Fenwick Allegedly Helps Conceal FTX Executives&rsquo; Use of Customer Fund for Speculative Investments
<p>The complaint further alleges that Fenwick &amp; West assisted in setting up two entities used to hide exchange executives&rsquo; use of customer funds to make speculative investments and political donations.</p>
<p>The law firm allegedly also advised on transactions that helped the exchange obtain regulatory licenses without having to apply directly to the necessary regulators.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is nearing a critical crossroads concerning ARK's application for a spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). With the August 13 deadline on the horizon, the financial world watches closely for the SEC's decisive verdict.</p>
Potential Delay Until 2024
<p>ARK Invest&rsquo;s official Bitcoin ETF submission on May 15 kicked off the SEC's countdown clock. It was followed by another filing on June 15 which preset the deadline as August 15, by which the SEC must express its approval or disapproval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the SEC can prolong the waiting game by 240 days, pushing the final response to January 10, 2024, for ARK Invest&rsquo;s proposal and March 2024 for other applicants.</p>
<p>Speaking on the topic, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood noted that there is a high probability of the SEC delaying the matter further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When asked about the August deadline, Wood said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I think you're probably right that Aug. 13 will come and go. I think the SEC, if it's going to approve a bitcoin ETF, will approve more than one at once."</p>

A Crowded Field of Aspirants
<p>ARK isn't alone in its quest for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Numerous organizations, including Bitwise, BlackRock, VanEck, WisdomTree, Valkyrie, First Trust Galaxy, and Fidelity Wise Origin, have entered the Bitcoin ETF fray. Grayscale also seeks to convert its Bitcoin Trust into an ETF. If the SEC greenlights any one of these applications, the call for fair and equal approvals among the other applicants will gain extra momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This wave of applications stands apart due to a "surveillance sharing" pact with exchanges like Nasdaq and Cboe. The agreement's goal is to exchange market trading data, customer ID info, and clearing activity details. This move aims to curb market manipulation risks and protect investor funds against unauthorized use, addressing previous SEC concerns.</p>
SEC's Reserved Move - The Waiting Game
<p>Observers speculate that the SEC won't budge unless compelled. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's lawsuit serves as inspiration on how to tackle the agency and its unbudging stance on ETFs. The court case has prompted the SEC to clarify its stance, highlighting its approval of Bitcoin futures agreements with similar monitoring provisions. This legal tussle may lead to a more transparent decision-making process.</p>
<p>While optimism grows in the crypto community, doubts remain about the SEC's approval of a Spot Bitcoin ETF. Critics recall the SEC's decade-long streak of rejecting such applications. Nevertheless, the approval of a leveraged Bitcoin ETF and a surge in Ethereum futures ETF applications hint at a shifting regulatory environment. Bloomberg Intelligence gives a 65% chance for approval, considering the Grayscale lawsuit and potential political influences.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Nowadays, no one manually searches for crypto spreads anymore; everyone uses bots for cryptocurrency arbitrage. There are two types of arbitrage bots: automatic and manual.</p>
What are the differences?
<p>Automatic arbitrage bots are bots where you set limits on spreads, coins, and exchanges. The bots themselves place orders or buy cryptocurrencies. All automatic bots work through APIs. Due to this, the risk of using automatic bots is significantly higher since you are essentially granting access to your funds to a third-party application.</p>
<p>Manual arbitrage bots are bots that provide information on spreads through separate applications, messengers, or even SMS. You still choose the limits, coins, and exchanges.</p>
<p>Today, we will review arbitrage bots and rank them based on the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Security</p>
<p>2. User reviews</p>
<p>3. Functionality</p>
<p>4. Prices</p>
<p>5. Additional features</p>
<p>We will evaluate each criterion on a 5-point scale and calculate the arithmetic mean to determine the best cryptocurrency arbitrage bot.</p>
ArbitrageScanner
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's start with the first-place bot - ArbitrageScanner with a rating of 4.8.</p>
<p>This service supports 60 CEX exchanges, 40 DEX exchanges, and more than 30 blockchains! The service even supports local exchanges in Turkey, Korea, and Latin America. Let's break down why it is ranked number one for cryptocurrency arbitrage scanning.</p>
<p>1. Security: 5/5</p>
<p>ArbitrageScanner is a manual cryptocurrency arbitrage bot. It sends you notifications about exchange rate differences on Telegram. This bot works without requesting API access, meaning all possible risks associated with your funds are eliminated. All exchanges connected to ArbitrageScanner have been verified and are safe to use.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 5/5</p>
<p>We couldn't find any significant negative reviews online. There were a couple of users who were dissatisfied that the service wasn't working, but we verified that the project's official channels mentioned technical work, updates, and expanded functionality. Users' reviews in personal blogs are positive, and reviews from news resources are also positive.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 5/5</p>
<p>The scanner works with a vast number of CEX, DEX, and blockchains. It is the most accurate scanner based on our measurements, always showing you the current cryptocurrency prices on exchanges. This alone gives it a high rating, but the service's development team has also created a screener for cryptocurrency arbitrage, which we'll discuss further in the Additional Features section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>4. Prices: 4/5</p>
<p>The minimum tariff costs $70, but we recommend paying attention to the Expert tariff at $399. It is ideal for both beginner and expert arbitrage traders. Opting for a more expensive tariff provides increased limits, allowing you to set up 30 different coins simultaneously, 15 different Telegram channels, and more. What caught our attention the most is that this tariff includes free access to the second service we mentioned earlier - the Arbitrage Screener. Additionally, you gain access to an arbitrage trader community, where experienced specialists share successful strategies, insights, and current spreads that can be profitable. The price of $399 doesn't seem too high, especially when you are offered numerous earning opportunities. There is also a free trial available.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 5/5</p>
<p>Under additional features, we consider what the service offers besides its main product. ArbitrageScanner provides numerous additional functions.</p>
<p>- Closed chat for arbitrage traders, where both the scanner team and the community share cases and hot opportunities.</p>
<p>- Educational materials, providing training on how to use the scanner, real cases, how to find arbitrage opportunities, and how to set up the service.</p>
<p>- Screener: This is the second product available to users with Pro and higher subscriptions. It displays all possible spreads that you set up across different exchanges and coins. This tool complements the scanner perfectly. You configure the screener to find the exchanges and coins with the largest spreads at that moment. Then, you switch to the scanner, set the settings for those exchanges and coins, and it shows you the most current spreads. Perfect for those who want to earn profits!</p>
<p>- The website offers a free profitability calculator for arbitrage. Even if you don't have a subscription yet, you can calculate how much you can earn on arbitrage with a specific cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>- Some users have been given access to beta testing of another product called Telegram Scanner. This tool allows you to search for all mentions of your chosen cryptocurrency or topic in all Telegram chats. It sends all mentions of your keyword to a separate chat, and with a single click, you can respond to the original messages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
3Commas
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In second place, we have 3Commas with a rating of 4.2.</p>
<p>This is one of the most popular automatic bots at the moment, suitable for cryptocurrency arbitrage. However, it has its small downsides:</p>
<p>1. Security: 4/5</p>
<p>While this bot has not been associated with fund theft or hacking, we cannot give it the highest rating. It uses APIs for operation, like all automatic bots, which poses a security threat to your finances.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 4/5</p>
<p>User reviews are generally good, but there are negative reviews regarding the service's performance. Some users complain about the delayed support response, but we do not consider these to be critical drawbacks of the project.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The service offers automatic arbitrage, but only on a single exchange. Due to the large number of users, it is very difficult to automatically earn profits using this service as there is significant competition among arbitrage traders using the same bot. There is inter-exchange arbitrage available on 16 CEX exchanges, but compared to the number supported by the first-place service in our ranking, this seems very limited. Moreover, 3Commas does not support DEX exchanges, which are now considered the new frontier for arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The service offers a 7-day free trial, which is much longer than its competitors. The tariff prices range from $29 to $99, which is quite competitive for the services provided.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 4/5</p>
<p>This is the most interesting aspect, considering what additional features each product offers. 3Commas provides:</p>
<p>- 5 bots for manual trading and 9 for automatic trading, but most of them are available in the highest subscription.</p>
<p>- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<p>- An internal portfolio rebalancer.</p>
Bitsgap
<p></p>
<p>In the third place in our ranking is Bitsgap with a rating of 3.6.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot that supports 15 CEX exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 4/5</p>
<p>As we mentioned before, automatic bots are not safe to use. Here, we encounter the first confirmation of this statement. Some users reported that funds went missing from their accounts. It could be malicious competition, but we cannot overlook these statements.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 3/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed, with complaints about poor support, delayed bot performance, and some exchanges periodically not functioning. As mentioned before, there are also claims about missing funds. On the other hand, some users did not experience such issues. While we cannot recommend using this bot, we also cannot claim that it is developed by dishonest developers.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The functionality does not stand out among automatic arbitrage bots. It supports 15 CEX exchanges and lacks DEX exchanges. Otherwise, it duplicates or even lacks certain features compared to 3Commas.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The minimum tariff is $23, and the maximum is $119. The difference between tariffs is minimal, and in the market, this is a relatively high price for the services provided.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 2/5</p>
<p>The service offers an arbitrage profitability blog and knowledge base, and unfortunately, that's all the additional functionality it provides.</p>
Coinrule
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fourth place on the list of arbitrage bots is Coinrule with a rating of 3.4.</p>
<p>This is an automatic bot for arbitrage that supports 10 CEX exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 2/5</p>
<p>Once again, this is an automatic bot that uses API. There are also articles about users of this bot losing their funds, but we cannot vouch for the accuracy of this information. It could also be the work of competitors, but we cannot ignore these claims.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 3/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed. Many find it challenging to work with, even for experienced arbitrage traders. There are also negative reviews about missing funds, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 4/5</p>
<p>The bot supports only 10 CEX exchanges, and configuring it requires significant effort. Its functionality does not stand out compared to other automatic bots we reviewed today.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 5/5</p>
<p>The price for this product is $30 - $450 per month, which is above average considering the intuitiveness of the service's management and prices for similar features among competitors.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 3/5</p>
<p>- Marketplace of arbitrage strategies&nbsp;</p>
HaasOnline
<p></p>
<p>In the fifth place in our ranking is HaasOnline with a rating of 2.8.</p>
<p>It is also an automatic bot that shows spreads between four 24 exchanges.</p>
<p>1. Security: 3/5</p>
<p>Since it is an automatic trading service, security is at an average level. This service has not been involved in hacking or fund theft from its users. Like any other automatic bot, it also requires API access.</p>
<p>2. User reviews: 4/5</p>
<p>User reviews are mixed. Many share their success stories of earning with this service, but there are also users who claim to have lost their funds. Some even reported that they couldn't make their subscription profitable using this bot.</p>
<p>3. Functionality: 2/5</p>
<p>This bot supports only four of the most popular exchanges, resulting in high competition among arbitrage traders and users of the service. This makes finding good spreads more challenging.</p>
<p>4. Prices: 2/5</p>
<p>The price for this product is $9 &ndash; $149 for a month, a reasonably acceptable price for what this bot provides.</p>
<p>5. Additional features: 3/5</p>
<p>This service offers additional features available to users:</p>
<p>- A demo account where you can try out your strategies.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud server (it's not safe)&nbsp;</li>
<li>We have highlighted some arbitrage bots that we believe are the most comprehensive and reflect the cryptocurrency arbitrage market. We recommend trying out ArbitrageScanner, even if you have used other bots that are not in our top list. We believe it is truly a market leader that other services will adapt to.</li>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a groundbreaking move, video game commerce giant Xsolla has teamed up with cryptocurrency platform, Crypto.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration of Crypto.com's checkout solution into Xsolla's Pay Station platform heralds a new era in the gaming world and is a bold move forward for Crypto.com in its quest to carve a niche in the gaming sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration promises to offer game enthusiasts and developers a seamless way to embrace cryptocurrency payments, ensuring smoother transactions and an enriched user experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the digital realm and metaverse grow, the partnership ensures gamers have plenty of payment options at their fingertips. Eric Anziani, the COO of Crypto.com, expressed his enthusiasm, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is significant potential in the convergence of gaming and Web3. By partnering with a global gaming leader like Xsolla and leveraging our respective assets and expertise, we are helping make that potential a reality &ndash; giving developers, publishers, and players a seamless way to engage and create value in the crypto economy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xsolla's Pay Station, already a powerhouse facilitating in-game purchases across a vast expanse of over 200 regions, is set to amplify its offerings with the Crypto.com Pay integration. This move is poised to broaden horizons for game developers, allowing them to connect with a diverse audience and explore untapped markets and revenue avenues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris Hewish, the head honcho at Xsolla, noted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The gaming industry is rapidly evolving, and we must adapt to meet those changes. The integration of cryptocurrencies as a form of payment offers game developers and players an innovative payment solution that aligns with the global shift towards digital currencies. Our collaboration with Crypto.com marks a pivotal moment for the gaming industry, paving the way for a more inclusive and secure gaming ecosystem.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a similar note, Patrick Yoon, who oversees Crypto.com's operations in Korea, added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are tremendously excited to take this first step with Xsolla as part of a broader collaboration initiative in Korea and on a global level. We look forward to continuing to work with Xsolla in developing and advancing payment ecosystems and digital asset adoption.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This joint enterprise between Crypto exchange Crypto.com and global video game commerce company Xsolla offers much potential for further integration of crypto and gaming. The availability of crypto payments for gamers is likely to stimulate both sectors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto investing app Libertify is calling on retail investors to up their game with the launch of a new offering that provides free, AI-powered risk assessments and instant optimization proposals for their portfolios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify is the creator of an AI-powered app that uses intelligent algorithms powered by neural networks to recommend portfolio adjustments, with the goal being to optimize user&rsquo;s portfolios and hedge against any risk they might be exposed to. The startup believes it can provide a valuable service to investors, given the notorious volatility of the crypto market and the instability of digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its new offering, Libertify says it will provide a free audit of the user&rsquo;s crypto portfolio, followed by an instant optimization proposal, with recommendations on the adjustments investors should make to hedge against risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The offering works with just about any kind of digital wallet, including software wallets such as Binance, Coinbase and MetaMask, as well as hardware wallets like Ledger, Libertify said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify CEO Steve Rosenblum said last year&rsquo;s crypto winter shows that it&rsquo;s time for investors to learn from the past. The company&rsquo;s portfolio audits provide investors with a unique way to scan risk exposure, he explained. The launch of its offering is well-timed too, as the market for crypto retail investors is growing rapidly. Whereas there were around 200 million crypto investors globally in 2017, that number is expected to rise to more than 1.6 billion by 2025.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an intriguing offering that will enable retail investors to benefit from the same kind of risk management solutions that were previously only available to the biggest banks and financial institutions, Libertify said. Until now, retail investors have always had to rely on their own insights and abilities to analyze the crypto market, but this approach is fraught with danger. As Rosenblum explains, by following their instincts, investors often make irrational choices, increasing the chance of them suffering considerable losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Libertify&rsquo;s AI-powered recommendations and proposals enable crypto investors to better protect themselves against market volatility, while still holding onto the assets they believe in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto users buy tokens based on their beliefs and hopes, often forgetting that the crypto market is a turbo of volatility,&rdquo; Rosenblum said. &ldquo;Simple and efficient, our industry-first AI risk management solution brings new hope for all self-directed investors still shocked by the last crypto crisis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The capabilities of Libertify&rsquo;s app were validated earlier this year when it was announced as the winner of the Paris leg of the Fast Track Hong-Kong FinTech, a prestigious annual contest for fintech and wealthtech startups that provides opportunities to secure funding and mentorships from some of Hong Kong&rsquo;s biggest financial firms. Having won that leg, Libertify will face off against 11 other startups in November&rsquo;s grand finale.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Yield Guild Games surged nearly 600% in less than a week, smashing through the top gainers charts before abruptly crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to reports, a new Binance trading product and an ongoing community gaming event have played a pivotal role in the incredible price rally of the YGG token.&nbsp;</p>
YGG Token Surges&nbsp;
<p>According to data from CoinmarketCap, the Yield Guild Games (YGG) token saw a dramatic surge over the past week, rising by 580% and reaching a peak of $0.93 on the 7th of August, 2023. However, the token abruptly crashed soon after reaching this price level and is currently trading at around $0.36. However, the token had hinted at a decline in price in its gradually dropping trading volume. The trading volume recorded a drop of 26% in 24 hours, falling under $500 million, while the market cap increased by $17 million, reaching $161 million.&nbsp;</p>
Why Did The YGG Price Rally?&nbsp;
<p>Observers attributed the surge in the YGG token&rsquo;s price to a couple of major factors. On the 3rd of August, Yield Guild Games announced the 4th season of the Guild Advancement Program (GAP). The Guild Advancement Program is a periodic gaming event that distributes rewards such as tokens to community members who successfully complete specified quests in participating in YGG-affiliated games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 4th season of Yield Guild Games includes some of the biggest names in the space, such as Splinterlands, Skyweaver, and Axie Infinity. As a result, it should come as no surprise that the Yield Guild Games network usage saw a spike, reaching a one-month high of 192 active addresses. Yield Guild Games stated in its press release,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some of the community&rsquo;s most recent top picks are joining the fold this season, with all-new quests for guild members to dive into as they hone their skills and establish their web3 reputation. The season will officially begin on the 3rd of August, 2023, and will run until the 27th of September, 2023.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Barely a day later, Binance announced plans to launch a YGG/USDT trading pair for perpetual contracts on its CEX platform, allowing up to 20x leverage. Available on-chain data suggests that the announcement brought in about $100 million worth of new capital into the YGG ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
Whales Dumping Share Of YGG
<p>While the growth has been quite notable, reports have emerged of venture capital companies who initially backed the project, reportedly looking to sell their share of YGG on Binance. Data from LookOnChain sourced on the 7th of August shows that Bitkraft Ventures and DWF Labs have moved their YGG holdings to Binance and are most likely looking to sell. DWF Labs had received around 29 million YGG from the Yield Guild Games Treasury. However, on-chain data has suggested that most of these tokens have been moved to exchanges. Bitkraft Ventures also made large deposits on Binance using FalconX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another whale, Wintermute Trading, has reportedly deposited just over 11 million YGG worth $6.7 million to different exchanges over the past four days. It currently holds a further 2.5 million YGG, valued at around $1.5 million. LookOnChain also showed that Youbi Capital had deposited around 1 million YGG to Binance. The firm currently holds about 11 million YGG. Sfermion has also jumped on board the selling wagon, using FalconX to deposit its YGG tokens on Binance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large deposits generally signify an investor&rsquo;s willingness to exchange the token for other assets or sell them. This is also true of whales such as the ones mentioned earlier. Smaller investors generally tend to follow larger investors, copying their selling behavior.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Steadefi has become the latest DeFi entity to be hit with an exploit, with the company stating in a tweet on X that all the funds it currently holds are at risk of becoming irrecoverable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent hacks have taken a toll on the space and have put considerable strain on public trust in DeFi apps.</p>
Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>News of the attack first became public on the 7th of August, when it emerged that the decentralized finance app was hit by an exploit of at least $334,000. While the attack was ongoing, the protocol&rsquo;s development team put out a message on X, stating that the attack had put all funds held on the platform at risk and they could become irrecoverable. As a result, the app&rsquo;s total value locked (TVL) fell off a cliff, according to data from DefiLlama. The team posted a message stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;NOTICE: Steadefi has been exploited, and all funds are currently at risk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team, while confirming the attack, posted a follow-up message on X and explained how the attack occurred. According to the message, the hacker managed to gain access to the private key of the team&rsquo;s deployer wallet and perform OwnerOnly functions. After gaining access to OwnerOnly functions, the hacker executed several OwnerOnly actions, such as allowing any wallet to borrow funds from lending vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team further stated that the attacker managed to drain all loanable funds. However, it assured users that all collateral held in vaults and not lent out was secure. This is because the app does not contain OwnerOnly functions to remove deposits. This means those users who deposited funds to the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;strategy&rdquo; vaults could withdraw some of their funds.&nbsp;</p>
Farming Contracts Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the hacker also stopped farming contracts through an OwnerOnly function. This means all users who deposited svTokens or ibTokens to farms are currently unable to withdraw their funds. The post states that the funds are essentially stuck in the app&rsquo;s contracts, with token holders who deposited into the farms left in the lurch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to details currently available, the tokens transferred to the address in question include 130,429 USD Coin, 3.39 BTC, 6184 Avalanche (AVAX), and 15 Wrapped Ether (WETH). Apart from the Wrapped Ether, all other tokens were immediately swapped for WETH. The attacker then bridged 184 WETH to another network via the Synapse Bridge.&nbsp;</p>
Steadefi Attempts To Negotiate With Hackers&nbsp;
<p>The development team also confirmed that it is attempting to negotiate with the hackers and has sent an on-chain message to the hacker&rsquo;s address, 0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc, on Ethereum. Blockchain data has revealed that the address saw a large number of inflows on the Avalanche Chain. The development team seems to have taken a leaf out of Curve Finance, Metronome, and Alchemix&rsquo;s playbook, offering 10% of the stolen funds as a bounty in return for the remaining 90%. The team also told the hacker that should they return the funds, there would be no involvement of law enforcement agencies or legal actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Steadefi would like to discuss a bounty with any parties who were involved in the recent Steadefi exploit. We are offering a 10% bounty of any funds stolen, which are yours to keep if you return the remaining 90%.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, like Curve, in a stark warning, the team added that should the hackers refuse the offer, Steadefi would offer the 10% as a bounty to anyone in the public who could identify or supply information that leads to a conviction. Clearly, Steadefi hopes to see the funds return without any further complications. However, the platform is more than willing to fight for the funds should it need to. The offer expires on the 10th of August at 0800 UTC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will have no risk of us pursuing this further, no risk of law enforcement issues, etc. If you choose not to partake in the voluntary return and complete the process by the 10th of August at 0800 UTC, we will expand the bounty to the public and offer the full 10% to the person who is able to identify you in a way that leads to your conviction in the courts. We will pursue you from all angles with the full extent of the law.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi&rsquo;s Hacker Headache&nbsp;
<p>Crypto and DeFi remain highly vulnerable to bad actors, even as the space looks for wider acceptance. Last month, Coinspaid fell victim to an attack orchestrated by the dreaded Lazarus Group, a North Korean-backed hacker group. An analysis showed how the breach occurred and found multiple vulnerabilities in Coinspaid&rsquo;s security. At the beginning of August, decentralized exchange LeetSwap suspended trading thanks to fears of a potential exploit. Bankrupt crypto platform Voyager also suffered a breach in the middle of its court-supervised recovery process. Another August heist saw a scammer steal around $20 million worth of USDT through a zero transfer phishing attack. However, Tether was quick to respond, freezing the attacker&rsquo;s address and blacklisting them.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Cypher Protocol, a decentralized futures exchange operating on the Solana blockchain, disclosed on August 7th that a significant security breach occurred on their platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The breach led to an estimated unauthorized transfer of assets valued at around $1 million. Swiftly addressing the event, Cypher Protocol informed its community of followers on X (formerly Twitter) and took immediate action by freezing its associated smart contract.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A statement from the firm emphasized their responsive action:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Cypher has experienced a security incident. The smart contract has been frozen. Investigations are ongoing. The team is currently working with individuals and investigating. To the hacker: We are writing to see whether you would be open to speaking with us about any potential next steps."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Data sourced from the Solana blockchain explorer, Solscan, has been invaluable in providing insights into the breach. It appears that the attacker or attackers absconded with a considerable 38,530 Solana (SOL) tokens in addition to $123,184 USD Coin (USDC). In sum, these unauthorized transactions amounted to roughly $1,035,203. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">What has raised eyebrows in the aftermath of the breach was the movement of the alleged funds. Within a short span following the exploit, a sum of 30,000 USDC from the contentious wallet was rerouted to Binance&rsquo;s specific Solana USDC address. The rapidity of these fund movements highlights the speed at which digital assets can change hands, emphasizing the need for robust security measures and real-time monitoring.</p>
Community Response and Calls for Accountability
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The aftermath of the exploit was punctuated by unique, digital-era responses. Members from the cryptocurrency community sent a series of NFTs to the suspected wallet. These weren&rsquo;t typical assets, but they bore messages &ndash; some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol&rsquo;s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.</p>

These weren&rsquo;t typical assets, but they bore messages &ndash; some of which appealed to the hacker's conscience to return the stolen funds. Among the various messages, one read:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Seriously though, you used Binance and KuCoin to fund and to try and get 30k out. People will find you. Please do the right thing and give the rest back."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The timing of this security breach was rather inopportune, as it coincided with Cypher Protocol&rsquo;s collaborative mtnDAO hacker house event, which they co-hosted with another Solana protocol, Marginfi. Ensuring clarity and dispelling doubts about their own security, Marginfi swiftly relayed via their Telegram channel that they remained unaffected by the breach and continue to maintain their operational independence from Cypher.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As of the time of reporting, no Solana-based funds have been detected as transferred to the Ethereum network, leaving the next steps of the alleged hacker unpredictable.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Incidents like these not only impact the entities directly involved but also reverberate throughout the crypto community. They underscore the persistent challenges in the realm of digital security and emphasize the need for continuous improvements in safeguarding digital assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Less than a day after PayPal&rsquo;s huge announcement, Ethereum became flooded by imposter tokens trying to ride the hype.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The digital payments and fintech giant announced the official launch of its very own Ethereum-based stablecoin PayPal USD (PYUSD) yesterday August 7. PYUSD is an ERC-20 token which will be pegged to the US dollar at a fixed rate of $1. It will be primarily used as a bridge between fiat currencies and web3, enabling conversion of any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PYUSD. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch has been the result of PayPal&rsquo;s own exploration into stablecoins at least as far back as January 2022 but which was temporarily halted due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The launch might mean that an agreement has been made between regulators and PayPal&rsquo;s stablecoin issuer Paxos. Now, the launch has been received with much fanfare, with the stablecoin finally rolling out to customers &ldquo;in the coming weeks.&rdquo; </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, this has not stopped scammers from riding the hype and launching fake PayPal stablecoins; which have since flooded cryptocurrency exchanges such as Uniswap. This was in part due to PayPal and Paxos&rsquo; own failure to include the official token address for PYUSD in their respective announcements. Users were then quick to inform PayPal about the problem. Finally, after more than a day since the PYUSD announcement, Paxos has released the official smart contract for PYUSD and the corresponding token address and GitHub repository. Currently, the max total supply of PYUSD sits at 26.9 million according to etherscan.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of PayPal&rsquo;s own stablecoin could send waves throughout the crypto industry in the United States. The fact that a stablecoin was released could mean that the current hostile environment for crypto in the country might start to somewhat cool down.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Blockchain.com, one of the earlier players and brands in the crypto exchange space, has secured a payments license from Singapore's regulatory body, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This move follows an in-principle approval granted to the platform in the previous year. With this license, Blockchain.com now joins a group of other service providers in the nation, which includes Circle, DBS Vickers, and Revolut.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MAS's decision to grant Blockchain.com its license signifies the evolving stance of regulatory bodies towards digital currencies and payment platforms. Licenses from entities like MAS are instrumental in validating a platform's adherence to regional financial and operational norms. For an industry often scrutinized for its transparency and security measures, such endorsements can be critical.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For platforms like Blockchain.com, having an MAS license can offer a level of operational assurance to its user base. Regulatory frameworks ensure platforms maintain a balance between innovation and user security.</p>
Digital Payments and Regulatory Frameworks
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ascent of digital payments across the globe underscores the need for robust regulatory mechanisms. Regulatory frameworks aim to standardize operations, ensuring that platforms operate within set boundaries, emphasizing security and transparency. In such a dynamic environment, recognized licenses can be pivotal, guiding platforms through compliant operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With this move, Singapore continues to demonstrate its adaptability in the evolving world of digital payments and cryptocurrencies.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>PayPal has announced the launch of its native U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin called PayPal USD (PYUSD) based on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
First Global Payments Company to Launch a Stablecoin&nbsp;
<p>On Monday, August 7, digital payments giant PayPal announced the official launch of its Ethereum-based stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. PayPal USD (PYUSD) will become available to the eligible U.S. customers in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ERC-20 stablecoin can be used for transfers between PayPal and supported external wallets, person-to-person payments, funding purchases, and converting any of the platform&rsquo;s listed digital assets to and from PayPal USD.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar," commented Dan Schulman, president and CEO, PayPal. "Our commitment to responsible innovation and compliance, and our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD."</p>

<p>According to the company&rsquo;s statement, PYUSD will serve as a bridge between fiat and Web3 for consumers and merchants, will be available to external developers, wallets and web3 applications, can be seamlessly adopted by exchanges, and used as a driving force behind many experiences in the PayPal ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issuer of PayPal USD is Paxos Trust Company, a fully licensed New-York based financial institution specializing in blockchain. PYUSD reserves are fully supported by U.S. dollar deposits, U.S. Treasuries and similar cash equivalents. PayPal USD can be bought or sold at a fixed rate $1 per PYUSD via PayPal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting from September 2023, Paxos will be publishing a public monthly Reserve Report for PayPal USD, and a public third-party attestation of the value of PayPal USD reserve assets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In addition to building products and services that add utility to digital currencies, PayPal is focused on increasing consumer and merchant comprehension of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while working closely with regulators as the industry evolves.&rdquo; reads the PayPal press release.&nbsp;</p>

PayPal Continues Integration of Crypto
<p>PayPal first confirmed its exploration of stablecoins back at the beginning of last year, although in February 2023 it reported to have halted the project due to regulatory scrutiny in the U.S. The release of PYUSD might mean that the company and its stablecoin issuer Paxos have finally reached an agreement with its persecutors.</p>
<p>The prominent fintech company has been actively exploring and integrating crypto services for the last couple of years. PayPal has recently revealed that it&rsquo;s holding almost $1 billion worth of crypto on behalf of its clients.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Records of Trump&rsquo;s and his inner circle&rsquo;s crypto promotions could be used against him in court and the upcoming presidential race.</p>
First US President to Ever Be Indicted
<p>Former US President. Donald J. Trump is the first American leader to ever be indicted. Trump is currently facing numerous charges in connection with at least three criminal cases including hush money payments, mishandling of classified documents, and the January 6 insurrection case, an effort to overturn the 2020 election. The 45th President of the US pleaded not guilty to all of the counts. However, the investigation continues. Trump might also face charges related to the election interference in the state of Georgia in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for crypto, some suggest that Trump&rsquo;s and his inner circle&rsquo;s involvement in activities related to digital assets could add up to the criminal charges against the former president and decrease his chances of reelection.</p>
Trump Family Jumps into NFT Space
<p>Former first lady, Melania Trump, was the first one to release an NFT collection called &ldquo;Melania&rsquo;s Vision&rdquo;on the Solana blockchain back in 2021. However, Melania Trump was later accused of buying the winning bid of her NFT auction in an effort to inflate the price of the collection.</p>
<p>This year, Melania Trump launched another batch of NFTs titled &ldquo;The 1776 Collection&rdquo;, timed for the US Independence Day, which seemed to have rolled out smoothly. Yet, her most recent NFT collection with the theme of Apollo 11 may have got the former first lady in trouble with NASA! Apparently, the agency doesn't approve of its images being used in connection with NFTs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;NASA is not approving any merchandising applications involving Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), as they are not consistent with the categories of products the agency is approved to merchandise,&rdquo; the document on the NASA website reads.&nbsp;</p>

Donald Trump&rsquo;s Controversial NFT Collection
<p>Even though Doland Trump had previously spoken out against crypto, he later followed his wife&rsquo;s steps and dropped his own NFT collection, &ldquo;Trump Digital Trading Cards&rdquo;. The first batch of NFTs, priced at $99 each, was sold within just 12 hours, raising over $5 million in the process. However, the floor price of the collectibles quickly dipped after.</p>
<p>Ironically, what made the NFT collection surge in price again (by a whopping 462%!) was the news about the former president's indictment and his arrest in New York City. Following the sudden success of the collection, in April 2023, Trump decided to launch the second series of his &ldquo;Digital Trading Cards&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Trump-branded NFTs were widely criticized and ridiculed both in the political and crypto spaces. It was recently revealed that the 45th President had made somewhere between $500,000 and $1 million on the sale of his collection so far. It is not clear what Trump will use this money for. Some speculate that the sum is aimed at funding the former president&rsquo;s legal battles.</p>
<p>Donald Trump will be running for president again in the upcoming 2024 election, along with other pro-crypto candidates.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) began advertising roles to expand its cryptocurrency investigation team. </p>
<p>The UK&rsquo;s National Crime Agency (NCA) is actively recruiting for senior roles to carry out cryptocurrency investigations.</p>
<p>The NCA seeks to expand its task force on digital asset investigations and has posted four job opportunities on its website. The NCA appoints four senior investigators to join its Complex Financial Crime Team (CFTC) to assist with digital asset-related crimes.</p>
<p>The CFTC &ldquo;conducts high-end proactive illicit finance investigations,&rdquo; and the newly advertised roles fall under the scope of its newly formed Digital Assets Team (DAT). The DAT will ensure &ldquo;complex investigations into Blockchain-enabled crime are fully in compliance with the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA).&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the NCA website,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It involves enquiries into criminal activity within virtual arenas, high end of high harm cryptocurrency and virtual assets fraud and money laundering offences carried out by significant organised crime groups and state actors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The positions require individuals to work alongside and collaborate with CPS, investigators, intelligence and analysis staff to ensure disclosure requirements are accordingly dealt with.</p>
UK Sets Up Investigative Unit to Deal With Illicit Crypto-Related Activities
<p>Along with the need for a more comprehensive need for crypto regulation, so too does the market exist for teams and agencies to investigate crypto-related activities. The UK&rsquo;s NCA established its digital asset team earlier this year due to the massive investor losses incurred by numerous scandals that shook the industry.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a mission to shut down all illicit crypto ATM sites and successfully put an end to 26 locations in July.</p>
<p>The UK has also made strides in crypto regulation. The UK Parliament passed a bill last month that could help authorities seize and freeze cryptocurrencies that have been used in criminal activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It involves enquiries into criminal activity within virtual arenas, high end of high harm cryptocurrency and virtual assets fraud and money laundering offences carried out by significant organised crime groups and state actors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The positions require individuals to work alongside and collaborate with CPS, investigators, intelligence and analysis staff to ensure disclosure requirements are accordingly dealt with.</p>
UK Sets Up Investigative Unit to Deal With Illicit Crypto-Related Activities
<p>Along with the need for a more comprehensive need for crypto regulation, so too does the market exist for teams and agencies to investigate crypto-related activities. The UK&rsquo;s NCA established its digital asset team earlier this year due to the massive investor losses incurred by numerous scandals that shook the industry.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a mission to shut down all illicit crypto ATM sites and successfully put an end to 26 locations in July.</p>
<p>The UK has also made strides in crypto regulation. The UK Parliament passed a bill last month that could help authorities seize and freeze cryptocurrencies that have been used in criminal activities.</p>
