					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin has observed a sharp increase of around 18% during the past day as the much-anticipated halving is just over a month away now. Litecoin Outperforms Market With A Strong 18% Surge Like most of the wider cryptocurrency market, LTC had enjoyed a sharp rally a week or so back, which had taken its price above the $90 mark. Unlike coins like Bitcoin, however, the asset had failed to maintain at these post-surge levels, as it slid off during the days that followed, until eventually bottoming out at the low $80 level. In the past day, however, tides seem to have rapidly shifted for Litecoin, as the asset is now trading above $101 after registering a sharp growth of 18% during the last 24 hours. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency has performed recently. Looks like the coin has observed a sharp uptrend today &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As you can see in the graph, Litecoin was around the $81 level only a couple of days back. This latest turnaround for the asset has meant that it has now surpassed the high registered around the start of the month. In terms of daily returns, LTC has outperformed almost all the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap; Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only exception with its whopping 26% gains in the same period. Related Reading: Stablecoin Cap Shows Early Sign Of Reversal, Why This Could Benefit Bitcoin As analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; pointed out on Twitter, Litecoin formed a golden cross just before this surge, as its 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed over its 200-day MA. 2020 it is#Litecoin has golden crossed, days after a death cross Does the rest of history repeat? https://t.co/sGlMhgKE0R pic.twitter.com/CRSaqHSbGt — Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; (@tonythebullBTC) June 30, 2023 Interestingly, only a few days ago, the same MAs had also formed a cross of the opposite type: the death cross. The bullish cross canceling this bearish one out merely days later is a pattern similar to the one seen back in 2020, which preceded the bull run. LTC Only Has 34 Days To Go For The Next Halving Litecoin also has a strong bullish narrative coming up in the form of its halving. The &#8220;halving&#8221; is an event where the block rewards of the cryptocurrency are permanently cut in half. As the block rewards are the only way to introduce new LTC into the circulating supply, the halving tightens up its production rate. This increased scarcity is why the event has historically been hyped up as a bullish one. Related Reading: Altcoin Whales Show Highly Active Day, Volatility Incoming? Halvings take place roughly every four years, and the next one is estimated to place on August 3, 2023, which is just 34 days away. It now remains to be seen whether the current price surge will be an extended rally that leads to the halving, or if this is another attempt that would run out of steam before long.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum network is currently witnessing a surge in interest following the recent Shanghai upgrade, which has expanded the options for holders of Ethereum (ETH). This has resulted in an uptick in the number of people staking their ETH in beacon deposit contracts, an indication of the growing confidence in the Ethereum blockchain since the upgrade. Since the Shanghai upgrade, the quantity of staked ETH has been increasing at a swift pace. This growth recently hit a peak, breaking previous records and suggesting that Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been received positively by the market. New Era For Ethereum The amount of Ethereum staked has now hit an all-time high (ATH), surpassing 25.8 million ETH, equivalent to a value of over $48 billion, according to the latest data shared by blockchain and crypto industry analytics platform, CryptoRank. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH This development has caused quite a stir in the crypto community and provides insight into the evolving dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain. Just a month earlier, in late May, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the $40 billion mark. This upward movement underscores the effectiveness of the new features introduced during Ethereum’s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the PoS consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade. Furthermore, the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum ecosystem has been profound. The surge in the Ethereum staking ratio since the upgrade is indicative of growing interest and faith in the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s potential.  This, in turn, reflects on the success of the Shanghai upgrade and the Merge in aligning ETH with market expectations and needs. While the influx of staked ETH steadily rises, Ethereum&#8217;s creator, Vitalik Buterin, has recently expressed concerns regarding the potential strain this could put on the network&#8217;s consensus. In a recent blog post, he urged caution, stating, &#8220;Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus.&#8221; Buterin went on to emphasize that utilizing Ethereum&#8217;s consensus for diverse functions could introduce elevated systemic threats to the ecosystem and should be actively discouraged. Despite this cautionary advice, there has been no decrease in ETH staking activity, only a consistent increase.

The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has surged from trading below $1,700 earlier this month to trading as high as $1,890, at the time of writing. Notably, the asset tapped and traded above $1,900 earlier today before slightly retracing to a 24-low of $1,843. Meanwhile, ETH has recorded more than $20 billion added to its market cap over the past two weeks. ETH trading volume has also surged over the same period indicating a rising trading activity.

					<description><![CDATA[The recent downturn in the XRP market has not deterred large-scale investors, often referred to as &#8216;whales&#8217;. Amid a 12% drop in XRP&#8217;s price between June 22 and June 28, they instead saw an opportunity rather than a setback, amassing 360 million XRP worth approximately $170 million. This significant investment demonstrates the high-stake moves that define the crypto markets. While such large-scale purchases are not unusual in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, this particular accumulation of XRP seems to suggest a confident long-term outlook on the asset by these whales, despite the current bearish trend. #Ripple whales bought the dip! While the price of #XRP dropped 12% from June 22 to June 28, whales bought 360 million $XRP worth nearly $170 million. pic.twitter.com/QI0m45cIio — Ali (@ali_charts) June 29, 2023 XRP Whale Movements Amid Market Fluctuations On June 22, XRP&#8217;s price hit a weekly high of $0.52. But this peak didn&#8217;t last long. The subsequent reversal led to a drop, triggering increased profit-taking as many felt the asset was overvalued. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi Consequently, XRP has been on a downward slope, breaking key support levels, and presently trades below the earlier $0.5 mark. This puts the asset&#8217;s decline at around 4.3% for the past week. However, the picture is not all gloom and doom. The market capitalization of XRP sits at $24.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This ranking comes even amid the notable downward pressure. Despite the past week&#8217;s bearish trend, the last 24 hours have shown some signs of recovery for XRP. The token has experienced a slight uptick, gaining 2.1% in price. This positive movement has bolstered the asset&#8217;s market cap by over $500 million, pushing it up from just below $24 billion earlier this month to the current $24.8 billion. Even so, XRP&#8217;s daily trading volume has experienced a significant fall, dropping from the $1 billion mark seen earlier this month to below $600 million in the last 24 hours. The token&#8217;s price has remained somewhat stable, with a 24-hour low of $0.46 and a high of $0.47. Effect On The Market While the whales&#8217; massive XRP purchase is newsworthy, it&#8217;s not the only factor at play. The modest price uptrend could be attributed to an overall slight bullish sentiment reverberating throughout the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the front-runner in the crypto space, has also displayed a minor upward trend, which typically influences the performance of other digital assets, including XRP. In this volatile world of cryptocurrencies, it&#8217;s crucial to keep an eye on such significant moves as the ones made by the whales. Their actions could set the stage for what&#8217;s next for XRP and other cryptocurrencies in the weeks and months to come. Ripple Labs has actively sought to have the Security and Executive Commission (SEC) lawsuit against it dismissed, asserting that XRP, unlike conventional securities, operates as a digital currency due to its practical use and decentralized features. The company is challenging the SEC&#8217;s authority in this regard and condemns the regulatory body for not offering clear guidance on the status of XRP as a security. Related Reading: XRP Price Topside Bias Vulnerable Unless It Climbs Above $0.50 Ripple claims that the ongoing legal dispute has adversely affected XRP holders and stifled progress in the cryptocurrency sector. The court&#8217;s ruling on Ripple&#8217;s request for dismissal is eagerly awaited, and it could substantially impact the trajectory of the lawsuit. Should the request be granted, it could significantly undermine the SEC&#8217;s case, but if denied, the legal battle will continue with the SEC&#8217;s charges against Ripple remaining active.

<p dir="ltr">In this volatile world of cryptocurrencies, it&#8217;s crucial to keep an eye on such significant moves as the ones made by the whales. Their actions could set the stage for what&#8217;s next for XRP and other cryptocurrencies in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Ripple Labs has actively sought to have the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/ripple-vs-sec-deaton-verdict-date-xrp-loses-steam/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Security and Executive Commission (SEC) lawsuit</a> against it dismissed, asserting that XRP, unlike conventional securities, operates as a digital currency due to its practical use and decentralized features. The company is challenging the SEC&#8217;s authority in this regard and condemns the regulatory body for not offering clear guidance on the status of XRP as a security.</p>

<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Ripple claims that the ongoing legal dispute has adversely affected XRP holders and stifled progress in the cryptocurrency sector. The court&#8217;s ruling on Ripple&#8217;s request for dismissal is eagerly awaited, and it could substantially impact the trajectory of the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Should the request be granted, it could significantly undermine the SEC&#8217;s case, but if denied, the legal battle will continue with the SEC&#8217;s charges against Ripple remaining active.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market eagerly observed the expiry of the quarterly BTC and ETH options today (at 8:00 am UTC / 4:00 am EST). It was the second largest in history with a volume of 159,000 BTC options and 1.25 million ETH options with a total value of almost $7 billion. The market was expecting a sharp increase in volatility, but it failed to materialize. In the run-up, the BTC price briefly spiked as high as $31,300 before seeing a pullback towards $30,700. The event has thus pretty much become a nothing burger. Options analysts at Greeks.Live confirmed a few minutes ago that the quarterly expiration has been completed, with more BTC block calls being traded in the last few days, mainly to close and roll positions at the end of the quarter, with ETH being mainly in the order book, adding: With the quarterly expiry, the market has seen a release of positions that have built up in recent months, and options could see a larger shift if the market supports it in July. Although volatility levels have risen this month and market makers are happy to actively buy positions, the downward trend in major term IV is very much in evidence amidst the strong selling pressure from quarterly delivery. What&#8217;s Next For Bitcoin? Today&#8217;s daily close could become extremely important for the Bitcoin price. Today is month-end, quarter-end and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, will be released at 8:30 am EST (12:30 pm CET). On Tuesday, the U.S. market is closed for the Fourth of July, Independence Day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Key Indicators Suggest A Strengthening Case For Rally To $32K The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is preferred by the Fed because it provides broader coverage of consumer spending, includes chain weighting to accurately track behavioral changes, accounts for the substitution effect, and uses comprehensive data sources. The PCE is therefore considered a more flexible and representative indicator of inflation compared to other indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While headline CPI data have looked extremely good in recent months, core inflation has been shown to be very sticky. A lot of focus today will therefore be on core PCE. The expectation for PCE inflation is 3.9% and for core PCE 4.7% year-over-year. A surprise to the downside has the potential to provide a bullish boost to both the traditional financial market as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Related Reading: Dawn For Bitcoin: $5 Billion In Options Expire And Could Push Price Towards $31,000 As renowned analyst @rektcapital writes via Twitter, BTC is positioning itself for a monthly close above a resistance that had rejected the price for the past three months. Currently, BTC is holding above the same level (black). Thus, the monthly as well as the quarterly close could be an extremely bullish harbinger for July. Is The Best Time To Buy Next Monday? Analyst @tedtalksmacro recently published an analysis about Bitcoin&#8217;s historical performance via Twitter. The result may suggest that the upcoming Monday, July 3, is the best option for a Bitcoin buy, at least historically. As the analyst noted, July has been the best performing month since October 2009. However, the data is skewed due to a 10x in July 2010. Taking only the last five years of data, the best performing month is October, closely followed by July. On a weekly basis, Mondays are the best day to buy and hold BTC. This assumes that buyers do not hold BTC on any day other than the nominated one, as the analyst evaluated. At press time, the Bitcoin price hovered below the $31,000 resistance zone, trading at $30,856. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Cash (BCH) price has gone through the roof in recent days. Within the last ten days, the Bitcoin fork has risen by a staggering 168%, temporarily BCH was already up over 200% today. While Bitcoin Cash was still trading at $104 on June 20 and was stuck in a deep bull market that looked bad even compared to other altcoins, a miracle occurred 10 days ago. The price exploded out of nowhere. Why Is Bitcoin Cash Experiencing A Revival? As NewsBTC reported, the reasons for the phenomenal rise in BCH&#8217;s price have already been discussed hotly over the past few days. It was often heard that the listing on the new crypto exchange EDX Markets, which is backed by industry giants Citadel Securities, Charles Schwab Corp. and Fidelity Digital Assets, favored BCH. Furthermore, it has been argued that the price increase is also due to Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s recent &#8220;game-changing&#8221; upgrade. In mid-May, Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork that not only improved the network&#8217;s security and privacy measures, but also introduced plans for CashTokens. However, the real reasons for the current Bitcoin Cash pump seem to lie elsewhere: namely in South Korea. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reports today that South Korea could be the reason for the BCH pump, looking at where much of the trading volume originates. Related Reading: Kaching! Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Price Explodes Over 100% – What’s Powering It? In the last 24 hours, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, recorded over $350 million in trading volume for BCH/KRW, accounting for 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH. Moreover, it is also three times the trading volume of BTC/KRW on Upbit &#8211; an anomaly that has extreme rarity. Renowned crypto whale and trader Andrew Kang agrees, stating that the current BCH rally reminds him of the multi-week Aptos (APT) battle between Korean retailers and &#8220;professional traders.&#8221; Never Skip A Korea Pump? &#8220;Koreans didn&#8217;t need a reason to bid, all that mattered is that it kept going up and early bears got slaughtered,&#8221; Kang said. The trader is alluding to APT&#8217;s 500% rally earlier this year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Surges 20% In One Day As Market Rebounds, What’s Next? South Koreans pumped Aptos because of a joke about housing affordability. APT&#8217;s trading volume on the South Korean crypto exchange UpBit was often higher than the total trading volume on Binance at the time. It was also beneficial that the Aptos Foundation marketed the altcoin to Koreans from day one. According to Alex Shin, co-founder of crypto venture capital firm Hashed, South Korean crypto investors took Aptos&#8217; three-letter ticker &#8220;APT&#8221; and turned it into a meme alluding to how absurdly expensive it is to buy an &#8220;apartment&#8221; in South Korea. Asia expert Wu said at the time that &#8220;pumping altcoins is a tradition in the Korean community.&#8221; Kang concluded: &#8220;People are shorting more BCH than there is liquid supply of it. It’s highly illiquid since most of the supply is dead. Imagine fading the original cartel&#8221; and added &#8220;disbelief pump.&#8221; At press time, BCH changed hands for $300 per coin.
