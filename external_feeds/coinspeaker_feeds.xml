<p>Despite seeing a surge in product demand for Q4 2022, Boeing sustained a gigantic $663 million loss due to macroeconomic constraints. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/boeing-q4-2022-results/">Boeing Q4 2022 Results Reveal Quarterly Loss Brought About by Labor &#038; Supply Headwinds</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/boeing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boeing</a> (NYSE: BA) recently posted its <a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/661678649/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/4Q22-Press-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Q4 2022 financial report</a>, which showed a losing effort characterized by labor and supply strains. The American aeronautics manufacturing giant posted a loss of $663 million in the fourth quarter amid supply chain constraints. These unsavory operational elements overshadowed the increased revenue the company realized from higher demand in aircraft sales and deliveries.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Boeing chief executive officer Dave Calhoun optimistically viewed the latest quarterly outing. Calhoun stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We had a solid fourth quarter, and 2022 proved to be an important year in our recovery. Demand across our portfolio is strong, and we remain focused on driving stability in our operations and within the supply chain to meet our commitments in 2023 and beyond.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the company&#8217;s CEO also said Boeing continues to invest in its business while innovating and prioritizing safety. Furthermore, he explained that Boeing would strive for quality and transparency in all its operational deeds.</p>
<h2>Boeing Q4 2022 Revenue Intake</h2>
<p>For the fourth quarter of 2022, Boeing reported a revenue haul of $19.98 billion compared to the higher $20.38 billion analysts expected. Furthermore, the company&#8217;s adjusted loss per share came in at $1.75 versus the much lower expected earnings per share of 26 cents.</p>
<p>Amid the rise in demand for Boeing&#8217;s products, the Chicago-based company&#8217;s top executives refrain from ramping up production. In a memo to staff, Calhoun said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re proud of how we closed out 2022, and despite the hurdles in front of us, we&#8217;re confident in our path ahead. We have a robust pipeline of development programs; we&#8217;re innovating for the future, and we&#8217;re increasing investments to prepare for our next generation of products.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the labor and supply drawbacks, Boeing also generated positive free cash flow in 2022 for the first time since 2018. Since the easing of pandemic restrictions, aircraft operators and manufacturers have benefited from a sharp rebound in air travel. During the height of Covid, the airline space ranked high among the most affected industries across the globe.</p>
<p>For Q4 2022, Boeing generated $3.1 billion in cash flow. This sum came in much higher than the consensus estimates of $2.3 billion for the year and represented the most since 2018. In the ensuing time, the aeronautics corporation endured a years-long crisis sparked by the second of two fatal 737 Max crashes.</p>
<p>Calhoun admitted that despite glaring challenges, Boeing remains well-positioned to restore its operational and financial strength.</p>
<p>Boeing&#8217;s BA shares were trading 1% lower in premarket trading following its latest quarterly results.</p>
<h2>$13.5B Delta Air Lines Deal</h2>
<p>Last July, Boeing <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/delta-100-boeing-max-planes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a substantial order</a> from <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/delta-air-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delta Air Lines Inc</a> (NYSE: DAL) for 100 737 Max 10 planes. According to reports, the delivery of said aircraft would commence in 2025 in a deal worth around $13.5 billion. Furthermore, the deal is Delta&#8217;s first with Boeing in over 10 years and includes an option for 30 more Boeing planes.</p>

<p>The bill was supported by some representatives of both the Republican and Democratic parties. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sen-hawley-lawmakers-stocks/">Sen. Hawley Introduces Act to Ban Lawmakers from Trading Stocks</a></p>
<p>A new bill has been submitted by Senator Josh Hawley, this bill is expected to refrain members of Congress from trading and possessing stocks, leveraging the name of his legislation to criticize the investment activities of Rep. Nancy Pelosi and her family.</p>
<p>Hawley, on Tuesday, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/3828504-hawley-introduces-pelosi-act-banning-lawmakers-from-trading-stocks/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">introduced</a> the Pelosi Acr, also called the Preventing Elected Leaders from Owning Securities and Investments Act. The act has renewed a legislative boost to diminish stock trading by legislative members that had previously not been effective.</p>
<p>According to Hawley in a tweet, members of Congress and their spouses shouldn&#8217;t be exploiting their power to make money on trading stocks.</p>
<p>Hawley, similar to several other Republicans, had targeted the former Speaker and her family for initiating the ban on stock trading by members of Congress.</p>
<p>During the last year, Pelosi&#8217;s husband Paul Pelosi was found selling millions of dollars worth of shares of a computer chipmaker as the House readied itself to vote on a bill specifically focused on domestic chip manufacturing.</p>
<p>Paul Pelosi, according to a spokesperson, allegedly sold his shares at a loss ultimately.</p>
<p>The bill was supported by members of both parties, a consequence of Sen. Richard Burr emptying <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stocks</a> at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The securities and exchange commission very recently concluded an investigation of his trading practices and refrained from taking concrete action.</p>
<p>Legislative bodies are, however, not being able to manufacture a scheme that allows enough backing from both factions in Congress. Democrats, last year, discarded the decision to vote on this legislation before midterm elections after Pelosi overturned the course and communicated his approval to other members voting for stock trading reform.</p>
<p>In addition to Hawley&#8217;s bill, a bipartisan couple in the House has disclosed a bill this year on the subject. Reps. Abigail Spanberger and Chip Roy brought along the Trust in Congress Act this month, commemorating the pair&#8217;s third time introducing legislation.</p>
<p>The bill is a byproduct after discoveries from last year that claimed that Nancy&#8217;s spouse, Paul Pelosi, traded approximately one million dollars and 5 million of stocks for semiconductors a few days before Congress allotted around 50 million in USD to the industry. The stocks were subsequently traded at a massive loss to eliminate the impression of improperness.</p>
<p>The bill, presently, expects the President of the US, the Vice President, a particular executive branch employee, the Postmaster General, some civilian employees, and judicial officials to file a report that comprises the source, type, and value of income accumulated from any source separate from their current employment.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-suffering-cloud-outage/">Microsoft Restores Services to Teams after Suffering Cloud Outage</a></p>
<p>Following the report from different users that applications from American multinational technology giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: MSFT) are down, the company has announced that it has taken a proactive step to resolve the cloud outage. The company gave the confirmation on Twitter when it said it has rolled back a network change that it believes was causing the disruption.</p>
<p>According to DownDetector, a platform where users can report issues about online applications that are having irregular issues, outages were reported for Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Store. According to data gleaned from DownDetector, the highest number of outage reports for Microsoft Teams was around 9 am today.</p>
<p>Those who filed the report came from different countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil to mention a few. <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/teams/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According</a> to the complaints, as many as 75% of complainants said they had issues with the Teams app, 16% were finding trouble accessing the website and 9% reported login-related issues.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve identified a potential networking issue and are reviewing telemetry to determine the next troubleshooting steps,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve rolled back a network change that we believe is causing impact. We&#39;re monitoring the service as the rollback takes effect.</p>
<p>&mdash; Microsoft 365 Status (@MSFT365Status) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1618178407316987905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The company said some of the users who lodged complaints about the cloud outage were already logging back in. The company did not share the exact estimate of those who might have been affected by the unprecedented cloud outage.</p>
<p>Microsoft develops some of the best-known and most-used software products in the world. Besides Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft also controls a significant portion of the global cloud business and it counts top businesses as clients. It remains unclear how the outage impacted businesses across the board.</p>
<h2>Microsoft Resolved Outage to Dodge Double Blow</h2>
<p>Microsoft is currently in the crosshairs at the time as its stock price is likely to trail a downtrend following the release of previous quarter earnings. While the company reported impressive revenue, bolstered by its Cloud business, it gave a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-revenue-forecast-fy23-q3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poorer-than-expected outlook</a> for the current quarter.</p>
<p>The move riled the market, and Microsoft stock is down 2.74% to $235.41 in the Pre-Market at the time of writing. Microsoft is trying its best to conserve capital and despite its high revenue, it <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/microsoft-lay-off-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the retrenchment of 11,000 of its staff in line with a broader job cut that has been rocking the tech sector.</p>
<p>The firm resolved its outages as swiftly as it did because it could not afford other challenges to upset its investors. While outages like what Microsoft suffered are not peculiar to the company as most of the top tech giants have faced similar challenges at some point over the past decade, the swift response showcases how ready the firm is to confront its woes and redirect its path toward productivity.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-slowest-sales-growth/">Tesla Foresees Slowest Sales Growth in Three Years</a></p>
<p>Electric vehicle (EV) maker <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) will deliver the slowest sales growth in 10 quarters during its earnings announcement on the 25th of January. The company has experienced lower deliveries, which could contribute to reduced sales growth. This comes as the EV giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tesla-car-prices-us-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cut prices on its electric cars</a> to trigger consumer demand and restrict competition. Recently, Tesla issued huge discounts on its vehicles and has again lowered global prices by as much as 20%.</p>
<p>However, reducing the cost of cars may impact the company’s margin even though it will somewhat tackle increasing competition from traditional automakers. Some of the traditional auto manufacturers include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ford Motor Company</a> (NYSE: F).</p>
<p>According to estimates by Refinitiv, Tesla is about to announce its slowest net profit rate and sales growth in three years. The EV manufacturer is already speeding up its production at the Berlin and Austin mega factories. Some analysts believe that ramping up factory output will result in a lower cost of production. They also hope that it will help the company absorb some of its losses. Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2023-01-24/teslas-slowing-sales-shrinking-margins-in-focus-in-ev-price-war" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I’m curious to see how those two (production cost and average selling price) offset each other in the fourth quarter because that will be an excellent directional indicator for what we can expect in 2023.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The early impact of Tesla cutting prices on its products was that Chinese EV manufacturers also dropped the costs of their vehicles. The Tesla Model 3 compact sedan and Model Y compact SUV now cost about the same price as Fisker’s Ocean SUV. They are also up for lower than Rivian’s R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV. The latest price slash was not the first of its kind for Tesla. The company cut its prices in China on its Model 3 and Model Y. While the decision is partially to gain more Tesla customers and increases sales growth, it raised protests from some customers who claimed that they received their vehicles at relatively higher prices before the slashes were implemented.</p>
<p>For the upcoming earnings results, analysts expect Tesla to see its revenue climb 36% to $24.03 billion. Also, there are profit expectations of $1.13 per share. Data from Visible Alpha indicates that the auto gross margin could decline from 30.6% to 28% in Q4. With a market capitalization of almost $454 billion, 25 of the 42 analysts covering Tesla rate the stock a “buy” or higher. Meanwhile, 12 rates it “hold,” and five rates it “sell” or lower. On the stock price target, the median range is $186.</p>

<p>Leading European tech company ASML has given higher guidance for its 2023 outing following a sound Q4 2022 earnings report. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/asml-q4-2022-earnings-profit/">ASML Posts Q4 2022 Earnings Forecast, Beats Estimates on Revenue &#038; Net Profit</a></p>
<p>Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/asml-holding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ASML</a>) recently posted its Q4 2022 financial report, which beat the earnings forecast for the period. Europe&#8217;s largest technology company raked in 6.43 billion euros for the period that ended December 31st. Meanwhile, analysts were expecting a revenue haul of 6.38 billion euros for the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>ASML also reported a Q4 2022 net profit of 1.82 billion euros compared to the consensus estimate of 1.70 billion euros. In addition, the Dutch multinational tech corporation also saw a record-high order backlog of 40 billion euros.</p>
<p>ASML&#8217;s latest quarterly growth came amid the macroeconomic constraints that plagued the tech sector throughout last year. During the Q4 2022 period, the company realized quarterly net sales of 21.2 billion euros and a gross margin of 50.5%. ASML also raked in a net income of 5.6 billion euros and now projects a 25% growth in 2023 net sales. The tech giant remains optimistic about said net sales growth despite likely new curbs on its exports to China.</p>
<p>ASML President and Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink commented on the company&#8217;s Q4 results, <a href="https://www.asml.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/q4-2022-financial-results" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For ASML, 2022 was another strong year ending with total net sales for the year of €21.2 billion, gross margin of 50.5%, and a record backlog at the end of 2022 of €40.4 billion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Wennink also added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We continue to see uncertainty in the market caused by inflation, rising interest rates, risk of recession, and geopolitical developments related to export controls. However, our customers indicate that they expect the market to rebound in the second half of the year. Considering our order lead times and the strategic nature of lithography investments, demand for our systems therefore remains strong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>ASML Expects Stronger Net Sales Following Sound Q4 2022 Outing</h2>
<p>On ASML&#8217;s loftier projections for 2023, Wennink stated that the company expects continued strong growth with an over 25% net sales increase. In addition, the Veldhoven-based firm anticipates a marginal gross margin improvement compared to 2022.</p>
<p>ASML previously struggled to meet demand as its top clients Samsung, TSMC, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel</a> (NASDAQ: INTC), are all in varying expansive stages.</p>
<p>Wennink explained that despite economic uncertainties weighing heavy on ASML&#8217;s 2023 economic outlook, there is a silver lining. According to the CEO, conditions improved towards the end of last year, and China seems to be on the mend now. In conclusion, Wennink opines that demand remains higher than ASML&#8217;s production capacity.</p>
<p>ASML had sales in China worth 2.16 billion euros last year, which accounted for 14% of its total revenue. The Chinese market represented the company&#8217;s third-largest market behind Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<p>According to Wennink, ASML&#8217;s exports to China have remained unaffected by the US imposition of new restrictions on its own companies. In Wennink&#8217;s opinion, the play out of the continuous dialogue between both governments would come to &#8220;a reasonable solution&#8221; on restrictions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/roger-ver-sued-20m-genesis-debt/">Roger Ver Sued for Defaulting on $20 Million Genesis Debt</a></p>
<p>As crypto lending firm Genesis begins to come to terms with its bankruptcy, one of its offshoots &#8211; GGC International, has sued popular Bitcoin Cash (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin-cash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BCH</a>) advocate <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/roger-ver/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Roger Ver</a>. According to a January 23 court <a href="https://www.offshorealert.com/ggc-international-ltd-v-roger-ver-summons-with-notice-failure-to-settle-20m-expired-crypto-options/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made available at the New York State Supreme Court, Ver is being sued over his failure to settle crypto options transactions worth over $20.8 million. And in addition to that, GGC also wants Ver to bear whatever costs the firm incurs throughout the court proceedings.</p>
<h2>Roger Ver and Genesis</h2>
<p>Per the filing, Ver was due to make payment by December 30. But in what now appears to be a clear case of defaulting, Ver did not pay up. For defaulting, GGC has now given Ver 20 days to respond to the complaints filed against him. This means that he has until February 12 to come forward and state his reasons for failing to fulfill his financial obligations.</p>
<p>In the event that he fails to honor the request, however, a default judgment will be meted out to Ver.  That is, he will then be obliged to pay the total amount by default.</p>
<p>As of publication though, Ver is yet to issue any statement of acknowledgment regarding the case.</p>
<h2>Roger Ver Has a History of Debts</h2>
<p>It might be worth noting that Roger Ver is not exactly new to cases of debts such as this.</p>
<p>Last June, Ver was also in the news for a similar case. At the time, Hong Kong-based CoinFLEX exchange claimed that Ver had flouted an agreement and was owing it around $47 million USD Coin (USDC).  Although Ver later denied those claims without directly addressing the company. It is believed, however, that Ver’s debt eventually <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinflex-arbitration-recover-84m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">went up to $84 million</a>. And that it was largely responsible for CoinFLEX&#8217;s decision to eventually <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinflex-restructuring-seychelles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">file for restructuring</a> later in August.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ver&#8217;s indebtedness to GGC has now made his debts one too many for Digital Currency Group (DCG). For what it&#8217;s worth, CoinFLEX and Genesis, to which he owes huge amounts, are both parts of DCG&#8217;s portfolio. Whereas, DCG itself is in a financial mess and is frantically sourcing for funds at the moment. So, Ver is certainly not the kind of debtor it hopes for, if it wants to stay in business and avoid bankruptcy.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/rocket-lab-stock-space-mission/">Rocket Lab Stock Up 4% after Launching First Space Mission on US Soil</a></p>
<p>American space and rocket engineering firm, Rocket Lab USA Inc (NASDAQ: RKLB) is seeing impressive growth in its stock price after it successfully completed its first space mission on US soil. As <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rocket-lab-expands-launch-footprint-with-first-mission-from-us-2987247" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by Reuters, the launch took place on Tuesday from the firm’s new launch pad at the NASA-operated Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia.</p>
<p>The company made use of its flagship Electron Rocket, a 40-foot tall rocket that is replaceable. The company’s Virginia mission was initiated to help radio-frequency analytics firm Hawkeye 360 in deploying three of its satellites to low earth orbit.</p>
<p>Space missions are not a regular engineering and logistics adventure and it takes years of planning on both the part of the company as well as regulators involved. While there are dominant figures in space including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/spacex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX</a> and Blue Origin amongst others, the space industry has seen the proliferation of companies with a different tilt and solution to existing ones.</p>
<p>With the government and companies in need of commercial satellites amongst the major market target, outfits like Rocket Lab have inked a unique market share since its inception. The recent space launch of the Electron Rocket is the company’s 33rd mission since 2017.</p>
<p>As a company, Rocket Lab has its primary launchpad strip in New Zealand, and the attempt to secure the right approval to launch in the United States resulted in some forms of delay. At this time, The launch was actually delayed 3 times as regulators scrutinized the company’s Electron&#8217;s automated flight termination system.</p>
<p>Besides this delay, the very bad weather in Virginia also contributed to the delays that were recorded in the more than 1 year since the firm had been planning the launch.</p>
<h2>Rocket Lab and the HawkEye 360 Alliance</h2>
<p>The Tuesday satellite’s lifting off to the edge of space is not going to be the last one for both companies. Over the course of this year and the next, Rocket Lab is billed to launch at least 2 more space missions on behalf of the company.</p>
<p><a href="https://pulse2.com/why-the-rocket-lab-stock-increased-3-11-rklb/">According</a> to Pulse 2.0, these missions will see as many as 12 more HawkEye satellites get deployed to space as it seeks to provide global geolocation of radio frequency emissions from anywhere in the world. Today, most TV stations and cable network channels cannot operate if firms like Rocket Lab are not in the business.</p>
<p>The company’s shares shot up by 4.43% to $4.97% after the close of trading on Tuesday and in After Hours trading, it has added an additional 22 cents to the price at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The California-based company, Rocket Lab has started the year on a very promising pedestal. With the flight window slated for 6 pm EST, by 7:34 pm, the company announced that the mission was successfully executed.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/blockstream-raises-125m-to-expand-bitcoin-mining-operations/">Blockstream Raises $125M to Expand Bitcoin Mining Operations</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blockstream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockstream Inc</a>, a leading <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and blockchain infrastructure company, has raised  $125 million in a convertible note and secured loan financing. According to the announcement, Blockstream intends to use the money to expand its institutional Bitcoin mining colocation services. The just-concluded fundraising was led by Kingsway Capital and Fulgur Ventures.</p>
<p>This follows last year’s $210 million Series B funding round that was used to expand its institutional Bitcoin mining operations. Additionally, the company used part of the series B funding capital to acquire Spondoolies to design and manufacture its ASIC and enterprise miner.</p>
<h2>Blockstream Taps on Bitcoin Market</h2>
<p>With $125 million raised through debt financing, Blockstream intends to pick up on what Series B capital managed in Bitcoin mining facilities. Moreover, Blockstream has reported a sharp uptick in demand for its institutional hosting services. Notably, Blockstream has over 500 Megawatts in its development pipeline to expand its Bitcoin mining facility for institutional investors.</p>
<p>“This fundraise allows us to accelerate the YoY revenue growth we created with our 2021 Series B and continue to build infrastructure for the future Bitcoin economy,” <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/2023/1/prweb19127332.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Blockstream President &amp; CFO, Erik Svenson. “We remain focused on reducing risk for institutional bitcoin miners and enabling enterprise users to build high-value use cases on the most secure, robust, and scalable blockchain in the world &#8211; Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>Blockstream has secured significant funding support at a time the Bitcoin market is marred with institutional failure including the FTX and Alameda implosion. As such, the company is optimistic it will do better in revenue returns when Bitcoin prices recover from the 2022 bear market.</p>
<p>“With 2022 being punctuated by multiple large-scale centralized parties and protocol failures, we believe this has been a learning experience for the market: that the fundamental value of blockchains is in reducing the need to trust third parties”, said Blockstream CEO Dr. Adam Back.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Bitcoin mining facilities were significantly affected by the 2022 crypto crash that saw Bitcoin move from $69k to $15k in less than a year. However, Blockstream reported a strong revenue growth year-over-year (YoY) due to high institutional demand for mining hosting services.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Blockstream had a strong 2022 with 3x revenue growth from 2021, &amp; strong demand for hosting into 2023 to expand for, with a return to a bullish market, with Bitcoin up 40% in the first 3 weeks of 2023 alone.”</p>
<p> &#8211; Blockstream CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adam3us</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/btc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@btc</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Blockstream (@Blockstream) <a href="https://twitter.com/Blockstream/status/1618057881164865537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 25, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the crypto market may not be out of the woods yet with increased sell pressure from miners and short-term holders. For instance, Bitcoin mining company Greenridge avoided bankruptcy last December after it raised approximately $74 million in capital in the last minutes from New York Digital Investment Group.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, Blockstream has developed a wide range of products that are changing the landscape of Bitcoin adoption by institutional investors. For instance, Blockstream offers a liquid network and a Bitcoin layer-2 network for digital asset issuance.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/league-of-legends-source-code-stolen/">League of Legends Source Code Stolen and Held Hostage for Ransom</a></p>
<p>Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends, recently confirmed that the source code for the popular game has been stolen. Last week on January 20, the studio complained about the compromised state of its development environment in a social engineering attack.</p>
<h2>League of Legends Source Code Stolen</h2>
<p>This method basically involves the psychological manipulation of people and pushing them to perform actions that would divulge information. As a result, the source code for <a title="Games &gt; League of Legends [94 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/league-of-legends/">League of Legends</a>, Teamfight Tactics, and a legacy anti-cheat platform remains compromised. It has also impacted Riot&#8217;s ability to release new content.</p>
<p>Riot Games noted that any exposure to the source code can increase the possibility of new cheats emerging. The studio also noted that they have been working to deploy fixes as quickly as possible. The popular gaming studio noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The illegally obtained source code also includes a number of experimental features. While we hope some of these game modes and other changes eventually make it out to players, most of this content is in prototype and there’s no guarantee it will ever be released.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Riot Games added that although this attack disrupted their build environment, there&#8217;s no compromise with the player&#8217;s data or any player&#8217;s personal information.</p>
<h2>Riot Games Received a Ransom Email</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1617900234734198787" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">update</a> on Tuesday, January 24, the game studio added that they received a ransom email from the hacker. “Needless to say, we won’t pay,&#8221; it added. Riot Games noted that they are working with law enforcement and authorities who are investigating the attack and the group behind it. They added:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re committed to transparency and will release a full report in the future detailing the attackers’ techniques, the areas where Riot’s security controls failed, and the steps we’re taking to ensure this doesn’t happen again&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The studio <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/riot-says-league-of-legends-source-code-has-been-stolen-and-is-being-held-for-ransom/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> to have made good progress over the last week and expects things repaired by later this week. Riot Games is also among the latest players in the market to announce 46 job cuts calling it a part of “strategic shifts within a few teams&#8221; and increasing their focus in several areas of business.</p>

<p>Embattled crypto lender Celsius plans to use a new bankruptcy digital currency token to pay off its creditors. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celsius-bankruptcy-crypto-token/">Celsius Proposes Bankruptcy Crypto Token Issuance as Part of Restructuring Plans</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-24/celsius-may-issue-a-bankruptcy-crypto-token-to-repay-creditors?srnd=technology-vp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According to reports</a>, Celsius Network LLC may issue a bankruptcy crypto token to repay creditors. This development forms part of a broader “recovery corporation” scheme by the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/celsius-customers-claims-bankruptcy/">bankrupt crypto lender</a> to remerge as a new publicly traded company. After fielding several uncompelling acquisition bids, Celsius attorneys opine that liquidating would generate fewer funds than reorganizing.</p>
<h2>Celsius Intends to Roll Out Bankruptcy Crypto Token Sooner</h2>
<p>Celsius announced that its reorganization and bankruptcy digital asset token plans could happen in “months” subject to regulatory approval. According to the bankrupt company’s attorney Ross M. Kwasteniet, creditors would benefit more from this scheme than attempts to sell hard-to-liquidate assets at depressed prices.</p>
<p>Under the newly-unveiled plan, creditors with locked assets above a certain threshold would receive a unique token. This token, called the Asset Share Token (AST), would reflect the value of said customers’ assets. Additionally, AST holders could either hold onto their tokens, which entitles them to periodic dividends, or sell them on the open market. Celsius also has reimbursement plans for the rest of its customers outside the threshold, which is between 60%-70% of the overall customer base. According to the New Jersey-based bankrupt crypto lending company, these customers would receive a one-time distribution in liquid digital currencies. According to Kwasteniet:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[The distribution] would be at a discount. We’re not envisioning a full recovery, but it’s a meaningful recovery, Your Honor. It would be a one-time distribution in liquid crypto – call it Bitcoin, Ethereum, or stablecoins. Something that has, you know, readily tradable, readily ascertainable market value to everybody who has claims below a certain threshold.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kwasteniet also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Celsius depositors] all have something in common – they all deposited crypto, and they all have a claim for the return of the crypto, and we’re focused on doing a plan that treats them equally … the Earn customers, we think, are going to be treated equally.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, Kwasteniet explained that these customers would be entitled to a significant return of value.</p>
<h2>Payout Threshold to Be Determined</h2>
<p>Celsius has been negotiating with numerous creditor groups over how to establish the new company and token payout plan. However, the company’s lawyers did not specify the payout threshold. According to Kwasteniet, Celsius is still discussing the threshold dollar amount with the Unsecured Creditors Committee (UCC). The company’s attorney also added that it would file court papers detailing its plan later in the week.</p>
