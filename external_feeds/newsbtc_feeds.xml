					<description><![CDATA[Argentine libertarian Presidential candidate and Bitcoin enthusiast Javier Milei has shocked the world by emerging victorious in Argentina’s recent primary elections. The pro-Bitcoin advocate scored the majority of the votes, making a stinging win during the Primaries on August 13. Javier Milei Demolishes Electoral Competition Javier Milei, an outspoken Argentine economist, is known for his sharp criticism of traditional politics and his fervent support of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin.

He has also said that Argentina’s adoption of bitcoin cryptocurrency would help create a more stable and accountable government, reducing government bureaucracy and improving the country’s declining economy.  “The central bank is a scam, a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with inflationary tax,” Milei stated.  BTC price recovers after brief dip &#124; Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com  Argentina Grapples with Spiraling Economic Crisis The daily reality of the Argentine country is filled with significant growth fluctuations, high inflation, and a deteriorating GDP.

					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), and ApeCoin (APE) have performed well against Bitcoin recently. Here&#8217;s what the memecoins&#8217; profits mean. SHIB, PEPE, And APE Have Enjoyed An Uptrend Recently Bitcoin has been going through a major phase of stagnation recently as the number 1 cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has remained stuck between the $29,000 and $30,000 levels. Much of the other market hasn&#8217;t been all that different, either. Out of the few coins that have gone against the grain and have displayed some volatility. However, the meme coins have especially stood out. Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Apecoin, in particular, have all pulled away from BTC. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, also saw bullish momentum earlier, but the asset has slowed down recently. Out of these assets, PEPE has been the best performer, as it has observed profits of about 22% within the past week. Looks like PEPE has been going up recently &#124; Source: PEPEUSD on TradingView While Pepe&#8217;s weekly gains are certainly the most impressive of the bunch, the meme coin is actually in severe losses of 17% when considering the period of the past month.

Then Prove BTC Is Not Manipulated, Says SEC ApeCoin has risen by 12% in the past week, and while the coin isn&#8217;t in negative during the past month, its performance for the period is still only flat. APE has also gone up in recent days &#124; Source: APEUSD on TradingView Unlike these two assets with significantly smaller market caps, Shiba Inu has not only registered impressive gains of 16% during the past week, but it has also observed a massive 32% rise during the last month. SHIB has sharply jumped recently &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView The reason behind the solid Shiba Inu performance is likely to be the much-hyped Shibarium upgrade, which is expected to launch sometime later in the current week. Does The Memecoin Rally Hold Any Significance For The Greater Market? All in all, it&#8217;s clear that these three meme coins have been building up bullish momentum recently, and they have been doing so simultaneously. In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed that while these assets may be rising, their social volumes haven&#8217;t budged much. SHIB and others haven't seen too high social volumes &#124; Source: Santiment The &#8220;social volume&#8221; here is a metric that keeps track of the degree of discussion that an asset is receiving on the major social media platforms. When this indicator has a high value, it&#8217;s a sign that a large number of users are talking about the coin and that there may be FUD or hype present around the coin. In uptrends, this metric reaching very high values is generally not a good sign, as it shows that FOMO is on the rise among social media users, which is something that has historically had an opposite effect on the price and has led to top formations. Since these metrics have risen for SHIB and the other meme coins, it means that social media users haven&#8217;t been paying too much attention so far to the pumps that these cryptocurrencies have been going through. Related Reading: Goldman Foresees Q2 2024 Fed Rate Cut: A Boost For Bitcoin? In the same post, Santiment also explains that the meme coins pulling away from Bitcoin have historically held significance for the entire sector. &#8220;This can often signal that the entire crypto market may be veering toward &#8216;overheated&#8217; territory,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. Santiment also says that when SHIB and co. see isolated pumps, &#8220;it is often associated with greed and/or boredom from the crowd. And these two behaviors often have adverse impacts on the markets.&#8221; Featured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The journey of Cardano (ADA) toward reclaiming the $0.3 price level seems to be growing more challenging in the days ahead, as the cryptocurrency grapples with persistent bearish pressure. After successfully managing to hold the line at $0.3 during the latter part of July, the digital asset encountered a setback in early August when this crucial support level split, potentially paving the way for further price declines. The $0.3 mark not only signifies a March low but also acted as a pivotal resistance point during the months of June and July. This level demonstrated its resilience by transforming into a support level in late July and early August. Nevertheless, the breach experienced in early August did not immediately send ADA into a downward spiral.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Steals The Spotlight, Leaving Bitcoin Behind In A Week Of Price Surges However, recent price analysis reveals a concerning development: a retest of this level followed by a price rejection has formed a bearish order block (OB) on the daily chart.

					<description><![CDATA[In a recent note that has caught the attention of both traditional financial markets and the Bitcoin community, Goldman Sachs economists, including the renowned Jan Hatzius and David Mericle, have made a significant prediction regarding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s monetary policy. The note suggests that the Federal Reserve may commence a series of interest rate cuts by the end of June 2024. “The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inflation is closer to target,” the Goldman economists wrote. This statement underscores the bank&#8217;s belief that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s current stance on interest rates may be too restrictive, especially if inflation rates continue to trend towards the central bank&#8217;s target. The note further elaborates: “Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason we also see a significant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady.” This cautious tone suggests that while Goldman Sachs is predicting a rate cut, they also acknowledge the unpredictability of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s decisions. Related Reading: US Bitcoin ETF Approval Could See North America’s ETF Volume Rise To 99.5% The recent data, which showed US inflation rising at a slower-than-expected rate of 3.2%, with the core consumer price index at a 4.7% annual pace, further complicates the picture. With the Fed&#8217;s benchmark rate currently set between 5.25% to 5.5%, Goldman Sachs expects it to stabilize around 3 to 3.25%. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? Expectations of a rate cut from Goldman Sachs are in line with market expectations according to the CME FedWatch Tool. In May 2024, 68% already expect there to be at least a 25 basis point (bps) rate cut. However, it remains to be seen whether macro events will influence the Bitcoin price again. In the last few months, BTC increasingly decoupled from macro events while the stock market rallied towards all-time highs and stagnated around the $30,000 mark.

The high expectations for these two events, coupled with a dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, could be a massive catalyst for the Bitcoin price.

					<description><![CDATA[The dynamic and ever-evolving blockchain community has shown a great deal of interest in and enthusiasm for Toncoin (TON). Due to its technological underpinnings and innovative answers to the long-standing problems that have plagued the field of decentralized finance, this digital money has risen to popularity very quickly. At the time of writing, TON was trading at $1.46, registering an impressive 10.4% increase in the last 24 hours. Equally impressive is the crypto&#8217;s price rally in the last week, when it registered a 22% climb, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Related Reading: Polkadot Bearish Trends Set The Stage For Bullish Possibilities – Here’s Why TON price action today. Source: Coingecko Just lately, the price of Toncoin broke out in a big way, separating itself from a 30-day consolidation. During this period of consolidation, prices moved inexactly between $1.31 and $1.49, showing a restricted and steady trading range. Toncoin Shows Signs Of Resilience Several times throughout this period of consolidation, the cryptocurrency showed signs of trying to rise beyond the $1.50 barrier, which may have suggested a possible upward trend. However, bullish market forces were unable to push the price over the $1.50 level, and the price ultimately closed below that level. The continuation of these adverse influences indicates that traders and investors are currently exercising caution. The bears&#8217; stubbornness implies there&#8217;s a widespread view that the market can&#8217;t handle a prolonged rise above $1.50 just yet. As of today, cryptocurrencies reached a market cap of $1.13 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Toncoin At A Glance The Open Network, or TON for short, is a layer-1 blockchain that is both decentralized and fast. Established in 2018, it is a proof-of-stake (PoS) network that has gained massive adoption among crypto users for its lightning-fast transactions. Related Reading: Solana Price Sparkles With 9% Increase, But Why Do Buyers Remain Cautious? TON set out to do some very big things, like simplifying transactions inside of Telegram. However, it encountered difficulty at every turn of its path. Despite the project&#8217;s initial focus on Gram, its native digital currency, it ran into trouble when the US Securities and Exchange Commission pointed out Telegram&#8217;s failure to register a substantial preliminary $1.7 billion Gram token sale. Source: Currency.com Possible Revisit Of Resistance Level This regulatory worry caused a brief halt in Gram sales, and the unrevealed offering ultimately led to a legal setback. Simultaneously, a slew of cyberattacks cast a pall over the TON&#8217;s appeal. Meanwhile, the present market structure indicates that the Toncoin price may revisit the resistance level of $1.49 if bulls can push prices above the support turned resistance of $1.31. For this to be even remotely credible, a candle closure over $1.31 would be required. If the TON price, however, rejects $1.31, it may return to the current support level of $1.17.

<p>The continuation of these adverse influences indicates that traders and investors are currently exercising caution. The bears&#8217; stubbornness implies there&#8217;s a widespread view that the market can&#8217;t handle a prolonged rise above $1.50 just yet.</p>

<h2><strong>Toncoin At A Glance</strong></h2>
<p>The Open Network, or TON for short, is a layer-1 blockchain that is both decentralized and fast. Established in 2018, it is a proof-of-stake (PoS) network that has gained massive adoption among crypto users for its lightning-fast transactions.</p>

<p>TON set out to do some very big things, like simplifying transactions inside of <a href="https://www.tekedia.com/top-crypto-investments-of-2023-xrp-ton-signuptoken-com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram.</a> However, it encountered difficulty at every turn of its path.</p>
<p>Despite the project&#8217;s initial focus on Gram, its native digital currency, it ran into trouble when the US Securities and Exchange Commission pointed out Telegram&#8217;s failure to register a substantial preliminary $1.7 billion Gram token sale.</p>

<strong>Possible Revisit Of Resistance Level</strong>
<p>This regulatory worry caused a brief halt in Gram sales, and the unrevealed offering ultimately led to a legal setback. Simultaneously, a slew of cyberattacks cast a pall over the TON&#8217;s appeal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the present market structure indicates that the Toncoin price may revisit the resistance level of $1.49 if bulls can push prices above the support turned resistance of $1.31.</p>
<p>For this to be even remotely credible, a candle closure over $1.31 would be required. If the TON price, however, rejects $1.31, it may return to the current support level of $1.17.</p>
