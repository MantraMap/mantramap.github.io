<ul><li>The FBI reportedly carried out a search at the residence of Kraken founder and CEO Jesse Powell.&nbsp;</li><li>The March 2023 search was over claims that Powell hacked and stalked a non-profit organization.&nbsp;</li><li>The FBI and federal prosecutors in California have been looking into Powell since September 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>The investigation is not related to Powell’s crypto business and has not led to any formal charges yet.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation reportedly carried out a search at the residence of Jesse Powell, the man behind <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kraken-sec-probe-unregistered-securities/">Kraken</a>, the second-largest crypto exchange in the United States. People familiar with the matter revealed that the FBI’s raid was not in connection with Powell’s cryptocurrency business but related to his non-profit ventures. </p>



<h2><strong>Kraken CEO Was Under Investigation Since Last Fall</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/technology/jesse-powell-kraken-crypto-fbi.html" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>, the FBI searched Jesse Powell’s residence in Los Angeles’ Brentwood area in March this year. Documents viewed by NYT revealed that federal agents seized electronic devices from the Kraken CEO’s home during the search. The search was reportedly over accusations against Powell of hacking and cyber-stalking a non-profit. </p>



<p>The Verge Center for the Arts, which was founded by Jesse Powell, accused him of interfering with its computer accounts and blocking access to emails and other online communications. The FBI and federal prosecutors in California have reportedly been looking into Powell since last fall. No formal charges have been filed against the Kraken founder yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>News of the FBI&#8217;s search and investigation was confirmed by Jesse Powell’s lawyer Brandon Fox, who added that Powell had not done anything wrong. A spokeswoman from Kraken told NYT that the FBI’s investigation of Verge was not related to the crypto exchange in any manner. According to her, the crypto firm had no reason to believe that the investigation involved any other potential issues. At the time of writing, there was no official statement from Jesse Powell regarding the recent developments.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Several senior executives at Binance have decided to quit the crypto exchange.</li><li>The executive blamed their decision on CEO Changpeng Zhao’s handling of the investigation by the Justice Department.&nbsp;</li><li>The departed executives include CSO Patrick Hillmann and Compliance SVP Steven Christie.&nbsp;</li><li>The latest development led to a considerable decline in the platform’s BNB token.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>After facing severed banking relationships, hostile regulators, and several instances of FUD, multiple senior executives at Binance have reportedly turned in their resignations. The executives blamed their decision to quit on CEO Changpeng Zhao’s handling of the regulatory inquiries and investigations into the exchange’s operations. Their departure comes amid mounting regulatory and legal troubles for the world’s largest crypto exchange.</p>



<h2><strong>BNB Tanks After Top Executives Quit Binance</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/07/06/binance-crisis-executives-quit-changpeng-zhao-justice-department/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a>, senior executives at Binance, including Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, Senior Vice President for Compliance Steven Christie, and General Counsel Han Ng, informed the Chief Executive that they were quitting the company. A person familiar with the matter revealed that the executives blamed their departure on Changpeng Zhao’s handling of the investigation by the US Department of Justice. The Justice Department’s probe is just one of many filed by federal agencies in the United States. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binances-market-share-down-by-10-in-2023/">Binance</a> or CEO Changpeng Zhao have not put out an official statement addressing the news of the recent departures. However, CSO Patrick Hillmann took to Twitter to inform everyone that he was leaving the company on good terms and would continue to respect and support Zhao. The BNB token took a visible hit following the latest development and was trading at $234 at the time of writing. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The loss of key figures from legal and compliance departments will likely cause problems for the crypto giant, given that it is juggling several regulatory inquiries. The crypto exchange is currently facing probes from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), among several other investigations. Matthew Price, Binance’s Chief of Global Investigations and Intelligence, also quit the company recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex has managed to recover $315,000 lost in a hack nearly seven years ago. The United States Department of Homeland Security helped the crypto exchange recover the funds in the form of cash and cryptocurrencies as part of an ongoing prosecution of the persons associated with the hack.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Bitfinex Will Redistribute Recovered Funds To Its Victims</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/crypto-exchange-bitfinex-says-315-000-from-2016-hack-recovered" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Bitfinex worked with Homeland Security to recover the funds that were lost in a hack back in August 2016. The hack drained 120,000 <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-pro-bitcoin/">Bitcoins</a> from the crypto exchange which was valued at approximately $72 million at the time. At the time of writing, the stolen Bitcoin was valued at a whopping $3.7 billion. The latest recovery is part of the exchange’s ongoing efforts to work with law enforcement and other agencies to recover the crypto assets stolen from the platform. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The U.S. government continues to make progress in prosecuting individuals involved in the Bitfinex security breach and in seizing funds associated with the theft.&#8221;</p><cite>Bitfinex Staff</cite></blockquote>



<p>The recovered funds will be redistributed among the holders of Bitfinex’s Recovery Right Tokens. These digital coins were issued to the victims of the hack and represent the funds owed to them. However, given that there are nearly 30 million Recovery Right Tokens in circulation, the victims will likely be refunded a negligible amount from the recent recovery. Authorities arrested a couple last year for allegedly laundering billions worth of Bitcoins associated with the hack. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Users in the Netherlands could choose to withdraw their funds from Binance to Coinmerce, Coinmerce CEO Jaap de Bruijn said in a blog post. </li><li>The company chose Coinmerce as its local partner amid preparations to exit the Dutch market due to regulatory reasons</li><li>Binance is shutting down its operations in the Netherlands and other European jurisdictions while facing lawsuits in the U.S.</li></ul>



<p>Dutch crypto exchange Coinmerce is an option for Binance users looking to withdraw their funds as crypto&#8217;s largest exchange bows out of the Netherlands due to licensing complications. </p>



<p>The update was confirmed by both Binance in an email to Dutch users and a <a href="https://coinmerce.io/en/news/binance-offers-dutch-users-switch-to-coinmerce/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmerce.io/en/news/binance-offers-dutch-users-switch-to-coinmerce/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from Coinmerce. &#8220;The crypto assets of the Dutch users at Binance will be transferred to Coinmerce via a controlled transition,&#8221; said Coinmerce CEO Jaap de Bruijn on Thursday. Notably, the transfer is optional and free.</p>



<p>Binance is unable to continue servicing Dutch users after failing to secure a license from the Dutch Central Bank as a virtual asset provider. The company will exit the Netherlands and shut down its local business as announced last month. </p>



<p>Per an email sent to Dutch users, the platform chose Coinmerce as its local partner since it is regulated by the DNB since 2020. Coinmerce boasts a &#8220;nearly identical&#8221; list of cryptocurrencies as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14s43f0/binance_recommending_coinmerce_in_the_netherlands/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14s43f0/binance_recommending_coinmerce_in_the_netherlands/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">noted</a> by the exchange in its email to users. </p>



<h2>Binance In Europe</h2>



<p>The Dutch Central Bank fined Binance $3.6 million (3.3 million euros) last year for operating without a license. Months later in 2023, the company is winding down local Dutch operations and referring users to a rival exchange. </p>



<p>French investigators stormed the platform&#8217;s Paris office as part of a probe into suspected money laundering. Australia&#8217;s securities regulator ASIC revoked the company&#8217;s license and also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-probed-derivatives/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-probed-derivatives/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched a probe into client classification</a> at the exchange. </p>



<p>The company has reaffirmed its commitment to complying with local laws and working with regulators to secure licenses needed to service users across jurisdictions. </p>

<p>The U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has concluded its probe into the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wintermute-helped-mashinsky-dupe-celsius/">Celsius</a> Network and found that the crypto lender and its founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky, broke the country’s laws before the firm imploded in mid-2022. The revelation comes almost a year after the crypto lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, leaving thousands of customers and creditors stranded.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>CFTC Could File A Federal Case Against Celsius This Month</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/cftc-probe-concludes-crypto-lender-celsius-ex-ceo-mashinsky-broke-rules" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the attorneys in the CFTC’s enforcement unit determined that Celsius misled its investors. The attorneys further stated that the defunct crypto lender should have registered itself with the commodities regulator. The CFTC has concluded that Celsius and its former CEO Alex Mashinsky broke U.S. regulations. People familiar with the matter revealed that the CFTC could file a federal case against the crypto lender this month if a majority of its commissioners agree with that conclusion. </p>



<p>Mashinsky is already facing a civil lawsuit from the state of New York. In the lawsuit filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James in January this year, the founder of the defunct crypto exchange was accused of defrauding investors out of billions of dollars by misleading them and misrepresenting the financial health of his crypto firm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Court <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11827/PLEADINGS/1182710062280000000010.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filings</a> previously made by the bankrupt crypto firm revealed that it was facing regulatory inquiries from several U.S. agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Massachusetts Securities Division, and the Washington Department of Financial Institutions Securities Division. The latest development in Celsius’ case led to a decline of over 12% in the platform’s native token CEL. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $0.15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry Fink, the man behind the world’s largest asset manager, has taken a rather friendly stance towards Bitcoin and the broader crypto space. As the Chief Executive of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nasdaq-blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-sec/">BlackRock</a> Inc, Fink described Bitcoin as an international asset in an interview with Fox Business earlier today. His support for the flagship cryptocurrency came just days after his firm filed an application with the SEC to offer a spot Bitcoin ETF. </p>



<h2><strong>BlackRock Wants To Democratize Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6H4eVwJpSw" rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> hosted by Fox Business’ Charles Gasparino, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink stated that his company wants to democratize Bitcoin and the broader crypto market and make it easier and less expensive for investors to explore this asset class. Fink added that he saw the potential in Bitcoin to revolutionize finance by tokenizing assets and securities. He also described BTC as digital gold and compared it with gold in the context of hedging against inflation. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We hope that, like in the past, we could be working with our regulators and get the filing approved one day, and I have no idea what that one day will be, but we’ll see how that all plays out.”</p><cite>Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock Inc. </cite></blockquote>



<p>Larry Fink also revealed that his $8.5 trillion asset management giant was working closely with regulators in the United States to seize the opportunity presented by Bitcoin. BlackRock’s application to offer a spot BTC ETF was recently rejected by the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to Fink, the securities regulator should look at the ETF filing as a way to democratize crypto. His latest comments on Bitcoin were the complete opposite of his stance back in 2017 when he described BTC as a tool for money laundering and other illicit activities.</p>

<p>The crypto market share of the largest crypto exchange in the world has gone down by double digits since the beginning of 2023. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-probed-derivatives/">Binance’s</a> market share has taken a hit from recent regulatory crackdowns and the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last month. Meanwhile, the crypto exchange’s American arm has also lost a significant share of the crypto market. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Expects Heavy Trading Volume</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by crypto analytics firm <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/reports/quarterly-report-q2-2023" rel="nofollow noopener">Kaiko</a>, Binance’s market share of spot volumes has dropped from 64% to 53% since January 2023. The regulatory crackdown, as well as legal trouble associated with the SEC and the CFTC, has led to the shedding of more than 10% of the crypto giant’s market share. Rival crypto exchanges, including Bybit and OKX, have benefitted from Binance’s woes by soaking up the market share lost by the crypto giant. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Binance US’s market share slipped below 1% in the second quarter of 2023. The international exchange’s derivatives volume has also taken a hit this year. Following the lawsuit by CFTC, the exchange’s perpetual market share dropped from 66% to 56%. Kaiko reported that American crypto giant Coinbase also suffered a similar fate with its market share going from 8% to 5.4%.</p>



<p>Despite the sinking market share and mounting regulatory and legal trouble, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao remains optimistic about the future of his crypto exchange. In a recent ask-me-anything session hosted on Twitter, Zhao stated that the trading platform is undergoing a lot of preparation in order to ready the systems to sustain higher crypto trading volumes. Citing historical patterns, Zhao stated that he was expecting increased trading activity in the next 6 to 18 months.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>An analyst from Piper Sandler downgraded the stock of crypto exchange Coinbase earlier today.&nbsp;</li><li>The analyst cited uncertainty in the crypto market and the ongoing legal battle with the United States SEC.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase’s share price fell by more than 4% following the projection from Piper Sandler’s analyst.&nbsp;</li><li>The analyst expects the trading volumes for Q2’23 to be the lowest in two years.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>An analyst from the U.S.-based investment bank Piper Sandler downgraded the country’s largest crypto exchange. Analyst Patrick Moley circulated a note earlier today wherein he shared a grim outlook for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-brian-armstrong-sold-29000-share/">Coinbase’s </a>stock, leading to a considerable decrease in the share price. The downgrade came just a week after German banking giant Berenberg warned that the stock’s recent rally could be short-lived. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Stock Down 4.7% </strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/coinbase-downgraded-as-analyst-says-crypto-limbo-dims-revenue-outlook" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Piper Sandler’s Patrick Moley cited Coinbase’s ongoing legal trouble with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for his latest projections. Moley also highlighted the continued lack of regulatory clarity in the United States, which according to him has created too much uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market to prudently project revenues in the coming years. </p>



<p>In the note shared earlier today, the Piper Sandler analyst downgraded his Coinbase recommendation from overweight to neutral. According to him, the trading volumes and the monthly transacting user totals for the second quarter of 2023 will be the lowest in over two years. Moley cut the price target of the stock from $65 to $60. The crypto exchange’s share price fell over 4% following the news. However, at the time of writing, the stock had slightly recovered and was trading at $78.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bearish projection from Piper Sandler came after the crypto exchange’s stock gained more than 50% over the past 30%. Much of the rally was triggered by applications for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) from traditional finance giants, including BlackRock and Fidelity which named Coinbase as a crypto custodian. However, Berenberg warned last week that the rally triggered by back-to-back BTC ETF applications may not last long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Valkyrie refiled its application for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC per a 19b-4 filing seen on Wednesday.</li><li>The asset manager joins other Wall Street titans like BlackRock and Fidelity in filing a second application after the SEC responded.</li><li>Valkyrie, like other asset managers, names Coinbase as its partner for the contentious surveillance-sharing agreement meant to tackle market manipulation.</li></ul>



<p>Trillion-dollar asset manager Valkyrie Digital Assets <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/valkyrie-is-latest-etf-issuer-to-refile-bitcoin-fund-application?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/valkyrie-is-latest-etf-issuer-to-refile-bitcoin-fund-application?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">submitted</a> another application for a spot Bitcoin ETF after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected previous attempts, saying that the filings did not address market manipulation concerns or meet the regulator&#8217;s requirements. </p>



<p>Valkyrie&#8217;s 19b-4 filing with the SEC names crypto exchange Coinbase as its partner for a contentious surveillance-sharing agreement. Notably, other issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity named Coinbase as their surveillance partners as well despite a hanging lawsuit against the exchange from America&#8217;s top securities regulator. </p>



<p>The asset manager argued its case for choosing Coinbase as its partner, noting that Nasqad previously executed a term sheet with the crypto exchange noted as the largest virtual currency trading venue in the U.S.</p>



<p>If approved by the SEC, Valkyrie would boast three separate exchange-traded funds that are tied to Bitcoin. In May 2022, the SEC approved Valkyrie&#8217;s Bitcoin futures ETF application that allows the company to offer two ETFs to investors. </p>



<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Wars</h2>



<p>Valkyrie is the latest wall street firm to enter the spot Bitcoin ETF frenzy as issuers race toward being the first to market with the product. Spot Bitcoin ETF will allow issuers to offer a fund that directly invests in Bitcoin. </p>



<p>BlackRock, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fidelity-bitcoin-spot-etf-blackrock/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fidelity-bitcoin-spot-etf-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>, 21 Shares/ARK Invest, Bitwise, WisdomTree, Invesco, VanECK, and Valkyrie have all filed for spot Bitcoin ETFs with the SEC, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart confirmed. BlackRock&#8217;s June 15 filing seemingly galvanized a wave of applications. The filing also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-rallies-29000-blackrock-etf-plays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> buoyed Bitcoin&#8217;s price above 30,000. </p>

<p>The local office of Binance Australia was probed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) as part of the regulator&#8217;s investigation into crypto&#8217;s largest centralized exchange. </p>



<p>According to people familiar with the matter, ASIC&#8217;s search of Binance&#8217;s premises is part of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/binance-australia-offices-searched-by-regulator-as-part-of-derivatives-probe?" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-05/binance-australia-offices-searched-by-regulator-as-part-of-derivatives-probe?" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">probe</a> into client classification on the platform and its local derivatives business. Bloomberg reported that the trading venue is cooperating with local authorities. </p>



<h2>Binance Australia Stuck In Derivatives Debacle</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s search comes after 500 derivatives positions were liquidated on the platform in February. The issue also reportedly affected user accounts, and some accounts were mysteriously closed down. </p>

ASIC officials disclosed that the probe was partly to determine how Binance classifies wholesale and retail clients.</p>



<p>Binance is also under heavy scrutiny in jurisdictions across the U.S. and Europe. The company&#8217;s office in Paris was stormed by officials investigating allegedly &#8220;aggravated money laundering&#8221;. Crypto&#8217;s leading CEX also pulled back from the U.K. and Cyprus. </p>



<p>German regulators <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-europe-paysafe-german-regulator/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-europe-paysafe-german-regulator/" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied the company&#8217;s custody license application</a> around the same time that major Euro payment partner Paysafe decided to cut support for bank transactions by September.</p>



<p>In the U.S., the company and CEO Chanpgeng Zhao stand accused of violating federal laws by offering unregistered securities trading to American investors. Zhao or CZ as he&#8217;s known by the media, is said to have commingled funds in private entities like Merit Peak. </p>



<p>The company and CZ <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-coinbase-after-binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied</a> the claims made by the SEC in its June lawsuit. </p>
