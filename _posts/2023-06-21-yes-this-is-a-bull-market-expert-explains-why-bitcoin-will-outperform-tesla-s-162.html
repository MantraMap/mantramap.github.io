The key to tracking Bitcoin’s next bull run could be its correlation with tech equities. The nascent crypto industry has been moving in tandem with this sector since 2021. At that time, the price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of around $69,000. The correlation with tech equities, as measured by the performance of the Nasdaq 100, has been decreasing over time and could continue this trajectory. According to the former hedge fund manager for Goldman Sachs, Raoul Pal, Bitcoin, and crypto are on track to outperform tech equities and “all other equities.” Despite the short-term turmoil in 2023, BTC’s price experienced a 75% increase year-to-date (YTD). In that sense, Ethereum (ETH), Tesla (TSLA), and other tech stocks have been rallying and will likely see further profits. As of this writing, ETH and TSLA experienced 50% and 160% profit, respectively.

As seen in the chart below, liquidity and financial conditions have been improving, according to Pal. In the past, whenever liquidity increased, BTC and equities followed.
