<h2>How Reducing Dollar Dependence Could Benefit Asian Countries</h2>
<p>Nigel Green, CEO of asset management firm Devere Group, published an opinion piece in Asia Times on Friday arguing that the decline of the U.S. dollar could benefit Asian economies. The executive began:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe that we are witnessing in real time the world beginning to shift away from a dollar-dominated financial system.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Among other reasons, this is because astronomic levels of debt, and the enormous amount of desperate money-printing to monetize these debts, have caused a considerable drop in the long-term value of the currency,” he detailed.</p>
<p>Reiterating his warning earlier this year that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance is under threat as Russia and Saudi Arabia eye the Chinese yuan for oil trade, the Devere boss emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>A shift away from dollar influence could have positive implications for Asian economies.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that reduced reliance on the greenback would allow Asian countries to “implement policies that are more tailored to their domestic economic conditions, potentially boosting stability and growth.”</p>

<p>Green further detailed: “With the dollar losing its stranglehold, Asian economies would also likely experience a diversification of reserve currencies, paving the way for greater regional trade and investment opportunities.” He continued: “A multilateral currency system would promote more extensive use of regional currencies like the Japanese yen, Chinese yuan and Indian rupee, making trade within Asia more accessible and efficient.”</p>
<p>Moreover, &#8220;A diminished dollar dominance would lead to more stable exchange rates, reducing volatility and uncertainty in cross-border transactions,&#8221; he noted. The Devere executive concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>A decline in dollar dominance would encourage Asian countries to diversify their reserve holdings, leading to better allocation of resources and increased investment in productive sectors.</p></blockquote>

The 2024 presidential candidate revealed the decision to accept digital currencies during a Coindesk TV broadcast.</strong></p>
<h2>2024 Presidential Candidate Francis Suarez Embraces Crypto Donations</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pro-bitcoin-miami-mayor-francis-suarez-joins-race-for-2024-us-presidential-election/">Francis Suarez</a>, the current mayor of Miami, is well known for his stance toward bitcoin and crypto assets, and Suarez is looking to challenge incumbent president Joe Biden in the 2024 U.S. general election. On Friday, the mayor announced that he&#x2019;s accepting crypto assets for campaign donations, joining two other candidates who have revealed they are accepting bitcoin for donations as well. Suarez broke the news on a Coindesk TV <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/08/04/miami-mayor-francis-suarez-to-accept-presidential-campaign-donations-in-bitcoin-and-other-crypto/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines">broadcast</a>.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Officially, my campaign is accepting bitcoin,&#x201D; Suarez disclosed. &#x201C;This is a process of developing technologies that are going to create democratizing opportunities for wealth creation and are not manipulated by a human being&#x2019;s ulterior motives, political goals, etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>However, Suarez is not just accepting bitcoin. The presidential candidate&#x2019;s website says &#x201C;crypto&#x201D; and leads to a portal that accepts crypto donations. The portal connects to a Bitpay invoice after the selected donation amount is chosen. In the Bitpay invoice portal, payments are directed to Suarez for President Inc. Payments can be made in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, DOGE, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>, SHIB, USDC, DAI, MATIC, APE, BUSD, WBTC, USDP, GUSD and EUROC. Interestingly, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>) is shown on the Bitpay invoice but is &#x201C;not supported.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Suarez joins presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a Democrat, who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kennedy-jr-to-accept-btc-for-campaign-contributions-says-bitcoin-is-an-exercise-in-democracy/">announced</a> his acceptance of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on May 21, 2023, and Vivek Ramaswamy, a Republican, who made his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/clash-of-presidential-contenders-bitcoin-gains-prominence-as-2024-us-election-approaches/">announcement</a> to accept <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> for campaign donations just hours after Kennedy during the same Bitcoin 2023 convention in Miami. The 2016 presidential race was the first to have candidates accept crypto for campaign financing.</p>
<p>Rand Paul, a Republican and son of Ron Paul, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/7/8362919/rand-paul-accepts-bitcoins">announced</a> his acceptance of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in April 2015, becoming the first presidential candidate in American history to receive donations through cryptocurrency. Democratic presidential candidates Andrew Yang and Eric Swalwell accepted digital currencies for their 2020 runs. Suarez made a name for himself in the crypto space years ago, was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/pro-bitcoin-miami-mayor-will-take-next-paycheck-100-in-btc/">paid in bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/miami-mayor-francis-suarez-plans-to-take-a-fraction-of-his-401k-in-bitcoin/">chose</a> to invest a portion of his 401(k) retirement plan in bitcoin.</p>

Their chief U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, is confident that the American economy will maintain a modest but steady growth trajectory throughout the remainder of the current year and well into 2024.</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan Foresees U.S. Economic Growth Amid ‘Ridiculous’ Fitch Downgrade and Recession Fears</h2>
<p>Echoing Bank of America&#8217;s revision of its economic outlook, JPMorgan&#8217;s team of economists have likewise set aside their earlier <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-outlines-4-global-outlook-scenarios-warns-of-boil-the-frog-recession-as-global-downturn-looms/">recession projections</a>. The top-ranking bank in the nation initially forecasted a downturn for 2023. However, their principal U.S. economist, Michael Feroli, now holds a more optimistic view that the U.S. can successfully dodge a full-scale recession.</p>
<p>“While a recession is no longer our modal scenario, risk of a downturn is still very elevated,” Feroli <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/04/jpmorgan-backs-off-recession-call-even-with-very-elevated-risks.html">wrote</a> on Friday. “One way this risk could materialize is if the Fed is not done hiking rates. Another way in which recession risks could materialize is if the normal lagged effects of the tightening already delivered kick in.”</p>
<p>Feroli, alongside his cohort of economists at JPMorgan, now foresees an economic resurgence in 2023, followed by a period of &#8220;modest, sub-par growth&#8221; in the subsequent year. This projection defies the widespread <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-dollar-collapse-inevitable/">dissenting opinion</a> that a recession, or even a depression, within the U.S., is inevitable. Danielle DiMartino Booth, the CEO and chief strategist at QI Research, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/qi-researchs-dimartino-booth-foresees-full-damage-yet-to-unfold-in-us-banking-sector/">argues</a> that the repercussions of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate increments and quantitative tightening have yet to fully manifest in the U.S. banking industry.</p>

<p>Moreover, JPMorgan&#8217;s perspective comes on the heels of Fitch Ratings&#8217; decision to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">lower the credit rating</a> of the United States. Unfazed by Fitch&#8217;s downgrade, JPMorgan&#8217;s chief, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-boss-warns-everyone-should-be-prepared-for-interest-rates-going-higher-from-here/">Jamie Dimon</a>, dismissed the move as &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; in an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/02/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-calls-fitch-ratings-us-downgrade-ridiculous-but-says-doesnt-really-matter.html">interview</a>. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon downplayed the significance of the downgrade, saying &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t really matter that much,&#8221; and emphasized that the United States remains &#8220;the most prosperous nation on the planet, [and] the most secure nation on the planet.”</p>
<p>Dimon and his team at JPMorgan perceive a budding growth in the U.S. economy, prompting their economists to doubt their previous forecasts. “Given this growth, we doubt the economy will quickly lose enough momentum to slip into a mild contraction as early as next quarter, as we had previously projected,” Feroli concluded in his missive to investors last Friday.</p>

The judge ruled the complaint lacked plausible claims of injury and failed to show that Tether&#x2019;s stablecoin <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> had diminished in value.</strong></p>
<h2>Judge Dismisses Market Manipulation Case Against Bitfinex and Tether</h2>
<p>A high-profile <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.524076/gov.uscourts.nysd.524076.1.0_1.pdf">class action lawsuit</a> filed against cryptocurrency firms Tether and Bitfinex was dismissed Friday by chief judge Laura Taylor Swain of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Judge Swain ruled the complaint lacked plausible allegations of injury and failed to demonstrate damages resulting from the actions of Tether and Bitfinex.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It's a good Friday.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tether?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tether</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bitfinex?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Bitfinex</a> Win Comprehensive Legal Victory as U.S. District Court Dismisses Class Action Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Court correctly held that plaintiffs&#x2019; complaint lacked any &#x201C;plausible allegations of injury&#x201D; because it includes no facts showing that &#x201C;<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> had a&#x2026;</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The lawsuit, originally filed in October 2019, accused Tether and Bitfinex of market manipulation through the issuance of unbacked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> stablecoins. Tether is the company that issues <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. Bitfinex is a cryptocurrency exchange that shares common owners and executives with Tether.</p>
<p>In her ruling, Judge Swain wrote that the complaint includes no facts showing that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> had a diminished actual value at any time and lacks any plausible allegations of injury, according to a <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-and-bitfinex-win-comprehensive-legal-victory-as-us-district-court-dismisses-class-action-lawsuit/">blog post</a> published by Tether. She dismissed the case in its entirety.</p>

<p>Tether welcomed the dismissal, saying in a statement that the claims were &#x201C;void of any legal merit.&#x201D; The company said it remains focused on fulfilling its commitments to customers and the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>According to the memorandum order on Pacer, the plaintiffs can file a motion to amend their complaint within 21 days to address the issues cited by judge Swain. If no motion is filed, the claims will be dismissed with no further notice due to lack of jurisdiction. The news follows Tether&#x2019;s latest <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-attestation-reveals-reserve-increase-of-850-million-in-q2-excess-reserves-reach-3-3-billion/">assurance report</a> which showed a reserve increase of $850 million in the second quarter of 2023.</p>

<p>Lately, Tether&#x2019;s attestation reports have sparked discussions within the crypto community regarding the firm&#x2019;s earnings and bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) holdings. The <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/">Q1 2023 Assurance Report</a> for Tether indicated that it possessed bitcoin reserves amounting to $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>BDO prepared the most recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tether-attestation-reveals-reserve-increase-of-850-million-in-q2-excess-reserves-reach-3-3-billion/">attestation</a>, which demonstrated an $850 million increase in Tether&#x2019;s reserves in Q2 2023. On August 3, 2023, Tom Wan, a research analyst at 21.co, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwanhh/status/1687304569750175744?s=20">posted</a> on social media platform X that he believed a specific address was associated with Tether.</p>

<p>Crypto journalist Yogita Khatri <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/243310/tether-bitcoin-11th-largest-holder?utm_source=telegram2&utm_medium=social">reported</a> after the social media post that &#x201C;a source with direct knowledge of the matter confirmed to The Block that Tether is the 11th-largest bitcoin holder.&#x201D; According to the <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html">BTC rich list</a>, the address &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qjasf9z3h7w3jspkhtgatgpyvvzgpa2wwd2lr0eh5tx44reyn2k7sfc27a4">bc1qj</a>&#x201D; possesses a balance of 55,022.19 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, equivalent to $1.6 billion at current exchange rates.</p>
<p>Though Tether has neither refuted nor affirmed ownership of this <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> address, onchain data reveals numerous bitcoin transfers originating from Bitfinex, as per Arkham Intelligence data.</p>

<p>Blockchain explorers characterize the address connected with the purported Tether bitcoin wallet &#x201C;<a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1Kr6QSydW9bFQG1mXiPNNu6WpJGmUa9i1g">1Kr6Q</a>&#x201D; as one owned by Bitfinex.

<p>X will “never” launch its own crypto token, its owner, billionaire investor Elon Musk, stated explicitly. He was replying to a post by a user with the handle @cb_doge who warned others about articles advertising non-existent tokens.</p>
<p>The latter bear names such as “$X token” and “Twitter token,” creating the false impression of links to or authorization by X or Twitter, its previous brand name, and Musk. Investors are lured with claims of incredible price gains in short periods of time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Elon Musk and 𝕏 never launched a crypto token. Be careful of such articles. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a0.png" alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/tZqfwMMm2X">pic.twitter.com/tZqfwMMm2X</a></p>
<p>— DogeDesigner (@cb_doge) <a href="https://twitter.com/cb_doge/status/1687659637611565056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The warning points out that neither the social media network nor its owner have ever launched a digital token. “And we never will,” responded Elon Musk who bought Twitter for $44 billion last year and is now rebranding it to X.</p>
<p>The clickbait media titles also reference the favorite crypto of X’s former CEO and current tech chief, dogecoin. DOGE has become one of the most recognizable and popular meme coins, largely due to Musk’s association with it and shilling.</p>

<p>In June, Elon Musk was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-faces-insider-trading-accusations-in-dogecoin-lawsuit-over-twitter-logo-change/">accused</a> of insider trading in a class-action lawsuit involving dogecoin. The price of DOGE jumped by 30% when the entrepreneur temporarily <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/twitter-changes-bird-logo-to-picture-of-doge-dogecoin-price-surges-20-after-the-change/">altered</a> Twitter’s logo to feature that of the meme coin. Plaintiffs claimed that the change had inflated its price.</p>
<p>Eventually, Musk replaced the iconic blue bird permanently in July with the current X logo. In a post, he <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1683656350046232578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that the Twitter name does not make sense anymore, since messages are not restricted in terms of characters and users can post even large videos.</p>
<p>“So we must bid adieu to the bird,” Musk said while also highlighting the role he envisages for the social media platform in his plan to build a super-app. “In the months to come, we will add comprehensive communications and the ability to conduct your entire financial world,” the owner promised without specifying whether that would include cryptocurrencies.</p>

The move comes as traders continue to react to Binance’s decision to approve the coin as a collateral asset, in addition to the upcoming launch of Shibarium. Dogecoin also snapped its recent losing streak today.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) jumped to a three-month high on Saturday, with prices surging by as much as 10%.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.000008551 on Friday, SHIB/USD surged to a peak of $0.000009509 earlier in today’s session.</p>
<p>This resulted in the meme coin climbing to its strongest point since May 6, when price reached a high of $0.00001007.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the move comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) moved past a resistance level of 67.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 73.62, which is its highest level since February.</p>
<p>Should momentum continue throughout the weekend, the next target for bulls is likely to be a ceiling at $0.00001025.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to SHIB, dogecoin (DOGE) also rose higher today, snapping a three-day losing streak in the process.</p>
<p>DOGE/USD rallied to a high at $0.07628, less than 24 hours after the meme coin was at a low of $0.07279.</p>
<p>As a result of this surge in price, DOGE is now trading at its highest point since Wednesday, after breaking out of a resistance zone of $0.0760.</p>

<p>This coincided with the RSI moving past its own ceiling at the 52.00 mark. It is currently at a reading of 55.84.</p>
<p>Despite today’s rally, dogecoin is still trading nearly 3% lower than at the same point last weekend.</p>

Ethereum neared a multi-week low.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped to below the $29,000 level on Saturday, as traders continued to digest the latest nonfarm payrolls report.</p>
<p>Following a high of $29,302.08 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to a bottom of $28,885.34 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>This was the first time since Tuesday that the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency had fallen below $29,000.</p>

<p>Saturday&#x2019;s decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) moved to a long-term support level at 42.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking marginally below this point, as bears attempt to maintain the current downward momentum.</p>
<p>However, price has since consolidated, and as of writing is trading above today&#x2019;s low, with a current price of $29,022.59.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) remained above the $1,800 level, despite bearish sentiment intensifying on Saturday.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to a bottom at $1,817.41 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following a peak of $1,847.91 the day prior.</p>
<p>The decline saw ethereum drop close to Tuesday&#x2019;s low at $1,812, which was the weakest point the cryptocurrency had hit since June 21.</p>

<p>This latest downturn comes as price strength moved below a key support point at the 43.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 41.57.</p>

Kenya&#8217;s ICT Minister Eliud Owalo has said Worldcoin&#8217;s verification services were being carried out within the confines of the law.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Activities Not in Breach of Kenyan Laws</h2>
<p>Alex Blania, the co-founder and CEO of Worldcoin’s founding entity Tools for Humanity (TFH), announced on Aug. 2 that his organization had &#8220;paused World ID verifications in Kenya.&#8221; According to Blania, this move gives his organization time to address some of the concerns raised by Kenyan regulators.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">TFH has paused World ID verifications in Kenya as we continue to work with local regulators to address their questions. We apologize to everyone in Kenya for the delay.</p>
<p>World ID is built for privacy. We look forward to resuming operations, while continuing global rollout.</p>
<p>&mdash; Alex Blania (@alexblania) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexblania/status/1686846072901996544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The remarks by Blania follow reports that the Kenyan government has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-government-says-it-has-suspended-worldcoin-activities/">suspended</a> Worldcoin activities over public safety concerns. Before the government decided to suspend Worldcoin’s activities, the Kenyan data regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kenyan-data-regulator-issues-warning-as-residents-rush-to-get-worldcoins-free-money/">warned</a> residents against giving away their details via TFH’s eye scanners which are also known as &#8220;Orbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite facing heat from regulators and government officials, TFH’s crypto project appears to have won the backing of the country’s ICT minister, Eliud Owalo. In remarks made on the day Worldcoin’s activities were suspended, Owalo insisted that Blania’s organization was &#8220;acting within the law.&#8221; The ICT minister also pointed to the fact that most Kenyan participants were not being forced to share their details.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Mitigating Crowd Volumes</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in an apparent response to concerns raised by the Kenyan government when it announced the suspension of Worldcoin’s activities, Blania suggested that his organization is pro-privacy.</p>
<p>&#8220;World ID is built for privacy. We look forward to resuming operations while continuing global rollout,&#8221; Blania said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/alexblania/status/1686846072901996544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1686846072901996544%7Ctwgr%5Eebf06a01e10226394a00784028b46d5865f732eb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F08%2F03%2Fworldcoin-plans-to-resume-iris-scans-in-kenya%2F">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to Blania’s tweet, the Worldcoin team released a statement in which they also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/03/worldcoin-plans-to-resume-iris-scans-in-kenya/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMfPA6pIpqUWe-CzV592VpYen1_C8wEVK6DV5xPD-5NylMdXJVy1ivs-PYhvnoiZW648qnrA7rsMuYwTewCq0S83lHYALQqMnFto0lnHw6nzz8es2c0viUdg9ItkRaAtfTt_lyclLKEhntvKysBtA6mC3Hn6_9tEm2rHggXglcl8">confirm</a> the temporary pause of verification services in the East African country. The team, however, characterizes the pause as a step it took &#8220;to mitigate crowd volume.&#8221;</p>
