Many investors were taken off guard by the events that unfolded throughout the year, which made it substantially more difficult to understand the crypto market. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">world’s largest crypto exchange Binance</a> managed to survive along with a few others, although facing quite a few hiccups along the way.</p>
<h2>Binance Records 10X Growth</h2>
<p>The on-chain data and analytics platform CryptoQuant recently <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1612675398470352899" rel="nofollow">published</a> a chart that demonstrated the annual growth of Binance over the past two years. The annual revenue of the CZ-led platform is said to have experienced an increase of 10 times, as stated in the report. In 2021, Binance&#8217;s quarterly revenue began to increase dramatically, and the trend continued throughout the year. In 2022, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange&#8217;s</a> yearly revenue hit over $12 billion.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-134880" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11020909/Screenshot-2023-01-11-020846.png" alt="" width="563" height="453" /></p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Massive Outflows</h2>
<p>In spite of this, the trading volumes on the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> began to decrease toward the end of 2022, which resulted in a reduction in the expected quarterly revenue. In the month of December 2022, Binance had a one-week loss of 90,000 Bitcoin (BTC) from its reserves. And, as reported earlier on CoinGape, data from the 9th of January showed <a title="Nearly $12 Billion Vanishes From Binance’s Assets; What’s Going On?" href="https://coingape.com/12-billion-vanishes-from-binances-assets-60-days/" rel="bookmark">nearly $12 Billion vanished from Binance’s asset</a> holdings in just 60 days. On December 23, the trading volume of the exchange reached $9.39 billion, which was its lowest level in the past few months.</p>
<p>Given the exchange’s dominance in the industry, it’s reasonable to be concerned that these could further contribute to the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market&#8217;s</a> instability. And if the rate of withdrawals continue to increase at the same pace, it could eventually result in devastating implications for crypto assets and market players as well.</p>
<p>On the other hand, its rival exchange, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/okx/">OKX</a>, witnessed a 4X increase in organic growth during the past two years. In addition, OKX&#8217;s revenue seemed to reflect that of Binance but the company&#8217;s revenue was recorded at $948 million in 2022. At the same time, competitors such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/huobi/">Huobi</a> have witnessed significant difficulty and since the second quarter of 2021, the exchange&#8217;s quarterly revenue has fallen by 98%.</p>

This V-shaped recovery registered nearly 20% growth and pushed the coin to its current price of $12.7. However, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> is currently hitting the resistance trendline of a long-coming wedge pattern, which could regulate the near future price</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today’s speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell could trigger temporary volatility in crypto</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Avalanche coin needs a bullish breakout from the wedge pattern to begin a sustained price recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Avalanche coin is $328.6 Million, indicating a 62% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/JcpFRTvG.png" alt="Avalanche Coin" width="1814" height="778" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wedge-pattern/">descending wedge pattern</a>, the Avalanche coin price has been steadily falling over the past six months. During the pattern formation, the coin price continues to resonate between two converging trendlines until its breach from the overhead one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the price action getting narrower down the wedge pattern reflects the weakening of bearish momentum. Thus, the pattern itself displays the inability of the sellers to bolster a deeper downfall after each successive price cycle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the most probable outcome of this pattern is a bullish breakout from its resistance trendline, which triggers a new directional recovery for coin holders. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, with the improving market sentiment, the AVAX price jumped 5% today and reached the resistance trendline of the wedge pattern. Thus, as mentioned above, a potential breakout from the trendline will intensify the bullish momentum and provide an entry opportunity for traders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The post-breakout rally may witness a quick target of 14% by hitting the $14.6 resistance. However, in ideal bullish conditions, the potential rally may reach the topmost swing high of this pattern which for AVAX price is $30.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the selling pressure in the market persists, the AVAX price may witness another bear cycle which plunges below the $10.5 low.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the recent price jump in AVAX reclaimed 20-and-50-day EMA slopes, which may assist buyers for trendline breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI indicator:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI Slope</a> rising high into the bullish territory indicates a confident and strong price recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avalanche Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $12.8</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels: $14.6 and $16</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $12.3 and $</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">16.7</span></li>

In what U.S. prosecutors have hailed as the first case of insider trading involving <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>, Nikhil Wahi, the perpetrator of the illicit trading plan, was handed a sentence of 10 months in prison for his participation in the scheme.</p>
<h2>Insider Trading At Coinbase</h2>
<p>Nikhil Wahi stated in September of the previous year that he had executed trades based on information that was deemed exclusive by the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase.</a> Ishan Wahi, the erstwhile product manager at Coinbase, is accused by federal authorities in Manhattan of disclosing confidential information to his brother and their mutual acquaintance Sameer Ramani on new <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto tokens</a> that Coinbase intended to make available for users to trade.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Check Out The Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p>According to the prosecutors, Wahi was able to accumulate close to $900,000 by investing in 40 different digital assets with the information he received from his brother. The final verdict was handed down by the U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska.</p>
<p>Nikhil accepted his crime and was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I made a huge mistake, a terrible mistake. It’s something that I will have to live with forever.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Nikhil Wahi To Repay All Profits</h2>
<p>In addition to the term of imprisonment, Wahi has also been ordered by Preska to give up the $892,525 in profits he had generated from the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/crypto-insider-trading/">insider-trading</a>. Additionally, he was placed on probation for a period of two years.</p>
<p>The prosecution requested that Wahi be given a prison sentence of up to sixteen months if he was found guilty. However, the defense attorney Priya Chaudhry explained to the judge that Wahi was not driven by greed but rather by the intention to repay his Indian parents for paying his college education in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> and to assist them in having a more secure retirement.</p>
<p>Wahi, who was hoping to avoid doing any jail time, will instead be required to return to India once he has finished serving his term.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Shiba coin price is rallying under the influence of a rounding bottom pattern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout from $0.0000096 resistance will encourage the coin price to 20% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $115.2 Million, indicating a 36% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/0/0UDy4kEQ.png" alt="Shiba Inu coin" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing the bullish recovery we saw last week, the Shiba Inu coin prices sustained higher levels and showed a phenomenal increase of 8% in the last 24 hours. The bullish recovery has recently breached a crucial resistance level of $0.00000865, resulting in a long engulfing candle forming in the daily chart. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a deeper analysis of the price action, we can find a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a> forming in the daily chart with the neckline at the crucial level of $0.0000096. The formation of this bullish reversal pattern indicates sustained recovery in the market.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the daily candle displays a higher price rejection from the 100-day EMA line, projecting a possibility of an increase in supply pressure. Thus, a consolidation phase close to the neckline is possible as it remains an area of increased supply. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the high price rejection, if the daily candle manages to close above the neckline at $0.0000096, Shiba holders can expect a 20% increase in the market value in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> A gradual spread between the rising <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal lines accentuates the steady growth in SHIB price. Moreover, these slopes could potentially breach the midline offering additional confirmation for long holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the recent recovery phase breaks above the 20-and-50-day EMA to reach the 100 EMA projecting a high bullish momentum. </span></p>

In theory, this bullish reversal pattern indicates a slow yet sustained recovery, which soars the assets price higher. Though the BTC price is currently struggling to surpass the local resistance of $17300, this bullish pattern may bolster buyers to achieve even higher price levels.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A rounding bottom recovery in the current leading the ongoing recovery in the BTC price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $17280 will trigger a 5% price jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $16.2 Billion, indicating a 1.5% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/o6BfOc6m.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During mid-December of 2022, the crypto market struggled through uncertainty, causing the Bitcoin price to hover above $16340 support. Though this narrow consolidation price created a stagnant market sentiment, the BTC price confirmed its sustainability above the $16340 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, amid the new year recovery in the market, the coin price rebounded from the aforementioned support and triggered a new recovery rally. Over the last ten days, the Bitcoin price has surged 4.5% higher and reached its current price of $17233.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this bullish rally, the gradual rise in volume activity reflects the growth in buyers&#8217; commitment to potential recovery. However, the Bitcoin price faces aggressive selling at the local resistance of $17300, putting the buyer&#8217;s goals under threat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, today the market will be closing watching Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell&#8217;s speech, as it could cause certain volatility in the market. If the above gives a positive push to the market, the BTC price may breach the $17300 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish breakout will further bolster the rounding bottom formation and surge the prices 5% higher to hit the $18150 neckline resistance. A breakout from this resistance will be crucial for BTC holders as it triggers significant growth in the near term.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> with the recent price jump, the BTC price breached the 20-and-50-day EMA, offering an additional support level for coin holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal lines are on the verge of rising above the midline. This crossover will indicate the growing bullish momentum and a buy signal for interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $17319</span></li>

This comes after Jared, who recently served as the liaison for TFL and the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/lunc/">LUNC</a> community, asserted that the Terra Classic network stands to gain significantly from the new &#8220;breakthrough in chain integrations&#8221;.</p>
<h2>LUNC&#8217;s Integration In Interchain Station</h2>
<p>While speaking on the release of the new station wallet, Jared&#8217;s comment sparked widespread interest within the community as the new integration had been a much-awaited update for the re-launch of the dwindling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a>. The lead developer further mentioned that the launch had been delayed till Jan 12 due to this development.</p>
<p>Jared was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the LUNC community. Stay tuned, the delay is related to an update you’ve been waiting for.</p></blockquote>
<p>The announcement follows up with the news of multiple integrations currently taking place in the wallet&#8217;s repository, which include the likes of Osmosis, Juno, SEI, Carbon and another &#8220;bonus chain&#8221; that would be revealed later this week. Moreover, Jared confirmed that the interchain support would be made available within the next 48 hours and the chain integrations would be done in a progressive manner.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are launching interchain support roughly 48hrs from this tweet.<br />After this initial launch, chain integrations will be on a rolling basis.</p>

<h2>Terra Classic (LUNC) Token Burn</h2>
<p>Jared&#8217;s tweets come at a time when the classic chain has been continually facing reports of internal conflict among the developer groups viz. Terra Rebels and the massive undelegation process carried out by exchanges; case in point, the recent <a href="https://coingape.com/kucoin-undelgated-48-billion-terra-classic-lunc-tokens/">48 Billion LUNC undelegation</a> by the KuCoin <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2">crypto exchange</a>.</p>

<p>However, on the other hand, the Terra Classic community has actively been burning the excess number of tokens in circulation. By 2023, the project and the validators of the chain plan to have burned billions of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens. Currently, the community has staked about 850 billion LUNC tokens collectively and burned approximately 37.30 million of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> so far.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Terra Classic (LUNC) price is currently being traded at $0.000167. This represents an increase of 3.1% on the day, in contrast to the massive gain of 10.2% during the last week, as per CoinGape’s <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker.</p>

Nearly 114 countries are currently exploring the option of a national digital currency in the form of CBDC. According to the Bank of International Settlements, CBDC is envisioned by most as a new form of central bank money. Central banks are embracing CBDCs in an attempt to compete with private and decentralized cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Origin of CBDC</h2>
<p>The first country to propose a national digital currency was China when its central bank, People’s Bank of China, began research on the digital currency in 2014 under the leadership of Governor Zhou Xiaochuan. The deputy governor of the Chinese central bank at the time, Fan Yifei, had asked central banks to take the lead, both in supervising private digital currencies and in developing digital legal tender of their own.</p>
<p>China became the first major economy to launch a pilot project of its central bank-backed digital currency back in April 2021, paving the way for other major economies to test run their CBDC.</p>
<h2>Why are governments getting into digital currency?</h2>
<p>There are several reasons why governments around the world have put development of a CBDC on a fast track in recent years. One of the common reasons for central banks to launch their digital currencies is to ward off competition from <a href="https://coingape.com/top-5-web-3-0-cryptocurrencies-that-may-take-over-bitcoin-in-future/">private digital currencies</a> and stop people from using them. Other reasons why central banks are developing digital currencies is to engage in international trade without depending on the US dollar. Some central banks have proposed retail and as well international use for their digital currency in their pilot launch.</p>
<h2>List of countries that are developing CBDC:</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are nearly 114 countries in the world, representing 95% of global GDP, that are exploring CBDC at some capacity right now. In 2023 over 20 countries will take significant steps towards piloting a CBDC.</p>
<p><strong>India</strong> &#8211; On 29 January 2021, the central government of India proposed a bill to ban trading and investments in cryptocurrencies while giving legal power to the country’s central bank, RBI, for developing CBDC. Last year, India’s finance minister announced the roll out of the <a href="https://coingape.com/indias-finance-minister-says-cbdc-digital-rupee-coming-2022-2023/">Digital Rupee</a> by 2023. India has already<a href="https://coingape.com/rbi-india-digital-rupee-launch-cities-cbdc/"> launched a pilot</a> of its retail and wholesale CBDC.<br />
Australia &#8211; The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is expecting to complete its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot by mid-2023, according to a white paper published in September 2022. The central bank launched the pilot of its CBDC in August last year.</p>
<p><strong>Brazil</strong> &#8211; The Central Bank of Brazil President Roberto Campos Neto announced that they plan to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by 2024.</p>
<p><strong>South Korea</strong> &#8211; The central bank of South Korea, Bank of Korea, tested a program that allows cross-border remittances by linking different central bank digital currencies (CBDC) from other countries. <a href="https://coingape.com/south-korea-aims-to-become-powerhouse-of-metaverse/">South Korea</a> has already completed the first of two phases by January and is expected to roll out a wider launch this year.</p>
<p><strong>Russia</strong> &#8211; The rogue nation Russia is planning to develop a cross-border settlement system using a central bank digital currency (CBDC) by next year. Russia faced severe sanctions from the USA and other countries after it invaded Ukraine. In order to bypass these sanctions, Russia has fast tracked its process to launch its CBDC.</p>
<p><strong>European Union</strong> &#8211; The European Central Bank is also expected to launch its CBDC pilot this year. Earlier, ECB chief Fabio Panetta wrote in a blog that through CBDCs, central banks “will safeguard the trust on which private forms of money ultimately depend.”</p>
<p><strong>United States</strong> &#8211; In an attempt to beat China, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell announced plans to publish a detailed paper on central bank digital currency, highlighting the possibility of issuing a US CBDC back in May 2021. In February last year, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston released initial details of Project Hamilton, a potential CBDC. Though the US might have been behind in the CBDC race, it is on its way to launch its digital dollar.</p>
<p>UAE, Ghana, South Africa, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand have all launched pilot projects of their central bank-backed digital currencies.</p>
<h2>Digital currency as a surveillance tool</h2>
<p>The main difference between a CBDC and a decentralized digital currency is the central authority that controls the currency. When China announced its plans to launch the digital yuan, several from the crypto industry raised alarms over it. By forcing CBDC adoption, China could use its digital yuan as a mass surveillance tool to monitor each and every transaction made by people. Each digital currency transaction will leave footprints that the government will have access to.</p>
<h2>Can we trust the government with CBDC?</h2>
<p>Famous whistleblower and digital privacy advocate Edward Snowden thinks CBDCs could give governments too much control over citizens’ finances. While speaking at Camp Ethereal last year, Edward Snowden explained CBDC by comparing it with a cartoon show from the 1980s. “Scrooge McDuck in DuckTales had a giant vault full of coins and dollar bills and things like that. And if he needs money, a giant magnet comes out of the top of it, and it just pulls dollars out of everybody in the town&#8217;s pockets. That is what a CBDC is, right? And that&#8217;s really all it is,&#8221; Snowden said.</p>
<p>Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes wrote in a<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://entrepreneurshandbook.co/pure-evil-c0c2148f81ab" rel="nofollow"> blog post</a> last year that CBDCs represent a full-frontal assault on people&#8217;s ability to have sovereignty over honest transactions between themselves. He warned that governments all around the world will replace physical cash with CBDC and usher into a new dystopia of financial surveillance.</p>
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Majority of central banks around the world are engaging in CBDCs in some capacity. While countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Russia are primarily using it to bypass sanctions and conduct international trades, while some are looking to force them down to use as a retail currency within the country.</p>
<p>When China proposed its CBDC, several economists warned that the Chinese digital yuan is a weapon to destabilize the US Dollar as the world’s reserve currency. It will be interesting to see how CBDCs will coexist with decentralized cryptocurrencies.</p>

After failing to meet the Jan 8 ultimatum of resolving the $900 million withdrawal pause, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> founder hit back at the DCG chief, demanding his immediate removal from the CEO post.</p>
<h2>Winklevoss Asks DCG CEO&#8217;s Removal</h2>
<p>Winklevoss said in a letter dated January 10 that Silbert and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis/">Genesis Global Capital</a>, a subsidiary of DCG, had misled more than 340,000 participants of the Gemini Earn program. The letter came after the co-founder of Gemini made an appeal to Silbert directly via Twitter on January 2. In the appeal, the co-founder stated that Genesis owed the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> millions of dollars and accused the CEO of hiding &#8220;behind lawyers, investment bankers, and process.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Cameron’s Open Letter To Silbert</h2>
<p>Winklevoss claims that Genesis lent more than $2.3 billion to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, a decision that ultimately resulted in a $1.2 billion loss for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> company when the investment firm collapsed in June 2022. He asserted that beginning in July 2022, Silbert, DCG, and Genesis planned a well-organized campaign of deception to make it appear as though DCG had provided the money to Genesis.</p>
<p>In Cameron&#8217;s latest letter, the crypto entrepreneur was quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>[Silbert] has proven himself unfit to run DCG and unwilling and unable to find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. There is no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of DCG</p></blockquote>
<p>Although, <a href="https://coingape.com/barry-silbert-dcg-genesis-geminis-cameron-winklevoss-funds/">Silbert responded to Winklevoss&#8217;s letter</a> dated January 2 via Twitter &#8212; claiming that DCG had delivered a proposal for resolving the dispute to Genesis &amp; Winklevoss&#8217;s advisers on December 29 &#8212; it had not received a response from them. However, Silbert has since remained silent on the charges pressed against him.</p>

With the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> related liquidity crisis in November, the coin&#8217;s price has been on a steady downward trend. Due to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s affiliation with the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> ecosystem, SOL price suffered a major blow. In context of the negative sentiment seen around the cryptocurrency last month, the recovery is quite surprising and unexpected.</p>

<h2>Solana Price Recovery</h2>
<p>While the overall trend is currently bullish for the cryptocurrency, it remains to be seen if there will be another rally in near term. The Bollinger band indicator suggests the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/how-far-may-solana-coin-price-rise-after-escaping-ongoing-consolidation/">possibility of a rapid Solana rally</a> in the short term. This means the recent price recovery could act as a precursor to another quick pump. Also, the moving average convergence or divergence (MACD) points to a growing bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The $18.10 mark was seen as the next resistance level if the SOL price breached the $15 mark. Although the milestone was breached all the way to above $17, it failed to reach $18. As of writing, SOL price stands at $16.23, down 0.54% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/">CoinGape price tracker</a>. At one point, the SOL token had a weekly price jump by a staggering 44%.</p>
<p>The weekly gains were second only to Lido DAO which had a rise by 60% due to <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-price-prediction-more-eth-recovery-ahead-of-shanghai-upgrade/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">Ethereum upgrade anticipation</a>. The 11th ranked cryptocurrency currently has a market cap of around $6 billion, compared to the $13 billion in the first half of November 2022.</p>

<p>In this context, another potential price pump could trigger the SOL token price to the range of $20. This could also act as a catalyst to the psychological recovery from its FTX affiliation.</p>

The tax authorities have decided to conduct a &#8220;special&#8221; inquiry into the exchange&#8217;s business practices. In addition, an individual believed to be the company&#8217;s major shareholder has been subpoenaed for further interrogation.</p>
<h2>Bithumb Under Investigation</h2>
<p>According to the latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230110077500002?section=economy/all&amp;site=major_news04" rel="nofollow">reports</a>, tax authorities visited the offices of Bithumb on January 10 in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, in order to investigate whether or not the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> complies with tax legislation on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> activities. The tax authorities are looking into potential tax avoidance by looking into domestic and international transactions conducted by Bithumb Korea, Bithumb Holdings, and its affiliates. The Seoul Regional Tax Service&#8217;s 4th Bureau of Investigation, a division of NTS, is in charge of the investigation.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134862" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/10193833/Screenshot-2023-01-10-193814.png" alt="" width="1590" height="506" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that Bithumb has been the subject of a tax investigation. In 2018, NTS began an inquiry into the company and subsequently obtained an income tax payment of 80 billion won or $64 million.</p>
<h2>Bithumb&#8217;s Legal Troubles</h2>
<p>Officials from government agencies are also conducting an investigation into the proprietors of the Bithumb empire. The ownership of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange</a> is considered to be extremely complicated, with a large number of stockholders owning stakes in the business. Among them are a number of publicly traded companies that do not have any other connections to the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a> or cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://coingape.com/bithumb-largest-shareholder-exec-dies-by-suicide-report/">reported</a> earlier on CoinGape, towards the end of the previous year, the corpse of the Vice President of one of these companies was discovered outside of his residence. The manner of death was officially ruled a &#8220;suspected suicide&#8221; by the police. According to the reports, the individual had disposed off crucial evidence in advance of a search warrant being executed at the company&#8217;s facilities.</p>

<h2>Binance Has Strict Internal Controls</h2>
<p>During the Hong Kong Web3 Innovators Summit on January 10, Binance&#8217;s co-founder He Yi <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1612712882155945986" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that they didn&#8217;t know about the misappropriation of customer funds by FTX. Binance&#8217;s decision to sell FTT tokens was taken as FTX was spending too much money. However, the seriousness of the problem became clear as things unfolded.</p>
<p>Answering the question of whether internal fund transfers can happen on Binance, she explained that the crypto exchange has a strict internal control policy.</p>
<p>Regardless of level, no employee is allowed to conduct personal short-term cryptocurrency transactions. After buying a cryptocurrency, employees must hold the position for more than 90 days before trading. Therefore, it helps prevents the possibility of market manipulation and insider trading by its employees.</p>
<p>Furthermore, He Yi revealed that Binance is moving ahead with the Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI). The crypto exchange has shortlisted some projects eligible for funding. Moreover, Binance plans to use funds for two large transactions, targeting two trading platforms.</p>
<p>Recently, the crypto exchange welcomed <a href="https://coingape.com/will-terra-classic-lunc-get-support-from-binance-industry-recovery-initiative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra Classic developers</a> to apply for the Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI). Developers wanting to continue to build the Terra Classic chain may receive support from Binance as part of the initiative. Many LUNC developers are planning to apply for Binance’s initiative, confirmed influencers Classy Crypto and DemonMonke777.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Remains Stuck</h2>
<p>After a <a href="https://coingape.com/top-reasons-why-the-crypto-market-is-rising-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market recovery</a> on Monday, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices remain stable above $17,000 and $1,300, respectively. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoins</a> pared gains and fell on Tuesday ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell speech.</p>
<p>While traders await a massive recovery in 2023, FTX contagion to DCG and Genesis is key to look out for in the coming weeks. Moreover, a pivot by the U.S. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve</a> can confirm <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bull market</a> conditions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/10184718/SBF2.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Crypto Startups" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>According to data from a research firm, PitchBook, venture capital investments in crypto startups fell to their lowest since 2020. The collapse of FTX has certainly made private investors think about the wobbly nature of crypto.</p>
<p>Alex Thorn, head of firmwide research at crypto financial services provider Galaxy Digital, said that the collapse of the crypto lending firm <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/celsius-2/">Celsius Network</a> already brought the VCs to a pause. Later, the TerraUSD stablecoin crashed which was followed by the shutting of The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, the hedge fund. The collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> was one of the biggest collapses in the history of the crypto world. This definitely made investors saturated and pull out from the crypto startups. The prices kept falling lower, hence, leaving the investors with no choice rather than to pasture in greener grass.</p>
<h2>The drastic drop in Venture Capital investments (VCs)</h2>
<p>Crypto startups saw a downfall of 75%, in VC investments, from the last quarter of 2021. Only 2.30 billion USD investment in startups was made in the last quarter of 2022.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Investors are trying to see what’s going to happen next and there isn’t a rush to deploy capital,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>said Robert Le, crypto analyst, Pitchbook.</p>

<p>The retreat contrasts with the enthusiasm for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a> at the beginning of 2022. While VC firms like Andreessen Horowitz, Haun Ventures, and Electric Capital raised billions of dollars to support crypto entrepreneurs, FTX raised 400 million USD at a 32 billion USD value in January. According to PitchBook, a record 26.7 billion USD was invested in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> startups last year due to industry enthusiasm, the majority of which came in the first quarter. In comparison to 2021, that figure reflected a modest increase.</p>
<h2>Investors are focusing on due diligence</h2>
<p>Recently the news broke out that the investors of FTX are being probed by the U.S. authorities. They are not accused of any wrongdoing but their due diligence and company policies will be questioned to make sure they didn’t misuse customers&#8217; money. Neither FTX nor its arm firm Alameda research did follow any such diligence or policies.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I don’t know how price-disciplined they were, it will be better for other crypto investors because now you can go back to the correct valuations and the correct due diligence process,”</p></blockquote>
<p>said Robert Le.</p>

This could potentially be due to the upcoming Ethereum Shanghai upgrade which could be rolled out in March 2023. In the last few days, LIDO DAO, the token behind staking protocol Lido, went up by a whopping 60%. The upgrade will allow traders to unstake their ETH assets, which is driving the rise in interest in the token.</p>

<p>Similarly, Rocket Pool (RPL), another Ethereum staking pool, saw huge interest from traders. As of writing, the RPL token is up by $25.69, down 1.21% in the last 24 hours. The <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-developers-update-eip-4895-for-eth-withdrawals/">Shanghai upgrade</a> will enable ETH withdrawals on the Beacon Chain. In this context, there is hope that the lead up to the upgrade will bring more demand for Ethereum (ETH). This comes at the backdrop of ETH price not rising as per expectation when The Merge was completed in September 2022.</p>
<h2>ETH Recovery To Continue?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the ETH price appears to be more on the bullish side currently than it stands chance of further reduction from current range. This is because several indicators point to potential upside to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. On chain data is hinting at ETH currently being in the bottom range. In the recent times, the <a href="https://coingape.com/key-reasons-why-ethereum-eth-price-news-bottom-range/">Ethereum exchange inflow</a> has seen a peak, which is a clear signal of price bottom.</p>
<p>Also, the ETH price is yet to price in the development it saw in the form of The Merge, which was a significant upgrade. Overall, the environment is more likely in favor of a price jump from current level for Ethereum. As of writing, ETH price stands at $1327, up 0.50% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>

<p>An initial game offering is a method of funding used by blockchain game developers. It is a presale of tokens as opposed to an initial coin offering (ICO) because it only focuses on crowdfunding for the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/play-in-the-metaverse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video game</a></strong> industry. Before the public auction, investors are given access to game tokens and in-game items at a reduced cost. Offering game assets for less is done so that money can be raised for the following stage, which could include game development, marketing, etc.</p>
<p>By making an early investment, investors can purchase game assets before the public auction for the lowest price, earning significant (5x–50x) returns and even more in the future. IGO is a brand-new concept for crowdsourcing in the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a></strong> gaming space that has the potential to advance crypto or NFT gaming. The crowdfunding approach aids in giving new game concepts and projects the proper exposure and introduction to <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a></strong> investors. In the past, a lack of funding has forced many excellent ideas to die and go unnoticed.</p>
<h3>Key takeaways</h3>
<blockquote><p>An initial game offering is a strategy employed by blockchain game development teams to raise money for an early-stage game.</p>
<p>IGOs are similar to ICOs in that they are both vehicles for raising capital for new projects.</p>
<p>IGO launchpads are made to introduce new game projects built on various blockchains, including Ethereum, Cardano, and others.</p></blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>How does an IGO work?</b></h3>
<p>An IGO is a way to raise money for brand-new blockchain gaming ventures. IGO members buy-in and get early access to in-game benefits and game assets to support a game&#8217;s early development stage. Additionally, before the game is made available to the general public, these players can receive the tokens designed for it.</p>
<p>Skins, weapons, characters, mystery boxes, and accessories are among the items offered during an IGO. On the blockchain, these assets frequently exist as <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a></strong> (NFTs). To play or access the game, you may need to use some of the IGOs&#8217; resources.</p>

<h2><b>Difference between IGO and ICO</b></h2>
<p>Emerging cryptocurrency companies have the chance to analyze the market before releasing a particular product through an initial coin offering, or ICO. They also give developers the opportunity to raise funds to support and streamline the startup process.</p>
<p>An ICO is an IGO for emerging cryptocurrency organizations, to put it simply. An IGO, when viewed from a different angle, is essentially a platform ICO for video games.</p>
<p>The ways in which an IGO and an ICO operate are different, despite the fact that they share many similarities:</p>
<h3><b>The product</b></h3>
<p>The item that each of these two companies sells may be the most significant distinction. A typical ICO markets a product with very limited usability. An IGO, on the other hand, offers digital goods that are compatible with the ecosystem of video games.</p>
<h3><b>Investment return</b></h3>
<p>Investors in ICOs receive very little to nothing in the way of early returns. Contrarily, the main goal of offering IGOs is to give potential investors early access to gaming assets that they can rely on and expect to generate a sizable return on their investment.</p>
<h3><b>Financing phase</b></h3>
<p>Before receiving funding from an IGO, a specific video game is frequently in its final stages of development. But with an ICO, that&#8217;s not the case. Instead, to gauge the product&#8217;s viability and the general public&#8217;s opinion or interest, crypto organizations frequently release the product early.</p>
<h2><b>Difference between IGO and IDO</b></h2>
<p>Another popular method of raising money in the crypto gaming industry is an Initial DEX offering or IDO. It is used to promote upcoming blockchain projects, much like an IGO. The scope of IGO and IDO differ from one another.</p>
<p>An IDO is any project that is launched on a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decentralized exchange</a></strong> (DEX). With an IGO, however, the investment is specifically targeted at creating a blockchain game.</p>
<p>IDO-announced tokens are immediately listed on the decentralized exchange from which they were launched. The projects also guarantee instant token liquidity. However, it is important to note that an IDO lacks a thorough and effective review process. As a result, it has a higher percentage of subpar and fraudulent projects than an IGO.</p>

<h2><b>What Is Initial Game Offering Launchpad?</b></h2>
<p>The initial game offering (IGO) launchpads serve as a meeting place for investors and new gaming concepts. IGO Launchpad helps a brand-new blockchain game idea develop when it is in its early stages and in need of funding. The fact that anyone can participate in the IGO launchpad because it is open to all investors is one of its biggest advantages. A gaming startup or game developer no longer needs to approach VCs or meet with investors to secure the funding necessary to finish the project.</p>
<p>Listing game tokens or in-game assets with the IGO launchpad can help a gaming startup get funding. Depending on the Launchpad platform, investors can either stake their tokens or lock them in a pool. Prior to the public auction, game assets are offered to investors at the lowest price. By using this technique, the gaming startup can raise money, and investors stand to gain significantly if the game develops after it is released. Before potential investors can take part in crowdfunding, a project must satisfy various requirements established by the launchpad platform. IGO launchpads are made to introduce new game projects built on various blockchains, including Ethereum, <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cardano</a></strong>, and others.</p>
<p><b>Popular Initial Game Offering Launchpad</b></p>
<ul>
<li> Seedify Fund</li>
<li>Game Fi</li>
<li>TrustPad</li>
<li>Game starter</li>
<li>EnjinStarter</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How Does an IGO Launchpad Function?</b></h3>
<p>Gaming startups can use the Initial Game Offering (IGO) launchpad to sell game tokens or in-game items at a discount in order to raise money for their upcoming project. Gaming startups can list their newest gaming project with them on an IGO launchpad. A gaming project won&#8217;t be listed on the IGO launchpad platform until all the prerequisite information and paperwork have been completed.</p>
<p>Before investing, participants or investors can view the upcoming gaming project on the platform and learn all the specifics. Prior to the game&#8217;s release to the general public, participants can purchase in-game items like skins, weapons, mystery boxes, or game tokens at a discounted price.</p>
<p>Investors can make significant gains as soon as the game goes live because the value of these in-game assets rises over time. The fact that some of these in-game items are necessities for players to access or engage in the game is their greatest advantage. Consequently, if the games become well-liked in the future, investors will have a huge earning potential.</p>

<li>Multi-Chain Compatibility</li>
<li>Know Your Customers</li>

<h2><b>Pros and Cons of IGO</b></h2>
<h3><b>Pros of an IGO</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>No need to give up equity</li>
<li>Funding future games</li>
<li>Quick funding</li>
<li>Complete control of your game</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Cons of IGO</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>An all-or-nothing scheme</li>
<li>Quite challenging</li>
<li>Risky</li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Things to Consider Before Purchasing an IGO</b></h2>
<h3><b>The launchpad platform</b></h3>
<p>For an IGO to be successful, the launchpad platform is essential. Along with the sum of money previously raised and the length of time needed for the project to receive funding on the platform, it is important to examine the history and success rate of the platform in launching IGOs.</p>
<h3><b>The team behind the project</b></h3>
<p>It would be helpful to know if the team has prior experience completing projects of this nature and what their success rate has been as this is a crucial consideration. Investors will be more confident in a team that has a proven track record of success.</p>
<h3><b>Community</b></h3>
<p>The majority of well-known crypto projects have a thriving community supporting them. Therefore, if you&#8217;re looking to purchase IGO, look for a community where you can find like-minded individuals who share your perspective on the project. The community might take the shape of a discussion board on a social media site.</p>
<h3><b>Initial investors and partners in the project</b></h3>
<p>You can get a sense of the likelihood of the project&#8217;s success by looking at the original investors and partners. The likelihood of the initial investors succeeding in the current project increases if they have a track record of funding profitable projects in the past.</p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p>Blockchain IGOs show to be an effective way to raise money for projects involving cryptocurrency gaming. Additionally, they might generate enough buzz before a game&#8217;s release to guarantee an audience. A video game in its IGO stage is typically found when it is nearly finished.</p>
<p>This is partially due to dishonest developers in the past who misled investors by using false advertisements and inaccurate descriptions of their investments. The IGO business model consequently frequently encounters a high level of disbelief, despite the fact that developers also frequently release updates and refunds. IGOs are still a practical and well-liked choice for developers looking to launch a project. The IGO market is expanding.

Recent updates from the Shiba Inu Ecosystem have played a major role in this price recovery. However, the latest development from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, the largest crypto exchange can send the SHIB token price to the moon.</p>
<h2>4 trillion Shiba Inu Coin staked?</h2>
<p>WhaleAlert reported that Binance sent 4 trillion Shiba Inu (approx worth $36 million) to an unknown wallet in a single transaction.</p>
<p>As we dig in, Shibburn declared that Binance staked those 4 trillion SHIB tokens using ShibaSwap. This move has directly sent approx $36 million worth of Shiba Inu tokens temporarily out of circulation.</p>
<p>Shibburn further added that there was another transaction of<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/shibburn/status/1612770425687375872" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> un-staking 12.6 trillion Shiba Inu Coin</a> (approx worth $116.2 million) from ShibaSwap by Binance. However, after this transaction, the largest crypto exchange re-staked 4 trillion Shiba Inu Coin.</p>
<p>Earlier, Shiba Archives announced that Binance has become the largest holder of Shiba Inu. Coingape reported that the world’s largest crypto exchange has planned to boost its <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-news-binance-to-add-76m-of-shib-is-shiba-inu-price-pump-near/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHIB holdings</a>. However, this was done in accordance with its deal to take over Voyager Digital&#8217;s assets. Binance added $76 million worth of SHIB tokens with other assets like $255 million worth of Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<h2>SHIB burn rate Drops by 26%</h2>
<p>As per the data, Shiba Inu Burn rate has dropped by 26% over the past 24 hours. Around 27.8 million SHIB have been burned in this period.</p>
<p>On the market side, <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-news-reason-behind-shiba-inu-price-drop-read-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shiba Inu coin price</a> have jumped by 5% in the last 24 hours. SHIB is trading at an average price of $0.000009, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume has surged by 77% to stand at $450 million.</p>

Thus, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> is currently trading at the $1330 mark and trying to break a monthly barrier of $1340. This resistance level is also the neckline of a bullish pattern called ascending triangle, which could accelerate buying pressure in the near term.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA would increase the possibility for a $1340 breakout.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below the rising support trendline will invalidate the bullish thesis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $5.3 Billion, indicating a 76% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/sN8qnvJn.png" alt="Ethereum Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily time frame chart shows the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> has been walking a sideways trend for the past two months. During this consolidation, the $1340 level stood as a crucial resistance that actively restricted any bullish growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, a new support trendline has emerged with the recent improvement in the crypto market and bolsters buyers for reclaiming higher levels. Moreover, this rising support trendline and fixed resistance level reveal the formation of an ascending triangle pattern. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the pattern formation, the higher low swing observed in the chart reflects the increasing bullish momentum in the market. Thus, with this core concept, the ETH price could eventually break the pattern neckline resistance and offer long entry opportunities for interested traders.</span></p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a daily candle closing above the $1340 neckline will give buyers a higher footing to lead the bullish rally. Furthermore, with sustained buying, the bull may drive 13.5% higher to reach the $1500 psychological mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, on January 9th, the daily chart showed a higher price rejection candle at $1340 resistance. This rejection hints the sellers are continuing to defend this barrier, and therefore, the prices may consolidate of few more trading sessions before giving an upswing breakout.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> Contrary to the ETH price, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> witnessed no restriction from above and showcased a steady uptrend. This bullish divergence in indicators gives additional confirmation for upcoming recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> Amid the recent recovery, the ETH price reclaimed the 20-50-and-100-day EMAs providing more support levels for long traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1329</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>

Coinbase slashed 18% of its workforce in June last year and will layoff an additional 950 employees as part of the latest decision. The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> had 4,700 employees at the end of September.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Plans to Layoff 950 Employees</h2>
<p>In a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/a-message-from-ceo-and-co-founder-brian-armstrong-to-coinbase-employees" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> on January 10, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced reducing operating expenses by about 25% quarter-by-quarter. It includes laying off about 950 people. He believes the company needs to reduce operating expenses, which can&#8217;t be done without considering changes to headcount.</p>
<p>Further, Coinbase plans to shut down several projects with a lower probability of success. Other projects will continue to operate as usual, with fewer people on the team. The details on the 2023 scenarios and expense outlook will be shared in a public 8-K filing today and the Q4 earnings call in February.</p>
<p>Those affected received an email to their personal account. Coinbase is offering a comprehensive package to support fired employees. US-based employees will receive a minimum of 14 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and other benefits. Also, the company plans to provide extra transition support for impacted employees on a work visa.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’re also giving everyone access to our Talent Hub to help connect you with your next career opportunity. Coinbase employees are among the most talented in the world, and I’m certain that your skills and experience will stand out, even in a challenging job market.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-coinbase-downgraded-amid-heightened-scrutiny-after-ftx-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase was downgraded</a> by analysts at financial services firm Cowen. Crypto companies face increased scrutiny following the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> and the overall decline in trading volumes in the crypto market.</p>
<p>COIN price fell over 2% in pre-market trading hours, with the current price trading near $37.42. The stock price saw a 15% jump on Monday amid the crypto market recovery.</p>

His plans of listing <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/circle/">Circle</a>, a <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/stablecoin/">stablecoin</a> came to an end due to the extreme crypto market situation of last year.</p>
<p>He also mentions that there will be a lot of good things this year that will help the crypto market survive the crashes of last year. This statement comes after Diamond was unable to list Circle, one of the largest Stablecoin, at a 9 billion USD valuation. The reason was cited as weak investor demand.</p>
<h2>Unrealized crypto plans of Bob Diamond</h2>
<p>Diamond was a well-known traditional financier in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2021, his private equity firm Atlas Merchant made a capital investment in Circle and subsequently created a special-purpose vehicle to buy the business.</p>
<p>The unfulfilled plan put an end to a dismal year for the crypto market, during which prices plummeted and the collapse of well-known companies like FTX revealed how unpredictable and poorly regulated a lot of the market was.</p>

<p>“I don’t think as an industry we’re going to throw the baby out with the bathwater,” in my mind, there is a place for a digital currency, a very important place,” said Bob Diamond, co-founder, and CEO, of Atlas Merchant Capital.</p>
<h2>Shouldn’t be using terms like &#8220;crypto winter&#8221;</h2>
<p>“Crypto is such a broad word,” he added and expressed his frustration about people calling it crypto winter. “It’s all good, it’s all bad. We have to do a better job. There are undoubtedly sectors that have a very strong future, like the technology being developed for stablecoins.”</p>
<p>“The optimist in me hopes this will be a catalyst for more effective and targeted regulation and development of territories. . . like stablecoins and blockchain technology for onshore and permissive applications,” he said while talking on the collapse of FTX and other exchanges in 2022, adding that Circle has long called for such regulation. He believes that the crashes of 2022 will open the eyes of regulators.</p>
<p>“People are starting to understand the difference between US onshore and offshore,” he added saying that this should benefit Circle as it is a company regulated in the U.S.</p>

<p>“I think there will be a chill for a while, whether it is an IPO or a spac, the process would be very difficult. . . at the moment,” he said while talking about how the market conditions are not suitable for upcoming listings.</p>
<h2>Are stablecoins actually stable?</h2>
<p>On being asked about stablecoins, Diamond said “a lot of the debate about stablecoins is, are they actually stable?”</p>
<p>“I think Circle has demonstrated through the management of its reserves that . . . their openness in the disclosure, its strategic partnership with BlackRock to manage the reserves going forward, and consistent repayment . . . that a dollar is a dollar in terms of their portfolio.”</p>
