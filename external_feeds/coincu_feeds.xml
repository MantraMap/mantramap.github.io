<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Shanghai government releases guidelines to promote blockchain, digital yuan, and metaverse adoption in real-world industries.</em></li>



<li><em>The plan includes blockchain-based platforms for commodity trading, e-commerce, and digital transformation in legacy industries.</em></li>



<li><em>Shanghai&#8217;s move aligns with China&#8217;s focus on leveraging blockchain&#8217;s cost-efficiencies and boosts efficiency in managing commodity settlements with the digital yuan.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The government of Shanghai has taken a significant step in embracing blockchain technologies, the digital yuan, and the metaverse, with a recent publication of guidelines <a href="https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/nw12344/20230718/898e51d8fe0b4e4e94306fdbe4cccfac.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aimed</a> at fostering adoption in various industries. The move aligns with China&#8217;s larger goal of integrating blockchain to achieve cost efficiencies in real-world sectors.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346-1024x614.png" alt="Shanghai Unveils Bold Blockchain And Digital Innovation Plans For Industries" class="wp-image-204308" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346-1024x614.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346-300x180.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346-768x461.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346-750x450.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346-1140x684.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1346.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Shanghai Unveils Bold Blockchain And Digital Innovation Plans For Industries 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The comprehensive plan encompasses the development of blockchain-based platforms for commodity production, supply, and trading, as well as e-commerce platforms focused on industrial products. Additionally, the guidelines aim to facilitate the digital transformation of legacy industries by utilizing blockchain technology.</p>



<p>Key use cases outlined in the guidelines include the implementation of blockchain and IoT technologies to manage carbon emissions and the creation of a blockchain-based platform for the automotive industry. Ge Dongbo, Chief Engineer at the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Economy and Informatization, expressed these initiatives in a recent press release.</p>



<p>The Shanghai report titled &#8220;Guidelines on the High-Quality Development of Manufacturing Internet Service Platforms&#8221; categorizes blockchain as a core technology alongside artificial intelligence (AI), big data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and the mobile web. This reflects the city&#8217;s focus on advancing its manufacturing internet service platforms through cutting-edge technologies.</p>



<p>The latest guidelines build on the three-year development plan for local manufacturing industries, which was released on June 15 and already included provisions for blockchain technologies.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Shanghai Clearing House, a prominent counterparty and clearing company in Asia, recently introduced support for operations and settlements using the digital yuan, the Chinese central bank digital currency (CBDC). Customers can now settle bulk commodity payments with the <a href="https://coincu.com/202102-bank-of-china-trials-offline-payment-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital yuan</a>, streamlining the process and increasing efficiency.</p>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/199394-china-central-bank-leader-doubtful-of-bitcoins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China</a>&#8216;s status as the second-largest global commodities importer in 2021, accounting for $2.68 trillion in purchases, further emphasizes the significance of integrating the digital yuan into commodity settlements.</p>



<p>As a leading hub for China&#8217;s blockchain industry, <a href="https://coincu.com/194896-shanghai-govt-now-demands-for-metaverse-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanghai</a> had already established its first blockchain industrial complex back in June 2020. The city is also home to AntChain, the blockchain branch of Ant Group, China&#8217;s renowned financial technology giant. With these initiatives, Shanghai is well-positioned to further drive innovation and adoption of blockchain technologies in various sectors.</p>

<p>Crucially, the foundation has clarified that the grant program will progress in different phases, with each phase having specific goals and objectives. However, unlike traditional grant programs, there is no fixed &#8220;end date&#8221; for these stages. Instead, the program will continue until the Arbitrum Foundation determines that the phase objectives have been adequately met.</p>



<p>Although the first phase&#8217;s duration has not been set in stone, it is anticipated to span approximately three months. During this time, developers and project teams will have the opportunity to submit their proposals and ideas for consideration, outlining how they intend to contribute to the advancement of decentralized applications and the Arbitrum infrastructure.</p>

<p>Arbitrum&#8217;s foundation funding comes as exciting news for the blockchain and Ethereum communities, as it offers an avenue for innovation and financial support to drive the next wave of cutting-edge DApps and blockchain solutions. The initiative also aligns with the broader mission of scaling Ethereum and addressing the challenges posed by network congestion and high gas fees.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Memecoin surprises the community with an airdrop of 17.25 billion MEME tokens, constituting 25% of the total supply.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong><a href="https://www.memecoin.org/#tokenomics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memecoin</a>, a promising player in the cryptocurrency space, has made a significant announcement that has ignited excitement among its community and the broader crypto world.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-1024x1024.png" alt="Memecoin Announced The New Airdrop Of A Total Of 17.25 Billion Tokens" class="wp-image-204283" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-300x300.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-150x150.png 150w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-768x768.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-75x75.png 75w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-350x350.png 350w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339-750x750.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1339.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Memecoin Announced The New Airdrop Of A Total Of 17.25 Billion Tokens 8"></a></figure></div>


<p>The project is set to conduct a massive airdrop of its native MEME tokens, amounting to a staggering 17.25 billion tokens. This airdrop represents a remarkable 25% of the total token supply, making it one of the largest token giveaways in recent times.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AIRDROP: 17,250,000,000<br>• 25% of the total <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MEME&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$MEME</a> supply<br>• Stored with the MVP, Captainz, and Potatoz<br>• [Redacted] % instant unlocked<br>• [Redacted] % to be unlocked</p>&mdash; Memecoin (@memecoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/memecoin/status/1681877522517213184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The airdrop is intended to reward holders of Memeland NFTs, including those from the MVP, Captainz, and Potatoz collections. This move is seen as a strategic step by Memecoin to boost engagement and strengthen its bond with the existing user base while encouraging more participation from the community.</p>



<p>Although the specific distribution plan between unlocked and delayed tokens has not been disclosed yet, the news has sparked a wave of anticipation among Memeland enthusiasts. The launch of the MEME token is projected to take place sometime in July or August of this year, setting the stage for an exciting period of growth and exploration for the project.</p>

<p>Many observers believe that the airdrop, combined with the anticipated token launch, could potentially position MEME as one of the biggest sensations in the crypto space. The project&#8217;s focus on creating an inclusive and vibrant ecosystem resonates with the core principles of Web3, attracting attention from both crypto veterans and newcomers.</p>



<p>Memeland, the NFT ecosystem powered by Memecoin, boasts three distinct collections &#8211; MVP, The Captainz, and The Potatoz. These collections creatively leverage the culture of memes, combining it with the revolutionary power of non-fungible tokens. The project&#8217;s core mission revolves around building and investing in social products that facilitate seamless connections between creators and communities.</p>

<p>While Memeland&#8217;s current features are predominantly accessible to NFT holders, the development team envisions expanding the platform into a comprehensive and inclusive Web3 space. The long-term goal is to create a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that empowers community members to actively participate in governance and decision-making processes.</p>



<p>Behind the <a href="https://coincu.com/182710-memeland-fight-other-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memeland</a> project stands 9GAG, a well-known name in internet meme culture with an extensive following across various social media platforms. 9GAG&#8217;s backing adds credibility to Memeland&#8217;s vision and mission, drawing attention from millions of netizens who have been captivated by the platform&#8217;s silly and entertaining content for over a decade.</p>



<p>Memecoin&#8217;s airdrop announcement is not only a celebration of the project&#8217;s growth but also a testament to the rising popularity of NFTs and their potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital assets. As the Memecoin community eagerly awaits the airdrop event and the upcoming launch of the MEME token, the project&#8217;s potential impact on the broader crypto landscape remains a topic of enthusiastic discussion and speculation.</p>

<p>According to a report from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jailed-crypto-tycoon-do-kwons-company-appoints-new-ceo-d58fa058?mod=livecoverage_web" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jailed-crypto-tycoon-do-kwons-company-appoints-new-ceo-d58fa058?mod=livecoverage_web" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> on July 20th, the company has appointed a new CEO, Chris Amani, who has been with Terraform Labs since 2021, initially serving as COO and later CFO. With this new leadership, the company aims to revitalize the Terra project, which experienced major issues in May 2022 when its stablecoin, TerraUSD, collapsed.</p>



<p>Despite the collapse, Terraform continues to operate in Singapore and Amani has expressed optimism regarding the company&#8217;s future prospects. In fact, he believes that Terraform Labs could salvage the Terra project, although he acknowledges that it will take time and effort to achieve the desired outcome. Amani stated that Terraform Labs plans to create applications that &#8220;provide real utility,&#8221; and has promised to provide further details on these plans in the near future.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Terraform-Labs-Welcomes-Chris-Amani-As-New-CEO-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="768" height="432" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Terraform-Labs-Welcomes-Chris-Amani-As-New-CEO-1.jpeg" alt="Terraform Labs Welcomes Chris Amani As New CEO 1" class="wp-image-204277" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Terraform-Labs-Welcomes-Chris-Amani-As-New-CEO-1.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Terraform-Labs-Welcomes-Chris-Amani-As-New-CEO-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Terraform-Labs-Welcomes-Chris-Amani-As-New-CEO-1-750x422.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" title="Terraform Labs Welcomes Chris Amani As New CEO 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Terraform Labs has about 40 employees, all of whom are working towards the company&#8217;s goals under Amani&#8217;s leadership. Interestingly, the company reportedly has no plans to launch a new stablecoin to replace the failed TerraUSD stablecoin. Instead, it will focus on other aspects of the Terra project to help it recover.</p>



<p>Terraform Labs&#8217; pending recovery plan will differ from or build upon the Terra 2.0 blockchain and Luna Classic (LUNC) token, which are already in operation. However, Amani is confident that the company will find a way to move forward and achieve success.</p>



<p>One major challenge for Terraform Labs is the ongoing legal issues surrounding its former CEO and co-founder, Do Kwon. Kwon faces charges of violations of capital-markets law in South Korea and criminal charges of fraud in the U.S., as well as a separate civil fraud suit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). All of those allegations are directly related to the collapse of his $40 billion crypto project. Kwon has resigned as CEO but retains a controlling share of 92% of the company’s stocks. Amani did not comment on how broader issues are affecting the company, but stated that Terraform Labs will continue to operate without Kwon&#8217;s leadership.</p>

<p>Only 15 of the 40 or so individuals currently employed by Terraform Labs were members of the company prior to its May 2022 crisis. Despite this, the company remains committed to its vision and is working hard to overcome the challenges it faces.</p>

<p>The report revealed a concerning decrease in network revenue, burned ETH value, daily active addresses, and a surprising change in the inflation rate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="304" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332-1024x304.png" alt="Ethereum Q2 Revenue Plunges 33.3%, Addresses Drop 6%" class="wp-image-204254" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332-1024x304.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332-300x89.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332-768x228.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332-750x222.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332-1140x338.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1332.png 1288w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bankless Report: Ethereum Q2 Revenue Plunges 33.3%, Addresses Drop 6% 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the report, Ethereum&#8217;s network revenue fell by a significant 33.3%, dropping from a substantial US$1.27 billion in the previous quarter to US$847 million. This decline in revenue may raise questions about the platform&#8217;s underlying economic activity and could be indicative of a slowdown in transactional volume during the given period.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="440" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333-1024x440.png" alt="Ethereum Q2 Revenue Plunges 33.3%, Addresses Drop 6%" class="wp-image-204255" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333-1024x440.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333-300x129.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333-768x330.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333-750x322.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1333.png 1076w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Bankless Report: Ethereum Q2 Revenue Plunges 33.3%, Addresses Drop 6% 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Furthermore, the dollar value of burned ETH also experienced a sharp decline, plummeting 35% from $1.09 billion to $713 million. The burning of Ethereum tokens is often viewed as a measure to control inflation and maintain the scarcity of the digital asset. Such a significant decrease in the value of burned ETH may warrant further investigation into the factors influencing this development.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1334.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="624" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1334.png" alt="Ethereum Q2 Revenue Plunges 33.3%, Addresses Drop 6%" class="wp-image-204257" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1334.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1334-300x187.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1334-768x479.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1334-750x468.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="Bankless Report: Ethereum Q2 Revenue Plunges 33.3%, Addresses Drop 6% 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The report also revealed a 6% decrease in average daily active addresses, declining from 471,447 in the previous quarter to 444,419. The number of active addresses is considered a key indicator of network usage and adoption. This drop may signal reduced user engagement or potential challenges in onboarding new users during the stated period.</p>

<p>Additionally, the most surprising and noteworthy figure in the report was the change in the ETH inflation rate. The inflation rate decreased by an average of 213%, shifting from 0.71% to a remarkable -0.8%. This deflationary turn could have significant implications for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value and its economic model.</p>

<p>Polygon 2.0 seeks to revolutionize the network, bringing <a href="https://coincu.com/201181-ethereum-in-q2-2023-340588-daily-active-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> to Internet scale and opening up new possibilities for the world of decentralized finance and blockchain applications.</p>



<p>The commemorative NFT, available in an open edition, is a token of appreciation to the community, recognizing their support and contribution to the platform&#8217;s growth and success. The NFT embodies the spirit of innovation and progress that defines the journey and reflects the exciting future that lies ahead with the implementation of Polygon 2.0.</p>



<p>To access this exclusive NFT, users need to download the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/suku-wallet/fopmedgnkfpebgllppeddmmochcookhc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suku Wallet</a> and log in using their Twitter account. Once logged in, the NFT will be showcased in the &#8220;Collectibles&#8221; tab, allowing users to marvel at the unique digital artwork that captures the essence of Polygon&#8217;s evolution.</p>



<p>For added convenience, users can also <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/suku-polygon2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">view</a> the NFT directly on OpenSea by connecting their Suku Wallet. The minting of the NFT will be available for a limited period of 48 hours, offering users ample time to claim their piece of history on the blockchain.</p>

<p>However, given the immense excitement surrounding the NFT drop, Twitter may rate limit the Suku account confirmation responses, leading to potential delays in receiving responses to tweets. But users need not worry, as even if they don&#8217;t receive an immediate response, their NFTs have still been successfully minted and secured in their Suku Social Wallet.</p>



<p>Polygon&#8217;s journey has been characterized by significant growth and development since its inception. The platform has garnered widespread recognition and formed valuable partnerships with renowned companies, solidifying its position as a leading layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum.</p>



<p>With the forthcoming release of Polygon 2.0, the platform is set to take another leap forward in reimagining various elements of the network.
