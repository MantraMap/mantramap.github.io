Despite the ongoing downtrend in the crypto market, this below-mentioned coin has shown some favorable technical setups that may provide significant growth in 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apecoin(Apecoin)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NTGfEJQF.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a resistance trendline, the Apecoin price has been falling for the past seven months, creating an established downtrend. The prices have reversed from this resistance trendline multiple times, indicating the sellers are aggressively selling at rallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-this-range-breakout-may-clear-uncertainty-in-crypto-market/">uncertainty in the crypto market</a>, the Apecoin wavering below a local resistance of $3.76. The coin price has been walking a sideways path for the past two weeks, indicating uncertainty in the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, this meta coin trades at $3.69 with an intraday gain of 1.65%. However, this rising price may retest the combined resistance of the resistance trendline of $3.76. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, a potential bullish breakout from this trendline will ignite a fresh recovery whose ideal target may reach $9.16.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sandbox(SAND)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1Hj5h5c4.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sandbox coin is currently following a steady downfall in response to a falling parallel channel. Despite the recent volatile phase in the crypto market, the price action has respected this pattern for nearly six months and should provide its potential target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, amid the sideways movement in the majority of major coins, the sandbox coin seems weaker than the rest of the market, maintaining a constant downfall. Thus, if the selling pressure persists, this altcoin may retest the support trendline again to replenish the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a potential bullish breakout from the pattern resistance trendline will encourage buyers to wrest trend control and extend a bullish rally to $1.5 in idea condition.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decentraland coin(MANA) </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/x/XQGV6P0P.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing downtrend in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentraland/">Decentraland</a> coin(MANA) price reached a new support zone of $0.295-0.29. This coin price currently trades for $0.3 with an intraday gain of 1.14%. However, the daily candle shows lower-price rejection at this $0.295 level indicating the prices are trying to sustain above the bottom support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the strength of recent price action, shows an upward movement. This bullish divergence indicates a high possibility of price reversal. Thus, with sustained buying, the $0.358 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, this bullish reversal may bolster the formation of a double-bottom pattern, which encourages a bullish rally continuation to $0.425.</span></p>

This pattern displays itself when the prices are constantly wobbling between two downsloping trendlines. However, in theory, this pattern is known for providing a significant bull run once the price breaks its resistance trendline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.00015 support breakdown sets the LUNC price for a potential 20% drop.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downsloping EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) moving above the coin price create multiple resistance against a potential price rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $95.8 Million, indicating a 9.83% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/sS4Gt4E4.png" alt="Terra Classic Coin " width="1813" height="818" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 27th, the LUNC price faced its latest rejection from the overhead trendline. The bearish reversal triggers a new bear cycle within the wedge pattern and has tumbled the price by 20.5% in the last five days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This downfall has also pierced local support of $0.00015 and currently trades at $0.00014. Amid the ongoing <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-this-range-breakout-may-clear-uncertainty-in-crypto-market/">uncertainty in the crypto market</a>, the LUNC is wavering just below the breached support and trying to check sustainability below it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The higher price rejection attached to the daily candle retesting the $0.00015 mark as potential resistance indicates the sellers are defending this new barrier. If the selling pressure persists, the Terra coin price will continue a downward spiral of 22% down to retest the combined support of the trendline and $0.0001168.</span></p>
<p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-passes-crucial-proposal-is-lunc-price-0-0005-next/">Terra Classic Community Passes Crucial Proposal, Is LUNC Price $0.0005 Next?</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, under the influence of the wedge pattern, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/terra-classic-price-prediction-will-luncs-ongoing-recovery-reach-a-high-of-0-0002/">Terra classic coin</a> price should eventually break the overhead trendline and trigger a fresh recovery cycle. The trendline breakout will offer an entry opportunity that, in ideal conditions, may lead to a price rally to the $0.0003745 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> concerning the LUNC coin’s recent price action, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> shows significant growth indicating the buying is rising at lower levels. Thus, this growth in the RSI indicator increases the possibility of upcoming recovery in LUNC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> Along with $0.00015 support, the altcoin also breached the 20-day EMA support offering additional confirmation for potential downfall before the next bull cycle start.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terra Classic Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.000147</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level-  $0.00015 and $0.0002</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.000116 and $0.000086</span></li>

This pattern occurs when buyers are unable to push the price higher after reaching a certain level of support, known as the neckline, leading to a downward trend. However, a bullish indication hints at a bounce back in 2023.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A head and shoulder pattern govers the XRP price action</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $0.4 will undermine this bearish pattern</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP price is $372.1 million, indicating a 50% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133759" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/31223106/B3wrchEI.png" alt="Xrp " width="1946" height="1105" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the recent bullish recovery reaching the heights of the 50-day EMA, the XRP market price takes a bearish turn to create a bearish pattern coming in the long term. In the month of December, the market value of the refill token has plunged by 16.5% and trades slightly below the mark of $0.35. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coming back to the long term pattern, the price trend shows a head and shoulder pattern forming in the daily chart with the neckline at $0.31-0.3. The neckline gets credibility by acting as a strong support level during the consolidation phase between June and October. </span></p>
<p>Also read &#8211; <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-xrp-holders-are-biggest-loser-in-ripple-lawsuit/amp/">XRP Lawsuit: XRP Holders Are Biggest Loser In Ripple Case? Attorney Suggests This</a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing the falling trend under the bearish aligned EMAs, the market value may soon succumb below the neckline highlighting a bearish entry point. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such a case, XRP investors can witness further decline in market price, potentially a drop of 37% to the next support level at $0.18.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the new year brings new investors for ripple, a reversal above the neckline crossing the $0.40 mark will break the bearish hypothesis.  </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, to support the bullish reversal a double bottom pattern is evident within the right shoulder of the bearish pattern. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering, the bulls get momentum in 2023, a double bottom breakout can revive the XRP buying spree. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA</strong>: undermining the recovery in November and December, the crucial daily EMAs- 20, 50, 100, 200 maintain a negative trend displaying a long term bearish phase in action. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength indicator</strong>: the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index">RSI</a> slope shows a short-term decline from the midline but the bullish divergence in the double bottom pattern keeps the hope burning for XRP buyers. </span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></p>
<ul style="font-weight: 400;">
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.344</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.373 and $0.41</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.31 and 0.26</span></li>

<h2>Will Bitcoin (BTC) Price Dump?</h2>
<p>According to a crypto trading analyst, who goes by the pseudonym Rekt Capital on Twitter, noted that a Bearish Engulfing (BE) candlestick was getting formed on Bitcoin&#8217;s yearly chart.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="Ripple’s XRP Price In Danger Zone, Will It Go Up Or Crash Down Harder?" href="https://coingape.com/ripple-xrp-price-danger-zone-crash-down-harder/" rel="bookmark">Ripple’s XRP Price In Danger Zone, Will It Go Up Or Crash Down Harder?</a></em></p>

<h2>Crypto Faces Another Sell Pressure?</h2>
<p>In another major development, extensive research into <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchange’s</a> netflow and historical indicators, show a number of prominent hypotheses. According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63aef3902fce6a57fced77c2-Exchanges-Netflow-After-a-local-top-we-will-face-increased-sales-pressure" rel="nofollow">data</a>, the netflow will eventually become positive once it advances closer and closer to zero.</p>
<p>This results in a lower number of buyers and a greater number of sellers. It is likely that at the same time that it turns positive, a local peak will be observed, followed by an increase in the amount of selling pressure on the future market. This can lead to a continuation of the downward trend and the loss of support that is currently in place.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $16,592 This represents an increase of 0.39% on the day, in contrast to a decline of 1.54% during the week as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

From the high of $1.6, this downfall tumbled the prices 66% down to currently trade at the $0.53 mark. However, the daily technical chart reveals this downtrend as the formation of a <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi34YWfqaT8AhWMA7cAHQ1nD4cQFnoECBcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw28PkFY8dUADJjZ1QkCJj4o">falling channel pattern</a>. This  pattern is identified as when the price action is falling within two parallel walking trendlines displaying an established downtrend. Though this technical setup seems to carry a strong downfall in theory it provides an excellent buying opportunity upon the breakout of its resistance trendline?</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The parallel channel pattern govern the ongoing downtrend in Curve dao coin</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish RSI divergence hint upcoming bullish reversal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the CRV token is $30.6 Million, indicating a 1</span></span><br />
<hr />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-133757" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/31221531/DlGNjJjl.png" alt="Crv" width="1946" height="1105" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://coingape.com/crv-short-squeeze-heres-why-curve-dao-token-price-shooting-up/amp/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEq9vMqKT8AhWnS2wGHYJRCvUQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw1ZO4o5inZHTXMnlJ8CQUND">CRV price</a> has reversed from both the trendline barriers several times indicating the traders are respecting the channel pattern, and should do the same for it&#8217;s potential target. Amid the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the Curve Dao coin price is hovering above the local support of $0.5 for past two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buyers manage to sustain above the $0.5 support, the price may rise 30% to challenge  the pattern&#8217;s overhead trendline. Furthermore, a potential bullish breakout from the overhead trendline will signal the start of a fresh recovery rally. This breakout may bolster buyers to drive the prices 88% up to hit $1</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in ideal condition, this Curve dao coin should reach the higher peak of this pattern which is $1.5.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing below the $0.5 support will tumble the coin by 20% and prolong the downtrend for a few more trading Sessions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: despite a sideways movement in Curve dao coin, the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8tv_7qKT8AhXL9XMBHZ6NCYoQFnoECA4QAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mPht-xlJuzYpPE12vTyno">daily-RSI slope</a> rising indicates the rising buying pressure. This bullish divergence increases the possibility of price recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the downsloping crucial EMAs(20, 50, and 100) seems to provide excellent dynamic resistance to falling CRV price. Each of these EMA slopes will act as a significant resistance indicating the potential rally.</span></p>
<h2><b>Curve Dao Coin Intraday Level</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.6</span></li>

However, both these coin shows a range formation in the daily chart, which offers a technical setup for the directional rally. Here’s how this setup may influence Bitcoin and Ethereum’s future price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133747" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/31175628/Screenshot_20221231_175548.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, the Trust Wallet Token and <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-coin-losing-streak-stalls-at-9-5-ssupport-will-price-recover-again/">Solana</a> show the highest gains in the 24 hours. Thus, the TWT price rose 8.05% to hit the $1.42 mark, while the SOL price increased 7.95% to reach $9.87. Conversely, Hedera and GateToken Tokens are top losers, with HBAR price at 2.91%, down $0.03735, while GT price shows a 2.83% loss to hit $3.03.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-133748" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/31175845/Screenshot_20221231_175448.png" alt="btc" width="1200" height="355" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For over two weeks, the Bitcoin price has resonated between definite levels of $16950 and $16285. Within this range, the prices retested the mentioned levels several times, indicating the market participants are trapped in uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 30th, the Bitcoin price showed a long lower price rejection candle at the $16285 mark suggesting the buying pressure persists and the consolidation phase would continue for a few more sessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Bitcoin price traders at $16563 with an intraday loss of 0.24% </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/m/mSQWNrVr.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, for Bitcoin price to escape the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-heres-how-they-could-escape-stagnant-market-condition/">stagnant market condition</a>, it needs to break out from this narrow range. A bullish breakout from $16950 will replenish the recovery phase and may encourage BTC to reach $17300, followed by $18300.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below $16285 will drop the prices back to $15600.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Bitcoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-whales-sold-close-to-1-million-eth-in-december-2022-more-fall-coming/">Ethereum price</a> is following its own consolidation phase, stretched from the $1230 and $1160 mark. This altcoin also shows price rejection on both ends of the several candles, accentuating the ongoing uncertainty in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, the Ethereum price trades at the $1198 mark with an intraday loss of 0.12%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With ongoing negativity in the crypto market and the downsloping EMA resistances(20, 50, 100, and 200), the ETH price is likely to breach the range support of $1160. This breakdown will tumble the prices of $1100-$10808 support.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a bullish breakout from the $1230 resistance will increase prices to $1350.</span></p>

Losing this crucial support, the selling pressure will intensify, and prices are poised for further downfall. However, here are three reasons why entering this discount opportunity can boost your portfolio in 2023. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Descending Trendline Provides Entry Opportunity </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/shiba-inu-dogecoin-price-prediction-heres-how-you-may-trade-in-stagnant-market-condition/">Dogecoin price</a> initiated a new correction phase when it turned down from the $0.15 resistance. The two months downfall breached multiple support but strictly followed a descending resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin price has retested this dynamic resistance multiple times, indicating the sellers are using this to maintain ongoing downfall. On a contrary note, a bullish breakout from this resistance will signal the selling on rallies is shifting to buying on dips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ideal bullish conditions, the Dogecoin price could rise 115% higher to hit the $0.15 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">$0.56 Stands As A High Accumulation Zone</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From June to October 2022, the Dogecoin price retested the $0.056 numerous times. The multiple lower price rejection candle at this support indicated the buyers are aggressively defending and also initiated the October end rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, under the influence of the aforementioned resistance, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> may prolong the ongoing downfall and revisit the $0.056 support. If the buyers manage to sustain above this support, the coin price will likely trigger another recovery rally.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rising RSI Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strenght index(RSI)</a> determines the strength of the ongoing trend by calculating the speed and magnitude of current price action. Thus, considering the coin price is revisiting, the weekly RSI chart shows evident growth, indicating buying pressure is growing at this support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a positive divergence between price action and indicator bolsters a higher possibility of price reversal. </span></p>
<p><b>Current Price Action</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 28th, the DOGE price has a bearish breakdown from a monthly support zone of $0.073-$0.071. This breakdown intensifies the prevailing selling pressure and may prolong the existing downtrend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained selling, the coin price may plunge 20% down to hit the $0.056 mark.</span></p>

However, SBF has previously claimed to have only $100,000 remaining in his bank account.</p>
<h2>SBF&#8217;s Crypto Wallets Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/#:~:text=A%20blockchain%20is%20a%20distributed,functions%20to%20become%20a%20chain.">blockchain</a> analysts have been tracking the movement of funds that appear to be tied to digital wallets associated with the former chief executive of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> exchange and his defunct hedge fund <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research.</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="FTX Founder SBF Single Handedly Funded $760,000 To This Political Organization" href="https://coingape.com/ftx-sbf-sam-bankman-fried-funded-political-organization/" rel="bookmark">FTX Founder SBF Single-Handedly Funded $760,000 To This Political Organization</a></em></p>
<p>Bankman-Fried denied the charges and stated that he was not the one conducting these transactions in a tweet that he sent out on Friday.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">None of these are me.  I&#39;m not and couldn&#39;t be moving any of those funds; I don&#39;t have access to them anymore.<a href="https://t.co/5Gkin30Ny5">https://t.co/5Gkin30Ny5</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency community, on the other hand, continues to hold the belief that SBF is fabricating facts. They also suspect that the FTX founder cashed out over $684,000 to a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> in Seychelles while being under house arrest in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a>.</p>

<h2>The FTX Saga</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, criminal charges were brought against Bankman-Fried for his role in the failure of FTX. Now, prosecutors from the Southern District of New York are attempting to determine the mysterious transactions which recently took place; and whether or not Bankman-Fried is just redistributing his own <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">assets</a> or cashing them out without consent if he is the one behind these transactions.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried, also known by his initials SBF, was granted bail of $250 million and released a week ago. The FTX founder is restricted from making financial transactions worth more than $1,000 without first receiving approval from the authorities or a judge, with the exception of paying for fees or legal costs. Whether he has disregarded those conditions is uncertain at this time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as reported on CoinGape recently, <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-to-plead-not-guilty-next-week-report/">SBF has agreed to plead not guilty</a> to the criminal allegations at a Manhattan federal court on January 3, 2023, before the U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan.</p>

The crypto market witnessed sluggish price action due to limited trading activity during the holiday season. Traders expect the second-largest cryptocurrency, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/Ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> to also end the year above $1,200.</p>
<p>In the weekly timeframe, the Bitcoin price action has been in a downward trend since the ATH in November 2021. The BTC price failed to capitalize on the descending channel breakout in October 2022 due to the collapse of the crypto exchange <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter  wp-image-133737" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/31162114/BTCUSDT_2022-12-31_16-21-04.png" alt="Bitcoin Price" width="720" height="438" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin price is currently trading at $16,553, trading sideways after recovering from a fall below the crucial support level on Friday. The 24-hour low and high are $16,408 and $16,610, respectively. Thus, the price has recovered just 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSI</a> is at 33. Therefore, the Bitcoin price shows weakness and should continue to move sideways in the next few weeks. The Exponential Moving Average also shows a bearish price trend in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Bollinger Bands indicates the formation of narrow bands in the weekly timeframe. Thus, traders may keep away from trading due to decreased volatility. The end of the Squeeze may likely see Bitcoin price moving higher.</p>
<p>According to UTXO distribution on-chain data, the 1-3 months retail investors (green) maintain a positive sentiment, but longer timeframes like 3-5 years holders (pink) clearly show de-risking. Moreover, the short-term traders 3M-6M (orange) are still reeling from heavy losses. However, the institutional level 2Y-3Y (deep blue) shows signs of accumulation.</p>

<p>According to Arcane Research <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/4rilomtvvae4/5DgOdTmxer4KBlLsOTXapd/b19f517260fa1f0d25c87b79fd88944c/2022_Year_in_Review_-_Arcane_Research.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, the crypto market to calm down in 2023, with declining volumes and falling volatility. This will be a year to accumulate and build exposure in Bitcoin, while keeping an eye on upcoming crypto regulations.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price will mostly trade in a flat range, but close 2023 at a higher price. The correlation between Bitcoin and equities will decrease due to less trading activity in crypto.</p>

However, XRP holders’ have tried to hold the fort in a hope that the outcome of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the XRP lawsuit</a> will land in the favor of Ripple. However, an attorney linked to the case has stated that XRP holders are the biggest loser here.</p>
<h2>SEC contradicting its stance in XRP lawsuit?</h2>
<p>US SEC, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a>, Ripple, and Defendants have submitted their briefs and opposition to brief in order to attain a <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-verdict-or-settlement-xrp-lawyer-to-drop-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summary judgment in the XRP lawsuit</a>. However, the commission again brought up Hinman’s speech docs and related emails in the latest submission despite facing backlash from the court.</p>
<p>John Deaton, Amicus Curiae in the Ripple Lawsuit stated that XRP holders have been the biggest losers in the XRP lawsuit. It had happened despite the regulator’s mandate to protect customers. In his writ of mandamus, he mentioned that the SEC’s take on XRP constitutes a security that is unprecedented in over 70 years of Securities law.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1608887502949208067" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">He added</a> that this stance contradicts previous guidance by authorities like the Howey test. XRP lawyer claimed that anything can be packaged as a security by an investment contract. Meanwhile, this cannot make the underlying asset alone a security.</p>
<h2>Ripple case to end in a settlement?</h2>
<p>Coingape reported that the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-to-end-in-settlement-whales-move-618-million-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawyer launched a Twitter Poll</a> asking users whether they believe that the summary judgment would suggest a settlement or goes to verdict. However, almost 60% of the voters believe that there will be a settlement in the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP prices</a> have registered a drop of almost 60% on the year to date (YTD) basis. While the biggest digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have shed 66% and 69% respectively. However, Ripple’s native crypto has turned out to be the<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-to-end-in-settlement-whales-move-618-million-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> top choice among the crypto whales</a> over the past few weeks.</p>

<p>One of the participants stated that Bankman-Fried would probably show up in person in New York on January 3 to enter his plea. Earlier this month, the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office for the Southern District of New York accused the former billionaire of engaging in illegal behaviour. This caused the collapse of the crypto exchange and claimed he was in command of one of the largest financial frauds in American history.</p>
<p>SBF’s associate, Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda research, FTX&#8217;s sister company, and Gary Wang, former CTO of FTX have accepted their faults. Thus, SBF’s not pleading guilty is contrasting to this. However, this move was widely expected as before his arrest he blamed faulty records and bank accounts for the illegal transfer of funds to Alameda Research.</p>

<p>After making an appearance in a New York federal court following his extradition from the Bahamas, SBF was released on a 250 million USD bond and given permission to remain in his parents&#8217; Palo Alto, California residence.</p>
<h2>How FTX shook the cryptosphere?</h2>
<p>The developing crypto industry has been shaken by the failure of FTX and its sister firm Alameda. Authorities claim that SBF used money from FTX’s customers to cover the costs and debts of his trading company Alameda Research. Both businesses declared bankruptcy in November. Individual traders who trusted FTX with their cryptocurrency are probably going to have to wait for bankruptcy proceedings before they can get any of their money back.</p>
<h2>Allegations against SBF</h2>
<p>Prosecutors are arguing that SBF made illegal transactions right from the year 2019, along with other associates. He has been lying to investors and customers about Alameda’s financial situation. He has also made huge donations to the democratic party in the U.S. which is considered illegal.</p>

<p>In recent years, he and his associates gave more than 70 million USD to political campaigns. Prior to the 2022 midterm elections, he personally donated 40 million USD, as per a report by Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">The SEC</a> and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission have also made accusations against SBF. In total, SBF is facing 8 different charges and if proven guilty can land up to 100 years imprisonment.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">Hackers can steal cryptocurrency by stealing or guessing your password, hacking an exchange platform, luring information from you in phishing attempts, and many other methods.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The most common attack, however, is the theft of a crypto wallet&#8217;s private keys. Getting a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallet</a> entails receiving a<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/private-key/"> private key</a>, which you must keep safe.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">While it is unlikely that you can be completely secure against all possible attacks, there are many things you can do to secure cryptocurrency and reduce your risk level.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">How to Secure Your Crypto Wallet?</h3>
<h3 style="color: #252525">1. Choose your crypto wallet carefully</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Online wallets, also known as &#8220;hot wallets,&#8221; are easy to use and don&#8217;t require expensive investments to buy dedicated hardware devices, but they are vulnerable to online hacks or theft.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">If you have or are planning to buy a significant amount of cryptocurrency, then storing those assets in a hardware wallet promises much more safety and security than online wallets.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">2. Always use two-factor authentication (2FA)</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Not using 2FA for your crypto wallets is just too risky. By requiring verification before engaging in account operations such as signing in, withdrawing, or sending payments, you essentially put an extra layer of security on your funds.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">When you enable 2FA, you will quickly see if someone is attempting to access your wallet.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">3. Change your passwords on a regular basis, or use a password manager</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Given the flood of hacking cases, you can expect your credentials to be hacked at some point. Creating a difficult password, keeping it safe, and changing it periodically are the least you can do.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">When choosing a password for your crypto wallet, avoid using any passwords that you have previously used. Passwords should be stored in a password manager rather than in your browser (much safer). If you can write it down rather than using any software, that would also be great. Finally, change your password every six months or so.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">4. Keep your seed phrase in a safe place</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">A seed phrase, also known as a recovery phrase, is a set of words that functions as a master password, allowing you to recover your crypto assets even if you forget your password, or lose your phone or hardware device.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Unfortunately, there is no &#8220;forgot password&#8221; option. As a result, if you misplace your seed phrase, you will, without exception, lose access to your wallet. Keep the seed phrase offline and safe. Simply, write it on a piece of paper and keep it in the same place where you store your important documents.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">5. Regularly backup your wallet</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">What if you misplace or break your device? Your digital assets may be gone forever if you haven&#8217;t backed up your wallet.<br style="color: #252525" />Backing up your wallet entails generating a digital key that allows you to access your wallet in the event that your device is lost or damaged. This digital key is stored outside of your device. For easy account recovery, use several backup devices.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">6. Use the multi-signature feature</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">As the name implies, multi-signature wallets require transaction authorization via multiple keys, which means that a group of users must sign to approve a transaction. Some cryptocurrency wallet providers enable this feature, which prevents unauthorised users from accessing the wallet without the necessary digital signatures.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Without such permission, hackers will be unable to access your wallet and steal your crypto assets. If you haven&#8217;t already, check to see if your wallet has this option available.</p>

<h3 style="color: #252525">7. The private key must be kept confidential</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Consider your private key to be the equivalent of your bank PIN. You must keep this secure since it is the key to your hard-earned money.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Keeping your private keys offline is one way to protect your wallet and your assets. You can either use cold storage devices or write them down on paper and keep them in a secure place.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525">8. Be cautious of phishing</h3>
<p style="color: #252525">Phishing is a type of targeted attack in which an attacker poses as a legitimate entity in order to obtain your sensitive information, and you&#8217;d be surprised how many people fall for it. To avoid phishing, never log in to your cryptocurrency exchange unless you are confident that you are on the right site.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Bookmark the link or type in the URL rather than clicking on a link sent to you. Furthermore, do not respond to texts, emails, or chats that request personal information. Finally, always double-check the details before sending any payments.</p>

The foundation has formed a new community Dogecoin Core development fund to increase Dogecoin development activity and benefit the overall Dogecoin ecosystem. The Dogecoin community reacted positively and saw the DOGE price rally over 2% in just an hour.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Core Development Fund</h2>
<p>In an <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2022-12-31-corefund/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official announcement</a> on December 31, the Dogecoin Foundation revealed the establishment of a new community Dogecoin Core development fund. The Dogecoin Foundation initially moved 5,000,000 DOGE to the development fund.</p>
<p>The development is managed by existing core developers and Dogecoin Foundation board director signatories. The team will ensure that 5 million DOGE will be allocated to Dogecoin Core. The development of the Core is critical and to the benefit of the Dogecoin ecosystem. In an effort to maintain transparency, the team will publish blog posts on all expenditures and developments.</p>
<p>The new multi-signature wallet will be operated by Dogecoin Core developers and members of the Dogecoin Foundation. The DOGE held in the wallet will be disbursed efficiently to developers of Dogecoin Core. This requires three out of five signatures from custodians.</p>
<p>The custodians include Chromatic (Dogecoin Core developer), Marshall Hayner (Dogecoin Foundation Board), Michi Lumin (Dogecoin Core developer, Dogecoin Foundation Board), Patrick Lodder (Dogecoin Core developer), and Ross Nicoll (Former Dogecoin Core developer). The custodians don&#8217;t have any rights to the money held in the wallet.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/9xEP9voiNLw7Y7DS87M8QRqKM43r6r5KM5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">wallet address</a> currently holds 4,999,999.90 DOGE tokens worth nearly $342K, as per BitInfoCharts.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Dogecoin Foundation has added Marshall Hayner to the board of directors for his contribution to Dogecoin development.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;His consistent commitment to the Dogecoin community and the development of Dogecoin has inspired many. Marshall brings executive and technical leadership experience to the Dogecoin Foundation and has been instrumental in creating this Core development fund.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2>DOGE Price Jumps</h2>
<p>Dogecoin price has relatively moved higher in recent weeks as <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> hinted at Dogecoin integration into Twitter for payments. The DOGE price jumped 2% in just an hour as the Foundation revealed the development fund.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE price is trading at $0.0702, up nearly 4% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0669 and $0.0703, respectively.</p>

NFTs for digital art have fetched millions of dollars. It is challenging to distinguish between original and fake NFT. How to spot a fake NFT?</p>
<p>As non-fungible tokens gain popularity in the art world, more people are asking themselves this question. Plagiarism and fakes are becoming more of a problem as NFTs help many traditional and <a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">digital artists</a> make art profitable once more.</p>
<h2>5 Ways To Spot Fake NFT Collection</h2>
<h3>Verify the legitimacy of the NFT seller or artist</h3>
<p>Check the artist&#8217;s website and social media accounts if you think you bought an NFT directly from them to confirm. Make sure you&#8217;re viewing an official account and not a fake one created by a scammer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always a good idea to double-check the information on official websites and various social media platforms. It&#8217;s probably a bad sign if you&#8217;re having trouble locating a reliable source of information. Another choice is to seek guidance and context in trustworthy NFT communities.</p>
<h3>Carefully review the NFT website</h3>
<p>Fraudsters have been known to replicate entire websites. Therefore, even though the NFT website appears to be legitimate, you might be using the wrong URL. If you look closely enough, you can usually see indications of fabrication on a fake website, such as blank spaces, poor-quality text, and other errors.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should never enter your financial information on a website before verifying its legitimacy. Once you&#8217;ve linked your wallet to a phony website, its owners can easily access your money.</p>

<h3>Verify NFT sales volume</h3>
<p>There is a good chance that the NFT has been traded before if you are buying an NFT from a popular series. By viewing the NFT on a blockchain explorer or <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a></strong> aggregator, you can verify this. If the NFT has never been sold before, further research is worthwhile.</p>
<p>Check the activity history again to make sure these transactions don&#8217;t involve the same or a small number of wallets, even if there have been enough sales. It&#8217;s possible that a fraudster is buying and selling their own counterfeit NFTs in an effort to manipulate sales volume and price.</p>
<h3>Examine the cost of the NFT</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s probably true if the price seems too good to be true. To see how it stacks up against the asking price of the NFT of interest, check the floor price for the entire series. It&#8217;s highly unlikely that a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-are-cryptopunks-how-to-buy-cryptopunks-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto punk</a></strong> you find for sale for $5,000, for instance, is authentic. As previously stated, you should always check to make sure the price wasn&#8217;t manipulated by a select few wallets, even if it appears to be legitimate.</p>
<h3>Check the contract address on the NFT</h3>
<p>Another vital piece of information to verify is the contract address of the NFT, in addition to the seller&#8217;s wallet and the NFT&#8217;s on-chain data. You ought to be able to learn the collection&#8217;s precise contract address from a reliable source. The NFT is not authentic if it differs. By checking the contact addresses you can identify fake NFTs easily.</p>
