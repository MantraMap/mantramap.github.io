<p>In a recent Video for CryptoLawUS, John Deaton, the well-known lawyer and representative of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-could-soar-10x-to-hit-300000-reckons-xrp-holders-lawyer-heres-how/">XRP holders</a> in the SEC vs Ripple lawsuit, discusses the unease of waiting for a final ruling. Deaton recognises that people are making assumptions and expressing annoyance at how long the case has strung.</p>



<p>Drawing on his own experience, Deaton states, “Well, today I was working on a case that was filed in 2018 by me; there&#8217;s like three of these cases. That&#8217;s 2018. It was five years ago. And so, this delay is normal to me <em>because it&#8217;s the civil justice system.”</em></p>



<p>Deaton emphasized the situation&#8217;s complexity by highlighting that Ripple and the SEC made multiple moves for summary judgment in the case&#8217;s reply briefs and objections to one another&#8217;s motions. Additionally, the case is complex and involves hundreds of pages of arguments for the judge to go through.</p>



<p>Six months ago, the response briefs were due; on March 6th, a Daubert motion was also submitted, dealing with expert witnesses&#8217; admissibility. It was highlighted that the judge&#8217;s summary judgment rulings had occurred anywhere from the same day as the Daubert decision to six months subsequently, based on earlier rulings she issued in related instances.</p>



<p>To dispel the myth that this case is taking much longer than her prior ones, it was anticipated that the decision, in this case, could be made by September 6th. The judge is probably taking the time to thoroughly consider her ruling, given the significance of this case and the scrutiny it will receive from numerous parties, including appellate courts.</p>



<p>Regarding the length of the case, the famous lawyer argues that this case, which fills a regulatory gap, is a first impression case because no other cases have addressed secondary sales in this way. Fifteen amicus briefs have also been submitted, underlining the case&#8217;s importance for international trade, finance, and U.S. economic policy.</p>



<p>It should be noted, according to Deaton, that Judge Torres has a wide range of duties and objectives while managing over 500 outstanding cases, including 44 criminal cases. Despite some claims to the contrary, it is critical to acknowledge the importance of each case on the docket, even those involving defendants who face harsh penalties.</p>



<p>Deaton dismisses the idea of anything nefarious occurring in this case as absolute nonsense. While some have argued Judge Torres is on the SEC payroll and that she is doing an inside job, Deaton strongly questions why the Judge would have ruled against the SEC at all then, for example, by ordering them to release the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-references-hinman-emails-in-xrp-case-as-exchange-seeks-dismissal-of-secs-lawsuit/">Hinman emails</a>.</p>



<p><em>“OK, so if she was corrupt and on the SEC&#8217;s payroll, she would have never released the Hinman emails that they fought so desperately to keep private.” </em>He said on the matter.</p>



<p>While Deaton pointed out that he was happy with the appointment of Judge Netburn and Torres, he said that he did not have to agree with every decision they made but that they were fair overall. He cited the exclusion of an SEC witness who claimed to speak for XRP holders yet had never even spoken to one.</p>



<p>He said: <em>“Are you really going to sit there and say oh she just did that to give an appearance that she&#8217;s fair. Come on like let&#8217;s join reality. Get out of the metaverse and let&#8217;s get back into reality. Please. It&#8217;s not.”</em></p>



<p>Finally, Deaton concluded that if the decision is in Ripple&#8217;s favour, the SEC may submit a notice of appeal; if it is in the SEC&#8217;s favour, the SEC may still decide to appeal or negotiate with Ripple.</p>



<p>Given the importance of the case and the likelihood that it will go to the US Supreme Court, the judge would take the much-needed time before making a final ruling, aware that the Second Circuit and other high-ranking judges will be closely examining it.</p>

<ul>
<li>A newly resurfaced video from 2018 shows Gary Gensler saying&nbsp; BTC, ETH, and LTC are not securities.</li>



<li>Crypto users sharply contrast Gensler’s pro and anti-crypto stance, highlighting significant swings over the years.</li>



<li>In a related development, some United States lawmakers are preparing a bill to reform the SEC and fire Gensler.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received criticisms over his sudden ideological shift since becoming the Commission’s boss in 2020.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1668328519334780928?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">video</a> from 2018 featuring Gary Gensler has resurfaced on social media showing him stating clearly that Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash are not securities. Several pro-crypto accounts have shared the video describing Gensler as “<em>unstable” </em>in his views as he waged war against digital assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler was addressing institutional investors at an event hosted by Bloomberg and went on to say “<em>Over 70% of the crypto market is Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash. Why did I name those four? They’re not securities.” </em>At the time, Gensler was notably pro-crypto and was a Professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he held lectures on blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two years down the line, he was appointed as the SEC boss with several industry executives and enthusiasts lauding the appointment as the turning point for the industry as inflows began trickling in from institutional investors in 2020. Over the years, the once-sweet experience has turned sour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The video resurfaced on social media after Gensler launched a new offensive against Binance US and Coinbase with lawsuits making several allegations including fraud and offering its services to unregistered securities. This is not the first of Gensler’s pro-crypto speeches to be circulated accusing him of bias as he now works with the SEC.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-this-is-not-our-gensler">This is not our Gensler&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new Gary Gensler is not lenient towards digital assets as he was about four years ago. In his defence, many have said as a regulator, he needs to protect investors with everything although they also concede to the fact that his approach is wrong since there’s no clarity of regulation in the market. </p>



<p>Before his appointment to the top job at the SEC, Gensler noted that ETH was not a security but post his appointment, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-merge-concerns-heres-why-eth-could-be-viewed-as-a-security/">suggested</a> that all cryptocurrencies other than BTC could be securities. As SEC chair, he failed to directly answer whether ETH constitutes securities while grilled by Congress leading to more uncertainty.</p>



<p>In a similar video in 2018, Gensler claimed that two-thirds of digital assets are “<em>non-securities</em>&#8216;, but the Commission under his leadership has labelled about 68 digital assets as securities with lawsuits slapped on Binance and Coinbase. In 2019, Gensler referred to Algorand (<em>A</em>LGO) as a “<em>great technology” </em>Forward to 2023, the SEC claims ALGO is a security, a move that has significantly impacted the price of the assets. </p>



<p>The digital asset community remains in shock at the transformation of Gensler, with some calling him a “<em>hypocrite” </em>while pushing for his exit from the SEC.</p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said Tuesday it had not decided whether it will reply to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition. The Wall Street regulator said it anticipates requiring four months to respond potentially and that the lawsuit against the San Francisco-based exchange is not inconsistent with any decision on rulemaking.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-requests-for-more-time-to-respond-to-coinbase-s-rulemaking-request"><strong>SEC Requests For More Time To Respond To Coinbase’s Rulemaking Request</strong></h2>



<p>The U.S. SEC has said it needs 120 days to respond to Coinbase’s request that it adopt new rules and clarify which crypto assets should be regarded as securities.</p>



<p>In a June 13 filing, the Commission said it “has not decided what action to take on Coinbase’s rulemaking petition.”</p>



<p>This comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit’s judge Cheryl Ann Krause — who noted the SEC&#8217;s complaint filed last week — ordered the SEC to clarify its position on the rulemaking petition from Coinbase. Judge Cheryl ordered the SEC to explain within 7 days if it intends to decline Coinbase’s request, the reasons for such a decision, or a timeline of when it expects to come to a decision.</p>



<p>The SEC claimed Coinbase’s “extraordinary request” for a writ of mandamus has “no merit”. The securities regulator maintained that the mandamus petition should be rejected, but it thinks it will make a recommendation “within the next 120 days.” It has offered to provide the court with a status report by Oct. 11, 2023.</p>



<p>“Regardless of whether the Commission determines to undertake the rulemaking sought by Coinbase, a decision the Commission has yet to make, Coinbase — like everyone else — is bound by existing law,&#8221; the SEC filing stated. &#8220;And Coinbase is free to vigorously assert its position that it has not violated that law in the current enforcement action.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier last week, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/this-is-an-opportunity-to-get-rule-clarity-in-court-coinbase-stresses-on-the-positive-amid-sec-lawsuit/">hit </a>America’s largest digital asset exchange with a suit, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange for years and “elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests.”</p>



<p>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1668742688689070083">slammed </a>the SEC’s response in a tweet, saying the agency “ignore[d] the clear statements of the Chair that confirm they have no intent to issue new rules, and instead conflate the evidence of a decision those statements provide with an argument that the statements are themselves a decision,&#8221; adding that “they refuse to commit to any deadline despite the Court&#8217;s explicit order.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s Coming Next?</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC’s legal battle with Coinbase is only part of a wider clampdown on the fast-growing crypto sector, steered by Chair Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions stated that all digital assets — excluding bitcoin — are securities.</p>



<p>A day before <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">taking enforcement action</a> against Coinbase, the regulator had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">struck </a>Binance, its U.S. arm Binance.US, and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao with 13 charges.</p>



<p>With the SEC’s response to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition not providing any clarity on the agency’s current stance, the crypto industry will continue to operate in an environment of legal uncertainty. This likely means a years-long litigation battle for Coinbase and Binance and an uncertain future for token projects mentioned in the two lawsuits.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Mihailo Bjelic, the Co-founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygons-co-founder-pushes-for-gaming-revolution-as-cryptos-largest-scale-opportunity/">Polygon</a> and the Polygon Labs technical team, released a proposal to convert Polygon PoS to a zkEVM validium, a decentralized L2 that is the first of its type and secured by ZK proofs. This would be a significant achievement for the Polygon ecosystem since it will make Polygon PoS a more reliable, efficient, and integral part of the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem.</p>



<p>By processing transactions outside of the Ethereum Mainnet, zkEVM validium is a scaling solution that seeks to increase transaction throughput. It takes advantage of off-chain data availability and processing, much like the validium used by other scaling solutions. Zero-knowledge proofs are published by validium, such as the zkEVM validium, to validate off-chain Ethereum transactions.</p>



<p>These zero-knowledge proofs, like ZK-SNARKs and ZK-STARKs, work as &#8220;validity proofs&#8221; that verify the accuracy of off-chain transactions and strengthen the security guarantees of the validium chain. Users&#8217; funds in zkEVM Validium are managed by an Ethereum smart contract. Almost immediate withdrawals are enabled as soon as a withdrawal request&#8217;s validity proof has been confirmed on the Ethereum Mainnet.</p>



<p>In the last 18 months, Polygon Labs has launched the only mainnet EVM-equivalent zkEVM and the quickest ZK proving system in the market. Despite being popular and widely used across the ecosystem, some issues raise questions regarding the Polygon PoS architecture&#8217;s long-term relevancy and dependability. It implies that these problems must be resolved to guarantee the platform&#8217;s long-term viability and user pleasure.</p>



<p>With its 100 validators and sizable staked value, Polygon PoS delivers a respectable amount of decentralization and economic security. However, by ultimately inheriting Ethereum&#8217;s security, powerful Layer 2 (L2) technologies like Polygon&#8217;s zkEVM can offer even higher security.</p>



<p>The Polygon PoS tech stack uses forks of the Cosmos SDK and Geth. Given the labour involved and the availability of more sophisticated L2 technologies like Polygon&#8217;s zkEVM, maintaining these forks may not be the best option.</p>



<p>Deep chain reorganizations occasionally occur in the probabilistic consensus process utilized by Polygon PoS, which can negatively impact the user experience and dependability. Additionally, the quick block times may cause errors in gas estimation, resulting in sporadic increases in gas prices.</p>



<p>Overall, the improvement is thought to be feasible, simple, and advantageous and would offer several advantages. The modification would result in enhanced Transaction Data Availability, Viability, and Simplicity, Higher Scalability, Lower Fees, and Increased Security.</p>



<p>In conclusion, the proposal views the switch to a zkEVM validium as a workable, simple, and advantageous solution to the problems Polygon PoS faces, enabling cheaper costs, more scalability, and utilizing the decentralization and design of Polygon PoS already in place.</p>

<p>Eswar Prasad, Indian-American economist and Tolani Senior Professor of International Trade Policy at Cornell University, recently spoke at the 2023 Summer Davos about the fact that Retail Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) have been the subject of tests in several nations, including China, Sweden, India, Brazil, and Japan. Engaging in this context is that these nations already have effective domestic retail payment systems in place. According to Prasad, as the private sector discovered more effective ways to handle payment transactions and advance financial inclusion, such as India&#8217;s Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the use case for retail CBDCs has been weaker over the past few years.</p>



<p>In a report called ‘The Future of CBDCs’, Ripple highlights that the real-time value transfer between various Central Bank Digital Currencies can be seamless and cost-effective using a neutral bridge asset, such as the digital asset XRP. It makes trade-less liquid CBDC pairs possible, boosts competitiveness globally by lowering obstacles to entry for smaller market players, and optimizes payments for speed, scalability, affordability, and security.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-launches-a-novel-platform-for-governments-central-banks-developing-cbdcs/">Ripple announced its CBDC Platform</a>, enabling governments and central banks to expand access to the unbanked population globally and promote digitising their financial services.</p>



<p>David Schwartz, Ripple CTO, mentioned in a Tweet that <em>“The CBDC Platform reaffirms the significance of the XRP Ledger as it’s built with the same core ledger technology. It has the ability to interact with XRPL and use XRP as a bridge currency for cross-currency and cross-border payments.”</em></p>



<p>Professor Prasad said that despite some countries possibly not needing a CBDC, central bankers continue to have some reasons for introducing CBDCs. A CBDC could promote payment system interoperability in China, for example, where well-known payment platforms like Alipay and WeChat Pay lack direct contact. By offering a public payment option, a second goal is to ensure the robustness of the payment system. Furthermore, when talking about CBDCs, many central bankers stress the idea of monetary sovereignty.</p>



<p>Prasad draws attention to the fact that conventional cross-border payments are expensive, cumbersome, and difficult to track in real time. However, cross-border transactions may be done more quickly and easily thanks to technological developments spurred by the Crypto revolution. This has made it easier for economic migrants to settle almost immediately, lessen the need for hedging, and streamline remittances. According to Prasad, the integration of wholesale CBDCs by central banks worldwide has the potential to enhance international payments.</p>



<p>Prasad expressed sincere doubts about whether the US Dollar will be replaced anytime soon. But he stressed that the current financial system may not be perfect or balanced, with one dominating currency influencing global markets.</p>



<p>Prasad concluded: <em>“I want to make the case that even if there were to be a digital renminbi well before there ever is a digital dollar, is it going to fundamentally alter the dynamics of international finance? If you think about international payments, practically all of them are digital already.”</em></p>



<p>While he was not directly speaking about <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-references-hinman-emails-in-xrp-case-as-exchange-seeks-dismissal-of-secs-lawsuit/">XRP</a>, the digital asset, amongst others such as Stellar, has often been heralded as a bridge currency and perhaps even a true stablecoin. If central banks resolve to use XRP for cross-border payments will have to be seen. Still, it is a hotly debated topic amongst the XRP Community in particular and the wider Crypto Community.</p>

<p>Statistician Willy Woo, the creator of data resource Woobull, has predicted that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency has the potential to reach $310,000 heights if some specific market conditions come into play.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-310k-btc-possible-if-institutions-allocate-5-of-aum-to-bitcoin"><strong>$310K BTC Possible If Institutions Allocate 5% Of AUM To Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>Analyst Willy Woo thinks Bitcoin could skyrocket to unprecedented values if institutional giants put just 5% of their AUM into BTC.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1674010721225691136">tweet</a>, Woo suggested that if big players the likes of BlackRock, Fidelity, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, Invesco, and Bank of America decide converted 5% of their assets under management to bitcoin, the preeminent crypto asset could easily hit $310,000. For Woo, the potential mega growth in Bitcoin&#8217;s market cap, accompanied by the increase in its realized cap, would lead to such an upsurge in price.</p>



<p>The statistician also noted that BTC’s price trajectory would also be affected by the timing of these institutional-grade investments. &#8220;The estimate of $310,000 per Bitcoin really depends on whether these institutional players deploy their investments during a bearish or bullish phase of the market,&#8221; said Woo. He expects BTC to plunge to roughly $128,000 in bearish conditions, but for a bullish phase, the flagship crypto should climb to around $400,000.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What would price do if these guys put 5% of AUM into BTC?<br><br>My calculations estimate around ~$310k per coin. <a href="https://t.co/XHfYxETVWY">https://t.co/XHfYxETVWY</a> <a href="https://t.co/anyym07XUQ">pic.twitter.com/anyym07XUQ</a></p>&mdash; Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1674010721225691136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Some Twitter users, however, were not convinced by Woo’s estimations, mainly regarding the assumption that these high-profile financial institutions could simply choose to redirect a certain percentage of their AUM toward BTC. This is because these institutions manage their clients’ funds and what to invest the money into is ultimately the customers&#8217; decision. </p>



<p>In response to these concerns, Woo explained that his Bitcoin estimation was merely hypothetical based on a question he had been asked. He further noted that wealth management can be divided into two different classes: those operated by investor decisions and those that rely on the decision of the wealth manager. As such, any substantial investment in BTC would probably require consent from these institutions’ customers.</p>



<p>The largest cryptocurrency was trading at about $30,572.91 at press time, up 1.6% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s the likelihood of all these institutions allocating only 5% of their AUM during the next bull cycle?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin has expressed sympathy for “bluechip” crypto tokens like Solana that have been directly targeted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its recent aggressive legal actions against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-buterin-s-thoughts-on-ethereum-emerging-as-winner"><strong>Buterin’s Thoughts On Ethereum Emerging As Winner</strong></h2>



<p>Vitalik Buterin has made a compassionate remark regarding Solana (SOL) and the other major crypto assets that were dragged into court battles by the Security and Exchange Commission.</p>



<p>Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang asked Buterin on Twitter how he feels about the U.S. policy approach to cryptocurrencies amid the regulatory turmoil. The Ethereum founder wasted no time <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1674644137847451649">saying </a>he felt bad that SOL and the other tokens are being hit this way by the SEC.</p>



<p>The top U.S. regulator memorably filed lawsuits against crypto exchanges <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>earlier this month, charging the exchanges with trading crypto asset securities, including SOL, Cardano’s ADA, Polygon&#8217;s MATIC, and Algorand&#8217;s ALGO.</p>



<p>“They don&#8217;t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up &#8216;winning&#8217; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&#8217;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term, probably isn&#8217;t even a victory,” Buterin posited.</p>



<p>For Buterin, Ethereum&#8217;s real competition is not other chains in the crypto space but &#8220;the rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on us as we speak.&#8221; Meanwhile, he wished for all “honorable projects” to get a fair outcome amid the regulatory storm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Projects Hit Back At SEC’s Allegations</strong></h2>



<p>SOL, ADA, MATIC, and the other tokens saw their prices plummet after they were labelled securities by the SEC, and as if that weren’t enough, prominent companies like <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">Robinhood</a>, eToro, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/digital-asset-platform-bakkt-follows-robinhood-in-delisting-cardano-polygon-solana-after-sec-lawsuits/">Bakkt</a>, and Revolut all have announced ADA, MATIC, and SOL delistings in response to the regulator’s action.</p>



<p>The development companies behind these tokens separately <a href="https://zycrypto.com/far-from-securities-solana-polygon-and-cardano-issue-solid-statements-against-sec-claims/">released </a>statements recently that fought against the SEC’s claims. The Solana Foundation disputed the SEC’s classification and maintained that it welcomes continued cooperation with lawmakers to reach regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>Cardano developer IOG also rejected the Commission’s claims that ADA, the blockchain&#8217;s native token, can be regarded as a security. IOG observed that the SEC&#8217;s suit contained “numerous factual inaccuracies” and that “under no circumstances was ADA a security.”</p>



<p>Notably, the prices of SOL, ADA, and MATIC have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-solana-polygon-prices-make-comeback-rally-as-foundations-fire-back-against-secs-security-label/">stabilized and recouped some losses</a> amid a BlackRock-fuelled rally, which started after the financial services giant’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">application </a>for a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 15, driving the benchmark cryptocurrency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-surges-past-31k-now-up-80-this-year-as-wall-street-eyes-digital-gold/">past $31,000</a> for the first time in months — raising the tide for the majority of tokens in the market.</p>

<p>Vodafone and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">Cardano</a> may seem like an unlikely match on the surface, but there may be more to it than meets the eye. It all started with a Tweet by Vodafone Germany asking if Cardano had NFTs.</p>



<p>“Does Cardano have NFTs ? Moving the chains,” the mysterious tweet read.</p>



<p>This was followed up a day later on an official Vodafone Germany social media Discord channel.</p>



<p>Vodafone representative Luca wrote: <em>“Yes, we are planning to release an NFT collection this year, and we want to utilize the Cardano chain for this. The reason we chose this particular chain comes down to community, sustainability as well as cross-chain possibilities.”</em></p>



<p>Vodafone&#8217;s choice to use the Cardano network for minting NFTs has increased Cardano&#8217;s visibility and likelihood of widespread adoption. Vodafone&#8217;s cooperation, coming from a significant international company, illustrates the potential and capabilities of the Cardano blockchain for hosting large-scale projects. Cardano adoption may increase due to this exposure among other companies and developers who may be motivated to learn more about the capabilities and advantages of the platform.</p>



<p>By selecting Cardano as the NFT minting platform, Vodafone expresses confidence in the network&#8217;s technical capabilities and infrastructure. This can bolster the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-surging-adoption-in-the-u-s-fueling-super-bullish-ecosystem-growth-for-ada/">Cardano ecosystem</a> and support its long-term expansion and sustainability.</p>



<p>Additionally, ADA is the native coin of the Cardano blockchain. The value and demand for ADA may benefit from increased Cardano network adoption and usage, pushed by major corporations like Vodafone. Increased transactions, staking of ADA, and involvement in the management of the Cardano blockchain may occur when more companies and individuals interact with the Cardano ecosystem. These activities can increase interest in ADA and raise prices.</p>



<p>Cardano enthusiasts and ADA holders alike will be pleased with the development as Cardano is gaining real-life use cases on top of a solid foundation. As one Twitter user Dave, noted, Cardanos&#8217; uptime has just passed 2100 days.</p>



<p>And Patrick Tobler, the founder of NMKR, the platform that will help mint Vodafone NFTs on Cardano, targeted a tweet at Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stating, “Real-World Enterprise Adoption, what do you say?</p>



<p>While Hoskinson did not directly comment on the development or respond to the tweet, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/charles-hoskinson-highlights-cardanos-growing-adoption-amidst-lots-of-noise-in-crypto/">he said</a>, “Lots of noise in crypto. Look for the signal. Cardano is getting real adoption and growing as an ecosystem under the harshest conditions our industry knows. Like Bitcoin, this is being done in a completely decentralized way.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has proposed a common protocol for the use of digital money, such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), tokenized bank deposits, and stablecoins on a distributed ledger.</p>



<p>The details are contained in a whitepaper released on June 21, 2023. The whitepaper encourages greater research among central banks, FIs, and FinTechs to understand the design considerations in using digital money.</p>



<p>According to the whitepaper, although digital money offers the possibility of programming unique characteristics into the individual bearer asset and hence dictates how the digital money is to be used, this would modify its properties and acceptance as a medium of exchange.</p>



<p>To understand how the fungibility of digital money can be retained, the whitepaper studied different programmability models, namely, the programmable payments model, the programmable money model, and the Purpose Bound Money (PBM) model.</p>



<p>According to the white paper, the programmable payment’s advantage is its ability to define a set of programming logic or conditions that could be applied across a variety of different forms of money. The programmable money model has the advantage of being self-contained and having conditional logic transferrable on a peer-to-peer basis between parties.</p>



<p>Consequently, there is a growing need to ensure a common framework for interacting with different forms of digital monies and ensuring interoperability with existing financial infrastructure.</p>



<p>The PBM model has the advantages of containing digital money as a store of values and programming logic denoting its use. The whitepaper provides a technical overview of the concept of the PBM model.</p>



<p>As per the whitepaper, the PBM model builds upon both the programmable payment and programmable money models and works with different ledger technologies. PBM enables users to access and transfer digital money using the wallet provider of their choice without the need for customization.</p>



<p>The whitepaper, developed in collaboration with the International Monetary Fund, Banca d’Italia, Bank of Korea, financial institutions and FinTech firms, further discusses potential uses of the PBM model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This collaboration among industry players and policymakers has helped achieve important advances in settlement efficiency, merchant acquisition, and user experience using digital money. More importantly, it has enhanced the prospects for digital money becoming a key component of the future financial and payments landscape&#8221;, said Mr Sopnendu Mohanty, Chief FinTech Officer at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>



<p>The MAS has previously stated that there is no urgent need for a retail CBDC in Singapore. The MAS says that this whitepaper is neither seeking to advance specific policy objectives nor to endorse any technical solution.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap, recently saw substantial growth, market observers look to the cause of this. One reason for the price driver may be the increase in applications for exchange-traded funds (ETF) for Bitcoin by several financial institutions, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity&#8217;s latest move to re-file for an ETF</a>. As the market continues to grow, investors are keenly speculating whether increasing demand for a Bitcoin-ETF is the leading cause of its price increase.</p>



<p>Fidelity has resubmitted a requisition to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), being the latest major player in financial services to enter the battle for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity is initiating a bid for a Bitcoin ETF for the second time with this action, demonstrating its belief in the likelihood of a successful launch.</p>



<p>The number of Bitcoin ETF applications submitted to the SEC this year has increased, with Fidelity becoming the seventh to do so. The increased interest in Bitcoin ETFs is evidence of the traditional financial community&#8217;s growing acceptance and acknowledgement of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The &#8220;Spot Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust&#8221; is intended to expose investors to Bitcoin through a product that trades on regulated exchanges, according to the filing. Shares of the trust, which would hold Bitcoin as its main asset and reflect a proportional investment in the virtual currency, would be available for purchase and sale on the open market to investors.</p>



<p>As the American economy recovers from the pandemic-related slowdown, Fidelity decides to re-file for a Bitcoin ETF. The demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as alternative investments has risen as economic activity picks up and investor confidence grows.</p>



<p>The industry&#8217;s increasing interest in a Bitcoin ETF reflects its understanding of the enormous potential for institutional adoption and its desire to offer regulated investing options for conventional investors. A Bitcoin ETF, if approved, may function as a spur for increased mainstream adoption and draw large capital inflows into the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s decision on any pending Bitcoin ETF applications is still in the air, despite Fidelity&#8217;s re-filing indicating optimism and a favourable forecast for the cryptocurrency sector. Due to worries about market manipulation and investor protection, the SEC has typically been wary of adopting such investment vehicles.</p>



<p>Fidelity&#8217;s action will likely increase competition among financial firms vying for a seat in the Bitcoin ETF race. Applications from other well-known parties, including Grayscale Investments and VanEck, show the rising desire to give investors regulated access to Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The recent price increases in the cryptocurrency market and Fidelity&#8217;s renewed campaign for a Bitcoin ETF highlight the rising demand and general interest in digital assets.</p>



<p>Investors and enthusiasts alike will be keenly watching developments to determine the influence on the price and broader acceptance of Bitcoin in the global financial scene as the market excitedly anticipates the SEC&#8217;s verdict on Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, blockchain payments firm Ripple <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">unleashed </a>the controversial Hinman emails as a key aspect of a defensive plan designed at putting the SEC on the back foot.</p>



<p>And these documents could not only help the XRP originator evade a billion-dollar suit but also help another crypto giant in the SEC&#8217;s crosshairs: Coinbase, the biggest digital asset exchange in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase has filed a motion to dismiss the SEC’s complaint. In the legal document on June 29, the exchange’s legal team cited the infamous Hinman emails to highlight a major “regulatory gap” and “greater confusion” regarding the rules in the crypto market.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-coinbase-denies-sec-jurisdiction"><strong>Coinbase Denies SEC Jurisdiction</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has filed its first legal response to SEC’s lawsuit.</p>



<p>In its answer filed Thursday with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Coinbase voiced concerns about the SEC violating its due process and reaching beyond its legal authority. Coinbase’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1674271484263661569">tweeted </a>on Thursday, saying that the SEC’s claims in the suit “go far beyond existing law” and should, therefore, be dismissed.</p>



<p>According to Coinbase, the 12 digital tokens considered as securities in SEC&#8217;s complaint are not &#8220;investment contracts,&#8221; hence the assets don’t qualify as securities under the Howey Test.</p>



<p>The exchange’s lawyers note that without a &#8220;contractual undertaking&#8221; to yield profits or a business whose &#8220;management owes enforceable obligations to investors,&#8221; it&#8217;s just an &#8220;asset sale&#8221; and cannot be deemed an &#8220;investment contract.&#8221;</p>



<p>Coinbase further argued that the SEC was fully aware of the exchange’s listing processes for crypto tokens and did not express any disapproval before lodging the lawsuit. Moreover, six of the 12 coins now under dispute were already being traded on the exchange when the SEC affirmed the effectiveness of the company&#8217;s registration statement.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s motion also notes that the SEC’s current Chair, Gary Gensler changed his position on the regulator&#8217;s authority over crypto toward the end of 2022. Gensler testified before Congress in May 2021 saying that &#8220;only Congress&#8221; can address the gap in regulating crypto assets as &#8220;there is not a market regulator around these crypto exchanges.&#8221; But by the end of 2022, the SEC boss had determined that his agency had &#8220;enough authority&#8221; to bring enforcement actions.</p>



<p>“Even if the SEC were correct that the assets and services it identifies are within the scope of its existing regulatory authority, this [legal] action must be dismissed on independent grounds that it violates Coinbase’s due process rights and constitutes an extraordinary abuse of process,” Coinbase’s legal team wrote in the filing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase’s Motion To Dismiss Has “Real Teeth”: Pro-XRP Lawyer</strong></h2>



<p>XRP holders’ attorney John E Deaton <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1674401125846458368">noted </a>that Coinbase’s argument had “real teeth” while pointing out some compelling points to buttress his point.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a>’s Motion to Dismiss, based on the Major Questions  Doctrine, has real teeth. I’m not saying that it will be granted for sure, I’m just saying it’s not your garden variety motion to dismiss where denial can easily be predicted. The motion has teeth because of… <a href="https://t.co/qVkwY31Zkm">https://t.co/qVkwY31Zkm</a></p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1674401125846458368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>For starters, Deaton pointed out that the U.S. Congress has commenced the process of legislation for the crypto industry, which is a sign that lawmakers are finally ready to address the core issues raised. The CryptoLaw founder then mentioned the regulatory gap argument that was publicized through the Hinman emails in the XRP v. SEC case, which also gave Coinbase a stronger defense.</p>



<p>Deaton also believes Gensler’s previous acknowledgement that there is no clear rulebook developed for the crypto assets ecosystem can also strengthen the exchange’s case.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Coinbase lawsuit is whether the exchange sold some assets as investment contracts. Speaking on this, the attorney observed that there has never been a case in the past where the court declared that assets purchased at the secondary market were an investment contract. Moreover, there is not even one case in history where the judge has found an investment contract when there was no connection between the issuer and the buyer.</p>



<p>While he believes the motion is strong, Deaton clarified that it does not mean the presiding judge will grant it. In other words, Coinbase’s motion isn’t “your garden variety motion to dismiss where denial can easily be predicted.”</p>

<p>Two weeks after BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF application, Boston-based financial services giant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-fidelity-investments-rumored-to-be-close-to-filing-for-blackrock-like-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity </a>is trying its luck with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) — again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fidelity Officially Reenters The Ring</strong></h2>



<p>Fidelity, a notable asset management company with at least $11.1 trillion in assets under administration, has refiled paperwork for its Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, joining a long list of spot bitcoin ETF hopefuls.</p>



<p>As per a filing by Cboe BZX Exchange with the SEC dated June 19, Fidelity said its spot BTC offering would help investors in the U.S. avoid risk.</p>



<p>&#8220;To this point, the lack of a Spot Bitcoin ETP exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto asset exposure through a Spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,&#8221; the filing stated, adding that investors have previously stored their assets on now-defunct cryptocurrency exchanges like FTX.</p>



<p>Fidelity’s application bears a striking resemblance to BlackRock’s and ARK Invest’s as it includes the &#8220;surveillance sharing agreement&#8221; with an unspecified United States spot-based bitcoin trading platform. The purpose of this key aspect is to help alleviate SEC concerns regarding market manipulation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-race-for-spot-etf-heats-up-amid-growing-institutional-interest"><strong>Race For Spot ETF Heats Up Amid Growing Institutional Interest</strong></h2>



<p>Fidelity’s application comes after the world&#8217;s largest asset manager BlackRock <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">filed paperwork</a> with the SEC for a spot BTC ETF on June 15. The BlackRock news sent shockwaves throughout the cryptocurrency market, enticing more financial institutions, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">Invesco</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shoots-up-with-30000-in-sight-following-fresh-wave-of-spot-etf-applications/">Wisdom Tree</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">ARK Invest</a> to hop on the crypto wagon and submit similar applications in the following days. Like these firms, Fidelity was making a second shot at a spot bitcoin product after the SEC denied its first application in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the SEC approved the first leveraged Bitcoin futures ETF last week, the agency is yet to decide on any of the new spot ETF filings. Notably, most crypto observers are optimistic about BlackRock’s application owing to its sheer financial power and the fact that the investment giant has received a green light for all of its previous 575 ETF applications except one. Additionally, hopes are high for BlackRock, seeing that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/theres-a-50-chance-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-gets-greenlight-from-sec-top-bloomberg-analyst-predicts/">Grayscale may likely win its suit</a> against the SEC for denying its spot bitcoin ETF request.</p>



<p>Institutional investors appear hungry for such spot crypto ETFs, pundits claim, because it would let them be involved with Bitcoin without worrying about storing the asset.</p>



<p>All these major traditional investment companies filing applications for spot bitcoin ETFs with the SEC have catalyzed bitcoin’s steady rise past the psychologically important $30,000 level. The largest crypto by market cap is changing hands at $30,819.93 at publication time, with a 0.8% gain.</p>

<p>The recent volatility in crypto prices has opened up enticing prospects for shrewd investors, specifically those who hold a significant amount of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-moon-time-ripple-eyes-upper-hand-in-sec-lawsuit-as-ceo-garlinghouse-sheds-light-on-case-outcome/">XRP</a> to acquire additional coins.</p>



<p>Earlier today, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the unusual buying activity of XRP whales during the recent market dip. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1674366754322104325">tweet</a>, Martinez noted that despite XRP&#8217;s price dropping by 12% between June 22 &#8211; June 28, whales seized the opportunity and purchased a staggering 360 million XRP tokens, equivalent to a substantial $170 million.</p>



<p>Notably, the so-called &#8220;whales&#8221; are often seen as trendsetters in the crypto space, and their actions can influence market dynamics. By acquiring such a significant amount of XRP during a dip, these whales are likely signalling their belief in a future price increase. This move may attract other investors and reinforce positive sentiment around Ripple and XRP.</p>



<p>The gargantuan purchase comes just days after the pundit highlighted the correlation between previous price jumps in XRP and a spike in the number of active XRP addresses.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The last three instances $XRP price jumped were preceded by a spike in the number of active XRP addresses. On-chain data from Santimentfeed has recorded a spike in network activity over the past few days. Could history repeat itself?&#8221;</em> Ali tweeted on June 26, sharing the chart below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DA8w7vg_JupCKqUgzsaE7ImIxYRqZA-P5jezJ2bn9jazTRvNkYT0nQD2uB-SXvgLsaY-sAQtqXdYdFHQiyXTB04T5rS3lVcIqDUxePnOZFOinjrNczwdFn34wOcWr32YNDWWRcxE8ipD7CMIRLWvQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>These developments send a clear message about investor confidence in Ripple&#8217;s vision and its underlying XRP token. Ripple, San Francisco, a blockchain-based payment company, has garnered attention for its potential to revolutionize cross-border transactions.</p>



<p>Recently, Ripple secured an In-Principle approval of a major payments institution license from Singapore, allowing it to offer regulated digital asset products and services and scale customer use of its On Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. This and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-sees-ultra-bullish-use-cases-after-colombias-central-bank-taps-ripple-to-pilot-cbdc/">partnerships</a> with financial institutions can amplify the utility and demand for XRP, ultimately exerting an influence on its value.</p>



<p>Notably, the surge in Ripple and XRP interest can also be attributed to the optimism surrounding Ripple&#8217;s ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-continues-to-see-new-twists-and-turns-as-alderoty-reveals-ripples-benefits-in-sec-case/">legal battle</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP as a security. It is worth noting that Ripple&#8217;s victories against the SEC, including the recent disclosure of the highly disputed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">Hinman documents</a>, have been widely regarded as a substantial reinforcement of Ripple&#8217;s arguments.</p>



<p>That said, the outcome of this case holds substantial importance, as a favourable ruling for Ripple could fuel investor confidence and bolster the prospects of XRP as a prominent cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, XRP has been experiencing a consolidation phase after encountering significant resistance at $0.55. Nevertheless, when examining the hourly time frames, the trend appears promising as the price establishes higher lows. According to the crypto analyst known as &#8220;Altcoin Sherpa,&#8221; this <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1674021807924314112">suggests</a> the need for patience until the resistance level is surpassed.</p>

<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.47 after a 0.60% drawdown in the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Joe Lubin, Ethereum Co-Founder and the CEO of ConsenSys is not worried about ether (ETH) being classed as a security in the United States after the crypto’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model.</p>



<p>Speaking during a June 28 <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetSignsCNBC/status/1673884919632904192">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, Lubin noted that a regulatory decision on ether has already been made. “The CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,” he stated.</p>



<p>Notably, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) boss Rostin Benham has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/blockchaintpsht/status/1633516089245147167">said </a>that the top three cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether’s USDT, belong under his agency’s purview as commodities. </p>



<p>Benham’s opinion, however, directly contradicts that of Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions indicated that “everything other than Bitcoin” fits the definition of securities. Earlier this month, Gensler’s hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.</p>



<p>The commission’s chairman has also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chief-gary-gensler-hints-ethereums-move-to-proof-of-stake-might-transform-eth-into-a-security/">hinted </a>that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network’s monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>



<p>But Gensler wasn’t always so trenchant a detractor. Before becoming the chair of SEC, he taught courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulted with that school’s Digital Currency Initiative. During this time, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gensler-asserts-bitcoin-and-ether-are-not-securities-at-a-bloomberg-conference-in-2018/">believed </a>ether had graduated from being a security into a commodity by 2018.</p>



<p>“The SEC has spoken,” Lubin opined, referencing former SEC director William Hinman’s 2018 speech Ethereum speech where he declared the asset a non-security. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">Recently unmasked documents </a>revealed that Hinman dismissed warnings from other SEC staffers who believed his comments would cause immense market confusion.</p>



<p>Notably, Gensler refused to say whether ether was a security during a five-hour-long hearing in April. “It’s really a forgone conclusion at this point,” Lubin observed. “There may be a regulator or two in the United States that can’t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don’t know why that’s the case.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, industry figures and billionaires like Mark Cuban are <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1667914770651987970">calling out</a> the SEC for failing to provide crypto firms with a clear registration process to comply with.</p>
