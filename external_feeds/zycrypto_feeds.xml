										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/XRP-Whales-Are-Seriously-Accumulating-–-A-Major-Price-Movement-Inbound_.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="XRP Whales Are Seriously Accumulating – A Major Price Movement Inbound?" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/XRP-Whales-Are-Seriously-Accumulating-–-A-Major-Price-Movement-Inbound_.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/XRP-Whales-Are-Seriously-Accumulating-–-A-Major-Price-Movement-Inbound_-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/XRP-Whales-Are-Seriously-Accumulating-–-A-Major-Price-Movement-Inbound_-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/XRP-Whales-Are-Seriously-Accumulating-–-A-Major-Price-Movement-Inbound_-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>The recent volatility in crypto prices has opened up enticing prospects for shrewd investors, specifically those who hold a significant amount of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-moon-time-ripple-eyes-upper-hand-in-sec-lawsuit-as-ceo-garlinghouse-sheds-light-on-case-outcome/">XRP</a> to acquire additional coins.</p>



<p>Earlier today, renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the unusual buying activity of XRP whales during the recent market dip. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1674366754322104325">tweet</a>, Martinez noted that despite XRP&#8217;s price dropping by 12% between June 22 &#8211; June 28, whales seized the opportunity and purchased a staggering 360 million XRP tokens, equivalent to a substantial $170 million.</p>



<p>Notably, the so-called &#8220;whales&#8221; are often seen as trendsetters in the crypto space, and their actions can influence market dynamics. By acquiring such a significant amount of XRP during a dip, these whales are likely signalling their belief in a future price increase. This move may attract other investors and reinforce positive sentiment around Ripple and XRP.</p>



<p>The gargantuan purchase comes just days after the pundit highlighted the correlation between previous price jumps in XRP and a spike in the number of active XRP addresses.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The last three instances $XRP price jumped were preceded by a spike in the number of active XRP addresses. On-chain data from Santimentfeed has recorded a spike in network activity over the past few days. Could history repeat itself?&#8221;</em> Ali tweeted on June 26, sharing the chart below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-DA8w7vg_JupCKqUgzsaE7ImIxYRqZA-P5jezJ2bn9jazTRvNkYT0nQD2uB-SXvgLsaY-sAQtqXdYdFHQiyXTB04T5rS3lVcIqDUxePnOZFOinjrNczwdFn34wOcWr32YNDWWRcxE8ipD7CMIRLWvQ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>These developments send a clear message about investor confidence in Ripple&#8217;s vision and its underlying XRP token. Ripple, San Francisco, a blockchain-based payment company, has garnered attention for its potential to revolutionize cross-border transactions.</p>



<p>Recently, Ripple secured an In-Principle approval of a major payments institution license from Singapore, allowing it to offer regulated digital asset products and services and scale customer use of its On Demand Liquidity (ODL) product. This and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-sees-ultra-bullish-use-cases-after-colombias-central-bank-taps-ripple-to-pilot-cbdc/">partnerships</a> with financial institutions can amplify the utility and demand for XRP, ultimately exerting an influence on its value.</p>



<p>Notably, the surge in Ripple and XRP interest can also be attributed to the optimism surrounding Ripple&#8217;s ongoing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-continues-to-see-new-twists-and-turns-as-alderoty-reveals-ripples-benefits-in-sec-case/">legal battle</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over the classification of XRP as a security. It is worth noting that Ripple&#8217;s victories against the SEC, including the recent disclosure of the highly disputed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-ripple-hinman-documents-release-is-a-boost-to-ethereum-jpmorgan-analysts-share-opinion/">Hinman documents</a>, have been widely regarded as a substantial reinforcement of Ripple&#8217;s arguments.</p>



<p>That said, the outcome of this case holds substantial importance, as a favourable ruling for Ripple could fuel investor confidence and bolster the prospects of XRP as a prominent cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>From a technical standpoint, XRP has been experiencing a consolidation phase after encountering significant resistance at $0.55. Nevertheless, when examining the hourly time frames, the trend appears promising as the price establishes higher lows. According to the crypto analyst known as &#8220;Altcoin Sherpa,&#8221; this <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1674021807924314112">suggests</a> the need for patience until the resistance level is surpassed.</p>

<p>At press time, XRP was trading at $0.47 after a 0.60% drawdown in the past 24 hours, as per data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Joe Lubin, Ethereum Co-Founder and the CEO of ConsenSys is not worried about ether (ETH) being classed as a security in the United States after the crypto’s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model.</p>



<p>Speaking during a June 28 <a href="https://twitter.com/StreetSignsCNBC/status/1673884919632904192">interview </a>with <em>CNBC</em>, Lubin noted that a regulatory decision on ether has already been made. “The CFTC has spoken very crisply a number of times that they consider Ether like a commodity,” he stated.</p>



<p>Notably, the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) boss Rostin Benham has previously <a href="https://twitter.com/blockchaintpsht/status/1633516089245147167">said </a>that the top three cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum, and Tether’s USDT, belong under his agency’s purview as commodities. </p>



<p>Benham’s opinion, however, directly contradicts that of Securities and Exchange Commission boss Gary Gensler, who has on multiple occasions indicated that “everything other than Bitcoin” fits the definition of securities. Earlier this month, Gensler’s hammer struck twice as the SEC filed landmark lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>for purportedly offering cryptocurrencies that the regulator deems to be unregistered securities.</p>



<p>The commission’s chairman has also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chief-gary-gensler-hints-ethereums-move-to-proof-of-stake-might-transform-eth-into-a-security/">hinted </a>that ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, fell under this umbrella after the network’s monumental shift to a proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>



<p>But Gensler wasn’t always so trenchant a detractor. Before becoming the chair of SEC, he taught courses on digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulted with that school’s Digital Currency Initiative. During this time, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gensler-asserts-bitcoin-and-ether-are-not-securities-at-a-bloomberg-conference-in-2018/">believed </a>ether had graduated from being a security into a commodity by 2018.</p>



<p>“The SEC has spoken,” Lubin opined, referencing former SEC director William Hinman’s 2018 speech Ethereum speech where he declared the asset a non-security. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-primed-for-massive-upsurge-as-sec-case-tilts-in-ripples-favor-amid-huge-reveal-of-hinman-docs/">Recently unmasked documents </a>revealed that Hinman dismissed warnings from other SEC staffers who believed his comments would cause immense market confusion.</p>



<p>Notably, Gensler refused to say whether ether was a security during a five-hour-long hearing in April. “It’s really a forgone conclusion at this point,” Lubin observed. “There may be a regulator or two in the United States that can’t bring himself to utter the fact that Ether is not a security, but I don’t know why that’s the case.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, industry figures and billionaires like Mark Cuban are <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuban/status/1667914770651987970">calling out</a> the SEC for failing to provide crypto firms with a clear registration process to comply with.</p>

<p>Charles Hoskinson, the founder of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-insane-growth-as-sundaeswap-hits-major-milestone-signaling-surging-adoption-for-ada/">Cardano</a>, has expressed his perspective on the current state of the cryptocurrency market, emphasizing the importance of looking for the signal amidst what he termed &#8220;lots of noise in crypto&#8221;.</p>



<p>Hoskinson, responding to recent adverse claims surrounding Cardano&#8217;s institutional interest and the health of its DeFi sector, passionately highlighted the ecosystem&#8217;s exceptional growth in a June 28 tweet, emphasizing its real adoption and commitment to decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, Hoskinson confidently stated that Cardano is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-sees-surging-adoption-in-the-u-s-fueling-super-bullish-ecosystem-growth-for-ada/">experiencing real adoption and significant growth</a> even under the harshest industrial conditions. Drawing a parallel to Bitcoin, he emphasized that Cardano&#8217;s progress is being completely decentralised.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Lots of noise in crypto. Look for the signal. Cardano is getting real adoption and growing as an ecosystem under the harshest conditions our industry knows. Like Bitcoin, this is being done in a completely decentralized way,&#8221; </em>Said Hoskinson.</p>



<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s response was prompted by a tweet from popular Cardano proponent Chris O, who highlighted claims made on a popular YouTube channel regarding Cardano&#8217;s lack of Total Value Locked (TVL) and institutional interest. In response, Chris offered a powerful rebuttal by highlighting various institutional players already involved in the Cardano ecosystem.</p>



<p>He listed prominent institutions such as Grayscale, Hong Kong Vectors Capital, Bitwise Investments, WisdomTree Europe, and 21Shares, all of whom have expressed interest or established products related to Cardano. He further pointed out the growing number of institutional funds and indexes associated with Cardano, specifically mentioning the WisdomTree Cardano ETP and the 21Shares Cardano ETP. Notably, these investments demonstrate institutional players&#8217; confidence in Cardano&#8217;s potential and further validate its increasing adoption.</p>



<p>Dan Gambardello, a popular crypto analyst and host of the Crypto Capital Venture YouTube channel, also highlighted the thriving nature of Cardano&#8217;s De-Fi sector. In a video, the pundit stated that some investors are achieving significant gains despite the bear market and challenged the misconception that all altcoins performed poorly during bear markets.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are people within Cardano outpacing these losses with gains, and they&#8217;re stacking ADA as a macro-minded investor or as a value investor for the long term. They&#8217;re stacking their AdA and outpacing these losses with gains</em>,&#8221; said Dan.</p>



<p>Dan then presented data illustrating Cardano&#8217;s rapid growth and adoption in the DeFi space. He emphasized the substantial increase in total value locked (TVL) within Cardano&#8217;s DeFi space, with an impressive growth rate of 148% from January to June. He also mentioned specific successful projects in the Cardano ecosystem, such as IAG, VPhi, Indie, and Milk, which achieved remarkable gains ranging from 255% to 590% over the same period.</p>



<p>That said, despite the prevailing bearish sentiment towards crypto, it is vital to acknowledge the potential and value that Cardano offers, especially considering the network&#8217;s strengthening fundamentals. At press time, ADA was trading at $0.27 following a brutal week, which saw its price plunge about 8%.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California filed charges against the investment fund founder of Ichioka Ventures, William K. Ichioka, of New York, New York, with several cryptocurrency fraud schemes.</p>



<p>According to a June 22, 2023 press release, the SEC charged Ichioka with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.</p>



<p>The SEC complaint states that Ichioka raised US$25 million from individual investors primarily in California and Oregon, making false claims about his investing success, and promising large anticipated returns.</p>



<p>The SEC’s complaint further alleges that from at least June 2019 to October 2021, Ichioka solicited investments for his unregistered investment fund, claiming that he was an accomplished investor, promising investors oversized returns and guaranteeing investors’ principal. Ichioka agreed to the entry of a partial final judgement, subject to court approval.</p>



<p>In a typical Ponzi scheme-styled fraud, Ichioka promised attractive returns and used money from new investors to repay other investors. As per the SEC complaint, Ichioka falsified a bank statement and other documents to create an appearance of success, and also misappropriated investors&#8217; funds for personal use.</p>



<p><em>“As we allege in our complaint, Ichioka lured investors by falsely stating that he was a self-made multimillionaire investor able to generate significant investment returns, but the real story was that Ichioka stole investor funds to enrich himself,” said Monique C. Winkler, Director, SEC’s San Francisco Regional Office.</em></p>



<p>In a June 22, 2023 press release, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission also filed a civil enforcement action charging William Koo Ichioka with fraudulently soliciting and misappropriating investors’ funds. Ichioka did not contest his liability on the CFTC’s claims.</p>



<p>According to the CFTC press release, Ichioka operated a fraudulent scheme from 2018 through November 2021, where he solicited funds from several individuals for trading digital asset commodities and for forex transactions.</p>



<p>On June 22, 2023, the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California also filed a criminal complaint against Ichioka charging him with multiple criminal counts including wire fraud and assisting in the preparation of a fraudulent tax return.</p>



<p>As per the court filings, Ichioka is further charged in connection with the purchase and sale of securities, and commodities fraud. Ichioka’s initial federal court appearance is yet to be scheduled.</p>



<p>The above concurrent charges against Ichioka further add to the debate of oversight over crypto activities and regulation in the United States and the collaboration of law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Invest has made a strategic move that potentially gives it an edge in the race for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. The firm has amended its application to include a surveillance-sharing agreement, similar to BlackRock’s recent filing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ark-amends-spot-etf-filing-to-include-blackrock-like-feature"><strong>ARK Amends Spot ETF Filing To Include BlackRock-Like Feature</strong></h2>



<p>ARK Invest has updated its Bitcoin ETF application with the SEC.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028-Amendment-No-1.pdf">update </a>includes a surveillance sharing agreement with the Cboe BZX Exchange — on which the ETF would be listed —  and a U.S.-based crypto exchange, most “likely Coinbase,” <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1674055780058771463">according to</a> Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.</p>



<p>“The Exchange is proposing to take additional steps to those described above to supplement its ability to obtain information that would be helpful in detecting, investigating, and deterring fraud and market manipulation in the Commodity-Based Trust Shares,” Cboe BZX said in the revised application.</p>



<p>A surveillance-sharing agreement entails sharing data regarding market trading activity, clearing activity, and customer verification to guard against possible market manipulation.</p>



<p>ARK requested permission to list its native spot BTC ETF a third time in April after previous applications were rejected by the SEC back in 2021 and 2022. As a reason for the denials, the securities regulator indicated that it did not fully satisfy the rules of practice and Exchange Act provisions for listing a financial product.</p>



<p>The amended 19b-4 filing potentially puts ARK in competition with BlackRock to gain the first-ever approval of a spot bitcoin ETF in the United States, as the original filing for the fund came earlier than BlackRock&#8217;s.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per Balchunas, the SEC’s decision is expected in August, and any potential delays could be seen as a really bad sign for approval unless the delay is followed by green-lighting of BlackRock’s ETF, which could signal a hint of “favoritism.”</p>



<p>BlackRock already tapped Coinbase to be its Bitcoin custodian if and when it&#8217;s granted approval. As such, there are concerns about whether the investment giant would allow Coinbase to enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement with another entity that could potentially overtake it on the market.</p>

<p>Colombia&#8217;s central bank, Banco de la República, recently joined forces with blockchain technology firm Ripple and software development company Peersyst to pilot a project exploring the use of blockchain technology on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-seals-major-partnership-with-canadas-biggest-university-to-launch-xrp-ledger-validator/">XRP Ledger</a>. The initiative, overseen by Colombia&#8217;s Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (MinTIC), aims to leverage Ripple&#8217;s recently launched central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform.</p>



<p>In a tweet, Ripple Partner Peersyst stated, “The objective: Evaluate potential efficiencies of a solution using the Ripple CBDC Platform based on the core technology of the XRPLedger to improve use cases on the high-value payment system.<em>”</em></p>



<p>The partnership between Banco de la República, Ripple, and Peersyst is a crucial step towards incorporating blockchain technology into the nation&#8217;s financial infrastructure. The pilot project will examine blockchain&#8217;s possible use cases on the XRP Ledger and how they relate to central bank digital currencies. Banco de la República hopes to improve the effectiveness, security, and transparency of the nation&#8217;s financial transactions by utilizing Ripple&#8217;s CBDC platform.</p>



<p>The partnership may affect the value of XRP, the cryptocurrency behind the XRP Ledger. Although the cooperation might increase interest in XRP, it is important to consider other market factors that may affect the price. It must also be stressed that a Colombian CBDC will likely not use XRP itself, but rather the underlying XRPL distributed ledger technology (DTL). The success of the collaboration will therefore rely on how well the pilot project is carried out and how widely blockchain technology is embraced in Colombia&#8217;s banking sector.</p>



<p>This is a hugely significant collaboration in the context of digital currencies issued by central banks. The fact that Banco de la República is investigating Ripple&#8217;s CBDC technology demonstrates the growing awareness of the potential of blockchain to revolutionize conventional financial systems. The central bank of Colombia has shown that it is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/colombian-government-launches-national-land-registry-on-xrp-ledger-for-over-50-million-people/">committed to staying</a> on the cutting edge of technological advancement in the financial sector by cooperating with Ripple and Peersyst.</p>



<p>The partnership between Banco de la Republica, Ripple, and Peersyst comes as central banks worldwide investigate the advantages of blockchain technology and virtual currencies. Blocks like this open the path for broader adoption and the mainstream integration of blockchain-based solutions as governments and financial institutions come to understand the revolutionary potential of decentralized technologies.</p>



<p>The collaboration raises promise for the future of digital money in the nation, even though the pilot project&#8217;s specific use cases and results have not yet been determined. Colombia intends to strengthen its financial infrastructure, increase security, and promote innovation by utilizing the possibilities of blockchain technology and Ripple&#8217;s CBDC platform.</p>



<p>It is crucial to understand that the pilot project&#8217;s success will depend on several variables, including legal requirements, technological viability, and public acceptance. Stakeholders should closely follow the project&#8217;s progress and evaluate the possibilities for growing blockchain solutions in Colombia&#8217;s financial ecosystem as it develops.</p>

<p>A leaked draft document from the European Commission has shed light on the institution&#8217;s plans for the digital euro, providing an intriguing glimpse into the future of digital currencies. According to the draft, the EU Commission wants to establish an openly available digital euro while also putting some limitations on programmability and interest rates.</p>



<p>According to the leaked document, the EU Commission&#8217;s fundamental goal is to make sure that everyone can use the digital euro, regardless of their socioeconomic level. In addition to highlighting the value of financial inclusion, the statement aspires to close the digital gap by granting everyone access to digital currency. The concept aims to provide a trustworthy and secure digital payment system that both individuals and companies can utilize.</p>



<p>But the leaked draught also clarifies that the EU Commission plans to restrict how the digital euro can be programmed. According to the document, the currency&#8217;s programmability would be limited to stop potential abuse and illegal acts. The goal is to balance innovation and regulatory monitoring, even though the precise details of these constraints have not yet been decided.</p>



<p>The leaked document also highlights an interesting development involving interest rates for the digital euro. It looks like the EU Commission is thinking about making interest in digital currency holdings illegal. This action is probably intended to avoid hoarding, discourage large-scale stockpiling of the digital euro, and encourage spending to boost the economy. Experts and economists are expected to disagree over the potential effects of the proposed interest rate restriction on the uptake and use of digital currency.</p>



<p>Smart contract proponents have expressed alarm at the leaked draught. According to the document, smart contracts may be de facto outlawed in the framework of the digital euro. Given that smart contracts might create complications and risks that call for meticulous regulation, this restriction is likely meant to safeguard the stability and integrity of the digital currency. However, critics claim that such a limitation would prevent the advancement and innovation of smart contract-based blockchain applications.</p>



<p>Even though the leaked draft provides valuable insights into the EU Commission&#8217;s plans for the digital euro, it is crucial to keep in mind that the document is not final and subject to parliamentary revisions. Before putting the plan in writing, the EU Commission will probably undertake more stakeholder meetings and consultations.</p>



<p>The EU Commission&#8217;s commitment to investigating and realizing the possibilities of central bank digital currencies is reflected in the leaked letter. The digital euro aspires to establish the European Union as a pioneer in the field of digital currencies while solving issues with accessibility, programmability, and interest rates as the world of finance continues to change. Although the future of the digital euro is still up in the air, this leaked memo provides an exciting look at potential developments for the European digital currency market.</p>

<li>Ethscriptions akin to BTC inscriptions are a new way for users to create non-fungible tokens on Ethereum.</li>



<li>Barely 48 hours after the launch, the project has recorded over 30,000 image NFTs with slight congestion on the blockchain. </li>



<li>Unlike BTC ordinals, the project has received widespread optimism among developers and users, although some feel it&#8217;s just a “<em>copycat.”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Ethereum developers have drawn inspiration from Bitcoin in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), an area of speciality for the decentralized blockchain giant.</p>



<p>A new protocol that offers users a new way to create NFTs hit Ethereum over the weekend with lots of buzzes over its possibilities. Developed by Tom Lehman, the co-founder of Genius.com, the project is <a href="https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/status/1670063380726423554?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">termed</a> Ethscriptions, coined like inscriptions in Bitcoin because of the shared similarities. </p>



<p>Ethscriptions allow for non-financial data to be written on the Ethereum network so far as it is under 96 kilobytes. It currently only allows for image-based NFTs, but developers say it will be expanded in the future. Lehman noted that Ethscriptions utilize “call data” which is data derived within a call to a smart contract making it cheaper and more decentralized than others. </p>



<p>“<em>It guarantees global uniqueness of the content of all valid Ethscriptions. it&#8217;s skating to where the puck is going in an L2 world,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>The launch has already sparked significant interest in major players in the Ethereum network. Within hours of its launch, over 10,000 inscriptions were recorded. The figure grew to over 30,000 over the weekend, with its debut project, “Ethereum Punks” being claimed in a few hours. </p>



<p>Lehman hailed the project as a success, claiming that its high adoption almost led to a temporary crash of the official Ethscription site. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-community-backs-innovation">Community backs innovation</h2>



<p>Modelled along the lines of Bitcoin Ordinals, the developers Ethscriptions hope to achieve the same results as the community moved in unison, at least for now. BTC Ordinals was launched with huge dissenting views, with many calling it an “<em>attack” </em>against the normal use of the network.</p>



<p>These views got louder when the blockchain was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-surging-transaction-fees-viewed-as-direct-attack-by-a-cross-section-of-the-community/">congested</a> due to the high inscription volume recorded in May. For Ethscriptions, most users focus on the positives calling for more innovation and adoption. Adam McBride, an NFT enthusiast, capped off the community’s sentiment with his views.</p>



<p>“<em>The exciting thing for me about Ethscriptions, similar to Ordinals, is that developers are playing around again with blockchain technology. It’s this experimentation that drives innovation and adoption,” </em>he stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, McBride also noted that technology has existed on the network for years with few artists deploying it, noting that this would be the first time it gets massive publicity.</p>

<ul>
<li>A new study shows that CBDCs could make retail payments cheaper and more efficient with the right technology.</li>



<li>The study carried out by the Bank of International Settlements and the Bank of England backs CBDCs for a digitized economy. </li>



<li>Despite the successful trial, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England insists that Britcoin is still “<em>some years away”</em>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The report from Project Rosalind shows that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are beneficial to a digitized economy, especially a two-tier CBDC model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bank Of England, alongside the Bank of International Settlements, embarked on a joint experiment in July 2022 to determine how an application programming interface (API) could be deployed in retail CBDC transactions. The report was <a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/othp69.pdf">released</a> on June 16 and states clearly that CBDCs make payments between individuals and businesses less expensive. </p>



<p>According to the report, a two-tier CBDC model will allow firms to create new financial products to reduce fraudulent activities. There are widely two systems for launching CBDCs: single-tier and double-tier. The Central Bank fully operates the single-tier model, while the two-tier model leverages financial institutions making it more decentralized.</p>



<p>The Central Bank provides core infrastructure, while private firms handle service providers through APIs. Project Rosalind explored how these APIs would improve the overall experience of the digital currency. An intriguing discovery in the report is the way the model would drive adoption with its numerous use cases, explore decentralization and create an interoperable model. </p>



<p>The study developed 33 API functionality with over 30 CBDC use cases, including its deployment on smartphones, vendors, and retail stores. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-britcoin-is-still-years-away"><strong>Britcoin is still years away </strong></h2>



<p>“<em>The Rosalind experiment has advanced central bank innovation in two key areas: by exploring how an API layer could support a retail CBDC system and how it could facilitate safe and secure CBDC payments through a range of different use cases,” </em>Francesca Road, Head of BIS London said in a statement. </p>



<p>With success recorded in Rosalind, many observers say that all roadblocks have been removed, paving the way for UK’s Central Bank’s Digital Currency, popularly called Britcoin. However, the deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Jon Cunliffe, had pushed the date further when he stated that the country’s launch of the currency “<em>is still years away.” </em></p>



<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-15/boe-s-cunliffe-says-decision-on-britcoin-cbdc-is-some-years-away">report</a>, Cunliffe, while addressing financial experts at Politico’s Global Tech Day that the possibility of a CBDC rollout stands at “<em>seven out of ten.” </em></p>

<li>Chainalysis EU policy head tells cryptocurrency firms to prepare for MiCA’s implementation to avoid regulatory setbacks.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Ripple lauds landmark crypto regulation as it plans its expansion in Europe and Asia amid US ambiguous policies.</li>



<li>EU leads the way: Crypto executives urge the United States to follow the steps of Europe and stop “<em>bottleneck regulation.”</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation has been passed by the European Union Parliament, but it will swing into effect in two phases next year.</p>



<p>Janet Ho, Chainalysis head of policy in Europe, has tasked digital asset companies to put their houses in order as they anticipate the implementation of MiCA. The regulation, which changes the entire scope and model of cryptocurrency regulation, will not be enforced until June 2024 for stablecoins and Dec 2024 for exchanges.</p>



<p>Address industry leads at a recent webinar; she warned firms and regulators not to become complacent while waiting for the deadline before making preparations. “<em>These are the preparations you want to start now – maybe even yesterday,” </em>she stated.</p>



<p>The need for haste comes with several obstacles firms may face from local regulators. According to her, it could take four to five months to obtain a MiCA license from local authorities if you factor in the timeframes for numerous stages of approvals or denials and re-application.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>If you want to continue your business, you need to take into account that 4-5 months, if not more,” </em>she added.</p>



<p>In applying for MiCA licenses, she told executives to see the immeasurable positives of registration rather than the task itself. A MiCA license will enable firms to drive into other European countries without new hurdles. “<em>Once you get one license, you can also scale up the business within the EU,” </em>she noted. Firms with this license will be seen as compliant worldwide because no such regulations exist, making it the gold standard. </p>



<p><em>“If you’ve got the MiCA license, you are complying, you’re being verified,”</em> she explained. <em>“There are no standardized rules in any other part of the world.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-europe-runs-away-with-the-torch"><strong>Europe runs away with the torch</strong></h2>



<p>For a larger part of the last decade, the United States led the way in web3 through new start-ups and technology, but those rosy years have been marred with regulatory uncertainty and countless lawsuits. In the last few years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has sued Ripple, Binance, Coinbase, and several other firms with no end in sight. </p>



<p>MiCA is touted as the first of its kind, placing EU nations in prime positions for new startups and established digital asset firms. Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, hailed MiCA as innovative for the entire crypto sector with expectations for a business-driven jurisdiction. Kadan Stadelmann, the CTO of Kodomo, added that other countries would have to play catch up with Europe after implementing the law.</p>



<p><em>“Other countries will probably choose a ‘wait and see’ approach before making their own regulations. Still, MiCA’s influence is clear; most nations will feel pressure to adopt some form of regulation to avoid getting left behind in a sector that has growing importance,” </em>he said.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The organizations behind Solana, Polygon, and Cardano have issued strong statements against being classified as securities by the SEC.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The prices of the three assets have plunged 30% since the lawsuit against Coinbase though slight growth is trickling in.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The community joins the organizations and executives to criticize the Commission&#8217;s trigger-happy stance against the market. </li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a new aggressive action against Binance and Coinbase earlier this month, leaving the market in the red zone with panic and tumbling asset prices.</p>



<p>After the SEC lawsuit against Coinbase, which listed several cryptocurrencies as securities, including Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), and Cardano (ADA), the organizations behind these projects are pushing back against the <em>“securities tag.” </em>These three assets rank highly among the other tokens listed in the lawsuit, with a combined market cap of $21 billion. </p>



<p>The Solana Foundation tweeted its position asserting that SOL is not a security according to the laws of the United States. The organization delved further to explain how regulatory clarity would fix the prolonged problem between the SEC and digital assets. </p>



<p>“<em>We welcome the continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve legal clarity on these issues for the thousands of entrepreneurs across the U.S. building in the digital assets space.”</em></p>



<p>Input Output Global, the association behind Cardano, also reiterated the same position as it claims ADA is not a security, adding that the lawsuit will not affect the operations of ADA in any way.</p>



<p>“<em>This latest filing from the SEC demonstrates that we still have a long way to go. Regulation through enforcement action does not provide either the clarity or certainty to which both the blockchain industry and consumers are entitled,” </em>IOG added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-mark-cuban-and-polygon-differ-from-the-rest"><strong>Mark Cuban and Polygon differ from the rest</strong></h2>



<p>Polygon, in its statement, did not directly state that MATIC is not a security but made an attempt to distance the asset from the United States market. According to the statement, Polygon was developed and deployed in foreign jurisdictions with a global presence.</p>



<p>They claimed that US-based investors were not targeted, a move which observers say they plan to use to argue against the legal jurisdiction of the SEC over the asset.</p>



<p>“<em>We are confident in the actions we took in the past. Given our focus on network security, we made sure MATIC was available to a wide group of persons, but only with actions that did not target the U.S. at any time,” </em>Polygon Labs added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Mark Cuban has noted that with the present state of things, firms can&#8217;t determine what constitutes securities calling for new regulations from Congress.</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset awareness surges across many regions, but several people fail to understand the true concept behind the terms.</li>



<li>Nigeria, Brazil, and South Korea lead the youthful drive of NFTs and Web3 despite recent perceived setbacks by authorities.</li>



<li>The majority of survey participants viewed blockchain and cryptocurrencies as the “<em>future of money”, </em>while few associated it with scams and money laundering.</li>
</ul>



<p>Web3 adoption around the world is growing across all age demographics, although many seem to be lost in the actual meaning of the world.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://consensys.io/insight-report/web3-and-crypto-global-survey-2023#05-crypto-awareness">survey</a> conducted by Ethereum software company, Consensys and YouGov shows an unprecedented rise in the growth of digital assets across all continents. The poll featured 15,000 participants who were quizzed on several areas, including their drive behind the technology, perspectives on the web3, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and regulation among others.</p>



<p>92% of participants acknowledged that they have little knowledge of digital assets, as expected, but only 8% knew the intricacies of web3. This shows a massive disparity between the industry’s analysis of web3 and the general public. Web3 seeks to push innovation to current web2 challenges tailored to giving users control over their content, data, and privacy.</p>



<p>Polled participants also showed a wider acceptance of the general description of crypto as the “<em>future of money</em>” and an “alternative to traditional finance.” Only 8% regarded virtual currencies to be mostly associated with fraudulent activities like money laundering. Among participating continents, Europeans viewed cryptos more negatively, especially related to gambling.</p>



<p>Although the majority of votes showed that people are not familiar with the technicalities behind NFTs, 41% voted for improved usage of the tokens in the future. While 76% of Uk participants have never owned NFTs, Vietnam posted more adoption, with only 26% not owning NFTs. As a store of value, 56% of Argentinians were driven to own assets as a result of an unstable local currency. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-nigeria-and-south-korea-lead-adoption-drive"><strong>Nigeria and South Korea Lead Adoption Drive</strong></h2>



<p>According to the report, participants in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/nigerias-new-crypto-tax-policy-could-set-the-tone-for-africas-positive-web3-relationship/">Nigeria</a> recorded a 78% understanding of general digital asset knowledge and awareness of its potential. This was followed by South Korea with 63% while <a href="https://zycrypto.com/1600-pick-n-pay-stores-set-to-pioneer-mainstream-bitcoin-payments-in-south-africa/">South Africa</a> and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-takes-the-spotlight-as-brazil-and-argentina-mulls-creating-a-common-currency/">Brazil</a> recorded 61% and 59% respectively. On NFT awareness and usage, 56% of Americans who participated said they were either very or fairly familiar with the concept. </p>



<p>Generally, over 50% of participants in Nigeria, India, and the United States knew the details of web3, NFTs, and regulations. Another salient point the survey covered was data privacy, a major flaw of web2. Over 67% believe that users should be in total control of the internet, while 79% feel that their data is best in their hands without any third party. While participants from countries with strong data privacy laws did not collectively vote for a change in the status quo, countries without those laws, like Latin American and African countries, did. </p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-saylor-envisions-250k-btc-price-following-bitcoins-soaring-dominance/">MicroStrategy</a> has purchased another 12,333 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 152,333 BTC — worth $4.6 billion at the current market prices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An Extra 12,333 BTC</strong></h2>



<p>Enterprise software solution company MicroStrategy keeps adding to its Bitcoin bet.</p>



<p>A Wednesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates that the firm had purchased an additional 12,333 bitcoins for roughly $347 million at an average price of $28,136 per coin. The purchase was made in cash between April 29 and June 27.</p>



<p>The recent purchase brings MicroStrategy’s holdings to around 152,333 Bitcoin, with the firm’s average cost basis sitting at $29,668.</p>



<p>The BTC acquisition was partially funded with the issuance of new stock, as the company noted:</p>



<p>&#8220;On May 1, 2023, MicroStrategy entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC and Canaccord Genuity LLC, as sales agents, pursuant to which MicroStrategy may issue and sell shares of its class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (&#8220;Shares&#8221;), having an aggregate offering price of up to $625.0 million from time to time through the Agents.&#8221;</p>



<p>MicroStrategy has issued and sold a total of 1,079,170 shares as of June 28 under the agreement for total net proceeds of $337 million.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-microstrategy-s-michael-saylor-is-bitcoin-s-biggest-advocate"><strong>MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Is Bitcoin’s Biggest Advocate</strong></h2>



<p>MicroStrategy is the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bullish-stance-on-bitcoin-stronger-than-ever-as-firm-post-q1-2023-profits/">world’s biggest corporate Bitcoin holder</a>, and its now executive chairman Michael Saylor, who stepped down as CEO in August 2022, has become known for his ardent belief in the asset. The company started purchasing the preeminent crypto in August 2020; Saylor said at the time that the reason was a hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>Needless to say, MicroStrategy’s strategy on Bitcoin seems to be paying off despite the top crypto having slumped from its historic high of $69,044.17 set in November 2021. The publicly-traded company’s stock, which trades under the ticker symbol MSTR on the Nasdaq, is up over 160% since its first BTC purchase in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Saylor recently revealed that MicroStrategy integrated Bitcoin Lightning into his corporate email address.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin-savvy firm is also working on an “enterprise Lightning solution” to help corporations move funds fast. The Lightning Network is a layer-2 payment protocol built atop Bitcoin’s blockchain that permits off-chain transactions, increasing payment throughput and reducing transaction fees.</p>

<p>So far, the SEC has rejected every spot market bitcoin ETF put before it, basically because it believes the bitcoin market can be easily manipulated.</p>



<p>But according to Bloomberg’s senior ETF strategist Eric Balchunas, BlackRock actually has a 50% chance of getting its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund greenlit by the securities agency. This is because Grayscale is more likely to win its lawsuit against the SEC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-first-ever-spot-bitcoin-etf"><strong>The First-Ever Spot Bitcoin ETF?</strong></h2>



<p>$9.5 trillion asset manager BlackRock recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">sought permission</a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to list a spot bitcoin ETF, giving its clients indirect exposure to the flagship cryptocurrency. The main reason behind the hype is mostly related to the investment giant’s ETF application approval rates. Notably, BlackRock boasts a 575-1 record when it comes to its ETF applications.</p>



<p>Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas gives BlackRock’s spot BTC approval chance of 50%. Balchunas’s forecast follows an observation made by the senior legal analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, Elliott Stein, who believes the chances of Grayscale defeating the SEC in the ongoing lawsuit are at 70%.</p>



<p>Balchunas noted that the SEC might give BlackRock’s ETF filing the go-ahead as a way to “save face” by authorizing an ETF from a “trusted ‘adult&#8217; TradFi” company instead of Grayscale. This means that this may be the first spot bitcoin ETF out the door.</p>



<p>As you might recall, Grayscale <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">launched a legal challenge</a> after the SEC rejected its application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) spot into a Bitcoin ETF. On March 7, a panel of judges heard oral arguments of the two sides in the suit. According to Stein, Grayscale’s chances of emerging victorious in the lawsuit increased from 40% to 70% because “all three judges on the panel appeared to side with Grayscale” based on their “lines of questioning”.</p>



<p>“The SEC and chair Gary Gensler may be bracing for a loss and looking to preemptively soften it or make it meaningless by approving a spot Bitcoin ETF application before or around the same time as the court decision,” Stein added.</p>



<p>Although the lengthy and extenuating legal war with the SEC seems endless, BlackRock’s impeccable track record for ETF applications injected a breath of fresh air into GBTC&#8217;s share price, which currently trades at $19.18, as per <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GBTC:OTCMKTS"><em>Google Finance</em></a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC’s Spot ETF Kill Streak</strong></h2>



<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, known for having lectured a Bitcoin and Blockchain course at MIT, has been a staunch adversary of the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Numerous investment managers have filed for spot crypto ETFs in the past, and have been shot down by the SEC, one after another. Many of these firms are now reapplying for ETFs, hoping that Blackrock’s filing will pave the way for a more friendly SEC.</p>



<p>New York-based asset management firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">WisdomTree is seeking approval</a> from the SEC to list its “WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust” for a third time. A few hours after the WisdomTree filing, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-shoots-up-with-30000-in-sight-following-fresh-wave-of-spot-etf-applications/">Invesco</a>, another major investment company with as much as $1.49 trillion under its management as of May 2023, “reactivated” its application for a similar investment vehicle, followed by a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">request </a>from Valkyrie Investments on June 21.</p>



<p>If the SEC ultimately greenlights the applications from these asset managers and the likes of Fidelity Investments, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, BNY Mellon, and Bank of America seeking to offer similar services to investors, the crypto market would be opened up to companies with a <a href="https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1673362112653975554">combined $27 trillion </a>in assets under management.</p>
