					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin and the broader crypto market rapidly reversed course in response to the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s announcement of a 50-basis-point increase in interest rates, erasing any gains made before the disclosure. The Federal Reserve has been steadily raising interest rates in an effort to ease the economy and rein in inflation, which has driven prices of basic commodities to record highs. Yesterday, Bitcoin&#8217;s price reached a one-month high and had a brief recovery of positive momentum, but a conservative report from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and remarks from Fed chair Jerome Powell drove BTC to an intraday low of $17,659.

Prior to Powell&#8217;s announcement, the key indexes were in the green zone; however, they plunged into the red zone afterwards. At the close of trading, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&#38;P were all in painted in crimson. Powell told members of the press on Wednesday afternoon that &#8220;we have more work to do&#8221; and that &#8220;inflation risks are on the upside.&#8221; Coingecko statistics indicates at the time of writing that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) values have fallen by more than 2.7% in the last hour and are presently trading at $17,717 and $1,292 apiece. In the past 24 hours, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies declined 1.42 percent to $857.98 billion, representing a decline of $85.72 billion. The overall crypto market volume during this timeframe has decreased by 14.40%, reaching $45.67 billion, based on latest data. BTC total market cap at $341 billion.

Tron price is trading in a positive zone well above the $0.0520 pivot level against the US dollar. The price is showing positive signs above $0.055 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $0.0530 on the 4-hours chart of the TRX/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair is likely to start a fresh increase above the $0.0562 and $0.0575 resistance levels. Tron Price Jumps 5% In the past few days, tron price remained strong above the $0.0520 level against the US Dollar, outperforming bitcoin and ethereum.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum jumped and tested the $1,350 resistance against the US Dollar. ETH corrected lower, but the bulls are active near the $1,280 support. Ethereum was able to clear the $1,300 and $1,320 resistance levels. The price is now trading near $1,290 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,285 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless there is a clear move below the $1,280 support. Ethereum Price Tops Near $1,350 Ethereum price gained pace for a steady move above the $1,300 resistance zone. ETH even surpassed the $1,320 level and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. However, the bears were active near the $1,350 zone. There were two attempts to clear the $1,350 resistance, but the bulls failed. As a result, there was a bearish reaction from $1,350, similar to bitcoin. Ether price declined below the $1,320 and $1,300 levels. There was a clear move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,240 swing low to $1,350 swing high. The price is now trading near $1,290 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,285on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair seems to be stable above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,240 swing low to $1,350 swing high. Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com An immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,300 level. The first major resistance is near the $1,318 and $1,320 levels. A close above the $1,320 resistance might start a fresh increase. The next major resistance could be $1,350. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1,400 resistance zone. More Losses in ETH? If ethereum fails to climb above the $1,320 resistance, it could continue to move down. An initial support on the downside is near the $1,285 level and the trend line. The next major support is near the $1,280 level, below which the price could gain bearish momentum towards the $1,240 support. Any more losses could lead the price towards the $1,200 support.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price climbed higher towards $18,400 before there was a bearish reaction. BTC is now trading near a major support at $17,550 and might bounce back. Bitcoin broke the $18,000 resistance zone before there was a downside correction. The price is trading above $17,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $17,580 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase unless it trades below the 100 hourly SMA. Bitcoin Price Remains Supported Bitcoin price extended its increase above the $17,800 resistance zone. BTC even climbed above the $18,000 resistance zone and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. The price traded as high as $18,387 before there was a bearish reaction. The Fed increased interest rates by 0.5%, sparking sharp moves in the market. BTC price reacted the downside and traded below the $18,000 support zone. There was a clear move below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $16,880 low to $18,387 high.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum saw an increase in its price on Tuesday along with the rest of the crypto market following the positive CPI data release. The jump in price saw Ethereum finally beat the $1,300 price point after hovering around $1,200 coming out of the weekend. However, the digital asset had met significant resistance at the $1,350 price level, which could end up being a bearish development for the cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Aim Big After Recent Breakout Above $1,300 Ethereum Trades Are Wary Currently, Ethereum traders are still very on edge regarding the cryptocurrency. Even the Tuesday recovery has not done much to actually instill faith in buyers, especially given the Fed’s announcement that is expected to happen on Wednesday. Expectations remain narrow because even though inflation saw a slowdown, it still remains high at 7.1%. Given this, traders are still being conservative in their positions and are not placing too much emphasis on ETH at this time. This is expected to continue through much of the midweek trading day until Powell’s announcement is live. There are also expectations to follow depending on what stance the Fed takes this time around. Over the last couple of months, the Fed had been hawkish due to the rising inflation in the country. But given that inflation had actually come out lower this time around, it could see the Fed soften its stance. If not, then a continuous hawkish stance from the Fed would no doubt see a retracement in the crypto market, which could see Ethereum lose all of its gains from Tuesday. Binance FUD Affects ETH Over the last couple of days, the Binance crypto exchange had been the target to crypto users’ ire as questions about its reserves were raised. As a result, there was massive withdrawals from the exchange, with Binance Ethereum withdrawals accounting for the majority of ETH withdrawals from centralized exchanges over the past week. As it is now, there are still rumors that the exchange may be insolvent and some are beginning to prepare for another FTX-level event if Binance were to fall.  Naturally, this has led to caution among investors who expect a downtrend if such a thing were to happen.

					<description><![CDATA[Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, has been the target of massive FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt, for the uninitiated) over the last couple of days. After FTX collapsed, users in the space began to question if exchanges actually held enough in their reserves to honor all customers. Given what happened to FTX, is it possible for Binance to come out of this unscathed? Related Reading: Why Goldman Sachs Expects This Asset Class To Outperform Bitcoin Binance Withdrawals Intensify As the FUD spread across social media platforms, Binance users had taken to withdrawing their deposits from the exchange en masse. Data aggregator platform reported on Tuesday that Binance’s withdrawals had crossed $1.9 billion, and by the end of the day, reports were that the withdrawals were eventually higher than $3 billion in a single day. According to the data released, the withdrawals were one of the highest single-day volume for the crypto exchange, which understandably had users at the edge of their seats. However, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao had come out to quell fears, explaining that it was nowhere near the highest single-day withdrawals the exchange had processed. Zhao explained that Binance had seen higher volumes when the LUNA cryptocurrency had collapsed, as well as during the FTX implosion. Most of the FUD had stemmed from the ‘audit’ report from Mazars which had drawn criticism from some experts in the industry. The multiple tweets saying that the Mazars report did not qualify as an audit had gained traction, leading to the current situation. Can The Crypto Exchange Survive? So far, Binance has been able to wade through the enormous FUD without much of a problem. Reports on social media say that despite the large withdrawal volumes, the crypto exchange continues to honor all of them in a timely manner. Also, data on Nansen show that deposits into the crypto exchange has been high during this time, offsetting the outflows to a significant degree. This tweet retweeted by “CZ” includes a screenshot of Nansen’s dashboard that showed Binance inflows were almost as high as outflows, resulting in negative net flows of only $378 million for the 24-hour period. CEO Zhao has referred to the current FUD as a “stress test” that “helps to build the credibility for exchanges that passes the test.” Haters: Omg omg!! #binance saw over 6 bn in withdrawals yesterday!!But these fudders did not tell that it got more deposits (6.56B) than withdrawals.

					<description><![CDATA[Toncoin (TON) is currently outperforming all other cryptocurrencies in the top 100 by market capitalization on a weekly basis. With a price increase of around 50% within the last seven days, the token is the undisputed leader, followed by Stacks (+16%) and Bitcoin SV (+14%). Over the last 24 hours, Toncoin is writing a whopping 21% gain. While it was trading at $1.86 on Sunday, the cryptocurrency was trading for $2.86 at press time. In the last 24 hours alone, the trading volume has skyrocketed 83%, to $95.4 million. On the daily chart, TON is thus approaching its all-time high of $3.26. A Reason For The Skyrocketing Price Of Toncoin The reason for the recent pump of the Toncoin could be a feature of Telegram, which was announced last week. Pavel Durov himself, the founder and head of the popular messenger, introduced a feature for Telegram that allows users to buy an anonymous phone number with the token and create an account with it. Related Reading: VanEck’s Bitcoin Prediction Stands At $10K-$12K By Q1 2023 On December 07, the Telegram Messenger team launched the sale of virtual numbers with the +888 prefix, which exist as collectible on the The Open Network blockchain. Users can log in to the Fragment platform with the TON blockchain-backed anonymous numbers and enjoy &#8220;ultimate privacy.&#8221; Fragment is a decentralized auction platform founded by Durov. It sells the anonymous numbers compatible only with Telegram. Purchases are transacted on the platform using The Open Network Telegram token.

In addition, purchased numbers can be stored in a regular Toncoin wallet, transferred to other users, and offered for sale on marketplaces, just like any other NFT on the The Open Network blockchain. +888 8 888 Is The Most Popular Telegram Number Some numbers are so popular that they are auctioned on Fragment for over $100,000. The most popular number is +888 8 888, for which 38,290 TON, the equivalent of about $103,000, are currently being bid. The auction runs for a little more than six days. The Open Network is the brainchild of the Telegram development team, which was forced to abandon the blockchain solution due to pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June 2020. The SEC forced Telegram to pay $1.2 billion in raised funds back to investors and pay an $18.5 million fine to settle the SEC charges. Since then, the TON ecosystem has evolved as a standalone ecosystem and regularly integrates innovations into the Telegram messenger.]]></description>
