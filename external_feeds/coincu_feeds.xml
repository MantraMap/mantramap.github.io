<p>The Open Campus Protocol is a decentralized solution for educators, content creators, parents, students, and co-publishers designed to address today&#8217;s significant educational challenges. Despite educators&#8217; important role in shaping future generations, they often need to be more valued and paid. In addition, parents often need more control over the educational content of their children.</p>



<p>The Open Campus Protocol is a community-driven effort to use blockchain technology to improve the educational system. The Open Campus Protocol gives educators additional chances to make money and get acknowledged for their actions while enabling students to access more varied educational information by decentralizing the development and distribution of educational content. The Open Campus Protocol aims to alter the $5 trillion education sector by giving educators and students back control.</p>



<p>The Open Campus Protocol allows them to produce, develop, and distribute valuable educational materials that not only cater to the various requirements of students but also support the ecosystem&#8217;s ongoing evolution and progress. Innovation, creativity, and information exchange are praised and fostered in this rich atmosphere, generating a more promising future for education.</p>

<ul>
<li>Content Creator</li>



<li>Co-Publisher</li>



<li>Educational platform</li>
</ul>



<p>The Content Creator will create the course and then encode the content in NFT over the Open Campus protocol. They will then sell these NFTs on the Open Campus Exchange Market. The buyers of the NFT are called Co-Publishers, who will have a marketing role for Content Creator&#8217;s courses. These courses will be uploaded to Education Platforms for release to learners, revenue from course sales will be shared with Content Creator, Co-Publisher, and Education Platform based on their contributions.</p>

<p>Web3 refers to the next large-scale development of the internet, based on blockchains and capable of giving people more control over their data. Visa claims to have been working on goods for this market for some time.</p>



<p>According to Cuy Sheffield, Visa&#8217;s Head of Crypto, the company is:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Particularly interested in [software engineers with] experience using Github Copilot and other AI assisted engineering tools to write and debug smart contracts.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Employees can plan to be in the office two to three days per week for the London-based assignments. </p>



<p>Last year, the company also filed fresh trademark applications that hinted at future ambitions for a crypto wallet and a metaverse product.</p>



<p>The job listings came in the wake of industry layoffs, including those at MoonPay, Disney, GSR, and Coinbase. Visa looked to reduce its crypto activities following the collapse of the exchange and crypto brand FTX in November. The company had planned to launch crypto debit cards in 40 additional countries as part of a long-term worldwide relationship with FTX, but the project was halted when FTX went bankrupt.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>California has drafted a bill to provide a regulatory framework for making the DAO an acceptable business entity.</em></li>



<li><em>Council Bill 1229 would change California&#8217;s corporate code to include DAOs, blockchain networks, and smart contract agreements.</em></li>



<li><em>If passed, DAOs would be registered and taxed and would provide better protections for Californians to participate in the Web3 economy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Decrypt, Congressman Matt Haney of San Francisco, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156423-california-regulator-alerts-of-17-allegedly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California</a>, has drafted a bill to provide a regulatory framework for making the DAO an acceptable business entity.</strong></h5>

<p>An organizational form known as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) distributes power among its members. Decentralized decision-making is made possible through the DAO&#8217;s usage of blockchain smart contracts, governance tokens, and voting participants.</p>



<p>A regulatory framework for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) could be coming to California. San Francisco Councilmember Matt Haney introduced Council Bill 1229 on Monday, which already has support from prominent crypto investment firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and the Cryptocurrency Innovation Council death.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have long been supportive of reasonable regulation that puts guardrails in place while giving innovators the certainty they need to keep building, which is exactly what this legislation does,&#8221; Miles Jennings, General Counsel at a16z crypto, told Decrypt.</p>



<p>DAOs, blockchain networks, and smart contract agreements would all be included in Council Bill 1229, which would amend California&#8217;s corporation code. If approved, the proposal will enhance Californians&#8217; participation in the Web3 economy while allowing DAOs to register and pay taxes in the state.</p>



<p>According to the spokesperson, the new bill aims to educate its colleagues on the basics of blockchain, California corporations, and the operation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).</p>



<p>The introduction of the law coincides with the launch of cryptocurrency regulators&#8217; and governments&#8217; official websites throughout the globe. The collapse of FTX in November led to a crypto crackdown in the US, which was coordinated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Additionally, state officials have increased their monitoring of bitcoin initiatives.</p>

<p>Another Rug pull or exit scam hit the market on April 24, 2023, when Ordinals Finance pulled out of the market. Ordinals Finance is introduced as an Ethereum (ETH) based DeFi protocol that allows lending and borrowing lines.</p>



<p>According to the data, the deployer withdraws OFI tokens from the OEBStaking contract, exchanges them for ETH, and transfers them to the EOA address (0x34e…25cCF), thereby transferring 550 ETH (approximately $1 million) to Tornado Cash. All social media accounts and the project website have been deleted. ETH address: 0x419E35E3515c2fDB652C898bF7A0B21FB20497dC</p>

<p>Scam projects are still popping up a lot in the market thanks to the heat and rapid growth of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (Defi). Many investors fall into sophisticated traps that have been set up despite many warnings. The implementers can manipulate investors after amassing large amounts of money. This can be considered as the order of events with Ordinals Finance.</p>

<p>The lawsuit will force the SEC to answer yes or no to Coinbase&#8217;s July 2022 petition asking the SEC to use its official rule-making process to provide guidance to the crypto industry. A rule-making process exists so that agencies can develop regulations with the benefit of public input and have their positions examined through judicial review. More than 1,700 organizations and individuals have submitted comments to the Coinbase petition, echoing the explicit request.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Last week, digital asset investment funds had net withdrawals for the first time in six weeks, totaling $30.4 million.</em></li>



<li><em>Outflows started on April 14, just as Bitcoin reached $30,000, implying that the most recent sell-off resulted from profit-taking.</em></li>



<li><em>Ether received $17 million in inflows, indicating investor confidence after the Shanghai network improvement.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin outflows of $53.1 million <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-128-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-827534831424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped</a> end a six-week streak of inflows into digital asset investment products.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the CoinShares weekly report, digital asset investment products had a net outflow of $30.4 million last week, capping a six-week streak of inflows.</p>



<p>Outflows started on April 14, coinciding with <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183349-bitcoin-accepted-at-the-grand-bazaar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> surpassing $30,000 for the first time in over a year, implying that the current sell-off was the result of profit-taking, CoinShares reported. Overall outflows for the week as the price of BTC declined by nearly 10%.</p>



<p>There was a net outflow of $53.1 million in Bitcoin investment products, a net inflow of $16.8 million in Ethereum investment products, and a net inflow of $1.5 million in short-selling Bitcoin investment products.</p>



<p>Apart from the main two cryptocurrencies, Polygon received another $1 million in inflows this week.</p>



<p>In the preceding four weeks, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency by market size has received $310 million in inflows.</p>



<p>BTC&#8217;s price has lately steadied over $27,000, but it faces stiff resistance above $28,350.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1650407496962523137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent research</a> by Michael van de Poppe, BTC&#8217;s value has the ability to rise if it successfully breaks beyond the $27,800-$28,000 region.</p>



<p>If this happens, BTC may possibly reach $29,200. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s upward momentum, however, is dependent on whether it can maintain the breakthrough over the barrier level.</p>

<p>Traders, however, emphasized that BTC remained optimistic, anticipating a possible copycat move of price action from February when BTC/USD burst higher following a period of consolidation. Nevertheless, a new study <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-17-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that hodlers were split on whether to sell into strength, even during BTC&#8217;s run above $31,000.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230417005765/en/Teahouse-Finance-Raises-5-Million-to-Further-DeFi-Wealth-Management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a>, Teahouse Finance secured $5 million in its most recent investment round to address DeFi&#8217;s concentrated liquidity issue.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="341" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1024x341.png" alt="Teahouse Finance Raises $5 Million To Solve Centralized Liquidity Problem" class="wp-image-183648" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1024x341.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-300x100.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-768x256.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1536x512.png 1536w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-2048x683.png 2048w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-750x250.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1744-1140x380.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Teahouse Finance Raises $5 Million To Solve Centralized Liquidity Problem 30"></a></figure></div>


<p>Teahouse Finance was founded in 2021 to address the tough, concentrated liquidity provision dilemma. In basic words, the concentrated liquidity issue arises when liquidity providers are permitted to choose a certain price range for providing liquidity in order to be more purposeful and strategic in how they supply liquidity.</p>



<p>This capability was brought to the DeFi world with the March 2021 release of Uniswap V3. Teahouse Finance was aware of the possible issue with concentrated liquidity early on and intended to be the first to overcome the complex challenge.</p>



<p>Teahouse smart contracts employ dynamic algorithms to handle customers&#8217; assets on their behalf, similar to an investment portfolio, with the bonus that users may enter/exit on a weekly basis.</p>



<p>Techniques use a variety of inputs, including market volatility, to dynamically alter liquidity pool ranges and hedge positions in order to maximize trading fees while limiting temporary loss.</p>



<p>In addition to liquidity, the company has created seven DeFi strategy vaults across several chains to assist people and companies in conveniently investing and becoming more lucrative on Web3. Initially restricted to Teahouse NFT holders, the company released its first publicly available liquidity provision strategy in January of this year, with an average APR of 54.37%.</p>



<p>Teahouse co-founder and CEO Fenix Hsu stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“With the recent collapse of trust in CEXes due to underhanded dealings by ex-industry-leaders like FTX, it is now more critical than ever to provide secure and transparent investment options that reside on-chain. We continue to focus on solving the hardest challenges, educating the community, and building an awesome ecosystem with our partners.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to its primary goal of democratizing DeFi via initiatives like Perpetual Protocol and Chainlink, Teahouse Finance plans to launch its enterprise-ready B2B offering, Teahouse Private Vaults, in Q2.</p>



<p>These unique vaults, with specific smart contracts for each investment, are managed by Safe&#8217;s multi-sig wallets, gated by NFTs, and safeguarded by action filters that allow only certain transactions to occur. Teahouse Private Vaults are intended for Web3 projects searching for a secure location to HODL or keep their assets and conventional enterprises interested in diversifying into cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Teahouse employs off-chain algorithms that communicate with the main TeaVault through smart contracts. The TeaVault, constructed on modular vaults dubbed &#8220;atomic vaults&#8221; that communicate with distinct DeFi protocols, holds the user assets on-chain.</p>



<p>According to the project team, the $5 million will be spent on numerous vault products now under development.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s DeFi interaction filters protect all transactions made possible by these vaults, and only those pre-approved are carried out automatically by smart contracts. These interactions are managed by the HighTableVault, which also handles network fees and incentive payments.</p>

<p>According to the latest court order, a consultant will evaluate keystroke logs and screenshots from Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried&#8217;s mobile phones at least thrice weekly.</p>



<p>The additional phone limits come after attorneys struggled to enforce an earlier court order related to a bail issue involving Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>Attorneys for FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried are <a href="https://news.coincu.com/182698-bankman-frieds-attorneys-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to satisfy bail requirements</a>, including one that requires phones used by Bankman-Fried&#8217;s parents to capture images of the user every five minutes.</p>



<p>The difficulties in satisfying Bankman-bail Fried&#8217;s requirements were detailed in a letter submitted to the court on April 19. The letter also said that the defense team has looked into other ways to lock the parents&#8217; mobile phones in a manner that conforms with the bail requirements without going into specifics.</p>



<p>On Saturday, Judge Lewis Kaplan authorized a motion to put monitoring software on the phones of Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, which would keep a tight eye on their internet surfing, applications, and texts.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We believe these restrictions are sufficient to prevent Mr. Bankman-Fried from using the Parents’ Phones to circumvent his bail conditions,&#8221; Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys wrote to the court in a letter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As part of his new bail conditions, Bankman-Fried recently exchanged his smartphone for one that can&#8217;t connect to the internet and his laptop computer for one that has monitoring software and limits his internet usage.</p>



<p>The former FTX CEO has pled not guilty to criminal allegations stemming from his involvement with the now-defunct crypto exchange and its sister crypto trading company, Alameda Research. He is scheduled to stand trial in October.</p>

<p>As local administrations warm up to the electronic money known as the e-CNY, a city in eastern China&#8217;s Jiangsu province aims to utilize the mainland&#8217;s sovereign digital currency in cross-border commerce with Belt and Road nations.</p>



<p>Xuzhou, the starting point for many Chinese freight trains destined for Europe, has released a strategy to promote the e-CNY, including its use in cross-border commerce. The city has 18 frequent cross-border train links to 21 European and Asian nations.</p>



<p>One of the first CBDCs to be designed and extensively tested was the digital yuan, often known as digital RMB. Although no formal launch has occurred, the government has widened its testing parameters to cover numerous cities and millions of individuals.</p>



<p>The e-CNY may be used to &#8220;better support the Belt and Road Initiative,&#8221; according to the Xuzhou local administration, alluding to Beijing&#8217;s trade and investment drive. Originally, e-CNY will be used to pay for services and storage fees for products transported by rail. According to the idea, the e-CNY will also be utilized to pay taxes and utility services in Xuzhou in the future.</p>

<p>Jiangsu province, in particular, has taken an aggressive approach to developing digital yuan use cases. Changshu, another city in the province, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/183570-digital-yuan-used-to-pay-servants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that it would pay civil officials and employees of government agencies using digital yuan.</p>



<p>Trials have already begun. Shenzhen, a nearby city, started giving retail discounts to Hong Kong visitors who pay with e-CNY in February. In December, the Bank of China offered cash rewards to registered clients who utilized digital yuan.</p>
