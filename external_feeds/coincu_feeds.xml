<p>Highstreet&nbsp;(HIGH) is an MMORPG game that blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual worlds. All the in-game items are represented on the platform as&nbsp;ERC-721&nbsp;non-fungible tokens&nbsp;(NFTs) divided into two fractions. While purchasing the digital fraction <strong>allows players to use the thing within the metaverse, buying the NFT will enable gamers to receive the item in real life.</strong></p>



<p>With that, the price of the Metaverse Highstreet project <strong>HIGH Token has increased by almost 170% in 24 hours, and the current price is $3.49</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>HIGH Token&nbsp;(Highstreet) is a native token</strong> of a&nbsp;decentralized&nbsp;commerce-centric&nbsp;<strong>play-to-earn&nbsp;metaverse built with virtual reality (VR) support</strong>. Apart from realizing a two-way currency flow within physical and virtual worlds,&nbsp;Highstreet&nbsp;(HIGH) introduces a market where in-game items can be redeemed for real-life products. During gameplay, users can explore the metaverse, fight monsters, and complete quests while acquiring goods that have both digital and real-world utility.</p>



<p>According to information on the project&#8217;s official website, <strong>Highstreet completed a $5 million funding in August 2021</strong>, with participation from Binance Labs, Shima Capital, Animoca Brands, and others.</p>

<p>The project sponsor, Binance, yesterday also made a statement regarding the development of Metaverse projects. Specifically, Binance CEO CZ stated in the latest Binance AMA that if Binance builds a metaverse, it will undoubtedly be backed by BNB, but since Binance (yet) is not a game builder. Without a game-building team, CZ wants to invest in other VR or metaverse games.</p>

<p><strong>SkyPeople</strong> plans not to appeal in the lawsuit for canceling the refusal of the rating for <strong>Five Stars for Clayton</strong>. Previously, <strong>SkyPeople</strong> lost the first trial judgment held at the <strong>Seoul Administrative Court </strong>on <strong>January 13</strong>. The<strong> Game Management Committee</strong> refused to classify<a href="https://news.coincu.com/161041-korea-banned-p2e-games-five-stars-rejected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Five Stars</a> for speculative reasons in 2021, and SkyPeople filed an administrative lawsuit against the <strong>Game Committee</strong> in <strong>July 2021.</strong></p>



<p>The reason <strong>SkyPeople</strong> made this decision was that it judged that there was little possibility of official service of P2E games under the current <strong>Game Industry Promotion Act. </strong></p>



<p>The current law prohibits game operators from promoting speculative behavior by providing prizes, etc., but the first trial judge viewed NFT items in Five Stars as prizes. This is because item ownership is permanently vested in the user and is freely traded through an exchange outside the game. <strong>SkyPeople</strong> argued that it could not be regarded as a gift, but the court judged differently.</p>



<p>The results of the first trial judgment on <strong>Natris</strong>, another P2E game lawsuit to be held on<strong> January 31</strong>, are expected to be similar. Natris also filed an administrative lawsuit against the Game Board for canceling the rating of <strong>Infinite Breakthrough: Three Kingdoms Reverse</strong>.</p>

<p>It is an observation that it is highly likely to see it as a prize because it pays out <strong>Mudolcoin</strong>, a cryptocurrency that can be exchanged at the exchange during the gameplay process. Unless the current game law is revised, it is expected that it will be virtually difficult to service P2E games normally in <a href="https://news.coincu.com/162920-south-korea-will-implement-crypto-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Korea</a>.</p>



<p>In contrast, domestic P2E games in global service are producing results. According to <strong>Sensor Tower,</strong> a mobile app data analysis company, among P2E games last year, Netmarble&#8217;s<strong> Second Country: Cross World </strong>ranked first in global sales combined with Google Play and Apple&#8217;s App Store, and WeMade&#8217;s <strong>Mir 4 </strong>ranked second. </p>

<p>Most of the domestic game companies servicing P2E games are developing the business only overseas, and the two games also introduced it only in the global version. In terms of profits earned in regions other than Korea, the second country and <strong>Mir 4</strong> kept first and second place.</p>

<p>On-chain games for developers use a novel technique by concentrating on strategy games in which participants program their plans using smart contracts. To succeed in <strong>0xMonaco</strong> and similar games in the future, players will need strong technical aptitude, originality, and agility. Through video simulations that show the exact code logic used throughout the round, <strong>MatchBoxDAO</strong> claimed to provide developers with a pleasurable experience and amuse spectators.</p>

<p>Developers participated in a <strong>Mario Kart-style racing game</strong> that rewarded technological prowess and used smart contracts for the vehicles on each team.</p>



<p>While it&#8217;s becoming more common for <strong>Web3</strong> <strong>games</strong> to merely have their assets on-chain and not the actual gameplay, <strong>0xMonaco</strong> is a completely on-chain game.</p>



<p>In order to effectively use resources for accelerating, shooting shells, super shells, or purchasing a shield, each of which costs coins, teams must develop a plan for each car before the race. <strong>17,500 coins </strong>are given to each player at the start of the game.</p>



<p>Game developers are increasingly moving beyond play-to-earn and concentrating more on the gameplay side of their platforms as a result of the Web3 ecosystem&#8217;s continued influence and evolution on the gaming scene.</p>

<p>On August 22, 2022, Ghana&#8217;s central bank introduced the sandbox, which was built in conjunction with Emetech Solutions Inc. The bank described the introduction of the sandbox as evidence of <strong>its commitment to creating an enabling environment for innovation to promote financial inclusion and enable Ghana&#8217;s digitalization and cash-lite agenda.</strong></p>



<p>Meanwhile, the BOG&#8217;s Nigerian equivalent, the Central Bank of Nigeria, recently announced the launch of its own regulatory sandbox. Innovators interested in participating in the regulatory sandbox to explore novel applications of technology and innovation on behalf of our customers and stakeholders can now submit <strong>expressions of interest.</strong></p>

<p>Although perpetual futures are the most widely used crypto primitive, the following issues have not yet been addressed by current exchanges:</p>



<ul>
<li>High obstacles to listing on the market. Because their procedures can&#8217;t adjust to difficult market situations, current exchanges are hesitant to list long-tail markets. As a result, there is no fresh exposure to long-tail assets, and the same markets are continually included in DEXs.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Insufficient risk management. Multiple protocols were shut down, and DeFi lost millions of dollars in 2022 alone as a result of market manipulation and oracle assaults.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Risk/returns for liquidity providers are unclear (LPs). LPs are subject to a variety of risks, including adverse selection and bankruptcy. Exchanges try to make up for this by charging large trading commissions.</li>
</ul>



<p>Vest Exchange hopes to solve the problems of high listing threshold, lack of risk management, and unclear risk/reward of LP. The exchange will soon announce a testnet.</p>

<p>Vest is a risk-first, non-custodial protocol that empowers users to trade <em>perpetual</em> futures on almost any asset. It unlocks new illiquid markets quicker than any other centralized or decentralized exchange by combining coherent risk metrics with the microstructure of perpetual future markets.</p>



<p>Vest Labs is a crypto research firm building useful primitives to enable a fairer system for all traders. The team aims to do just that for traders. They will make the first stride by building a decentralized perpetual futures exchange (Vest Exchange) where traders can speculate on almost any asset.</p>

<p>According to Dave the Wave&#8217;s chart, <strong>BTC appears to be continuing its technical setup from the second quarter of 2019</strong>, when BTC rose from about $4,000 to $14,000 in a few months. </p>



<p>The <strong>MACD</strong>, a trend reversal indicator, is <strong>currently circling in the same area as it did before the 2019 BTC spike</strong>, claims the analyst. Similar to Bitcoin&#8217;s Q2 2019 setup, the histogram, which gauges the convergence or divergence of the moving averages, is likewise trending upward.</p>



<p>According to the crypto strategist&#8217;s logarithmic growth curve (LGC) model, <strong>the value of Bitcoin might increase by 676% by 2024.</strong></p>

<p>The LGC is the analyst&#8217;s attempt to forecast the boom-and-bust cycles of <strong>Bitcoin in the face of shifting macroeconomic circumstances. </strong>The LGC concept is intended for long-term Bitcoin investors, claims Dave the Wave.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">BTC charts are for investors – buying in a few tranches over a reasonable period of time…. with price in the ‘buy zone’… may prove to be a good investment going forward.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at <strong>$23,570</strong>, which is a <strong>2.4 %</strong> increase over the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>After the rejection, <strong>Custodia</strong> will not be able to access the<strong> Federal Reserve Payments System</strong>. The Fed believes that the application submitted by the company does not meet the requirements required by law. Experts say Custodia&#8217;s failure will disappoint the crypto industry.</p>



<p><strong>Custodia</strong> is a special purpose depository institution chartered by the state of <strong>Wyoming</strong> with no federal deposit insurance. The company proposes to engage in novel and untested crypto activities, including issuing crypto assets on open, public, and/or decentralized networks. The company&#8217;s novel business model and proposed focus on cryptoassets pose significant safety and sound risks.</p>



<p>The <strong>Federal Reserve</strong> has previously made it clear that such cryptographic activities are highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. The Fed also found that Custodia’s risk management framework was <strong>insufficient to address concerns about increased risks associated with its proposed crypto activities</strong>, including its ability to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p>

<p>Previously, the <strong>US Federal Reserve</strong>, the <strong>Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</strong>, and the <strong>Office of the Comptroller of the Currency</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157936-federal-reserve-warns-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they were closely observing the cryptocurrency operations of banking institutions.</p>



<p>The regulators highlighted a few red flags for those wishing to go deeper into crypto-related activities, even if the statement noted that banks aren&#8217;t forbidden from doing business with organizations that operate within the law.</p>

<p>The security agency PeckShield tweeted that hackers in the attack on the official social media account of the NFT project had exchanged the stolen funds for a total of<strong> 618 ETH</strong> (one<strong> 468 ETH</strong>, the other <strong>150 ETH</strong>) and transferred them to crypto mixer Tornado Cash. The phishing address &#8220;0x50…fd7&#8221; simultaneously stole 196 NFTs, including <strong>74 Otherdeeds, 56 Beanz, 12 Doodles, 2 MAYCs</strong>, and <strong>41 PudgyPenguins</strong>. The address has so far transferred <strong>234 ETH</strong>.</p>



<p>In the past, hackers were able to take over Azuki&#8217;s Twitter account by taking advantage of a flaw in the social network platform servers. These cybercriminals have stolen NFTs by using Twitter accounts to advertise harmful phishing websites.</p>



<p>The Azuki NFT collection&#8217;s community manager, <strong>Emily Rose</strong>, stated that infamous hackers broke into their social media servers on Friday afternoon and took over their Twitter account in a blog post published on <strong>January 27</strong>.</p>

<p>Hackers have used Azuki&#8217;s Twitter following to spread the word about harmful phishing websites. They connected phony connections to Azuki&#8217;s metaverse portal, The Garden, and urged users to lay claim to the land.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it appears that <strong>more than $1.7 million </strong>has been taken from several NFT investors by hackers. <strong>74 Otherdeeds </strong>with a floor price of <strong>$2,700 apiece </strong>were among the NFTs taken.</p>



<p>Azuki, a blue-chip tier non-fungible token collection with a limited edition of <strong>10,000 anime-inspired avatars</strong>, was introduced in <strong>January 2022</strong>. On Twitter, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/136079-azuki-investor-to-own-nft-skateboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Azuki</a> has a following of more than <strong>333,000 users.</strong></p>
