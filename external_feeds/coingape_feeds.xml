This breakdown resolved a one-year consolidation in the seller&#8217;s favor indicating this memecoin is poised for a significant downfall. The negative sentiment in the market also rooted for the same cause suggests this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> is less likely to make a sharp recovery in the near future.</span></p>

<h2><b>Shiba Inu Price Daily Chart</b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demand pressure at $0.00000572 support could hint at a bullish reversal in the SHIB price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily RSI slope at the oversold region indicates that more buyers could enter at discounted prices.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $120.5 Million, showing a 68% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uwIWiQqG.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the triangle breakdown point of $0.00000824, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> tumbles 33% and reaches a two-year low of $0.00000543. However, on June 10th, the aggressive selling was immediately undermined by the buyers as they recovered the losses witnessed during the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long tail rejection candle projected at $0.00000572 support indicated the buyers are accumulating at this discounted price which could lead to a minor pullback. As of now, the SHIB price trades at $0.0000066 with an intraday loss of 2.48%.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the demand pressure from bottom support rises, the SHIB price could rise 17% to retest the breached $0.00000778 support as potential resistance.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After such a massive downfall, a sudden recovery is less possible, and therefore, the SHIB price could turn sideways above $0.00000572</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Shiba Inu&#8217;s Price Lose $0.00000572?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the sudden downfall, the SHIB price managed to sustain above the $0.00000572 level. Despite a strong bearish scenario, the coin price stayed above the aforementioned level indicating a breakdown below it would be very tough for sellers. Thus, the retest to the $0.00000572 support could be an opportunity to accumulate SHIB.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dynamic resistance of the 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> will be the first sign of bullish recovery if breached.Â </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> plunge into the oversold region also indicates unstable aggressive selling which could trigger a quick rebounce.</span></li>

<h2><b>Pepecoin Price Daily ChartÂ </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The downsloping trendline governs the current downfall in PEPE price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.000000842 stands as a strong accumulation zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Pepecoin coin is $126.5 Million, indicating a 43.5 % loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the June 10th sell-off, the PEPE price gave a decisive breakdown below the $0.000000963 support. By the press time, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> trades at $0.0000009138 and continues to waver below the breached support trying to obtain suitable resistance.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The breakdown set the prices for a potential downfall of 9% and hit the $0.000000842 multi-month support. On June 10th, the PEPE price showed a long-wick rejection at the $0.000000842 support indicating buyers are actively accumulating at this support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin manages to sustain above the aforementioned support, a potential reversal will assist buyers to challenge the overhead trend, this downsloping resistance has been carrying a steady downfall in PEPE Price over the past three weeks.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Until this trendline is intact, the PEPE may whiteness an aggressive downfall.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Pepecoin Coin Sustain Above the 0.000001 Mark?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last three weeks, the PEPE price witnessed multiple reversals from the downsloping trendline. Thus, the potential buyers waiting for an entry opportunity should wait for a breakout above the overhead trendline. Thus, this will signal an early sign of trend reversal and could push the PEPE price back to $0.0000016.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite a lower low formation if the chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> shows massive recovery indicatingÂ </span></li>

As far as John Reed is </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1667553074318135297"><span style="font-weight: 400">concerned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the argument from the trading platform that the regulator approved its Initial Public Offering (IPO) back in 2021 and as such, has a good knowledge of its business is flawed.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why, IMHO, Coinbase&#39;s SEC Defense is Criminal</p>
<p>Coinbase and its shills argue that when Coinbaseâs SEC initial public offering (IPO) registration went effective, the SEC somehow also approved the bonafides of Coinbaseâs business. What a crock and possibly a criminal offense.Â Yes,â¦ <a href="https://t.co/5QyWYTcA8f">pic.twitter.com/5QyWYTcA8f</a></p>
<p>&mdash; John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1667553074318135297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">John Reed said the role of the SEC as far as IPO filing is concerned is to review whether or not the applying company made the right disclosures. According to the former regulatory Chief, the SEC always issues a bold disclaimer in every prospectus that legally recuses the commission of exactly the same claims that the exchange plans to use as a cover.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For emphasis, John Reed published a sample of the statement which reads;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">âThe Securities and Exchange Commission and state securities regulators have not approved or disapproved these securities, or determined if the prospectus or this prospectus supplement is truthful or complete. </span><b>Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense</b><span style="font-weight: 400">,â with the bold emphasis added by John Reed.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He added that the SECâs role is to help investors make their investment decisions based on the availability of the right decision and according to him, Coinbase claiming the commission is aware of its business will not help its defense in the course of the suit.</span></p>
<h2><b>Coinbase Has a Long Road to Trail</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it stands, Coinbase as an exchange has a very long road to trend as it has two lawsuits pending with the US SEC. First, the trading platform sued the Gary Gensler-led commission for failing to provide regulatory clarity as it has demanded severally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-stock-price-crash-sec-lawsuit-crypto-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400">second lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> which is obviously the most important is the charges on the trading platform for supporting the trading of unregistered crypto securities like Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Filecoin (FIL) and Polygon (MATIC) amongst others.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The legal battle will be a long haul for the trading platform judging by the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-sec-xrp-lawsuit-settlement-hinman-docs/"><span style="font-weight: 400">legal battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> between Ripple Labs and the market regulators.</span></p>

Glassnode in its analysis has already detailed the limited likelihood that assets in custody for this long period will be liquidated easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Against the general expectations that the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) surrounding Coinbase and Binance will push many to withdraw their assets, the Glassnode insight showed that the lawsuits has made no difference on these HODLers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the SEC first </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-stock-price-crash-sec-lawsuit-crypto-news/"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the Binance charges and followed it up with that of Coinbase about 24 hours later, the market responded in a very bearish manner. The long sought recovery of the market is still quite far away as Bitcoin (BTC) is still trading at below the $26,000 resistance point after falling more than 5.32% over the trailing 7-day period.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will Long Term Bitcoin Holders Change their Position?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, the Glassnode data confirmed that long term Bitcoin holders are unfazed by the uncertain regulatory environment surrounding Binance and Coinbase, the likelihood of things changing in the long term remains a subject up for debate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the allegations brought against both entities especially as it concerns the trading and support for unregistered crypto securities, the exchanges are bound to delist the concerned assets, a move that will exempt Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the broad crackdown from both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Bitcoin has always been exempted from Securities classification across the board. With the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/michael-saylor-proposes-bitcoin-to-solve-turkish-lira-issue/"><span style="font-weight: 400">loud voice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> of Bitcoin maximalists like Jack Dorsey and Michael Saylor, Bitcoin and a few Proof-of-Work (PoW) tokens are likely to be the crypto that will maintain legitimacy in the near term.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Solana Foundation said it âwelcomes the continued engagement of policymakers as constructive partners on regulation to achieve legal clarity on these issues for the thousands of entrepreneurs across the U.S. building in the digital assets space.â</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The foundation blew its own trumpet that it has the strongest builder community in the broader digital currency ecosystem with the commitment to build exceptional projects and products in the broader industry. While its message is designed to reassure its community, the Solana Foundation highlighted its core mission of supporting âthose building for the long-haul to continue to create the best blockchain for a decentralized future.â</span></p>

While there is no apparent lawsuit against Solana Foundation for now, the classification has the tendencies to negatively shift the trust investors have in the SOL token.</span></p>
<h2><b>Solana Foundation Shared its Reassurances Late</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite the message that was targeted at pacifying its community, the Solana Foundation notably made the move to reassure its community fairly late. While the probe into why it waited about a week to address its community is not far-fetched, the impact of the SEC crackdown is already being felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a fear that more exchanges may be delisting SOL and the affected digital currencies until the securities status of these assets is redefined. At the time of writing, SOL is changing hands at a price of $15.37, down 30.3% in the trailing 7-day period.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano Price Daily Chart:Â </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long-tail rejection candle at $0.24 projects intense buying at this support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily RSI slope indicator at the oversold region indicates a heavy discount on the ADA price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the ADA coin is $650.47Â  Million, indicating a 47% loss</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the Cardano coin witnessed massive outflow and tried to breach the December 22â low of $0.24. However, the buyer&#8217;s made an immediate comeback and recovered most of the dayâs loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, the resulting daily candle showed a long wick rejection at $0.24 indicating the aggressive accumulation from buyers at this level. By the press time, the ADA price trades at the $0.268 mark with an intraday loss of 2.33%.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained selling, the coin price could make another retest to the $0.24 support which will offer additional confirmation for the buyers to accumulate.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the traders may face the nearest supply zone at the $0.3 mark. A breakout above this aforementioned resistance is needed to obtain the first sign of recovery.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will ADA Price Break $0.24?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the intense selling pressure observed on June 10th, the Cardano price managed to stay above the critical $0.24 support level. The rejection of lower prices, characterized by a long-tailed candlestick indicates the buyers stepped in to defend this support level. Thus, the possibility for ADA price to break $0.24 is less likely until we see another negative news spread across the crypto market.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> plunge to the oversold region indicates the sellers went overboard to tumble this coin and thus offer a heavy discount to potential traders.</span></li>
<li><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The massive gap between the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, 100, and 200 and ADA price reflects the current downtrend is insatiable, and recovery is possible.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On June 10th, the MATIC price recorded a 28% loss in the early hours and tested the psychological support zone of $0.52-$0.5. The investor reacted quickly to the discounted price and the intraday loss was halved by the day&#8217;s end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting lower tail rejection reflects the $0.5 as a strong accumulation, withstanding the current market sell-off. By the press time, the MATIC price trades at $0.6, with an intraday loss of 1.3%.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is likely the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> price will make a revisit to $0.5 and confirm its sustainability above it. A potential consolidation above the aforementioned support could offer a reaccumulation opportunity to traders.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the recent breach support of $0.687 and $0.745 will act as crucial ceilings to validate if buyers are ready for a recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can MATIC Price Sustain $0.5 Support?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the aggressive sell-off on June 10th, the MATIC price didnât breach the $0.5 support, indicating that even in unfavorable scenarios the buyers defended the mentioned support. Therefore, it&#8217;s less likely to see a breakdown below this until we see some other negative news spread across the market. The long-tail rejection is a sign that buying pressure is rising at the $0.5 mark.</span></p>

This price level supported the buyers for over two months despite the highly volatile phase, indicating the holders lost a crucial footing. Thus, this breakdown is likely to boost selling pressure in the ETH price and extend the prevailing correction phase.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ascending trendline is the representation of the current bull run in the ETH price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bearish breakdown below the $1775-$1764 set the coin price for a potential 6% drop</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $4.6 Billion, indicating a 0.27% loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price closing below the last swing low of $1775-$1765 reflects a continuation signal of the ongoing correction phase. By the press time, the ETH price trades at $1750, with an intraday gain of 0.14%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price sustains above the breached support in the coming days, the altcoin will slide lower and meet the $1700 mark. This psychological support aligned with the 200-day EMA creates a high area of interest for buyers to reaccumulate.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under a pessimistic approach, a breakdown below $1700 will pull the price back to the combined support of $24000 and ascending trendline. This dynamic support could offer traders great pullback opportunities as it did in December 2022, followed by January and March 2023.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below the support trendline with daily candle closing will trigger a free fall in ETH.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Ethereum Price Plunge below $1650?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the overall market sentiment favors a downfall in Ethereum price, the daily chart shows some crucial support that can hold buyers at higher levels. The $1700 horizontal support and the angular trendline are suitable accumulation zones that can undermine the current downfall and recuperate the bullish momentum. Until the support trendline is intact, the ETH price is less likely to fall below $1650.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Directional Movement Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The expanding gap between the DI slopes in a bearish alignment(DI- above DI+) highlights a bear trend sentiment among traders.</span></li>

This could not have come at a better time as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to attack the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> with lawsuits. It may be recalled that the SEC recognized top altcoins Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL) as securities. Hence, Cardano joined XRP in the long list of crypto tokens the SEC has categorized as securities.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP Vs SEC lawsuit</a>, the central argument is about whether XRP is a security or not. The Summary Judgement in the case is awaited from Judge Analisa Torres.</p>
<h2>XRP Holders Back To Supporting Cardano Founder</h2>
<p>In the context of severe trolling and criticism from the XRP community, Charles Hoskinson had earlier cut ties with the XRP holders. In a fresh development, the Cardano founder <a href="https://coingape.com/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-may-finally-patch-up-with-xrp-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offered</a> to finally make peace with the community. In response, the XRP holders reacted positively and suggested that he host a Twitter spaces to make the patch up official. Some members of the community were positive to supporting Hoskinson but <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/QuadJacksXRP/status/1667358282447568900@coinbase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarked</a> that it was Coinbase that did a lot of damage to the cryptocurrency by not relisting the token on the platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Coinbase is directly responsible for value lost and continue gatekeep by not relisting XRP.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC, however, was not left out of scrutiny by the US regulators, as the SEC filed a lawsuit alleging violation of securities laws.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the falling wedge pattern is a sign of a gradual decrease in selling pressure which leads to a massive bullish upswing. As for now, the converging trendline is narrowed enough to project a no-trading zone.</span></p>

<h2>Lummis Aims For Crypto Regulation In US</h2>
<p>Working alongside Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Lummis has been working on a revamped bipartisan effort to introduce comprehensive regulations for <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>. This legislative endeavor is expected to gain traction on Capitol Hill later this year, paving the way for a much-needed framework in the rapidly evolving digital asset space.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Breaking: Hong Kong Legislator Invites Coinbase To Establish Crypto Operations" href="https://coingape.com/hong-kong-coinbase-apply-for-license-stock-exchange-listing/" rel="bookmark">Hong Kong Legislator Invites Coinbase To Establish Crypto Operations</a></strong></em></p>
<p>While highlighting the fact that the opposition successfully thwarted the inclusion of a <a href="https://coingape.com/biden-proposes-30-climate-change-tax-bitcoin-miners/">30% digital asset mining tax</a> in the recent debt ceiling deal, Lummis emphasized that the fight to establish a clear regulatory landscape for the crypto sector is far from over.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We successfully prevented <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@POTUS</a>&#39; 30% digital asset mining tax from being included in the debt ceiling deal but the fight is far from over.</p>
<p>I am working on a regulatory framework that will allow individuals and companies to own and trade digital assets in America.</p>
<p>Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
<p>&mdash; Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1667573085426384899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Crypto Bill Expected To Address Token Definitions</h2>
<p>Earlier, during a digital assets symposium, Senator Gillibrand stated that the revised version of the bill would be more detailed, particularly in terms of defining tokens and the processes required to obtain them. As stated by the senators multiple times, this move would aim to provide clarity and address existing ambiguities in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the forthcoming bill primarily seeks to define cryptocurrencies while potentially removing the &#8220;security&#8221; tag associated with them. Additionally, the proposed legislation will supposedly impose a universal ban on algorithmic stablecoins although further deliberations are necessary to determine the entities authorized to issue <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/stable-coins/">stablecoins</a> and the requirements associated for maintaining their USD reserves.</p>

However, the downtrend asset found support at the base of the bearish channel, the buyers are absorbing the sell-off neatly. Will Dogecoin reverse from the baseline or is the memecoin set to fall below $0.050?</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin price retests the $0.065 breakdown to test the $0.056 level.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Buying at lower levels leads to tail formation projecting a potential reversal, as buyers absorb the sell-off.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $911.5 Million, indicating a 271% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moving in a negatively inclined bearish channel, today the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">dogecoin price</a> approaches the support trend line with an intraday fall of 13.85%. Responding to a recent market sell-off, the meme coin gives a follow-through of a consolidation range fallout between $0.069 and $0.075.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The sell-off forms a bearish engulfing candlestick reflecting the high momentum trapped within the range. However, the Dogecoin investors are readily accumulating the coin at lower levels, buying the dip in short.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding points to the bull team, the dog-themed memecoin is bouncing back from the support trendline and the $0.56 level signifying a lower price rejection. At present, the coin trades at $0.059, recovering 13.65% from the dayâs low.Â </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Continuing the channel price trend, DOGE will likely bounce back in the coming days if it sustains above the $0.056 level. The reversal will retest the $0.69 level soon as the buyers reclaim their ground.Â </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the sell-off continues, the channel breakdown will prove catastrophic for Doge holders.Â </span></p>
<h2><strong>Will Dogecoin Fetch $0.10?</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going against the previous analysis of a range breakout on the upside, the memecoin retests the support trendline after the fallout. However, the readiness of buyers to grab dogecoin at lower levels showcases strong trust within the community. This improves the possibility of a bullish reversal. However, Elon Muskâs favorite crypto can face opposition at the $0.069 and $0.075 levels.Â </span></p>

While the exchange has faced significant attention due to the reported outflows, Binance CEO <a href="https://coingape.com/education/who-is-changpeng-zhao-discover-binance-founder-investments/#:~:text=Changpeng%20Zhao%2C%20also%20known%20by,founder%20and%20CEO%20of%20Binance.">Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhao</a> took to Twitter to address the issue, stating that the data presented was slightly misleading.</p>
<h2>CZ Refutes Reported Outflows As Inaccurate</h2>
<p>According to CZ, Binance&#8217;s internal data reveals a net outflow of approximately $392 million within the last 24 hours. He pointed out that certain third-party analysis firms determine outflows by measuring changes in Asset Under Management (AUM) in USD equivalent, which includes the impact of crypto price drops. CZ emphasized that this approach may not accurately represent the actual outflows and that it combines two distinct concepts.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a href="https://coingape.com/hong-kong-coinbase-apply-for-license-stock-exchange-listing/">Hong Kong Legislator Invites Coinbase To Establish Crypto Operations</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, the 46-year-old crypto mogul clarified that while crypto price drops reduce AUM, they should not be classified as outflows. While arguing that the public <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wallet-address/">wallet addresses</a> of Binance make it possible for anyone to track the movement of funds, CZ noted that some analysis firms solely measure outflows without considering inflows &#8212; which can lead to a skewed representation of Binance&#8217;s asset movements.</p>
<h2>Impact of Market Fluctuations On AUM</h2>
<p>In addition to all this, CZ shed light on the impact of sharp price movements, such as the significant price drop experienced in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/?utm_source=menubar">crypto market</a> on June 10. He highlighted that on such days, arbitrage traders often transfer a substantial amount of funds between exchanges, resulting in significantly higher activity than on normal days. This increased movement of funds can create the illusion of greater outflows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">According to our data, last 24hrs, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Binance</a> net outflow is about $392m.</p>
<p>Our wallet addresses are public. Some 3rd party analytics measure Change in AUM (asset under management) in USD equivalent as outflow. This would include crypto price drops (which decrease AUM) as &quot;outflow&quot;.â¦</p>
<p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="ð¶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1667554966662266883?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>CZ recalled a past instance in November when the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/binance-exchange-review/">Binance exchange</a> processed a net outflow of $7 billion in a single day. He emphasized that these figures need to be considered in the context of the overall market dynamics and the specific circumstances surrounding each trading day.</p>
<p>As things currently stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bnb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">price of BNB</a> â Binance&#8217;s native cryptocurrency â gained by 0.83% in a matter of minutes upon the announcement, and is presently being traded at roughly $235.</p>

<h2>Custodia Case Crucial For Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>In the latest U.S. district court ruling, Judge denied the Federal Reserveâs motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Custodia bank. However, the court rejected the bankâs request to compel the Fed to grant its master account and membership. Custodia Bank can now pursue its claims through normal channels.</p>
<p>Attorney John Deaton, Amicus curiae in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit</a> stated that the Custodia case has arguably become the important case despite Ripple and Coinbase&#8217;s pending cases. Highlighting Chokepoint 2.0 with the failure of multiple banks like Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and other banks, he stated that crypto firms always need banking for on and off ramps. <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>He mentioned that the Custodia Bank holds a very revolutionary idea of not engaging in fractional banking maintaining funds in reserve. The attorney stated that when you have 100% reserves, a bank run becomes a non issue. This is because then there would be no panic about not getting funds or assets out.</p>

<p>Deaton stated that the Federal Reserve doesnât like the revolutionary concepts. He mentioned that the Fed is ignoring its statutory mandate by denying the Custodia Bank a charter. However, the recent court order will allow the Custodia Bank to move ahead with discovery.</p>
<p>Crypto industry finally received a order in its favor amid the recent crackdown led by the US SEC.</p>

<h2>Xrp(XRP) Price Analysis: Dip Opportunity</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/d6AJmTL9.png" alt="Xrp(XRP) Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- TradingviewÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the increasing selling pressure in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/#:~:text=XRP%20Price%20Trends,tokens%20market%20capitalization%20at%20%2435%2C648%2C476%2C604.72.">XRP price</a> witnessed a minor correction to $0.486 support. Despite the two major sell-offs this month, on June 5th and June 10th, the coin price managed to hold above the $0.486 mark indicating the buyers are defending the newly reclaimed level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price continues to sustain above this level, the buyers are likely to come back and push the price higher to rechallenge the $0.55. The aforementioned resistance is a multi-month resistance that limited bullish growth for over a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, interested traders can look for entry opportunities as the XRP price is at important support, however, the coin holders will obtain a better confirmation of a rally after a decisive breakout from $0.55.</span></p>
<h2><strong>TRON(TRX) Price Analysis: Health Retracement for a Potential Rally</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/a/A2VJkm3D.png" alt="TRON(TRX) Price Analysis:" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- TradingviewÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over a two-week period, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/tron/">Tron price</a> experienced a notable correction of 22.4%, declining from its peak of $0.085 to todayâs low of $0.0644. However, this pullback is under the 50% Fibonacci retracement level indicating the overall bullish trend is intact.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, the TRX price found support at an ascending trendline carrying the current uptrend. The lower price rejection attached to the daily candle, indicates the buyers are accumulating this altcoin at dips.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buyers manage to sustain above the trendline, the uptrend continuation could lead to the Tron price above $0.0858.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Polkadot(DOT) Price Analysis: Back-to-Bottom Support</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/r4HttDUF.png" alt="Polkadot(DOT) Price Analysis" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- TradingviewÂ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an intraday loss of 11.18, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/#:~:text=DOT%20Price%20Trends%20%3A,trading%20volume%20of%20%24194%2C926%2C034%20USD.">Polkadot coin price</a> plunged back to the December 22â low of $4.228. However, the daily candle showed long-tail rejection at the long-coming support, indicating the buyers continue to accumulate at this level.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previously this support triggered the January 2022 rally which peaked nearly 86% higher to hit $7.9</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the market sentiment remains bearish, the DOT price is likely to hover above this support before giving a bullish reversal. A potential reversal from this level could assist buyers to rechallenge the overhead trendline located near $6.</span></p>

Since last year, this forbidden resistance has restricted bullish growth, forming a high supply zone for traders. Thus, the coin price struggling to breach this barrier indicates the sellers continue to defend this resistance and may trigger a temporary correction in the near future.</span></p>

<h2><b>XRP Price Daily Chart:</b></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.55 resistance stands as a strong supply zone</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakdown below the $0.486 support could tumble the XRP price by another 8%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.73 Billion, indicating a 5% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the XRP price shows failed attempts from buyers to surpass the multi-month resistance of $0.55. The green candles showed struggling to offer follow-up candles is a sign of the distribution phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The resulting reversal tumbled the coin price by 11% to reach the $0.486 local support. By the press time, the XRP price trades at $0.4886 and currently hovers above the aforementioned support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.486 level stands as strong support as during the sell-off on June 5th, the buyers manage to take support at the aforementioned level. Until this leave is intact, the overall recovery sentiment will remain intact.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below the $0.486 support could prolong the correction and plunge the XRP price by 8% to hit the $0.447 mark.</span></p>
<h2><b>Will XRP Price Plunge to $0.45?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The increasing supply pressure at $0.55 pressurizes the XRP price for a bearish reversal. The resulting downfall hit the next significant demand zone of the $0.486 mark. The daily chart shows the aforementioned level aligned with the 50-day EMA and the 50% retracement level creates a strong accumulation and less likely of a breakdown.Â </span></p>

In a Twitter post, Legislative Council member Johnny Ng expressed his willingness to provide assistance and hinted at possible stock listing plans for crypto trading operators, including <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a>. This move comes after the US SEC went on a crypto carnage this week with subsequent <a href="https://coingape.com/sec-sues-coinbase-exchange-day-after-binance-lawsuit/">lawsuits</a> filed against crypto heavyweights like Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Embraces Crypto Regulations<strong><br />
</strong></h2>
<p>While many countries in the West remain cautious about <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>, Hong Kong has taken a different approach by actively regulating crypto assets. In 2023, the city&#8217;s Financial Secretary, Paul Chan, announced the government&#8217;s commitment to building a robust crypto and fintech ecosystem. Since then, Hong Kong has been proactively developing regulations and compliance measures to foster the growth of the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-crypto stance has attracted attention from global tech giants. In January, Samsung, the Korean tech giant, announced the launch of a Bitcoin Futures Active ETF on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Moreover, in mid-February, reports emerged that Chinese officials were providing strategic approval to Hong Kong&#8217;s pro-crypto efforts.</p>
<p>It is even speculated that the Chinese government might eventually consider using Hong Kong as a test bed for crypto innovation, as long as it does not pose a threat to the country&#8217;s financial stability. This endorsement further solidified Hong Kong&#8217;s reputation as a leading crypto-friendly jurisdiction in the region.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Lays Foundation For Retail CBDC</h2>
<p>In the latest development, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced on June 9 its plans to lay the foundation for implementing a retail <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/">Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</a>. The move aims to explore the potential benefits of CBDCs as a payment method for day-to-day transactions and for easy onboarding of customers onto <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>The invitation extended by Legislative Council member Johnny Ng signals the country&#8217;s commitment to becoming a digital hub for the crypto industry, which has already seen participation from both OKX and Huobi compliance entities and are currently listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. At the time of writing, the California-based Coinbase exchange has not provided a response to the proposal yet.</p>

<h2><b>Details About the FTX Verdict</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As revealed in a </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://apnews.com/article/ftx-cryptocurrency-bankmanfried-bankruptcy-e3a4c8729d3f3f3c22724247104c337b"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> by the Associated Press, the ruling follows a two-day hearing in which media outlets and the United States Bankruptcy Trustee opposed FTX&#8217;s plea to keep customer and creditor names hidden. This decision marks a significant development in the intersection of privacy, finance, and cryptocurrency, as it sets a precedent for customer protection in the event of future bankruptcies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">FTX, a once prominent player in the crypto market, filed for bankruptcy after </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-sam-bankman-fried-faces-investigations-amid-new-bail-restrictions/"><span style="font-weight: 400">facing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> financial difficulties last year. As part of its bankruptcy proceedings, the exchange sought to protect the privacy of its customers by keeping their identities confidential. FTX argued that disclosing customer names could expose their personal information and potentially lead to misuse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the time, some media outlets </span><a href="https://coingape.com/top-media-demands-court-to-release-data-of-9m-ftx-customers/"><span style="font-weight: 400">contested</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the notion that potential risks to customers outweigh the public&#8217;s right to access bankruptcy filings and information. The outlets also emphasize that foreign laws do not typically prohibit the disclosure of customer identities in bankruptcy court proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, the media outlets argue that the demand for secrecy should not be sufficient justification for redaction. The media outlets claim that if the court accepts such a premise, it will set a precedent of sealing personal information in all circumstances when people want privacy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the recent ruling, Judge John Dorsey dismissed all arguments and highlighted that customer identities are a trade secret. He also stated that FTX clients must be protected from criminal actors who may target them by searching the internet and the âdark webâ for personal information.</span></p>
<h2><b>FTX Latest Ruling Reveals a Balance Between Transparency and Privacy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, the court&#8217;s ruling in favor of FTX raises important questions about the balance between transparency and privacy in the cryptocurrency industry.Â </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While transparency is crucial for establishing trust and accountability, Judge Dorsey argues that individuals have the right to maintain their anonymity in crypto transactions. Overall, this ruling recognizes the significance of safeguarding customer privacy in the evolving landscape of digital finance.</span></p>

This comes after the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC</a>) targeting top US based crypto exchange Coinbase with charges of violating securities laws in the country. However, it is argued that the SEC was informed about the same operations when it approved Coinbase&#8217;s IPO in 2019.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the US SEC had mentioned at the time in its documentation that the IPO approval does not necessarily prevent it from charging businesses over violations in operations. Meanwhile, the crypto trading community went through a shock with the back to back lawsuits against two of the world&#8217;s top crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Politician Invites Coinbase To Apply For Crypto License</h2>
<p>Contrary to the regulatory environment in the United States, Hong Kong leader Johnny Ng had on Saturday wrote an <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Johnny_nkc/status/1667499874521350144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open invitation</a> to the likes of Coinbase and other crypto trading operators to come and apply for regulatory licenses in the region.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I hereby offer an invitation to welcome all global virtual asset trading operators including Coinbase to come to HK for application of official trading platforms and further development plans. Please feel free to approach me and I am happy to provide any assistance.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Hong Kong made <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/crypto-price-analysis-prices-skyrocket-for-top-3-china-coins-hong-kong-opens-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> by allowing retail investors to trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other cryptocurrencies. As a result, there has been a rise in demand for some of the Chinese crypto coins, although not as much as anticipated.</p>

<p>According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Coinglass</a>, over $300 million in longs and $30 million in shorts were liquidated in the last 24 hours.
