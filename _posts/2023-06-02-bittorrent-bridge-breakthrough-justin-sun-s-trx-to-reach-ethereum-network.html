Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain, has announced that the Tron network&#8217;s native asset, TRX, can now be fully accessed on Ethereum (ETH), the largest altcoin network in the cryptocurrency industry. This has been made possible through the BitTorrent Bridge, which allows for seamless interoperability between the two blockchains.  BitTorrent Bridge Paves The Way To Ethereum Integration Interoperability in the context of blockchain refers to the ability of different blockchains to communicate and exchange information with each other seamlessly. In this case, the BitTorrent Bridge enables Tron&#8217;s native asset, TRX, to be transferred and accessed on the Ethereum network, and vice versa.

The BitTorrent Bridge acts as an intermediary between the two blockchains, facilitating the transfer of assets and data in a secure and decentralized manner. The move is a significant development for the Tron ecosystem, which is currently the second-largest DeFi ecosystem with over $5.6 billion in total value locked and more than 2.9 million active users, according to DeFiLlama data. Justin Sun&#8217;s tweet regarding the Ethereum expansion via BitTorrent Bridge has already had a positive impact on TRX&#8217;s price, with the asset jumping by 2% following the announcement. This further demonstrates the potential for Tron to expand its reach and appeal to a wider audience in the cryptocurrency industry. With Tron&#8217;s expansion to Ethereum, the cryptocurrency industry continues to see the growing importance of interoperability between different blockchains. As more projects explore the potential of cross-chain functionality, the industry is likely to see further development and innovation in the coming years. TRON Sets New Daily Transaction Record Despite the challenges faced by the cryptocurrency industry in recent months, TRON has continued to perform strongly, defying expectations and posting impressive growth. According to a Twitter thread by Justin Sun, the network hit a new record high in daily transactions, processing over 10 million transactions in a single day. Furthermore, Sun notes that the robust performance of the TRON network is a result of its quality and efficiency, as well as its ability to continuously improve and deliver concrete results. Looking ahead, TRON has set an ambitious target for the year, aiming to double its transaction volume. Sun emphasizes that this increase is not just a measure of quantity, but also a reflection of the network&#8217;s ability to maintain its strong fundamentals and generate revenue even in a challenging market.
