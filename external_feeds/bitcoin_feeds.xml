<h2>Sir Jon Cunliffe on Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Sir Jon Cunliffe, Bank of England (BOE)&#8217;s deputy governor for financial stability, talked about cryptocurrency in an interview with Sky News Thursday. He explained that the British central bank plans to step up its effort with new laws to regulate crypto trading following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trading of crypto assets was not big enough to destabilize the financial system, but it was starting to develop links,&#8221; Cunliffe said, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We had banks and investment funds and others who wanted to invest in it and I think we should think about regulation before it becomes integrated with the financial system and before we could have a potential systemic problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bank of England deputy governor noted that trading in crypto should be regulated rather than banned.</p>
<p>While cautioning that many coins were little more than a &#8220;gamble&#8221; and most were &#8220;without intrinsic value,&#8221; he admitted: &#8220;There are people who want to engage in that activity.&#8221; The BOE official clarified: &#8220;Provided they do that with their eyes wide open in a place that is safe, is not full of money laundering or illicit finance … then we should provide them at least with the opportunity to do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Cunliffe opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we&#8217;re talking about creating the regulation in which people can see whether they can develop services that have benefits using those technologies to the real economy &#8230; then I think there&#8217;s a real benefit for the U.K.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, he cautioned: &#8220;If we&#8217;re talking about using these crypto technologies to create, basically, crypto assets that have nothing behind them &#8230; I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s ever going to be a sustainable financial activity around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, Cunliffe said the collapse of crypto exchange FTX highlighted the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-england-deputy-governor-ftx-collapse-highlights-urgent-need-for-tighter-crypto-regulation/">urgent need</a> for tighter crypto regulation. The Bank of England executive regularly warned about the danger of cryptocurrency. In July, he said crypto is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-englands-cunliffe-warns-crypto-is-prone-to-collapse-touts-same-risk-same-regulatory-outcome/">prone to collapse</a>.&#8221; He also expects to see <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-englands-cunliffe-warns-crypto-will-see-tough-times-as-federal-reserve-tightens-financial-conditions/">tough times ahead</a> for the industry as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten financial conditions.</p>

</strong></p>
<h2>Elon Musk on Fed Rate Hikes</h2>
<p>Tesla, Spacex, and Twitter boss Elon Musk warned Thursday about the damaging impact of the Federal Reserve rapidly raising interest rates.</p>
<p>His warning was in reply to a <a href="https://twitter.com/GRDecter/status/1605945570715205634">tweet</a> by former investment manager Genevieve Roch-Decter stating that &#8220;the Fed has never raised rates faster&#8221; than this year. Musk wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the risk of being repetitive, these Fed rate increases might go down in history as most damaging ever.</p></blockquote>
<p>Roch-Decter also included a chart with her tweet showing that the Fed has hiked interest rates further and faster this year than at any other time in modern history.</p>

<p>Many people agreed with Musk. &#8220;I agree, Elon. The mortgage industry is taking a blood bath. Good professionals like me (marketing) laid off. Applications at historic lows. This is a disaster,&#8221; one Twitter user wrote. Another described: &#8220;This is what happens when the government artificially infuses $3.5 trillion into the U.S. economy. The Fed makes up for it in damaging interest hikes &#8230; It&#8217;s going to get worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Musk also blamed the Federal Reserve for Tesla&#8217;s loss of market value. Investment advisor Ross Gerber tweeted last week: &#8220;Elon has now erased $600 billion of Tesla wealth and still nothing from the Tesla BOD [board of directors]. It&#8217;s wholly unacceptable.&#8221; Musk replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tesla is executing better than ever. We don&#8217;t control the Federal Reserve. That is the real problem here.</p></blockquote>
<p>The billionaire has warned several times about the risks of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates. Earlier this month, he cautioned that the recession will be <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-recession-will-be-greatly-amplified-if-the-fed-raises-rates-next-week/">greatly amplified</a> if the Fed raised interest rates again. The central bank then raised rates by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-hikes-rate-by-50bps-fomc-signals-rate-to-rise-to-5-1-next-year/">50 basis points</a> following four consecutive 75-basis-point hikes.</p>
<p>Last month, Musk warned that the &#8220;trend is concerning,&#8221; emphasizing that the Fed &#8220;needs to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-warns-of-severe-recession-urges-the-fed-to-cut-interest-rates-immediately/">cut interest rates immediately</a>.&#8221; He added: &#8220;They are massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.&#8221; The billionaire also previously said that he believes the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-says-global-recession-could-last-until-spring-2024/">recession</a> will last until the spring of 2024.</p>

In addition, the SEC chief said: &#8220;Proof of reserves is neither a full accounting of the assets and liability of a company, nor does it satisfy segregation of customer funds under the securities laws.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>SEC Chair Gensler on Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler stressed the importance of bringing crypto platforms into compliance after the securities regulator <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-against-ftx-alameda-execs-wang-and-ellison-reveal-key-findings-us-regulator-says-ftt-is-a-security/">filed charges</a> against former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and former FTX executive Gary Wang for their role to defraud equity investors. The SEC boss tweeted Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws, risks to investors will persist. It remains a priority of the SEC to use all of our available tools to bring the industry into compliance.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg Thursday, Gensler indicated that the SEC is just getting started with its crackdown on crypto firms that are not in compliance with its rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;The runway is getting shorter&#8221; for crypto firms to come in and register with the SEC, Gensler explained, emphasizing: &#8220;The casinos in this Wild West are non-compliant intermediaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The SEC chief also commented on proof-of-reserves (POR) reports used by a number of crypto exchanges, including Binance, to prove that they have enough funds to fulfill customer withdrawals. Noting that this practice falls short of the disclosures needed to protect investors, Gensler explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Proof of reserves is neither a full accounting of the assets and liability of a company, nor does it satisfy segregation of customer funds under the securities laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gensler suggested that crypto companies should &#8220;give customers confidence that their crypto is really there&#8221; by &#8220;coming into compliance with time-tested custody, segregation of customer funds rules and accounting rules.&#8221; The SEC is focused on crypto firms&#8217; financial record keeping.</p>

<p>The securities watchdog and its chairman have been heavily criticized by some for their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/commissioner-sec-enforcement-centric-approach-crypto-regulation/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto industry. They have also been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/conflicting-reports-emerge-about-sec-helping-bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-with-legal-loopholes/">scrutinized</a> in the collapse of crypto exchange FTX since Gensler and SEC staff met with former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) several times.</p>
<p>Congressman Tom Emmer (R-MN) tweeted Thursday: &#8220;Gary Gensler and the SEC had more <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/conflicting-reports-emerge-about-sec-helping-bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-with-legal-loopholes/">meetings</a> with SBF and FTX/IEX than anyone else in crypto, allegedly to craft a special regulatory framework designed to benefit FTX alone.&#8221; The lawmaker further wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Making backroom regulatory deals with bad actors is not a tool in the SEC&#8217;s toolbox.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congressman Emmer said last month that the FTX fallout is not a crypto failure but the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-ftx-collapse-isnt-a-crypto-failure-its-a-failure-of-sec-bankman-fried-centralized-finance/">failure of the SEC and Chair Gensler</a>. The lawmaker from Minnesota has called on Gensler to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmaker-calls-on-sec-chair-gensler-to-testify-about-his-crypto-regulatory-failures/">testify</a> before Congress about the cost of his regulatory failures.</p>
<p>Last week, the SEC chief stressed the importance of regulating crypto <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-says-important-to-regulate-crypto-issuers-and-intermediaries/">issuers and intermediaries</a>. He previously said that most crypto tokens are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">securities</a> but the crypto field is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-discusses-crypto-regulation-following-ftx-collapse-says-this-field-is-significantly-non-compliant/">significantly non-compliant</a>. The securities regulator recently published its strategic plan for the next four years and crypto is among its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-strategic-plan-crypto-initiatives-among-top-priorities-over-next-4-years/">top priorities</a>. Gensler said in November that the SEC&#8217;s Enforcement Division remains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">focused on crypto</a>.</p>

In her statements, Ellison describes that she was the co-CEO and CEO of Alameda, and under those roles, she reported directly to the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The ex-Alameda CEO’s testimony details that she was fully aware from 2019 to 2022, that Alameda Research had access to a special borrowing facility that allowed the company to maintain an unlimited line of credit with zero collateral. The &#8216;borrowing facility,&#8217; according to Ellison, was FTX&#8217;s customer funds. </strong></p>
<h2>Caroline Ellison Details FTX&#8217;s Misconduct With Alameda and the Co-Mingling of Customer Funds Started From the Very Beginning</h2>
<p>Following the unsealing of Caroline Ellison’s plea deal, <a href="https://www.innercitypress.com/">Inner City Press</a> reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress">Matthew Russell Lee</a> published a <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1606344052139593748?s=20&amp;t=1CyPjfcmlWhC3P0pja-FSQ">tweet storm</a> that featured screenshots of Ellison’s unsealed guilty plea transcript. Russell Lee said that the plea arraignment was “held in secret, and not docketed until today, once Bankman-Fried was freed on $250 [million] bond.” If Ellison’s testimony is true, the document highlights a number of infractions both FTX and Alameda executives partook in since 2019.</p>
<p>“From 2019 to 2022, I was aware that Alameda was provided access to a borrowing facility on FTX.com, the cryptocurrency exchange run by Mr. Bankman-Fried. I understood that executives had implemented special settings on Alameda’s FTX.com account that permitted Alameda to maintain negative balances in fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies,” Ellison’s testimony details. &#8220;In practical terms, this arrangement permitted Alameda access to an unlimited line of credit without being required to post collateral, without having to pay interest on negative balances, and without being subject to margin calls or FTX.com’s liquidation protocols,” the ex-Alameda CEO added.</p>
<p>Ellison’s account of the situation continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>I understood that if Alameda had significant negative balances in a particular currency, it meant that Alameda was borrowing funds that customers had deposited on the exchange.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ellison Understood FTX Customer Funds Were Used to &#8216;Finance FTX&#8217;s Loans to Alameda,&#8217; Ex-Alameda CEO Is &#8216;Truly Sorry&#8217; for What She Did</h2>
<p>Ellison was aware that many of Alameda’s investments were illiquid, and she said she fully agreed to borrow funds from FTX’s coffers. “While I was co-CEO and then CEO, I understood that Alameda had numerous large illiquid investments and had lent a lot of money to Mr. Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives,” Ellison’s testimony explains. “I also understood that Alameda had financed the investments with short-term and open-term loans worth several billion dollars from external lenders in the cryptocurrency industry. In or around June 2022, I agreed to borrow several billion dollars from FTX to repay those loans. I understood that FTX would need to use customer funds to finance its loans to Alameda.”</p>
<p>Ellison further added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I also understood that many FTX customers invested in crypto derivatives and that most FTX customers did not expect that FTX would lend out their digital asset holdings and fiat currency deposits to Alameda in this fashion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Ellison said in or around July 2022 to October 2022, she agreed with SBF to “provide materially misleading financial statements to Alameda’s lenders.” Ellison said that the team served lenders botched quarterly reports that obfuscated “the extent of Alameda’s borrowing.” The ex-Alameda CEO also elaborated that she was aware that FTX’s equity investors were kept in the dark about the nature of FTX’s and Alameda’s co-mingled relationship. “I agreed with Mr. Bankman-Fried and others not to publicly disclose the true nature of the relationship between Alameda and FTX, including Alameda’s credit arrangement. I also understood that Mr. Bankman-Fried and others concealed the source and nature of those funds,” Ellison’s account of the situation details.</p>

<p>According to SBF’s alleged ex-girlfriend, Ellison said she was very sorry for what she has done. At the end of her transcript, she apologizes a great deal for what she did. The testimony from Ellison is very different than that of SBF’s stories, when he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-is-sleeping-better-playing-video-games-new-york-times-sam-bankman-fried-interview-dunked-on-for-going-soft-on-ftx-co-founder/">managed</a> to do a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-the-former-ftx-ceos-media-tour-many-unanswered-questions-remain/">media tour</a> for a month before he was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> and he apologized a great deal. While SBF apologized a lot, he never admitted to doing any wrongdoing in terms of fraud or committing any financial misconduct. SBF further said that he did not run Alameda Research, and stressed that he had little knowledge of the trading firm’s business dealings. Speaking virtually at the New York Times’ Dealbook Summit with Andrew Ross Sorkin, SBF <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-boss-speaks-at-dealbook-event-says-he-didnt-knowingly-co-mingle-funds/">insisted</a> he “didn’t knowingly co-mingle funds.”</p>
<p>As far as Alameda Research was concerned, SBF said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I didn’t know the size of their position. I wasn’t running Alameda — I didn’t know exactly what was going on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ellison’s unsealed testimony completely contradicts SBF’s position during his media tour, and not only does she apologize, she explains a number of misdeeds she personally committed. “I am truly sorry for what I did,” Ellison concluded. “I knew that it was wrong. I want to apologize for my actions to the affected customers of FTX, lenders to Alameda, and investors in FTX. Since FTX and Alameda collapsed in November 2022, I have worked hard to assist with the recovery of assets for the benefit of customers and to cooperate with the government’s investigation. I am here today to accept my responsibility for my actions by pleading guilty.” When the judge asked Ellison if she knew what she did was illegal, she replied “yes.”</p>

<h2>Billionaire Bill Ackman&#8217;s Recent FTX Twitter Thread Slammed</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, billionaire Bill Ackman </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1606116911711862784?s=20&amp;t=1CyPjfcmlWhC3P0pja-FSQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about SBF and cohorts the day prior on Dec. 22, and decided to describe the case as a business “failure.” &#8220;One that is “so frightening that they can’t acknowledge it, and they do stupid sh-t to avoid the embarrassment and the come down,&#8221; Ackman <a href="https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1606117008030027778?s=20&amp;t=1CyPjfcmlWhC3P0pja-FSQ">wrote</a>. Ackman’s most recent FTX Twitter thread wasn&#8217;t received well by a great majority of commenters who told Ackman that SBF and FTX are being convicted of starting the fraud from the very beginning. Ellison’s testimony even notes that her special Alameda treatment and the co-mingling of customer funds began in 2019. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin proponent Nic Carter, for instance, replied to Ackman and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1606144002142736384"><span style="font-weight: 400;">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “They were engaging in fraud from day 1.” Coinshares executive Meltem Demirors also responded to Ackman’s tweets and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1606297976808255488?s=20&amp;t=1CyPjfcmlWhC3P0pja-FSQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">remarked:</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “They were depositing FTX customer funds directly into Alameda’s bank account from day 1.” Ackman was </span><a href="https://twitter.com/maybebullish/status/1606117901613690880?s=20&amp;t=1CyPjfcmlWhC3P0pja-FSQ"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reminded</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on several occasions in the thread that maybe he should read the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-against-ftx-alameda-execs-wang-and-ellison-reveal-key-findings-us-regulator-says-ftt-is-a-security/">SEC charges</a>, before claiming that FTX was a “legitimate profitable exchange started by an MIT grad with backing from top VCs at a massive valuation.”</span></p>

<h2>SEC Official Warns Investors Should Be &#8216;Wary&#8217; of Proof-of-Reserve Audits and Crypto Exchange Claims</h2>
<p>U.S. regulators, and more specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are looking more closely at proof-of-reserves (POR) these days following the collapse of FTX. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-heightening-scrutiny-of-auditors-crypto-work-11671681693">Speaking</a> with the WSJ on Thursday, SEC’s acting chief accountant, Paul Munter, explained that investors should not put much faith in POR audits and claims. SEC is concerned that investors “may be getting a false sense of reassurance from the firms’ reports,” the WSJ report detailed.</p>
<p>“We’re warning investors to be very wary of some of the claims that are being made by crypto companies,” Munter explained. “Investors should not place too much confidence in the mere fact a company says it’s got a proof-of-reserves from an audit firm,” the SEC accountant stressed. Munter continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>[A POR audit] is not enough information for an investor to assess whether the company has sufficient assets to cover its liabilities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The commentary from Munter follows the POR concept <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/proof-of-reserves-concept-gains-traction-as-major-crypto-exchanges-provide-wallet-lists-and-promise-full-audits/">gaining traction</a> among crypto exchanges since FTX collapsed. Companies like Okx, Binance, Crypto.com, Huobi, and others have released POR audits but some were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/krakens-jesse-powell-takes-aim-at-newly-launched-proof-of-reserve-lists-por-audit-requires-cryptographic-proof/">met with controversy</a>. Furthermore, on Dec. 16, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/accounting-firm-mazars-stops-proof-of-reserve-audits-for-crypto-firms-binance-audit-removed-from-the-web/">reported</a> on the accounting agency Mazars Group after it revealed it would no longer provide crypto exchange audits. Binance’s POR audit completed by Mazars was also removed from the web.</p>
<p>“We are increasing our understanding of what’s going on in the marketplace,” Munter told the WSJ. “If we find fact patterns that we think are troublesome, we will consider a referral to the division of enforcement.”</p>

<p>Additionally, after Mazars Group said it would not offer POR audits to crypto exchanges, a spokesperson for the auditing firm BDO <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-18/understanding-tether-and-its-usdt-stablecoin-and-why-regulators-are-worried">said</a> that week it is contemplating which kinds of customers to take on. University of Texas professor Jeffrey Johanns believes auditing firms are doing the right thing by being reluctant to offer crypto firms auditing services. “The Big Four firms have…rightly decided the risks [of auditing crypto companies] are extremely high,” Johanns told the WSJ.</p>

<h2>Court Filing Wants to &#8216;Enforce an Automatic Stay&#8217; Against Claims Over FTX&#8217;s 56 Million Robinhood Shares</h2>
<p>On Dec. 22, 2022, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.deb.188450/gov.uscourts.deb.188450.291.0.pdf">court documents</a> show that debtors from FTX want to freeze 56 million Robinhood shares owned by a subsidiary crafted by SBF called Emergent Fidelity Technologies. The debtors from FTX and Alameda have said that multiple entities are seeking to claim these assets, including the now-defunct crypto lending firm Blockfi. FTX wants the court to enforce an automatic stay against claims for the 56 million Robinhood shares worth roughly $450 million.</p>
<p>The Class A common stock Robinhood shares are currently custodied at ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets Inc. (EDFM) in New York City. EDFM does not dispute the ownership of the $450 million shares of Robinhood stock. The court filings say that not only is BlockFi Inc. attempting to gain access to the shares, but Yonathan Ben Shimon and SBF are also looking to obtain the stocks. FTX insists to the court that the debtors have “at least a ‘colorable’ claim to ownership of the Robinhood Shares.”</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that multiple prepetition creditors of different Debtors and Mr. Bankman-Fried are all seeking to obtain possession of the Robinhood Shares demonstrates that the asset should be frozen until this Court can resolve the issues in a manner that is fair to all creditors of the Debtors,&#8221; the FTX court filing submitted on Thursday evening details. “The full evidentiary record, once completely developed, will show the Robinhood Shares are conclusively estate property,” FTX added.</p>

<p>The filing shows that Alameda’s ex-CEO Caroline Ellison allegedly almost sold the Robinhood shares in an over-the-counter (OTC) deal. Further, Ellison later pledged the shares to Blockfi in order to commence a deal which was an attempt to save the troubled crypto lender from defaulting and filing for bankruptcy. The court document shows that Blockfi’s CEO Zac Prince “agreed to Ms. Ellison’s offer to pledge the Robinhood Shares and certain other Alameda assets as security for Alameda’s debts.”</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>) was in the green on Friday, as prices surged for a second straight session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD raced to a high of $0.2623 in today&#x2019;s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $0.2482.</p>
<p>The move saw the token climb towards a resistance level of $0.2685, and it is currently trading at its highest point since Monday.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Friday&#x2019;s gains come as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has moved closer to a ceiling of its own at 32.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at 30.18, with the price slipping from earlier highs, and trading at $0.2586 as of writing.</p>
<p>In order for bulls to hit the ceiling at the $0.2685 mark, this upcoming ceiling of 32.00 on the RSI must first be broken.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, also rose on Friday, as the token extended a recent bull run, in hopes of breaking out of a key resistance point.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.3424, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.3531 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s high is the strongest point that the token has traded at since Sunday, when it was at a top of $0.3555.</p>

<p>Despite this recent climb in price, sentiment in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> still appears to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) extending its downwards cross with the 25-day (blue) MA.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 14-day RSI is currently tracking at 39.65, which is close to a ceiling of 41.00.</p>
<p>If bulls are unable to force a breakout of this level, we will likely see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> once again move lower.</p>

Statistics indicate that the mining pool Foundry USA discovered the most block rewards this year, as the operation found 11,779 bitcoin blocks out of the 53,240 rewards mined during the last 365 days.</strong></p>
<h2>More Than 53K Bitcoin Block Rewards Discovered in 2022, Top Five Mining Pools Mined a Total of 39,545 Blocks</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022, metrics show that 53,240 blocks were mined this year and a total of 23 known mining pools discovered the block subsidies. Presently, bitcoin&#x2019;s price and high mining difficulty rating are making it awfully hard for miners to profit at the end of the year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-565479 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bmc.jpg" alt="" width="1150" height="550" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bmc-300x143.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bmc-1024x490.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bmc-768x367.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bmc.jpg 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 1150px) 100vw, 1150px"></p>
<p>Data indicates that the average <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> mining cost according to metrics from <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">macromicro.me</a> is around $18,816 per unit, while <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s average spot market value in U.S. dollars is $16,800 per unit. The discrepancies between the cost of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> production and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s spot market value have been a tough reality for miners since mid-June 2022.</p>
<p>Prior to mid-June 2022, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s spot market value was well above the average cost of production since mid-Nov. 2020. <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool?pool_mode=year">12-month metrics</a> show that in 2022, Foundry USA obtained the most blocks with 11,779 recorded.</p>

<p>Three of those blocks were empty blocks, and Foundry&#x2019;s block discovery indicates that it represented 22.12% of the network&#x2019;s hashrate this year. 2022 was a good year for Antpool in terms of finding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks over the last 12 months.</p>

<p>Antpool found 8,560 block rewards during the past 365 days and 22 of them were empty blocks. Antpool&#x2019;s 12-month metrics show the pool&#x2019;s hashrate this year represented 16.08% of the total network.</p>
<p>F2pool managed to hold down the third largest mining pool position in 2022 with 14.72% of the year&#x2019;s total hashrate. F2pool gained a total of 7,837 out of the 53,240 blocks found and 28 were empty blocks.</p>

<p>Binance Pool found 6,175 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> blocks in 2022 which equates to 11.60% of the year&#x2019;s total hashrate. Viabtc clocked in at 9.76% of the hashrate as the pool attained 5,194 of this year&#x2019;s blocks.</p>
<p>Calculations show that the top five mining pools mined a total of 39,545 of this year&#x2019;s 53,240 blocks discovered, or 74.28% of the total hashrate. Other notable bitcoin mining pools in the top ten standings in 2022 include Poolin, Braiins Pool, Btc.com, Luxor, and SBI Crypto, respectively.</p>

<p>Those five pools accounted for 22.62% of the total hashrate over the last 365 days. Unknown hashrate, otherwise known as stealth miners, accounted for 1.45% of the hashrate during the last 12 months, discovering approximately 771 bitcoin block rewards.</p>
<p>On Dec. 23, 2021, Bitcoin&#x2019;s total hashrate was around 184 EH/s or 184,000 petahash per second (PH/s). Roughly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211221081543/https://btc.com/stats/pool">around that time</a>, within a three-day radius, Foundry had around 30.93 EH/s and today the pool has around <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool">75 EH/s</a>.</p>
<p>F2pool had around 27.88 EH/s and now has around 29.20 EH/s, while Antpool had 25.59 EH/s compared to today&#x2019;s 48.09 EH/s. Besides the increase of around 29.35% from a year ago today in overall hashrate from 184 EH/s to 238 EH/s, the Bitcoin network also tapped a lifetime high in terms of total hashrate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-565481 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hashhhhhhh.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Statistics show that on Nov. 12, 2022, at block height 762,845, the total hashrate tapped a high of around 347.16 EH/s. The 347.16 EH/s lifetime record equates to 0.347 zettahash per second (ZH/s).</p>
<p>It also became a lot more difficult to find a bitcoin block this year, as the mining difficulty jumped from 24.37 trillion to today&#x2019;s 35.36 trillion. The mining difficulty rating also tapped an all-time high this year at 36.84 trillion after block height 760,032 and the two weeks that followed.</p>

<p>The network recorded these feats despite the lower prices during the last 12 months compared to last year&#x2019;s bitcoin bull run. 2022 saw a number of newly introduced bitcoin mining rigs that packed a whole lot more hashpower per watt.</p>
<p>Bitmain released the Antminer S19 XP Hyd., which boasts around 255 terahash per second (TH/s). The company also released the Antminer S19 XP with 140 TH/s. Canaan released the Avalon A1366 bitcoin mining device, which produces around 130 TH/s. There&#x2019;s also the Microbt Whatsminer M50S bitcoin mining rig that produces around 126 TH/s.</p>

Gross domestic product in the United States was revised higher to 3.2%, better than the 2.9% expected. Bitcoin mostly consolidated in today&#x2019;s session, with prices trading near the $16,800 mark.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was once again in consolidation on Friday, as markets continued to react to the latest U.S. Q3 GDP figures.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,592.41 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD was marginally higher, with prices rising to a peak of $16,880.87 in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The surge in price pushed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> above a key resistance point of $16,800, as bulls once again attempted to recapture the $17,000 mark.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, recent price uncertainty comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) remains close to a floor at 45.00.</p>
<p>Sentiment also seems uncertain following a recent crossover between the red 10-day moving average, and its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>If this downward trend continues, we could see <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> trading near $16,000 during the Christmas weekend.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally higher to end the week, as prices moved closer to a key resistance level earlier today.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $1,224.21 in Friday&#x2019;s session, less than 24 hours after hovering at $1,187.13.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move sees <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> bulls once again try to break out of the long-term resistance level of $1,230.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the 14-day RSI is now rallying above a resistance point at 47.00, and tracking at 47.92, with the next visible ceiling at 52.00</p>
<p>In order for bulls to continue to push ethereum higher, price strength will likely need to surge towards this upcoming resistance of 52.00.</p>
