<p>Uwerx is having one of the most successful presale events we have seen this year, but there&rsquo;s more to look forward to as the launch approaches. Having raised over a million dollars, Uwerx is getting the hype it deserves, and smart investors have taken the opportunity to get in early. Following the recent launch of SUI from its presale round, users have become more optimistic about the future of Uwerx.</p>
<p>With the impressive profit return for early buyers on SUI, one wonders if Uwerx can do a 300x or even more. Read on to find out Uwerx&rsquo;s potential to break the market with its pump after launch.</p>
<p>Sui(SUI) Successful Presale Event</p>
<p>Sui is a new layer-1 designated Proof-of-Stake(dPoS) blockchain network that was recently launched, and it looks to improve on existing industry frameworks. The network used the modified version of the new programming language, Move. The language was used by the discontinued Facebook project, Diem, and it&rsquo;s the same language Aptos uses. Interestingly, Sui and Aptos were both created by the same firm, Mysten Labs.</p>
<p>The project launched on May 3, but prior to that, it gave presale allocations to early testers on the network. For $45, they were able to buy up to 1500 SUI tokens, and right after launch, SUI went as high as $1.4, turning the 45 investment into over $2000. These are typical trends with presale tokens, especially with great utility, as you have with Uwerx.</p>
<p>The blockchain network is looking to become a solid network for NFTs and gaming, and considering the growth in both landscapes, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for profit in owning some SUI tokens.</p>
<p>Can Uwerx(WERX) Do A 30x?</p>
<p>Uwerx is the newest solution in a growing global gig industry, and it poses a huge profit opportunity for early adopters. According to Velocity Global, the global freelance industry is estimated to reach 9192.9 million by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%.</p>
<p>Uwerx is a blockchain-based solution aimed at decentralizing the industry so that more value can go back to users rather than predominant freelance companies in the industry. Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork charge up to 20% fees on transactions on their platform. With Uwerx, that amount is beaten down to 1%, allowing users to keep more to themselves. The 1% fee is also split to give value back to the community.</p>
<p>Uwerx has one unique tokenomics of any blockchain project in recent times. With WERX on presale, the project is offering up over 57% of the supply making the token majorly owned by the community. Another 10% will be in the liquidity pool, which will be locked for 25 years after launch to enable trades.</p>
<p>WERX is a reserve of value and serves as a reward for using the platform. Users can trade it for profit in the future, but there&rsquo;s a much bigger opportunity at the moment. WERX is selling on presale at $0.0315; expert price predictions suggest we could see the price go as high as $1.5 by Q4 of 2023, leaving a profit margin as wide as SUI.</p>
