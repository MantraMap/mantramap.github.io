<li>Ethereum price is showing bearish signs below the $1,250 resistance zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading below $1,240 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,270 on the 4-hours chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could start a recovery wave if it clears the $1,220 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is struggling below $1,250 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more losses if there is a break below the $1,150 zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, ethereum faced a rejection near the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-bulls-aim-upside-break-above-1300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">$1,350 zone</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price failed to gain strength and started a fresh decline below the $1,300 level.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $1,280 and $1,250 support levels. The bears pushed the price below the $1,220 support zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support near $1,270 on the 4-hours chart.</p>
<p>The price traded as low as $1,150 and is currently consolidating losses. An immediate resistance is near the $1,200 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,350 swing high to $1,150 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,220 zone.</p>
<p>The main resistance is near the $1,250 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-rally-possible-above-this-hurdle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,350 swing high to $1,150 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $1,240 and $1,250 resistance levels might call for a decent increase to $1,300. Any more gains could even send the price above the $1,350 resistance zone.</p>
<p>On the downside, an initial support is near the $1,160 level. The next major support is now near the $1,150 level. A break below the $1,150 support could push the price to $1,100.</p>
<p>If the bulls struggle to protect the $1,100 support, the price might decline towards $1,065. Any more losses could lead the price towards $1,000 or even $920.</p>
<div id="attachment_76054" style="width: 1834px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Ethereum-2.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-76054" class="size-full wp-image-76054" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2022/12/Ethereum-2.png" alt="Ethereum Price" width="1834" height="845" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-76054" class="wp-caption-text">Ethereum Price</p></div>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" target="_blank" rel="noopener follow" data-wpel-link="exclude">chart</a>, Ethereum price is clearly trading near the $1,250 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). Overall, ether price could start a recovery wave if it clears the $1,220 resistance zone.</p>
<h2>Technical indicators</h2>
<p>4 hours MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is now losing momentum in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4 hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ETH/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Key Support Levels – $1,150, followed by the $1,100 zone.</p>
<p>Key Resistance$ Levels – $1,220 and $1,250.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dennis Kelleher – one of DC’s top figures in the fields of banking and finance – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-fiction-of-crypto-was-visible-to-all-who-wanted-to-see-one-of-dcs-top-financial-reform-voices-tears-into-the-greed-and-fomo-that-led-to-the-ftx-collapse/ar-AA146KTG" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">claims to have seen the</a> FTX collapse coming a mile away, and he’s not surprised by the aftermath it’s led to.</p>
<h2>Kelleher Believes Crypto Won&#8217;t Survive</h2>
<p>FTX was one of the world’s top digital currency exchanges. Beginning in 2019, the company rose to prominence rather quickly and has since become an embarrassment in the space. The firm initially sought help from Binance and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">looked to the larger competitor</a> to buy it out after it was allegedly dealing with a liquidity crunch. After the larger corporation said “no,” FTX had <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">no choice but to</a> file for bankruptcy, and Sam Bankman-Fried – the person who ran the firm – has since resigned.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sad sight that’s going to mar the crypto space for some time, but Kelleher says it was greed and fear of missing out (FOMO) that led to the company’s collapse, and he thinks these two emotions are likely going to cause the entire crypto space to suffer greatly.</p>
<p>In a recent statement, Kelleher explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one should be shocked by FTX’s demise. The fiction of crypto was visible to all who wanted to see.</p></blockquote>
<p>His statement continued with a rather scathing review of crypto. He claims there is no valid use for digital currencies and that the arena does not hold ground when compared to traditional banking institutions. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>To this day there is no valid use case for crypto, and no amount of personality cult or hype will change that fact.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a longtime skeptic of digital currencies, Kelleher believes that what happened with FTX will likely happen with many other trading platforms. He believes the digital currency space is nothing but a “delusion,” with traders believing in allegedly big payouts and significant exchanges. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>FTX, [Sam Bankman-Fried], and crypto spent enormous amounts of money to make sure many people (including smart and influential people who should have known better) had gigantic financial incentives to not understand, see, or question the fiction and fraud that is crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>He even argues that regulation is not likely to make any real significant difference in the space, which he feels is doomed to fail in the long term. He claims it has become “lawless” by choice, and he doesn’t see any hope for the arena’s survival or growth.</p>
<h2>So Much Suffering</h2>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than being a legitimate business that constructively engages with regulators and complies with the laws and rules as other legitimate companies do, crypto’s chosen strategy is to fight against regulators and regulation, while trying to get the easiest regulator and most favorable legislation.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, assets like BTC have greatly suffered from FTX’s fall and are now trading in the mid-$16K range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Money is fluid by nature. It’s designed to be used and moved, not sitting stagnant, losing value with inflation. <a href="https://fluidity.money/?utm_source=PR+Campaign&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=CryptoMode&amp;utm_term=Home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Fluidity Money</a> &#8211; a protocol that rewards people for using their crypto &#8211; isn’t just gamifying DeFi. It’s <em>transforming</em> our relationship with money.</p>
<p>Fluidity Money is now on mainnet, after a successful testnet launch in February 2022, with approximately 50,000 users and millions of transactions.</p>
<p>“Fluidity’s vision is to transform how people think about spending, saving and creating wealth. The future is where people can earn money by practicing their own spending habits. We’re excited to introduce a new financial derivative to change the way people think about utility”, Shahmeer Chaudhry, Co-Founder and CEO of Fluidity.</p>
<p>Fluidity takes tokens and wraps them at a 1-to-1 ratio, while storing the original asset in a lending protocol. The accruing interest is stored in a reward pool with any on-chain transaction being eligible for a portion of the pool.</p>
<p>The opportunity to earn money with every other spend, without fees or friction, is a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>With no cost of entry, there are no losers with Fluidity. Approximately 50-70% of transactions using fluid assets will be yield-bearing. The rewards are split 80/20 between senders and receivers. Users have the chance to win life-changing money just by practicing their normal spending habits.</p>
<p>Millions of people trade crypto every day. Instead of lending, staking or locking up assets, people can use their crypto and be compensated for it.</p>
<p>“We see Fluidity becoming part of our everyday life, where people earn rewards while paying for lunch, drinks with friends, petrol, clothes or rent”, Chaudhry added.</p>
<p>Fluidity Money is accessible to everyone, with a low barrier to entry. There is a perception with Web3, investing and interest-bearing assets, that one needs sufficient capital to participate. Fluidity, however, is open to all, with no inherent cost.</p>
<p>“DeFi became so complicated. In my experience in game design, users want simplicity. Game theory is huge in the crypto space, but we haven’t seen much innovation in payments or crypto in years. We wanted to make DeFi simple, user-friendly, and easy to understand”, Chaudhry shared.</p>
<p>Financial inclusivity is important for Fluidity. People without money can’t afford to have their funds sitting idle. With Fluidity, individuals can earn rewards on purchases they’d already be making. This is the promise of Web3 – a more equitable, inclusive world that gives power back to the people. A reorganising of our money mindsets, the financial system, and society as we know it.</p>
<p>Fluidity Money successfully <a href="https://blog.fluidity.money/fluidity-announces-1-3-million-seed-round-led-by-multicoin-capital-943ee3fbe0e6?utm_source=PR+Campaign&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=CryptoMode&amp;utm_term=Seed-Fund" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">raised $1.3 million in a seed round</a>. Some of the investors include Multicoin Capital, Solana Ventures, Circle, and MakerDAO.</p>
<p>“For the past 18 months, we’ve been working closely with developers and stakeholders, to launch Fluidity on mainnet. It’s now officially here”, Chaudhry shared.</p>
<p>Like many other Web3 initiatives, Fluidity Money aims to challenge the status quo. Instead of sitting idle to accruing interest, Fluidity empowers crypto users to engage in their unique blockchain incentive layer, rewarding money on the move.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://fluidity.money/?utm_source=PR+Campaign&amp;utm_medium=Article&amp;utm_campaign=CryptoMode&amp;utm_term=Home" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">newly revamped website</a> to start engaging with Fluidity Money and increase your potential to be rewarded without any risks and fees.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heat Bit – a company that recently launched a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/heatbit-world-first-heater-mines-232500993.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">personal heater to be sold</a> to customers – has announced that its product comes with a twist… It’s the first personal heater out there designed to mine bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Heat Bit Keeps You Warm&#8230; and Wealthy</h2>
<p>Heat Bit initially launched a Kickstarter campaign for the device last year. After getting all the proper safety licenses in place and making the money it needed, the product was unveiled last October and is now available for purchase by members of the public. The interesting news is that while it can make you warm as temperatures drop, it can also add to your bitcoin wallet and give you digital riches.</p>
<p>Alex Busarov – the co-founder of Heat Bit – released the following statement about the product’s development and release:</p>
<blockquote><p>After a three-year development cycle, we are thrilled to ship the first Heat Bits to our loyal customers. Our engineers have put in blood, sweat, and tears to revolutionize mining this way. Over the next few weeks. all buyers will finally have their Heat Bits delivered… It is important to understand that Heat Bit is about supporting the decentralized money revolution. Bitcoin is supposed to be the cryptocurrency where everyone makes a small contribution. True decentralization is many users, each contributing their little bit, not the large mining farms we see these days.</p></blockquote>
<p>The company is now planning a new fundraising campaign to help expand the machine’s breadth and domain. Busarov concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have some amazing support from our customers. I would much rather have them own a piece of the company in the spirit of decentralization and community drive.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would all be fine and dandy except for one big thing… The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-companies-really-have-it-hard/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto mining sector is dying</a>, and it’s dying fast. This raises the question as to whether Heat Bit was correct in seeking to release its product now. Should things have waited a bit longer? Should the release of the product have been delayed or postponed so the space could heal itself?</p>
<p>Over the past several months, the crypto industry has been on its last legs. Bitcoin, for example, is now trading in the mid-$16,000 range. That’s a near 80 percent drop from the all-time high it achieved in November of last year. Many other forms of crypto have followed suit, and the digital currency arena has lost more than $2 trillion in valuation.</p>
<h2>Will the Space Come Back?</h2>
<p>Thanks in part to falling prices, the crypto mining space has been experiencing all kinds of problems, and the arena is suffering like it never has before. Many companies have simply exited the space or are stepping back some given it’s been hard just to break even.</p>
<p>While the new product is intriguing, will it be enough to bring people back to mining?</p>

<h2>Crypto.com Is Raising All Kinds of Questions</h2>
<p>The world was shocked in mid-November when one of the largest digital currency exchanges out there came crashing down and was forced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">into bankruptcy proceedings</a> due to an alleged liquidity crunch. The firm was hit hard with creditors requesting that payments be returned, and it appears many investors have seen their money go up in smoke within a matter of days. It’s been a crazy and rather depressing sight to see, and one that’s likely to haunt the crypto space for some time.</p>
<p>But the world of sports and crypto appears to be staying strong. Proof of that exists in the idea that the AFL is not moving on from its work with Crypto.com. In addition, the CEO of the digital trading platform Kris Marszalek went online to engage in an “ask me anything” (AMA) conversation as a means of keeping people assured that his firm is not heading in a similar direction.</p>
<p>Throughout the event, he commented that FTX has ultimately set the space back “a good couple of years,” though he mentioned that his own Crypto.com is the most “regulated company” in the digital currency sector and that his firm boasts financial licenses in Europe, Canada, Singapore, the UK, and Australia where the AFL is based.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our platform is performing business as usual. People are depositing, people are drawing, [and] people are trading. We never engaged as a company in any irresponsible lending practices. We never took any third-party risks, we do not run a hedge fund, we do not trade customers assets, [and] we always kept one-to-one reserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further stated that the company’s balance sheet was very strong and that the firm was not likely to face any serious financial issues in the coming future. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been saying it for a few years, and what I can say is that we will do what we’ve always done. We will prove people wrong with our actions and not our words. So, in a couple of months, all these guys are going to look bad for throwing allegations that have absolutely no substance.</p></blockquote>
<p>While he’s confident in the company’s direction, other executives in the space – such as Changpeng Zhao of Binance fame – have stated that things aren’t looking so good given the company recently sent hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH off its exchange.</p>
<h2>Telling People to Steer Clear</h2>

<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After forming a top near the $0.0920 zone, stellar lumen price started a steady decline against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair formed a high near $0.0911 before it started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a move below the $0.0820 and $0.0800 levels. The price even settled below the $0.080 level and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-extends-decline-why-bears-are-in-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. A low was formed near $0.0725 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor move above the $0.0750 level.</p>

<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, ripple price saw a bearish reaction from the $0.3950 zone against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair declined below the $0.3800 support zone to move into a bearish zone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FTX collapse has been all everyone’s talked about over the last month or so, and it appears that many people and businesses that were once tied to the now failed exchange are looking to distance themselves from it and quickly.</p>
<h2>The Miami Heat Is Ending Its Relationship with FTX</h2>
<p>One of them is the FTX Arena, which hosts home games for the Miami Heat. It’s now looking to end its relationship with the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/miami-heat-will-rename-ftx-arena-after-cryptocurrency-exchange-collapses/ar-AA140KAR" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">disgraced trading platform</a> and change its name fast. In a statement, the team said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Miami-Dade County and the Miami Heat are immediately taking action to terminate our business relationships with FTX, and we will be working together to find a new naming rights partner for the arena.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Miami Heat is famous for having basketball players such as Shaquille O’Neal on its roster at one point. Spokespeople for the Miami Heat have stated that the situation surrounding FTX is “extremely disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>FTX gained a lot of fame in the industry for its use of traditional television commercials and sponsorships. The company has also formed heavy relationships with sports stars, many of which were featured in their small-screen ads. One such figure was Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback for the New England Patriots. He was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tom-brady-featured-in-new-ftx-crypto-commercial/" data-wpel-link="internal">seen in a commercial</a> for the firm a few months back that poked fun at the digital currency mining process.</p>
<p>Prominently armed with a flamethrower, Brady fired a hot blaze at a nearby block of ice. Once the ice had melted, a bitcoin was visible to the audience. Brady has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sports-stars-stephen-curry-and-tom-brady-join-the-ftx-exchange-family-as-ambassadors/" data-wpel-link="internal">also agreed to serve</a> as a brand ambassador in the past to the company.</p>
<p>But was once all money, fun, and games for FTX has quickly turned into embarrassment as the company has collapsed rather suddenly, taking many players’ money with it. The firm first began experiencing issues in mid-November and went to Binance for help, claiming it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">was experiencing a liquidity</a> crunch. This meant it didn’t have enough funds on hand to stay afloat, and it asked the larger enterprise to engage in a buyout.</p>
<p>From there, it looked <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">like a major acquisition</a> was about to happen, though it never did as Changpeng Zhao, the man behind Binance, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">eventually backed away from</a> the deal, claiming FTX’s problems were simply too big to manage. From there, the company <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">has fallen into bankruptcy</a> and the head executive of the company, Sam Bankman-Fried, has resigned.</p>
<h2>So Much Controversy</h2>
<p>It’s a sad and ugly sight as what was considered one of the top crypto exchanges in the industry has now fallen into the same ranks as enterprises like the Celsius Network and Three Arrows Capital.</p>
<p>At this time, FTX-based controversy continues as many are <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/half-a-billion-dollars-goes-missing-from-ftx-exchange/" data-wpel-link="internal">wondering how half a billion</a> in crypto funds could have gone missing from the exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the collapse of famed crypto exchange FTX, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is planning a new set of protocols that <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-is-planning-this-cryptocurrency-safeguard-changpeng-zhao-tells-benzinga-in-twitter-space/ar-AA146m0o" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">would help exchanges</a> show their customers what reserves they have in place.</p>
<h2>Vitalik Buterin Says Exchanges Need to Be Clear</h2>
<p>One of the big things that allegedly led to the fall of FTX was the sudden and unexpected “liquidity crunch” the company seemed to endure last-minute. It was stated in a series of messages online that Sam Bankman-Fried, the man tasked with running the firm, had <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">reached out to his bigger</a> counterpart Binance to claim that the company was experiencing a sudden lack of funds, and that Binance stood to benefit by buying the smaller company out.</p>
<p>For a while, it looked <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">like this was going</a> to happen, though Binance later sent out an announcement saying that it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">would not be moving</a> forward with the acquisition given FTX was dealing with far too many issues, and there was nothing its staff could do. As such, FTX later fell into disarray.</p>
<p>To ensure that this never happens again, Buterin thinks it’s important for all crypto exchanges to be able to show from the get-go that they have money in place to support themselves even in the direst circumstances. He says this will help build customer trust and allow them to see what they’re dealing with in terms of finding companies to trade through.</p>
<p>Right now, Buterin wants to use Binance as a guinea pig of sorts, in which the exchange is used to test out the new series of protocols. Changpeng Zhao – the man behind the trading platform – said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I think there are no suspicious activities related to us. For other players, I have not seen their books, so [I] cannot comment, but it is not a very good thing to do. They may or may not have a valid reason to do so, but I really don’t know… We expect it (the Merkle tree) in a couple of weeks and therefore, we have published all our cold wallet addresses. It is not as good as a Merkle tree, but at least users know how [many] funds we have.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Zhao Doesn&#8217;t Want to Play God</h2>
<p>Zhao has faced some criticism for previously selling his FTT tokens, FTT being the native cryptocurrency of the FTX exchange. He has defended his actions, claiming to have only sold a small portion. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, I think we acted in very ethical ways&#8230; We will try to help FTX users, but it was the users who chose to use FTX, right? We don’t want to create a situation where if anything goes down in the industry, we [need] to pay for it. That is not right for our users.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is adamant that Binance cannot step in and solve every problem in the industry.</p>
