<li>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink was all praise for BTC in a recent interview.</li>
<li>The asset manager refiled for a Spot Bitcoin ETF earlier this week.</li>
<li>Bitcoin is currently up close to 90% versus the start of the year.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> made a new 52-week high this morning after Larry Fink &ndash; the Chief Executive of BlackRock Inc agreed that it was a valuable international asset.</p>
<h2>Fink is now constructive on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Fink had once dubbed the BTC an index of money laundering. But in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6330640643112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fox Business</a>, he was all praise for the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>
<blockquote><p>I do believe the role of crypto is digitalising gold in many ways. Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation or the onerous problem of any one country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this week, the asset manager <a href="https://decrypt.co/147177/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-sec-coinbase-surveillance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refiled</a> for a Spot Bitcoin ETF after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for more clarity on its initial application.</p>
<p>BlackRock Inc currently has about $9.5 trillion worth of assets under management.</p>
<h2>Is a Spot Bitcoin ETF coming soon?</h2>
<p>Note that BlackRock has a history of getting regulatory approval for nearly every exchange-traded fund it has ever filed for.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s important considering many experts forecast a <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/anthony-pompliano-sec-approve-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> to unlock further upside in Bitcoin. The digital currency is already up close to 90% for the year at writing.</p>
<p>BlackRock has already made money investing in BTC and expects the crypto asset to grow further moving forward. According to CEO Larry Fink:</p>
<blockquote><p>The foundation of BlackRock is about hope. You have for retirement because you believe tomorrow is better than today.</p></blockquote>

<li>The conference will run from December 4 to December 10.</li>
<li>The conference will include hackathons, side events, parties, a headline conference, and an ETHIndia hackathon.</li>
<li>The conference is organized by Hashed Emergent, a subsidiary of Hashed, a prominent web3 venture fund from South Korea.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hashed Emergent has announced that it will host the first <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> conference week in India in December. The week-long series of web3-focused events will be held in Bangalore, the heart of India&rsquo;s tech and startup scene, rightfully known as the &ldquo;Silicon Valley of the East.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new conference dubbed India Blockchain Week (IBW) aims at becoming India&rsquo;s first world-class, multi-chain web3 conference with a pan-industry agenda. It will reflect India&rsquo;s increasing role in web3, expressed both in terms of crypto adoption and the exciting startups originating from the sub-continent.</p>
<p>Expressing his excitement about the upcoming event, Managing Partner of Hashed Emergent, Tak Lee, said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to bring the first world-class, pan-industry and multi-chain web3 conference to India, finally giving it the attention it has always deserved. Bangalore ranks among the most prolific startup hubs worldwide, and Indian startups in web3 have made a considerable impact on the industry, spearheaded by multiple hugely successful protocols and products. We believe that IBW will quickly become one of the most interesting and diverse gathering places for the crypto industry.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>The India Blockchain Week timetable</h2>
<p>The conference will have a week-long series of web3-focused events lasting from December 4-10.</p>
<p>It will start with a &ldquo;warm-up&rdquo; session on Monday and Tuesday, December 4-5. This will include hackathons, side events and parties.</p>
<p>The IBW headline conference will be held on December 6-7, or Wednesday and Thursday succeeded by the ETHIndia hackathon which set a record last year as one of the largest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> hackathons with over 2,000 attendees and 450+ project submissions.</p>
<p>The main venue of the IBW conference will be the Sheraton Grand Hotel in Whitefield, a major IT and commercial hub of Bangalore.</p>
<h2>MarketAcross will be IBW&rsquo;s lead media</h2>
<p>MarketAcross, the world&rsquo;s leading web3 PR and marketing agency known for its work in the region with companies like Polygon and Hashed Emergent, will be joining the event as the global lead media.</p>
<p>MarketAcross has served as the official media partner in multiple web3 events including the Korea Blockchain Week, WebX, Paris Blockchain Week, and the IVS Kyoto.</p>
<p>India has rapidly emerged as one of the leading adopters of web3 despite the numerous regulatory hurdles seeing that the Indian government has been historically sceptical to crypto and is now positioning itself for globally harmonized regulation at the G20 Summit.</p>
<p>While the list of speakers at the IBW headline conference is yet to be revealed, Harsh Emergent has confirmed that it will include prominent local and global leaders within the blockchain industry.</p>

<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinjournal.net/news/stay-away-from-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-despite-discount-narrowing-to-10-month-low/">Stay away from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust despite discount narrowing to 10-month low</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://coinjournal.net">CoinJournal</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has persistently traded at a discount to its net asset value</li>
<li dir="ltr">The discount has narrowed to its lowest mark since September off hope the fund is more likely to be converted to an ETF</li>
<li dir="ltr">The entire GBTC debacle represents the mess that is the institutional regulatory climate in the US</li>
<li dir="ltr">Spot ETFs are a question of when rather than if, and such investment vehicles will then be a thing of the past</li>
<li dir="ltr">That won&rsquo;t assuage frustration of GBTC investors, who have been caught badly as alternative Bitcoin investment vehicles have come online and demand for the trust has dried up</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">Among the interesting aspects of the fallout from the slew of recent spot Bitcoin ETF filings is how it affects the controversial Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The trust has been flying, up 56% in the three weeks since Blackrock&rsquo;s ETF filing was announced.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14353132">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">Notably, this means it has significantly outpaced its underlying asset, Bitcoin. That sounds like a good thing, but it really summises the problem with this investment vehicle that has done nothing but frustrate investors in recent years, but we will get to that in a moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have plotted the movement of the GBTC against Bitcoin itself in the next chart, highlighting the outperformance the Trust has had since the ETF filing, with Bitcoin itself up &ldquo;only&rdquo; 21%.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14353266">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<h2 dir="ltr">Grayscale discount to net asset value narrowing but still enormous</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The trust&rsquo;s discount to net asset value has also narrowed to its smallest mark since September, now below 30%. This comes as investors bet the trust is now more likely to finally be allowed to convert to an ETF.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/06/06/1688650389110-2e2da1ba-ffda-469d-89b2-467982f18dd6.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="189"></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;Should this conversion occur, the discount would narrow to near zero, as funds would then be allowed to flow in and out of the vehicle without affecting the underlying assets. For the time being, while it remains a trust, there is no way to get Bitcoin out of GBTC. This, coupled with steep fees (2% annually) means that a heavy discount has persisted.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In truth, the very existence of the Grayscale trust is a black mark on the sector. The discount it trades at is farcical &ndash; even following the recent narrowing, a 30% delta is an enormous chasm, one that is hurting investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The outsized assets under management &ndash; essentially trapped due to the closed-fund nature &ndash; feels like a throwback to the days when anyone and everyone wanted to get exposure to Bitcoin through whatever means necessary. Grayscale was the only shop in town, and such was the demand for Bitcoin, coupled with that monopolistic power, that it even traded at a premium for much of its early history.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, as more mediums through which Bitcoin exposure can be had have come online, the premium has flipped to a discount, and that discount has become <em>large.&nbsp;</em>It is probably fair to say that investors displayed a lack of due diligence for how the fund works, another throwback to the up-only bull market of days gone by.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Without donning a captain hindsight outfit, there was always going to be competitor firms coming online and the premium was bound to come under pressure. An investment in GBTC essentially amounted to two things: a bet on Bitcoin, and a bet that the trust would be converted into an ETF <em>quickly.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">But at that, perhaps sympathy can be shown to investors. Investment management firm Osprey Funds has a similar product, and earlier this year sued Grayscale, alleging that its competitor misled investors about how likely it was that GBTC would be converted into an ETF. This, they allege, is how they captured such a share of the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Only because of its false and misleading advertising and promotion has Grayscale been able to maintain to date approximately 99.5% market share in a two-participant market despite charging more than four times the asset management fee that Osprey charges for its services&rdquo;, the suit alleges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Whether Grayscale knew of the regulatory difficulty it would face or not, it has tried and failed for years to convert the vehicle into an ETF. Last year, it sued the SEC itself, declaring the latest rejection &ldquo;arbitrary&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Institutional climate turning</h2>
<p dir="ltr">My thoughts on the trust overall remain the same. I believe it represents a terrible investment (obviously), and its mere existence is only a byproduct of the regulatory travails that the sector has struggled with. There is no reason to even consider buying this unless there is quite literally no other vehicle through which to gain Bitcoin exposure.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">There will come a day when all this squabbling over trusts and ETFs will likely be nothing but a throwback of a more uncertain time. But time is a luxury that many investors don&rsquo;t have, and Grayscale has been a horrendous investment, typical in a lot of ways of the travails the space has had in bridging the gap to become a respected mainstream financial asset.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Not only is the discount jarring as it is, but it widened beyond 50% in the aftermath of the FTX collapse as it emerged that crypto broker Genesis was in deep trouble. Genesis&rsquo; parent company is Digital Currency Group (DCG), the same parent company of Grayscale. Genesis eventually filed for bankruptcy in January.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This sparked concern around the safety of Grayscale&rsquo;s reserves, something which they company did not exactly comfort investors about when it refused to provide on-chain proof of reserves, citing &ldquo;security concerns&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">6) Coinbase frequently performs on-chain validation. Due to security concerns, we do not make such on-chain wallet information and confirmation information publicly available through a cryptographic Proof-of-Reserve, or other advanced cryptographic accounting procedure.</p>
<p>&mdash; Grayscale (@Grayscale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1593737746413244417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2022</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">While the furore over reserves has quietened down, the episode is yet another stark reminder of the oft-repeated (but perhaps not often enough) phrase: &ldquo;not your keys, not your coins&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The problem for institutions to date is that they have had trouble accessing Bitcoin directly for a variety of reasons, primarily regulatory-related. While spot ETFs will also technically violate the &ldquo;not your keys&rdquo; mantra, with prudent regulatory oversight and a strong custodian, this should be a safe way for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">That would end all this nonsense (and that really is the right word) such as trusts trading at 30% discounts, and give investors a secure avenue through which to put their views on Bitcoin into conviction. That may still be a long way off, but if demand for these products remains, it&rsquo;s only a matter of time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Matrixport believes that Bitcoin could rally to $125k by the end of next year.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The crypto services provider points out that Bitcoin has already touched its bottom after rallying to the $31k level last month.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin could hit $125k by the end of next year</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is up by more than 50% since the start of the year. However, some market experts believe that Bitcoin could rally higher over the next 12-18 months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto services provider Matrixport believes that Bitcoin could rally as high as $125,000 by the end of 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Matrixport&rsquo;s forecast is based on its data that indicates a multi-month bull market, resulting in a massive rise in the market value of Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Matrixport, Bitcoin reaching the $31k level indicated the end of the bear market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While speaking with CoinDesk, Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, stated that</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;On June 22, 2023, bitcoin made a new one-year high, marking the first time in a year. This signal has historically indicated the end of bear markets and the start of new crypto bull markets. If history is any guide, bitcoin prices could climb by +123% over twelve months and by +310% over eighteen months &ndash; based on the average return of the signals triggered in 2015, 2019 and 2020. That would lift prices to $65,539 in twelve months and $125,731 over eighteen months.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Thielen described the 2012 signal and the subsequent 5,285% price rise in 2013 as an unusual bull market.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin Surged By 50% YTD</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has surged by more than 50% since the start of the year. It started the year trading just around the $15k level, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> now at $31,192 per coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Matriport&rsquo;s forecast will coincide with the fourth halving. The next halving will see the reduction in the new coins paid per block to 3.25 BTC from 6.5 BTC and will take place in March/April 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<li>The United States Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has concluded investigations into Celsius Network.</li>
<li>The CFTC has found the former CEO and Celsius Network guilty of breaking several rules before the company collapsed.</li>
<li>The price of CLE, the native cryptocurrency of Celsius has lost 10% in value after the revelation.</li>
</ul>
<p>After investigations, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has concluded that cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network and its <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-ceo-alex-mashinsky-resigns/">former CEO Alex Mashinsky</a> broke US laws before it collapsed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the CFTC report, the findings indicate that Celsius deceived investors and neglected to register with the CFTC. The CFTC may file a lawsuit in federal court within the month if the majority of its commissioners concur with these findings.</p>
<h2>New York Attorney General already sued Celsius</h2>
<p>Letitia James, the attorney general of New York, has already filed a lawsuit following the demise of Celsius Network. James alleged that Mashinsky misrepresented the company&rsquo;s financial situation and made false claims about the platform&rsquo;s security.</p>
<p>James&rsquo; lawsuit charges Mashinsky with defrauding millions of investors, including more than 26,000 residents of New York, in a lawsuit that was filed in January. It states that Mashinsky made &ldquo;false and misleading representations&rdquo; in order to persuade clients to deposit enormous sums of money with the crypto lender.</p>
<h2>What really happened to Celsius?</h2>
<p>Celsius was founded in 2017 and it shot into the limelight during the Covid-19 pandemic when it introduced loan offerings and tempting interest rates for cryptocurrency deposits.</p>
<p>Mashinsky frequently presented these products as less risky options compared to those provided by conventional banks. However, the Celsius market boom did not last long since the demise of Terra&rsquo;s algorithmic stablecoin UST and a slump in the cryptocurrency market had disastrous effects on its business.</p>
<p>Although Celsius initially denied making losses after the Terra Luna collapse, it faced a wave of customer withdrawals. Withdrawals were eventually frozen in June 2022, and a month later, <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-cel-price-on-the-decline/">bankruptcy protection was sought</a>.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors in Manhattan are, however, also looking into Celsius in accordance with its bankruptcy filings.</p>
<p>In March this year, the court allowed <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-customers-begin-withdrawing-funds-eight-months-after-bankruptcy-filing/">Celsius withdrawals</a> to resume and in June the crypto lender was <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/court-allows-celsius-to-sell-altcoins-for-btc-eth-starting-july-1/">allowed</a> to convert its altcoin holdings into <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-cel-price-on-the-decline/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase Global Inc</a> has been an absolute delight for shareholders over the past thirty days but a sharp downturn is likely moving forward, as per a Piper Sandler analyst.</p>
<h2>Avoid Coinbase stock due to regulatory uncertainty</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, Patrick Moley downgraded the crypto exchange to &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; and lowered his price target as well to $60 that signals a 25% downside from here.</p>
<p>The analyst turned dovish primarily because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the Nasdaq-listed firm last month for operating as an unregistered exchange (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/the-sec-strikes-again-first-binance-now-coinbase/">read more</a>).</p>
<p>In a research note today, he attributed the recent surge in Coinbase stock to prominent asset managers filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF and the consequent benefit to crypto prices but said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rising crypto prices have not translated to increased trading volumes for COIN in recent quarters and the timing of a Spot Bitcoin ETF approval is anyone&rsquo;s guess.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Coinbase Global will report a weak second quarter</h2>
<p>Moley expects the crypto company to report monthly transacting users and trading volumes at a two-year low in its second financial quarter.</p>
<p>The Piper Sandler analyst agreed that Coinbase Global will eventually emerge as a major player within the crypto space but said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;d like to see more progress on regulatory front and a convincing turnaround in underlying fundamentals of the business before becoming more positive on Coinbase stock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the regulatory crackdown, though, Coinbase increased its <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/coinbases-market-share-is-on-the-rise-in-spite-of-sec-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market share</a> last month to a new high since January 2023, as per data from Kaiko &ndash; a digital assets data provider.</p>
