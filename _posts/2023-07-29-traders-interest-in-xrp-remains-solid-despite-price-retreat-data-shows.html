The enduring allure of XRP, despite market volatility, may be evidence of its continued relevance, as it has continued to attract the interest of traders and investors equally. Even as the dust settles after Ripple&#8217;s recent victory jubilation, the cryptocurrency market remains keen on XRP. Kaiko, a provider of market data on digital assets, reports that the open interest ratio on XRP futures trades on prominent exchanges remains quite impressive. Recently, the crypto market has experienced a pervasive price reversal. Despite the pullbacks, traders&#8217; interest in the Ripple cryptocurrency remained remarkably high, according to Kaiko. At the time of writing, XRP was in the red in all timeframes, trading at $$0.712, down a measly 0.02% in the last 24 hours, and a considerable 8.4% in the last seven days, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows. Given these numbers, XRP is still able to shine in another key department. XRP in crimson in all timeframes during the weekend.

This reliability suggests that the XRP coin is actively traded in a healthy market. This percentage is significantly greater than the market average, indicating strong liquidity and sustained interest from traders and investors. On prominent exchanges, the volume-to-open-interest ratio is also used to measure trading activity. When the interest metric is high, it indicates that more purchasers and sellers are willing to trade the token, which indicates speculative interest. A favorable volume-to-open interest ratio could be a signal for market participants to trade in such a token.
