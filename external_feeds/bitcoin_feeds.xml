Viewing retail trading of cryptocurrencies as more akin to gambling rather than a financial service, the U.K. Treasury Committee stated that “Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have no intrinsic value and serve no useful social purpose, while consuming large amounts of energy and being used by criminals in scams, fraud, and money laundering.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>UK Lawmakers Propose Regulating Crypto Like Gambling</h2>
<p>The U.K. Parliament announced Wednesday that the Treasury Committee has called for &#8220;consumer trading in unbacked crypto to be regulated as gambling.&#8221; The Treasury Committee is appointed by the House of Commons to examine the expenditure, administration, and policy of HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs, and associated public bodies. Eleven members of parliament (MPs) currently serve as members of the Committee.</p>
<p>Citing a report titled &#8220;Regulating Crypto&#8221; which the Treasury Committee published on Wednesday, the Parliament explained: &#8220;The cross-party Committee of MPs highlights that cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have no intrinsic value and serve no useful social purpose, while consuming large amounts of energy and being used by criminals in scams, fraud and money laundering.&#8221; The announcement further details:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Committee concludes that cryptocurrencies pose significant risks to consumers, given their price volatility and the risk of losses. Given retail trading in unbacked crypto more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, the MPs call on the government to regulate it as such.</p></blockquote>
<p>The chair of the Treasury Committee, Parliament Member Harriett Baldwin, commented: “The events of 2022 have highlighted the risks posed to consumers by the cryptoasset industry, large parts of which remain a wild west. Effective regulation is clearly needed … By betting on these unbacked ‘tokens’, consumers should be aware that all their money could be lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition, the U.K. Parliament noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Committee is also concerned that regulating consumer crypto trading as a financial service – as proposed by the government – will create a ‘halo’ effect, leading consumers to believe this activity is safe and protected, when it is not.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.K. is currently working on legislation to regulate the crypto sector as it strives to become a “<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rishi-sunak-becomes-uk-prime-minister-make-britain-global-crypto-investment-hub/">global hub</a>” for crypto assets. In February, the British government published a proposed regulatory framework for crypto. Andrew Griffith, Economic Secretary to the U.K. Treasury, told CNBC in April that specific crypto regulation could come into force within a year or so.</p>

It will happen. It has always happened,” he warned.</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;American Dollar&#8217;s Time Is Coming to an End,&#8217; Says Rogers</h2>
<p>Famed investor Jim Rogers shared why he expects the U.S. dollar to lose its status as the world&#8217;s reserve currency in an interview with Sputnik, published Wednesday. Rogers is George Soros’ former business partner who co-founded the Quantum Fund and Soros Fund Management.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many friends of America are moving, trying to find something to compete with and ultimately replace the U.S. dollar. It will happen. It has always happened,” the famous investor began. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>America&#8217;s time is coming to an end. The American dollar&#8217;s time is coming to an end.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that the dominance of the U.S. dollar will inevitably decline since “No currency has been on top more than 150 years.” Reiterating that &#8220;Nobody has always been on top, so it&#8217;s always happened,&#8221; he pointed out that “People have moved away from whatever currency it is.”</p>
<h2>Why Countries Are Moving Away From USD</h2>
<p>Rogers proceeded to detail the reasons why countries are increasingly moving away from the U.S. dollar. The first reason is that the U.S. is the largest debtor nation in the history of the world. &#8220;Many people are starting to say: &#8216;Wait a minute, I don&#8217;t know if we want to use that money, because it will have a problem someday,'&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>His remarks coincided with the U.S. grappling with a debt crisis that could lead to a default on its debt obligations as early as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">June 1</a>. Some have warned that a U.S. default could spark a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/harvard-economics-professor-us-default-could-spark-global-financial-crisis/">global financial crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Another major reason Rogers mentioned concerns sanctions. The U.S. and its allies have imposed severe sanctions on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, with the most <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-expands-unprecedented-global-sanctions-on-russia-with-over-300-new-targets/">recent round of sanctions</a> announced on Friday. Reiterating his previous <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-end-of-us-dollar-washington-does-not-play-fair-anymore/">warning</a> regarding the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-to-play-lesser-role-due-to-its-weaponization-digital-currencies-economist-jeffrey-sachs-says/">weaponization</a> of the U.S. dollar, Rogers described:</p>
<blockquote><p>The world’s international currency is supposed to be completely neutral. Anybody can use it for anything you want. But now Washington is changing the rules. And if they get angry at you, they cut you off.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Russia has expedited the process of de-dollarization, stating: &#8220;Even America’s friends are worried that something could happen to them. And so the world is moving more rapidly.”</p>

<p>While emphasizing that “The world is trying to accelerate its move away from the U.S. dollar” and many countries are trying to find a USD alternative, Rogers said: &#8220;So far, the world hasn&#8217;t found something to replace or even compete with the dollar.” Commenting on whether the Chinese yuan could become the world’s dominant currency, he said: &#8220;The Chinese currency, sure you would think, but the Chinese don&#8217;t let you buy and sell the currency, it’s not completely converted.”</p>
<p>One of the initiatives aimed at challenging the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance is the proposed BRICS currency. The BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">collaborating</a> to establish a common currency that would reduce their dependence on the U.S. dollar. The leaders of the BRICS countries are set to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">discuss</a> this proposal during their upcoming summit in August. The potential success of a BRICS currency is widely seen as a factor that could undermine the dominance of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>A growing number of countries are following the BRICS&#8217; de-dollarization lead, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indonesia-is-following-brics-de-dollarization-lead-says-central-bank-governor/">Indonesia</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelas-president-declares-inevitable-shift-away-from-us-dollar-in-de-dollarization-push/">Venezuela</a>. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">Ten Southeast Asian countries</a> also recently agreed to encourage the use of national currencies in an effort to reduce their reliance on the U.S. dollar and other Western financial systems.</p>

The famous author also said a financial pandemic has started and corruption is high, reiterating his recommendation to buy gold, silver, and bitcoin. </strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Believes a Crash Landing Is Coming</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, is back with more warnings about the U.S. economy. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries. Kiyosaki tweeted Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Soft landing? Hard landing? Or Crash landing? I say crash landing. I hope I am wrong yet that is what I believe.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Corruption is high & leaders corrupt. Buy gold, silver, bitcoin. Still best insurance against corruption & incompetence,&#x201D; his tweet continues. Kiyosaki has voiced his concerns many times regarding the corruption and incompetency within the U.S. government and the Federal Reserve, repeatedly emphasizing his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-everything-will-crash-plans-to-buy-more-bitcoin/">lack of trust</a> in them.</p>
<p>The renowned author issued a similar warning on March 13 about where he thinks the U.S. economy is headed. &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-crash-landing-ahead-as-bailouts-begin-advises-buying-more-bitcoin/">Crash landing ahead</a>,&#x201D; he wrote on Twitter. &#x201C;Bailouts begin. More fake money to invade sick economy. Still recommend same response. Buy more gold, silver, bitcoin.&#x201D; His tweet followed the U.S. government bailing out collapsed banks. In a follow-up tweet, he stressed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-regional-banks-are-being-wiped-out-calls-fed-criminal/">regional banks are being wiped out</a>, calling the Federal Reserve &#x201C;criminal.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Last week, Kiyosaki also cautioned that a crash is here, tweeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Financial pandemic started. Crash is now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Multiple people have similarly stated that the U.S. economy is at risk of a crash landing, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-economy-at-risk-of-crash-landing-allianz-warns/">Allianz&#x2019;s analysts</a> and economist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-david-rosenberg-warns-of-crash-landing-and-recession-citing-fed-data/">David Rosenberg</a>.</p>

<p>Moreover, Kiyosaki previously warned about <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-dying-warns-of-hyperinflation-death-of-us-dollar/">hyperinflation</a> and the death of the U.S. dollar. He believes that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-fed-rate-hikes-will-crash-stocks-bonds-real-estate-and-us-dollar/">Fed rate hikes</a> will crash the USD as well as stock, bond, and real estate markets. He also made predictions about the global economy, tweeting in March that the world economy is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-world-economy-on-the-verge-of-collapse-warns-of-bank-runs-frozen-savings-bail-ins/">on the verge of collapse</a>.</p>
<p>The acclaimed author has consistently advocated for gold, silver, and bitcoin. In February, he expressed his belief that these three investments are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-stocks-bonds-mutual-funds-says-bitcoin-best-for-unstable-times/">best for unstable times</a>. He predicts that by 2025, the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">reach $500,000</a>, while gold and silver will reach $5,000 and $500 respectively.</p>

The report emphasizes the formation of a vast Eurasian regional alliance that excludes Western involvement, with the aim of fostering greater collaboration and “reformatting the global economic architecture.”</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS, EAEU, SCO to Discuss Moving Beyond Western Boundaries</h2>
<p>Russia Briefing, in its May 17, 2023 publication, <a href="https://www.russia-briefing.com/news/brics-eaeu-sco-to-discuss-integration-at-the-eurasian-economic-forum.html/">unveiled</a> an interesting development involving the convergence of several prominent nations. The leaders of the BRICS nations — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — are scheduled to convene with policymakers hailing from the Eurasian Economic Union free trade group (EAEU). Notably, the EAEU comprises Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. The primary objective of this gathering is to deliberate upon the prospects of integration with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).</p>

<p>Set to unfold on May 24-25, the city of Moscow will play host to the second annual <a href="https://forum.eaeunion.org/en/">Eurasian Economic Forum</a>, serving as the backdrop for these deliberations. The Russia Briefing author claims the emergence of a “massive Eurasian regional bloc is being created without Western input.&#8221; Shedding light on the upcoming gathering, Mikhail Myasnikovich, the chairman of the board of the Eurasian Economic Commission, explained the upcoming meeting’s purpose, as quoted by the publication.</p>

<p>“The expansion of mutually beneficial cooperation between integration formats not only contributes to the growth of national economies, but can also have a significant impact on the formation of new approaches to the functioning of the global market,” Myasnikovich stated. “The space of Greater Eurasia has unique trade, economic, transport and logistics advantages, while the human potential and resources of the BRICS countries can multiply the effect of this cooperation.”</p>
<p>The EAEU chairman added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am sure that during the discussion, the experts will be able to find practical application for the combined capabilities of the EAEU, SCO and BRICS states and propose specific ways to develop interaction between interstate associations, primarily for the benefit of the citizens of these countries.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Zelensky Visits Riyadh, Saudi Foreign Minister Insists Arab Nations Will Remain Impartial to Ukraine-Russia Conflict</h2>
<p>Amidst a wave of keen interest stemming from numerous nations aspiring to join the BRICS bloc, the latest developments have caused continued intrigue. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-discuss-expansion-plan-as-membership-interest-grows/">Reports</a> indicate that 13 countries have formally expressed their desire to be part of the BRICS alliance, while an additional six nations have demonstrated an informal interest. Among the hopeful candidates stands Saudi Arabia, whose intentions became apparent last year. In April 2023, the Saudi Arabian Cabinet also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-strengthens-bond-with-china-by-joining-sco-bloc-as-dialogue-partner/">sanctioned</a> its decision to pursue membership in the SCO bloc.</p>

<p>Notably, Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelensky embarked on a <a href="https://twitter.com/Salansar1/status/1659613347438837774?s=20">recent visit</a> to Riyadh, seeking the kingdom&#8217;s support in the face of the Russian conflict. However, Saudi foreign minister prince Faisal bin Farhan clarified that Riyadh, alongside several other Arab nations, shall maintain a stance of impartiality in this ongoing dispute.</p>
<p>“Since the beginning of the crisis, the Arab countries have taken a position of positive neutrality, opening dialogue with the Russian and Ukrainian parties, while ensuring Arab relations with the two sides,” Farhan conveyed in an <a href="https://twitter.com/KSAmofaEN/status/1659737784683319304?s=20">official statement</a>.</p>

As of this writing, more than 218 blocks must be processed to fully alleviate this congestion.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#x2019;s Lingering Transaction Backlog</h2>
<p><a href="https://archive.ph/9Zw1Q#selection-1711.1-1711.6">Data collected</a> on May 20, 2023, at 1:35 p.m. Eastern Time reveals approximately 289,385 unconfirmed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transactions lingering in the backlog. This is slightly lower than the figure <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-starts-to-clear-congestion-onchain-fees-drop-by-90/">recorded</a> nine days earlier on May 11, when just over 300,000 transactions were pending miner confirmation. However, fees have fallen since then; at that time, a high-priority fee was $3 per transaction.</p>

<p>Currently, mempool.space statistics indicate that a high-priority fee stands at $1.81 per transaction, while a medium-priority fee costs $1.62. A low-priority transfer, according to the site&#x2019;s data, will amount to $1.47 per transaction on Saturday afternoon. Meanwhile, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">metrics</a> from bitinfocharts.com show the average <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transaction fee as 0.00023 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> per transaction, or $6.07. Concerning median-sized transaction fees on the Bitcoin network, bitinfocharts.com <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html">reports</a> a fee of around 0.00013 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $3.55 per transfer.</p>
<p>The persistence of Bitcoin&#x2019;s unconfirmed transfer backlog has led some to speculate that demand may eventually wane. Yet others argue that demand could endure for an extended period owing to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/surge-in-ordinal-inscriptions-ignites-exponential-growth-in-brc20-token-economy/">Ordinal inscriptions</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brc20-token-economy-thrives-amidst-crypto-downturn-surging-53-in-five-days/">BRC20 tokens</a>&#x2018; existence. Presently, about <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/d5d95c483a35f4067c7112fd3d1aabe6a8b3e4108c6e6d8aef78b729f5c7fad6i0">8,128,158</a> inscriptions can be found on the Bitcoin blockchain. Moreover, the current value of the 24,677 BRC20 tokens in existence is an <a href="https://brc-20.io">estimated $592 million</a>.</p>

<p>Despite the ongoing inscription and token trend occurring on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/litecoin-network-surges-with-activity-as-ordinal-inscriptions-drive-transaction-volume/">Litecoin</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/drc20-tokens-take-dogecoin-community-by-storm-driving-record-breaking-daily-transactions-on-the-network/">Dogecoin</a> blockchains as well, minting and transactions linked to inscriptions and BRC20s have not decelerated on the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, the Lightning Network (LN) capacity has consistently declined since our <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-makes-progress-clearing-backlog-lightning-network-capacity-channels-dropped-amid-congestion-issues/">last report</a> on the issue, which indicated the LN held 5,415 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on May 14. That figure has since contracted to <a href="https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity">5,367 BTC</a>.</p>

<h2>Keyp&#x2019;s Game Wallet: Turning Game Boy Into a Secure Hardware Wallet for Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>On May 19, Joseph Schiarizzi, a developer from the cryptocurrency company Keyp, <a href="https://twitter.com/CupOJoseph/status/1659544815204179968?s=20">unveiled</a> a project he has crafted since the beginning of the year. Schiarizzi introduced a concept that utilizes a physical Game Boy cartridge, resulting in the creation of a &#x201C;truly offline hardware wallet&#x201D; that operates independently without the need for firmware updates. To support his innovation, Schiarizzi <a href="https://twitter.com/CupOJoseph/status/1616907664872587264?s=20">shared</a> a tweet he published in January, showcasing a Game Boy game where the character can generate a seed, illustrating the potential of the endeavor.</p>
<p>&#x201C;So we&#x2019;re producing a real physical cartridge that lets you use your Game Boy as a cold storage wallet, generate mnemonic phrases and save them securely offline,&#x201D; Schiarizzi tweeted. &#x201C;No firmware updates ever. Randomness for generating the keys is introduced by the player as they walk around the world and complete fun quests, RPG style.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Back in April 1989, Nintendo unleashed the 8-bit handheld gaming device known as the Game Boy in Japan. Fast forward to March 2021, and a Youtuber decided to push the boundaries of the Game Boy&#x2019;s capabilities and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/youtuber-builds-a-bitcoin-miner-out-of-a-31-year-old-nintendo-game-boy/">released a video</a> showcasing an audacious feat: mining bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) using the iconic device. However, it quickly became apparent that the Game Boy&#x2019;s humble processing power paled in comparison to today&#x2019;s cutting-edge mining rigs. Another individual embarked on a similar venture in 2013, <a href="http://retrominer.com/">developing</a> a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) miner.</p>

<p>Although both mining experiments with the Game Boy and NES were intriguing and fun, their practical value (which was impractical in terms of mining) paled in comparison to something with actual utility. The Game Wallet project has even established a dedicated <a href="https://www.gamewallet.gg">website</a>, inviting visitors to sign up and stay informed about the availability of the initial batch of cartridges. The website further emphasizes the importance of offline functionality in safeguarding digital assets. The Game Wallet website states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Devices that physically cannot connect to the internet are more secure by nature. A device that was created before cryptocurrency existed, that can never be attacked through digital phishing, and has been sitting on your shelf for 20 years is even better.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Game Wallet news comes on the heels of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ledger-faces-backlash-for-controversial-backup-tool-as-crypto-community-expresses-discontent/">recent criticism</a> directed at Ledger&#x2019;s new Ledger Recovery service. It also follows 1inch Network&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/1inch-network-launches-hardware-wallet-for-storing-users-private-keys-in-a-secure-offline-setting/">announcement</a> of a new hardware wallet in January and Coinkite&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinkite-launches-higher-end-coldcard-bitcoin-wallet-with-qr-code-scanner/">introduction</a> of a &#x201C;higher-end&#x201D; Coldcard bitcoin wallet in February. According to the Game Wallet website, Schiarizzi&#x2019;s project utilized the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">Assembly programming language</a> used for Nintendo consoles and games.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We converted an open source assembly implementation of the sha256 hashing algorithm used to generate cryptographic seed phrases based on BIP-39 into GBAssembly, the language all Game Boy games are programmed in,&#x201D; the website details.</p>

Over the course of 309 days, by February 19, 2023, the treasuries dwindled to $8.8 billion. However, during the past 90 days, there has been a significant surge, with the funds held by DAO treasuries increasing by 144% to the current value of $21.5 billion. </strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations Witness Explosive Growth in 3 Months</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Following the failure of the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in 2016, the concept of DAOs experienced substantial growth. As of May 19, 2023, deepdao.io, a web portal dedicated to the analysis and information surrounding these organizations, has documented approximately <a href="https://archive.ph/AIxpi#selection-259.2-259.6">12,763 DAOs</a>. In October 2022, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-the-crypto-market-downturn-dao-treasuries-grew-by-700-million-since-january/">reported</a> on the financial assets held by DAO treasuries, which amounted to a total value of $9.8 billion. Notably, the largest treasury belonged to Uniswap, boasting a stash of $2.8 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">At that time, Bitdao held a cache of $1.3 billion in assets, closely following Uniswap&#8217;s DAO treasury. However, the subsequent months witnessed a decline, with the funds held by DAO treasuries plunging to a low of $8.8 billion by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230219232444/https://deepdao.io/organizations">February 2023</a>. Fast forward to today, May 19, 2023, and the scenario has transformed dramatically. The funds held by DAO treasuries have surged to $21.5 billion. Notably, Bitdao&#8217;s treasury now holds the third position, while Uniswap&#8217;s treasury secures the fourth spot among the largest treasuries.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-589249 size-full" title="DAO Treasuries Surge: From $8.8B to $21.5B in 90 Days, Marking a 144% Increase" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddfdof.jpg" alt="DAO Treasuries Surge: From $8.8B to $21.5B in 90 Days, Marking a 144% Increase" width="1280" height="475" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddfdof-300x111.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddfdof-1024x380.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddfdof-768x285.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dddfdof.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">At the forefront of DAO treasuries stands the Optimism Collective, which holds $4.3 billion in digital assets. On its heels is Arbitrum&#8217;s treasury, valued at $4.1 billion, while Bitdao secures a substantial stash of approximately $2.5 billion. Uniswap follows closely with a cache of crypto assets totaling $2.2 billion, and Polygon claims the fifth spot with a treasury valued at $1 billion. As the value held by DAO treasuries skyrocketed by 144% in the last 90 days, the number of DAOs also witnessed a 9% surge. Among the vast list of recorded DAO treasuries in deepdao.io, there’s approximately 6.9 million governance token holders.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Within the DAO ecosystem, an active community of 2.2 million voters and proposal makers is actively shaping the decentralized autonomous organization landscape. The cumulative votes cast thus far amount to 11.9 million, with 114,300 decisions made across the extensive network of 12,763 DAOs. Despite a 144% surge since February, the assets under management (AUM) for DAOs in the previous month hovered around $25.5 billion, resulting in an approximate loss of $4 billion. As of today, the AUM stands at $21.5 billion, comprising $18.3 billion in liquid funds and $3.1 billion locked in vesting obligations.</p>

<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, remained close to a multi-week high to start the weekend, despite bulls moving to secure recent gains.</p>
<p>Following a peak at $0.4738 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD declined to a bottom at $0.4627 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Despite the decline, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> remained close to its strongest point since April 30, when the price reached a top of $0.4818.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_589310">

<p></p></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Looking at the chart, one of the catalysts of the move appeared to be a breakout on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>The index moved beyond the ceiling of 54.00, and as of writing, is now tracking at 56.09.</p>
<p>Bulls are likely targeting the $0.4800 mark, and could reach it this weekend, should the RSI move towards its next point of resistance at 59.00.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, Polkadot (DOT) extended its own gains on Saturday, as the token rose for a second straight session.</p>
<p>DOT/USD climbed to a high of $5.41 to start the weekend, following a low at $5.33 the day prior.</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s move comes as polkadot continued to move away from a recent support point at $5.30.</p>
<div>
<dl id="attachment_589308">
<dt>
<p></p></dt>
</dl>
</div>
<p>The slight increase in price has also led to the RSI moving towards resistance at 42.00, which is acting as an obstacle to further bullish pressure.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that DOT could make a run towards $6.00, should this current ceiling give way.</p>

Speaking on Friday, Powell stated that rates may not be increased by as much as initially expected. Ethereum rose marginally higher today.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) consolidated below $27,000 to start the weekend, despite dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>Following a high of $27,128.62 during yesterday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $26,700.21 earlier today.</p>
<p>The move sees bitcoin remain relatively close to a floor at $26,300, and comes despite optimism that the Fed could soon begin to ease monetary policy.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the volatility in the market comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continues to track below a key resistance level.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 40.75, which is below a ceiling at 42.00</p>
<p>In order for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to remain firmly above $27,000, and begin to head towards $28,000, this point will need to be broken.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) on the other hand was marginally higher on Saturday, as prices remained above $1,800.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit a high of $1,826.19 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after nearly dropping below $1,800.</p>
<p>Since dropping to a floor at $1,790 earlier in the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> bulls have managed to keep price away from this point.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum&#x2019;s RSI continues to hover below a resistance point at 46.00, and is now at a reading of 44.84.</p>
<p>A breakout will also need to occur at this zone, in order for bullish momentum to fully return to ethereum.</p>

The monetary authority has published a report presenting the progress made by the growing industry and assessing the prospects for its further development.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s Central Bank Issues Report on Market for Digital Assets</h2>
<p>The Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) expects the volume of digital financial assets (DFAs) issued in the country to increase significantly in the future. The regulator believes that growth will be facilitated by the transparency and ease of use of these alternative instruments.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cbr.ru/Content/Document/File/146720/platform_services_20230515.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> quoted by the crypto page of the business news portal RBC, the bank also anticipates the emergence of new types of digital assets that will have no analogues in the traditional financial market and satisfy specific needs of businesses.</p>
<p>DFAs, as a legal term, was introduced with the law “On Digital Financial Assets” which went into force in January 2021. It’s still the only legislation that partially applies to crypto assets, at least those that have an issuer, unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which are yet to be regulated in Russia.</p>
<p>They are tokens issued on a blockchain platform created and managed by a licensed operator that usually represents monetary claims. The CBR has already authorized several such operators — the tokenization service <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-token-issued-in-russia-to-facilitate-investments-in-palladium/">Atomyze</a>, the fintech company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-digital-asset-deal-denominated-in-chinese-yuan/">Lighthouse</a>, Russia’s largest state-owned and private bank, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sberbank-to-conduct-first-digital-asset-transaction-on-own-platform/">Sberbank</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-private-bank-launches-digital-asset-platform/">Alfa-Bank</a>, as well as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-registers-another-digital-asset-issuer/">Masterchain</a>, which was licensed this spring.</p>

<p>During 2022, the first three registered platforms carried out a total of 19 issues of DFAs on behalf of 11 companies from different sectors, the report reveals. The list of issuers includes large industrial companies, financial firms and banks, construction companies and other organizations.</p>
<p>Russian businesses have been exploring ways to fund their operations amid unprecedented Western sanctions severely limiting their access to global finances. In early December, the first DFA deal denominated in Chinese yuan was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-largest-digital-asset-deal-denominated-in-chinese-yuan/">announced</a>.</p>
<p>The transaction, which was the largest of this kind at the time, involved issuing DFAs secured by commercial debt for 58 million yuan (over $8 million). Seven placements of digital financial assets for a total of 1 billion rubles ($13 million) were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-assets-for-1-billion-rubles-issued-in-russia-in-a-month/">made</a> in April this year.</p>
