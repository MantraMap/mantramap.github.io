The India Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, recently said India is not against blockchain technology, but crypto needs monitoring. She further claims that blockchain gives too many options and can be utilized in many different ways. SItharaman believes the central bank must drive crypto; otherwise, it can fall like those without proper government backing, causing huge spillover effects like FTX. She highlights the limitations of individual countries&#8217; actions in regulating crypto assets, stating that the interconnectedness of the global order renders such measures ineffective.
