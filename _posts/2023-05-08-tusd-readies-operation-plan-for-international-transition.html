<p>Singapore, Singapore, May 8th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>TrueUSD (TUSD), a leading stablecoin provider, announced its intention to implement a plan for the international transition of its management services, reflecting an emerging industry trend of international expansion. Since its inception in 2018, TUSD has led industry innovation in the stablecoin sector with a strong emphasis on client due diligence and regulatory compliance while growing its reserve portfolios in collaboration with a diversified network of financial institutions and fiduciaries. TrueUSD has proven to be one of the most trusted stablecoins during recent market volatility and disruption to the US banking sector.</p><p>The expansion and transition of TrueUSD&rsquo;s operations was part of the intention around its acquisition in 2020 and conditions are now appropriate to begin this next phase of portfolio review, consolidation and growth. While TrueUSD remains committed to serving all members of its global community, this announcement signifies TUSD&rsquo;s effort to further align itself with the development of the stablecoin sector against continued disruptions to the banking system and ongoing regulatory uncertainty.</p><p>About TrueUSD</p><p>TrueUSD (TUSD) is the first digital asset with live on-chain attestations by independent third-party institutions and is backed 1:1 with USD.
