<ul><li>OpenSea’s former product manager Nate Chastain has been convicted of wire fraud and money laundering.&nbsp;</li><li>A federal jury in New York found Chastain guilty of using insider information to trade NFTs.</li><li>The former executive faces up to 40 years in prison for netting $50,000 from his insider trading scheme.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Nate Chastain, the former Product Manager at NFT marketplace OpenSea, has been convicted by a federal grand jury in New York in the first-ever NFT <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-guilty-insider-trading/">insider trading</a> case. Chastain’s conviction comes less than two weeks after the first hearing in his case was held in the District Court for the Southern District of New York. </p>



<h2><strong>Former OpenSea Executive Faces Up To 40 Years In Prison</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ex-opensea-manager-convicted-nft-insider-trading-case-2023-05-03/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, the federal jury found Chastain guilty of money laundering and wire fraud for his role in the NFT insider trading scheme. He faces up to 40 years in prison. The charges were filed against him in June last year by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan. As the head of product, Chastain was responsible for picking the digital artworks that would be featured on the NFT marketplace’s homepage.</p>



<p>Federal prosecutors accused the former OpenSea executive of abusing his position at the firm to illegally trade NFTs. He reportedly made more than $50,000 between June 2021 and September 2021 by purchasing NFTs that were about to be listed, and then offloading them after their prices surged. Chastain reportedly tried to cover his tracks by using multiple wallets and accounts to route his funds. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Nathaniel Chastain exploited his advanced knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on OpenSea’s website to make profitable trades for himself. Although this case involved trades in novel crypto assets, there was nothing particularly innovative about his conduct — it was fraud.” </p><cite>Damian Williams, U.S. Attorney SDNY</cite></blockquote>



<p>Nate Chastain’s guilty verdict comes more than six months after his lawyers filed a motion to get the case dismissed on procedural grounds. He pleaded not guilty as his lawyers argued that OpenSea did not treat the insider knowledge as confidential information during his tenure at the company. &#8220;Nobody told Nate that he couldn&#8217;t use or share that information,” the former executive’s lawyers stated during the closing arguments earlier this week. </p>

<ul><li>Changpeng Zhao recently stated that believes that support from banks is the biggest challenge for crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>The Binance Chief believes that traditional finance systems are important for furthering crypto adoption.&nbsp;</li><li>Zhao views traditional banking institutions as a necessary element for Bitcoin rather than a rival.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the man at the helm of the world’s largest crypto exchange, believes that support from the traditional finance industry is an important prerequisite to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Zhao’s comments came during a recent ask-me-anything (AMA) <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/from-cz/highlights-from-czs-may-1-ama-4719549893974593654" rel="nofollow noopener">session</a> where he answered questions on topics like crypto regulation, the relationship between traditional banking institutions and the crypto industry, and token listings on his crypto exchange. </p>



<h2><strong>Changpeng Zhao: Banks And Bitcoin Are Not Rivals</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking on Banking v. Bitcoin, Changpeng Zhao stated that the success or failure of banks doesn’t necessarily have a meaningful impact on crypto. According to him, the extent of the impact is limited to Bitcoin’s role as a safe haven asset when investors lose confidence in TradFi. However, that is true for real estate and gold as well. Zhao believes that it is possible for crypto to coexist with banks and traditional fiat currencies rather than it being a zero-sum game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-apologize-binance-cz-sui-tusd/">Binance</a> chief further argued that the success of banks will lead to a more prosperous economy with money and value which will translate to a better scenario for the crypto industry. “The more people, the more activity, the better it is for everyone. That&#8217;s how I view things,” Zhao added. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>If banks are willingly working with crypto, especially exchanges, then we can really facilitate the flow between traditional financial systems and crypto financial systems.”</p><cite>Changpeng Zhao, Co-founder and CEO of Binance</cite></blockquote>



<p>When asked about the regulatory landscape for the crypto industry, Changpeng Zhao revealed that the number one challenge for crypto firms today is receiving support from banks. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto industry has discouraged traditional banking institutions from catering to businesses operating in the crypto space. Zhao believes that a proper regulatory framework will restore investors’ and banks’ confidence in crypto, which will ultimately further its adoption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the AMA session, the Binance CEO also talked about memecoins and the listing of tokens on his crypto exchange. He clarified that he isn&#8217;t involved in Binance’s token listing process. As far as memecoins are concerned, Zhao revealed that he never understood them. However, as long as users are willing to trade them, his exchange will list them.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>BUSD&#8217;s Fall</h2>



<p>BUSD&#8217;s dwindling activity comes after its issuer Paxos was the subject of enforcement actions from two U.S. regulators. The crypto trust company received a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-binance-stablecoin-paxos-busd/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wells notice</a> from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accusing Paxos of issuing unregistered securities. Paxos promised to litigate if necessary and &#8220;categorically&#8221; <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/busd-issuer-paxos-in-discussion-u-s-sec/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/busd-issuer-paxos-in-discussion-u-s-sec/" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed</a> the SEC&#8217;s allegations. </p>



<p>New York&#8217;s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) ordered Paxos to cease issuing new BUSD tokens. Paxos is regulated by the NYDFS and can operate in New York&#8217;s jurisdiction. The company said redemptions would <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxos-busd-binance-redemptions-till-2024/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/paxos-busd-binance-redemptions-till-2024/" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue until February 2024</a> at the very least. </p>



<p>DeFi protocols like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-votes-offboard-busd-lending-pool/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aave-votes-offboard-busd-lending-pool/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave</a> lost faith in BUSD following the news. Community members proposed removing the stablecoin from lending pools and decentralized services. Platforms like Coinbase also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-suspend-busd-trading-march-13/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-suspend-busd-trading-march-13/" rel="noreferrer noopener">moved</a> to delist the token. </p>



<h2>Tether Solidifies Stablecoin Lead</h2>



<p>Tether&#8217;s USDT, crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin, continues to command the lion&#8217;s market share of the stablecoin ecosystem amid troubling times for rivals. At its peak, BUSD boasted over $23 billion in supply. This figure has dipped sharply to around $5 billion. </p>



<p>USDT&#8217;s market cap alone is north of $82 billion. Tether&#8217;s closest competitor Circle (USDC) has a market cap of just above $30 billion. Tether is also reportedly minting significant amounts of new USDT tokens. </p>



<p>Typically, Tether creates new USDT in response to increased demand, signaling the influx of fresh cash into the ecosystem often deployed to purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<ul><li>Celsius founder Alex Mashinsky has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed by the Attorney General of New York.</li><li>The lawsuit accused Mashinsky of misleading and defrauding the investors of his crypto lending firm. </li><li>The former CEO has dismissed the allegations made in the lawsuit and called them “baseless”.  </li></ul>



<p>Alex Mashinsky, the man behind the failed crypto lending firm <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-creditors-suspicious-trades-ftx/">Celsius</a>, has filed a motion in the Supreme Court of New York to dismiss a complaint filed against him by the state of New York in January this year. Mashinsky’s lawyers responded by claiming that the fraud claims made against him by New York Attorney General Letitia James, are baseless and derived from online misinformation. </p>



<h2><strong>Alex Mashinsky: Crypto Products Offered By Celsius Were Not Securities</strong></h2>



<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> by the State of New York against Alex Mashinsky for defrauding hundreds of thousands of investors out of billions of dollars worth of crypto assets. The lawsuit alleged that Mashinsky repeatedly made false and misleading statements regarding Celsius’ safety to encourage investors to deposit billions worth of crypto into the crypto lender. Attorney General James further alleged that amid last year’s crypto contagion, Mashinsky misrepresented and concealed the financial health of his company. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=/mPuBL5LQ5Z2OEWZ70pvhw==" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> by the former CEO’s lawyers, the allegations made in the lawsuit “parrot misformation” on the internet about Mashinsky and Celsius. They claimed that the “baseless” conclusions in the complaint demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the bankrupt crypto lender’s business and the role that the former CEO played in it. In the response, Mashinsky’s lawyers claimed that Celsius’ bankruptcy was blamed on him despite being caused due to external events that were out of his control. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Complaint cynically cherry picks fragments of statements and sound bites, without broader context, falsely depicting Celsius’s exceptional transparencies with its users as a deceptive tactic.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Speaking on the allegation of perpetrating securities fraud by failing to register Celsius as a securities dealer and offering securities through the platform, Alex Mashinsky’s lawyers stated that the Earn Accounts offered to customers were not securities. “The Complaint fails to plead adequately the existence of securities or commodities in Celsius’s business model,” the lawyers argued. The response also cited several legal precedents to argue that no investment contract exists between the firm and the investor without a predetermined interest rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Daily unique addresses on Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible chains set a new all-time high of 6.77 million last week.</li><li>Experts and on-chain say expensive gas fees pushed more users to leverage EVM-chain like BNB Chain, Polygon, Fantom, and Avalanche.</li><li>The hike in gas fees coincides with the Pepe and meme coin fever spreading through the cryptocurrency market. </li></ul>



<p>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible network saw an uptick in user activity as Ethereum maintained its infamously high gas fees. </p>



<p>According to on-chain data from The Block, EVM chains set a new all-time high for daily unique addresses. The number of these unique addresses hit <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/average-transaction-fee-on-ethereum" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theblock.co/data/on-chain-metrics/ethereum/average-transaction-fee-on-ethereum" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">culminated</a> last week on Wednesday, April 25. Daily unique addresses hit 6.77 million for the first time on EVM-compatible chains like BNB Chain, Polygon, and Fantom. </p>



<p>Ethereum&#8217;s network enjoyed an additional surge in interest after the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/2billion-ethereum-rewards-unlock-shapella/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanghai upgrade</a> as traders and crypto users were once again spurred by meme coin mania. This increased trading activity on ETH&#8217;s chain caused a consistent rise in transaction costs, the main reason why users are opting for EVM-compatible chains instead. </p>



<p>Transaction costs on EVM-compatible chains like BNB Chain and Polygon are a fraction of gas fees on Ethereum. These networks are also able to provide cheaper gas fees while leveraging security infrastructure from Ethereum&#8217;s base layer. </p>



<p>Research analyst Kevin Pang noted a steady increase in transaction costs on ETH&#8217;s network since early 2023. Pang opined that this consistent rise powered growth in EVM chain usage. Data showed a 250% increase as gas fees jumped from around $2.5 per transaction late last year to $9 in May 2023. </p>



<h2>Pepe Traders Contribute To Ethereum Gas Fee Spike</h2>



<p>Speculative traders and memecoin mania are not new narratives in the crypto industry. Indeed, the rise in gas fees comes at a time when rising meme coin Pepe has stormed the market and grown in popularity. </p>



<p>The memecoin based on &#8216;Pepe the frog&#8217; recorded over 2100% in returns for holders since its debut in April. Pepe&#8217;s PEPE-WETH contract has been the <a href="https://pro.nansen.ai/defi-paradise" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pro.nansen.ai/defi-paradise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most active liquidity pool</a> on Uniswap V2 and V3 for the past week. Pepe is also a top trending crypto on aggregators like Coingecko and CoinMarketCap. </p>

<p>Binance and other crypto exchanges were <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1653722900661407744?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1653722900661407744?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a> to stall listing SUI perpetual trading contracts, per an official request from the core SUI team cited on Wednesday. Four major exchanges including <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-apologize-binance-cz-sui-tusd/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-apologize-binance-cz-sui-tusd/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> and Kucoin have temporarily honored the request, supporting only spot trading for now. </p>



<p>The token opened trading as high as $4 on some trading venues before crashing more than 70%. Trading volumes rose above $300 million in the first 24 hours of trading. OKX experienced downtimes as traders flocked to the new and high-anticipated L1 blockchain token. </p>



<p>Trading activity on Binance made up over 60% of the token&#8217;s spot volume shortly after launch, per CoinGecko data.</p>

<p>The request was publicly disclosed shortly before trading venues listed the token for spot trading. Other crypto exchanges like BitMex and MEXC ignored the request, supporting both spot and perpetual futures trading on their platforms. </p>



<h2>Diem Devs Activate SUI Mainnet</h2>



<p>Former Diem developers launched the SUI Layer 1 mainnet on May 3 after years of building the network. The chain&#8217;s genesis blob was <a href="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1651701079128821760?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/SuiNetwork/status/1651701079128821760?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">activated</a> per a Discord server update, thrusting the Mysten Labs&#8217; brainchild into a competitive L1 market. </p>



<p>The designated proof-of-stake (dPoS) network plans to onboard over 200 entities from DeFi, decentralized applications, NFTs, blockchain gaming, and more into its ecosystem over the next few months. </p>



<p>SUI was developed using an off-shoot of the Rust programming language dubbed Move. Rust was initially created for Meta&#8217;s failed Diem blockchain project. The dPoS chain leverages two high-performance throughput mempool and consensus engines called Narwhal and Bullshark, both developed by Mysten Labs. </p>

<ul><li>Gemini has launched its offshore crypto derivatives trading platform in thirty countries.&nbsp;</li><li>The Gemini Foundation is now offering BTC perpetual contracts to customers in qualified jurisdictions.</li><li>The new exchange is not available to customers in the United States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>U.S-based crypto exchange Gemini’s offshore crypto derivatives trading platform has been launched less than two weeks after initially announced last month. The Gemini Foundation is now live in over two dozen countries including Singapore, Hong Kong, India, Switzerland, Bermuda, Turkey, Brazil, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Foundation Not Available In US, UK, And EU</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/Gemini/status/1653391869395767297" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread</a> posted by the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange earlier today, the Gemini Foundation is open for trading to customers in all available jurisdictions. Users from the 30 available jurisdictions can now trade BTC perpetual contracts denominated in the exchange’s GUSD stablecoin using up to 100x leverage. The new crypto derivatives exchange plans to launch an ETH/GUSD perpetual contract in the coming weeks. </p>



<p>The offshore trading platform will not be available to customers in the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union. In the available jurisdictions, both retail and institutional traders can access the platform. Gemini revealed that it will be expanding its derivatives offerings with additional perpetual contracts, dated futures, and options in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Gemini Foundation offers customers a capital-efficient, highly available, and trusted venue to trade derivatives. Purpose-built for both individuals and institutions, Gemini Foundation combines powerful trading tools with an elegant user experience.”</p></blockquote>



<p>A report from <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/02/gemini-launches-offshore-crypto-derivatives-platform/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fortune</a> revealed that the new derivatives exchange is based in Singapore. As <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-non-us-crypto-derivatives-platform/">reported</a> earlier, the platform will introduce spot products as well. Customers will have to convert their USD and USD Coins to GUSD on a 1:1 basis in order to fund their trading account. Perpetual funding payments will have to be made exclusively in GUSD.</p>



<p>News of the derivatives trading platform’s launch comes on the same day that Coinbase announced the launch of its Bermuda-based crypto derivatives exchange, Coinbase International Exchange. The American exchanges’ global push is partly due to the lack of regulatory clarity in the US and the hostile stance of regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has launched an offshore crypto derivatives exchange based in Bermuda.&nbsp;</li><li>Coinbase International Exchange will allow non-U.S. customers to trade perpetual futures.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bermuda Monetary Authority recently granted a regulatory license to the American crypto giant.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a significant push for global expansion, American crypto giant Coinbase has announced the launch of Coinbase International Exchange, its offshore crypto derivatives trading platform. The new derivatives exchange is based in the Caribbean nation of Bermuda. The launch of the offshore exchange comes in light of intensifying scrutiny of crypto firms in the United States.  </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase International Exchange Will Settle All Trades In USDC</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-coinbase-international-exchange" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Coinbase, its new crypto derivatives exchange will allow users based in eligible jurisdictions outside the United States, to trade perpetual futures. The new Bermuda-based trading venture aims to tap into the perpetual futures trading space, which reportedly accounted for almost 75% of the global crypto trading volume in 2022. </p>



<p>Coinbase International Exchange listed BTC and ETH perpetual futures contracts earlier today. These contracts will initially allow institutional clients to trade with up to 5x leverage. The new platform will not require any fiat on-ramps as all trading will be settled in USD Coin (USDC). It is important to note that the platform is not available for retail clients at this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The announcement of the new exchange comes less than two weeks after Coinbase <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/">revealed</a> that the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) had granted it a regulatory license to operate in the British Overseas Territory. The crypto exchange lauded Bermuda’s favorable regulatory landscape and highlighted its high level of transparency, compliance, and cooperation. The exchange assured that it&#8217;s still committed to the American market, but highlighted the countries around the world that are setting up responsible regulatory frameworks for crypto.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We would like to see the US take a similar approach instead of regulation by enforcement which has led to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US.” </p></blockquote>



<p>The launch of the overseas exchange comes amid the crackdown on crypto businesses in the United States. Regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) have booked several crypto firms since the beginning of the year in what industry players have described as a campaign against the crypto industry. The SEC issued a Wells notice to Coinbase last month, stating the regulator’s intention to initiate enforcement actions against the exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The plaintiff&#8217;s complaint alleges that Coinbase broke biometric privacy laws in Illinois.</li><li>A user named Michael Massel damages on the grounds that the crypto exchange violated state laws when carrying out know-your-customer checks and unlawfully stored sensitive user data.</li><li>The California District Court case is the latest battle faced by crypto exchange Coinbase on U.S. soil as the company explores offshore jurisdictions.</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase crypto exchange has been <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67306707/1/massel-v-coinbase-inc/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67306707/1/massel-v-coinbase-inc/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sued in a California District Court</a> for allegedly violating Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA and using sensitive customer identification data unlawfully. </p>



<p>The suit alleges that the crypto company&#8217;s biometric data collection through its know-your-customer (KYC) practices was unlawfully obtained and stored without implementing providing the necessary details on this verification policy. </p>



<p>It&#8217;s a common requirement among some crypto exchanges, especially those operating in the U.S. and other strict jurisdictions, for users to confirm their identity and upload a photo for verification. Regulators make KYC mandatory as an anti-money laundering tactic and a way to fight illicit finance. </p>



<p>According to BIPA rules, a company that collects biometric data must inform the user in writing of the data collection including the specific purpose and length of term for which the data will be stored.</p>



<p>Written consent is also required from the customer and the company has to publish publicly‐available written retention schedules and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric information.</p>



<p>The suit claims that the crypto company does not comply with these rules and instead “wrongfully profits” from the data by collecting biometric data to “further enhance Coinbase and its online ‘app-based’ platform.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the suit alleges that Coinbase “disclosed, redisclosed, or otherwise disseminated Plaintiff’s biometric information to numerous third parties including, but not limited to, Jumio Corporation, Onfido, Inc., Au10tix LTD, Solaris AG, and Liquid Co. Ltd.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Plaintiff, Michael Massel, a user of the exchange, is seeking $5,000 in damages for every “intentional and reckless violation” of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) and a further $1,000 for each other violation his legal team can find.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Coinbase, Crypto Companies Spar With US Regulators</h2>



<p>Coinbase, like a host of crypto businesses, is also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-preparing-legal-battle-u-s-sec/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-preparing-legal-battle-u-s-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taking heat from U.S. regulators</a> pursuing what the industry describes as a “regulation-by-enforcement strategy,” where federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) prefer to serve up lawsuits and legal threats rather than draft new guidelines for the still-nascent industry. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the SEC alleged that the staking services offered by exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase were unregistered securities and began a crackdown against them, issuing the former with a $30mn fine and the latter with a Wells Notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hostile climate appears to be <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-exchange-soon/" rel="noreferrer noopener">driving Coinbase further offshore</a>. Last month the exchange announced it received a license to operate in Bermuda, and is in talks with the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FRSA), a regulator of the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)—a crypto-friendly free economic zone in the territory of UAE—about the potential of opening a regulated exchange there.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the company is locked in a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-responds-to-secs-wells-notice/" rel="noreferrer noopener">legal bottleneck</a> with U.S. regulators over securities laws and clearer crypto laws. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>VARA said OPNX solicited Dubai customers through marketing campaigns and social media without the appropriate regulatory approval.</li><li>Dubai’s regulator said they were assessing whether further action might be needed against the latest crypto venture from Su Zhu and Kyle Davies.</li><li>OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb rebutted that the exchange isn’t available to Dubai residents. </li><li>At the same time, Zhu and Kyle claim no influence over the platform’s operations after contributing the initial ideas for OPNX.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto claims trading exchange OPNX must navigate more controversy after its lackluster launch in early April this year. </p>



<p>The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) lambasted the crypto venture started by Su Zhu and Kyle Davies for marketing an unregistered digital asset business to Dubai residents and customers, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/dubai-reprimands-three-arrows-founders-over-new-crypto-project?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/dubai-reprimands-three-arrows-founders-over-new-crypto-project?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> Tuesday.</p>



<p>OPNX is a crypto exchange that allows users to trade claims from defunct entities like FTX and Three Arrows Capital, the very same bankrupt hedge fund previously led by Zhu and Davies. The platform hosts executives from other troubled crypto businesses like CoinFLEX’s Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam. Leslie Lamb currently spearheads the venture as CEO.</p>



<p>On February 27, Dubai’s VARA issued a “cease and desist” order to OPNX. A second cautionary notice was published shortly after on March 10 to both the founder and the crypto platform itself. </p>



<p>The platform later <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-crypto-exchange-3ac-coinflex-live/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-crypto-exchange-3ac-coinflex-live/" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in April, recording unimpressive trading volumes at launch, and continued to leverage social media for marketing campaigns. VARA claims this move was also targeted at onboarding Dubai users. </p>



<p>Following its first two notices to OPNX and its founders before the platform launched, VARA published a written reprimand to all four co-founders for attempting to run an unregistered crypto business in the Emirates. </p>



<p>The notice echoed regulatory concerns cited in February, and March, and an “Investor and Marketplace Alert” published about OPNX shortly before the exchange launched in April.</p>



<p>OPNX CEO Leslie Lamb, another subject of VARA’s regulatory torch, rebutted the claims and said the company had not violated any of the Emirati’s policies. OPNX and VARA are working together to investigate the matter, CEO Lamb suggested in a WhatsApp text cited in Tuesday’s report. </p>



<p>3AC co-founder Su Zhu also claimed that he and Kyle were not involved in daily administrative duties at OPNX despite ideating the original concept for the crypto claims exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>CEO Lamb also said that “at no point in time have UAE customers been able to open an account on OPNX”.</p>



<h2>Dubai’s Burgeoning Crypto-Hub Plans&nbsp;</h2>



<p>VARA’s regulatory move against OPNX comes as Dubai works to develop its jurisdiction as a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubais-crypto-regulator-vara-to-make-its-metaverse-debut-in-the-sandbox-metaverse/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubais-crypto-regulator-vara-to-make-its-metaverse-debut-in-the-sandbox-metaverse/" rel="noreferrer noopener">global hub for crypto innovation </a>and digital asset businesses. Several crypto businesses like Binance and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kraken-crypto-license-uae/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/kraken-crypto-license-uae/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a> have received regulatory nods from UAE watchdogs. </p>
