					<description><![CDATA[Charles Edwards, the mastermind behind the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons signal and founder of Capriole Investments, has sounded the alarm. The renowned analyst warns that the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal just flashed, a phenomenon that has historically accompanied moments of distress for BTC miners. As outlined by Edwards, Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate had experienced an astonishing and seemingly unsustainable 50% surge in 2023. However, this meteoric rise came to a sudden slowdown, which has led to the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal to appear. Via Twitter, Edwards emphasized that the signal is neither a clear sell signal nor a buy indicator. But it demands prudent risk management until a renewed price rally: We have a Hash Ribbon capitulation. AKA a slowing in Bitcoin&#8217;s Hash Rate growth after what has been an incredible (unsustainable) 50% increase in 2023. Hash Ribbons capitulation is not a sell signal, but it&#8217;s also not bullish. Risk management warranted until growth resumes. Market analyst Lukasz Wydra corroborates Edwards&#8217; stance, pointing out that the death cross of Bitcoin hash ribbons is a signal of a time of uncertainty. Wydra revealed that historically, there have been 14 similar events, each leading to diverse outcomes. Among these events, three resulted in rallies, six led to sideways movements, and five triggered declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Blofin Forecasts $49,000 Price High With Potential Spot ETF Launch Wydra takes a statistical approach and reassures investors that, statistically speaking, the Hash Ribbons capitulation does not inflict significant harm on the market. In fact, he emphasizes that when the capitulation finally subsides, it will usher in a strong buying signal, one that has shown remarkable effectiveness in the past. The last time the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal appeared was at the end of November 2022. It was followed by a prolonged sideways trend for over a month until the buy signal flashed at the beginning of January. The result? Bitcoin embarked on a furious rally, etching a memorable start to the year. Why Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Are Such A Powerful Tool In simple terms, the Hash Ribbon indicator is designed to detect periods when BTC miners are facing distress and possible capitulation. These phases tend to coincide with major lows in the price of Bitcoin, making them attractive buying opportunities for astute investors.

During periods of rapid price surges followed by sharp pullbacks, some miners may find it financially challenging to continue their operations, leading them to power down their mining rigs. Charles Edwards elucidates that when miners capitulate, it might be the most potent buy signal observable in the Bitcoin market. However, the indicator does not claim to time the exact bottom of the price. Instead, it identifies periods when miners are turning off their rigs due to adverse market conditions, leading to drops in hash rates. These moments often correspond to macro bottoms in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, making them opportune moments to accumulate Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded near the range lows at $29,863.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data on July 19 shows that as much as 2 million XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, were changing hands every minute on top cryptocurrency exchanges, including KuCoin and Poloniex. In a screen grab shared on Twitter, on-chain data reveals that more XRP was being traded in bulk, driving trading volumes higher across the board.  Accompanying the expansion, prices remain higher as of writing on July 20. The coin is up 72% from July 2023 lows, even though trading volumes in leading exchanges, including Binance, have since tapered slightly. Nonetheless, the resurgence in trading volumes this week suggests that the demand for the coin remains relatively higher. XRP And Its Spectacular Rally The token&#8217;s value experienced a surge following a recent court ruling declaring that the SEC could not provide evidence that it was a security. Per the Howey test, the judge concluded that XRP does not meet the legal definition of a security. Related Reading: SEC Allegedly Delays Assistance For US Crypto Market Bill Three years ago, in December 2020, the regulator filed a lawsuit alleging that Ripple, the blockchain company, and some of its executives, including Brad Garlinghouse, had raised over $1 billion through alleged illegal sales of XRP, an asset they claimed was an unregistered security. Ripple denied the allegations and fought the lawsuit, expending millions of dollars in legal expenses and eventually winning on this item.  Coinbase, Bitstamp, Crypto Exchanges Relisting The rally has also been boosted by the news that Coinbase Global, Kraken, and other top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges have relisted the token. Specifically, Coinbase delisted XRP in December 2020 following the SEC lawsuit, triggering a wave of delisting among cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States.  Relisting XRP across major exchanges could be a sign of confidence. It will likely boost the coin’s liquidity, increasing trading volumes in the coming months. Supporters find the listing a refreshing development, especially for clients in the United States who had been cut off from trading.

Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple Labs removed uncertainty around the coin&#8217;s status. This decision can also open more doors for institutional adoption.  Moreover, the rally and regulatory clarity cement the token&#8217;s position in the cryptocurrency market. This development may see it narrow its gap with Ethereum (ETH), perhaps even flipping it to become the second-largest coin after Bitcoin. In the last three years before the court ruling, the token shook off weakness and retained its slot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization amid the biting and extended crypto winter 2022.

					<description><![CDATA[Through the bear market, Arbitrum (ARB) has been one of the tokens that have managed to hold on to a significant amount of its all-time high value. Along these same lines, the digital asset is one of the few tokens currently flashing a green bullish flag, and accumulation has ramped up as a result of this. ARB Whale Accumulation Ramps Up Transactions on the Arbitrum blockchain on Thursday, July 20, point to massive accumulation among large investors. These transactions were flagged by on-chain data tracker Lookonchain, going as far back as July 17 when the accumulation trend seemed to have begun. Related Reading: Why This Upcoming Event Is Bearish For Axie Infinity (AXS) On Monday, Lookonchain reported three transactions carrying 3.76 million ARB worth $5 million at the time from the Binance exchange to known whale wallets. While these transactions were significant, they did not stop there. The following day, July 18, the tracker spotted another transaction carrying 4 million ARB. The source of the transaction was the same, with the coins which were worth $5 million at the time being moved from Binance to a private wallet. The most recent whale accumulation happened on Wednesday, July 19, with the largest ARB withdrawals of the bunch. This time around, a whale identified as “0x6950” withdrew 4.6 million ARB worth $5.84 million at the time of the transaction, from Binance. Whale&#8221;0x6950&#8243; withdrew 4.6M $ARB ($5.84M) from #Binance again just now. The whale has withdrawn a total of 9M $ARB ($11.4M) from #Binance in the past 2 days.https://t.co/E9GCmJ7ftc pic.twitter.com/FNI1gBbxrd — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 19, 2023 All of these transactions point to a consistent accumulation trend among these large holders, which could suggest that they expect a price recovery to happen soon. Their withdrawals have also reduced the amount of selling pressure on the digital asset and this could also lend support to any rally from here on out. Arbitrum Continues To Dominate Layer 2 Blockchains Arbitrum has seen much success in the market and this contributes to the bullishness around its native ARB token. Arbitrum currently boasts the largest Total Value Locked (TVL) of all the Ethereum Layer 2 blockchains, including Polygon and Optimism. Related Reading: Back In The Game: Ripple Joins $54 Million Funding Round For Metaverse Startup While Polygon and Optimism TVLs are sitting at $1.027 billion and $926 million, respectively, the TVL of the Arbitrum network is at $2.68 billion. This figure makes the L2 the fourth-largest by TVL across all blockchains, coming up behind heavy hitters such as Ethereum, Tron, and BSC. With Arbitrum controlling a significant portion of the L2 TVL, expectations are that its native token will also surge alongside it. Currently, ARB is trading at $1.29 with a 3.33% price gain in the last 24 hours. However, the price could easily surge toward $1.5 if whale accumulations continue and sell pressure continues to decline.

					<description><![CDATA[Crypto analyst Adam Cochran recently caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community when he called attention to a series of TrueUSD (TUSD) transactions made by Tron founder Justin Sun.  Cochran highlighted a series of transactions made by Sun&#8217;s address on the Tron blockchain, including minting $62 million worth of TUSD, withdrawing $50 million in USDT from Huobi, and depositing $50 million in USDT on Bitfinex. Justin Sun&#8217;s Dubious TUSD Transactions Perhaps most concerning, however, was Sun&#8217;s apparent burning of $50 million TUSD, which Cochran suggested could be an attempt to temporarily “snapshot or unwind” debt using a “fake” balance that was “unbacked”.  Cochran also pointed out that Sun appeared to be using Poloniex and Huobi as his own “piggy” banks to borrow against, with large amounts of Huobi assets being plowed into JustLend &#8211; an official lending platform on the TRON blockchain &#8211; for him to borrow against shitcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Blofin Forecasts $49,000 Price High With Potential Spot ETF Launch These transactions have raised questions about Sun&#8217;s motivations and the potential impact of his actions on the broader cryptocurrency market. In particular, Cochran expressed concern that Sun&#8217;s apparent “manipulation” of TUSD could create the appearance of greater liquidity in the market and potentially lead to price manipulation. Compounding these concerns is that Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has reportedly offered voluntary termination packages to employees in multiple departments.  This move has raised questions about the financial stability of Binance and its potential exposure to Sun&#8217;s actions. Cochran concluded: CZ offered multiple departments &#8220;voluntary termination&#8221; offers where any staff member could apply to resign today, sign a new NDA and get a 3 month severance to quit. Totally normal thing to do after already big cuts&#8230;. The Uncertainty Of Justin Sun&#8217;s Cryptocurrency Moves The potential risks of Justin Sun&#8217;s transactions are unclear, as his motivations for these actions are unknown. However, several possible concerns have been raised in the crypto community.  One potential risk is the possibility of price manipulation. If Sun was attempting to manipulate the price of specific cryptocurrencies by creating the appearance of greater liquidity in the market, this could lead to price distortions that could harm investors and destabilize the market. Another risk is the possibility of a liquidity crisis. If Sun&#8217;s actions caused a sudden influx of TUSD or USDT into the market, this could lead to a sudden drop in the value of these cryptocurrencies, potentially causing a liquidity crisis and harming investors. There is also a risk that Sun&#8217;s actions could ripple throughout the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially causing other investors to panic or leading to a broader sell-off. Related Reading: SEC Allegedly Delays Assistance For US Crypto Market Bill Finally, there is a risk that Sun&#8217;s actions could trigger regulatory scrutiny or legal action, mainly if he is found to have engaged in illegal or unethical behavior. This could harm the reputation of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and lead to increased regulatory oversight. Despite these concerns, it remains unclear precisely what Sun&#8217;s intentions were with the transactions highlighted by Cochran.

<p>Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1682097478491860998?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlighted </a>a series of transactions made by Sun&#8217;s address on the Tron blockchain, including minting $62 million worth of TUSD, withdrawing $50 million in USDT from Huobi, and depositing $50 million in USDT on Bitfinex.</p>
<h2>Justin Sun&#8217;s Dubious TUSD Transactions</h2>
<p>Perhaps most concerning, however, was Sun&#8217;s apparent burning of $50 million TUSD, which Cochran suggested could be an attempt to temporarily “snapshot or unwind” debt using a “fake” balance that was “unbacked”. </p>
<p>Cochran also pointed out that Sun appeared to be using Poloniex and Huobi as his own “piggy” banks to borrow against, with large amounts of Huobi assets being plowed into JustLend &#8211; an official lending platform on the TRON blockchain &#8211; for him to borrow against shitcoins.</p>

<p>These transactions have raised questions about Sun&#8217;s motivations and the potential impact of his actions on the broader cryptocurrency market. In particular, Cochran expressed concern that Sun&#8217;s apparent “manipulation” of TUSD could create the appearance of greater liquidity in the market and potentially lead to price manipulation.</p>
<p>Compounding these concerns is that Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has reportedly offered voluntary termination packages to employees in multiple departments. </p>
<p>This move has raised questions about the financial stability of Binance and its potential exposure to Sun&#8217;s actions. Cochran concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>CZ offered multiple departments &#8220;voluntary termination&#8221; offers where any staff member could apply to resign today, sign a new NDA and get a 3 month severance to quit. Totally normal thing to do after already big cuts&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
The Uncertainty Of Justin Sun&#8217;s Cryptocurrency Moves
<p>The potential risks of Justin Sun&#8217;s transactions are unclear, as his motivations for these actions are unknown. However, several possible concerns have been raised in the crypto community. </p>
<p>One potential risk is the possibility of price manipulation. If Sun was attempting to manipulate the price of specific cryptocurrencies by creating the appearance of greater liquidity in the market, this could lead to price distortions that could harm investors and destabilize the market.</p>
<p>Another risk is the possibility of a liquidity crisis. If Sun&#8217;s actions caused a sudden influx of TUSD or USDT into the market, this could lead to a sudden drop in the value of these cryptocurrencies, potentially causing a liquidity crisis and harming investors.</p>
<p>There is also a risk that Sun&#8217;s actions could ripple throughout the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially causing other investors to panic or leading to a broader sell-off.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a risk that Sun&#8217;s actions could trigger regulatory scrutiny or legal action, mainly if he is found to have engaged in illegal or unethical behavior. This could harm the reputation of the cryptocurrency industry as a whole and lead to increased regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it remains unclear precisely what Sun&#8217;s intentions were with the transactions highlighted by Cochran.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has allegedly held up assistance needed in a congressional bill to regulate the crypto markets. This has been considered a potential hurdle if the bill is to pass in Congress. Through multiple sources, the Block found that the SEC has yet to provide sufficient technical assistance for the bill after almost six weeks of request. The report stated that this appears to be the case despite the supposed commission’s good communication with the House.  SEC officials have recently provided briefings to the staff of Democratic members of the House Financial Services Committee. These briefings reportedly covered their opinions on digital asset regulation in light of the committee&#8217;s upcoming consideration of bills to establish a comprehensive framework for cryptocurrency markets in the United States. Related Reading: Arkansas Senator Calls For Reversal Of Controversial New Crypto Mining Law While the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be dragging its feet in responding to the House’s request, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is said to have been receptive so far, providing the congressional staff with some technical assistance. Final Draft Of Crypto Market Bill To Be Unveiled  Various House committees have been working together for months to create a new bill for crypto markets in the country. This crypto market bill, led primarily by Republican members, is expected to direct the U.S. market regulators on how a digital asset can transition from a security to a commodity.  Additionally, it would temporarily confer the Commodity Futures Trading Commission superior power over crypto commodities markets &#8211; mainly Bitcoin trading. A final draft of this multi-committee bill will reportedly be introduced today, July 20, 2023. This is in anticipation of a committee debate and vote next week. Initially, a committee debate and amendment process for the Financial Services Committee part of the bill was scheduled on Wednesday, July 19. However, this “markup” has been rescheduled to the following week to allow enough time for additional review by committee members. Senators Urge SEC Chairman To Crack Down On Crypto Companies On Wednesday, July 19, two prominent figures in the U.S. Senate criticized the crypto industry, pressing the Securities and Exchange Commission to be more aggressive in its regulatory style.  Democrat Senator Dick Durbin D-III condemned the activities of crypto companies in the United States. The government official said: They spent billions on sports arena or stadium naming rights deals to gain misguided credibility with everyday Americans and manipulate prices with phony tokens of no underlying value. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, asked Gensler why there was &#8220;no emergency injunction to force the bankrupt FTX exchange to halt its operations before collapsing last November.&#8221;  The SEC chairman responded, saying: We investigate by the book. You, I&#8217;m sure, and the American public, want us to follow the facts, follow the law, properly get people subpoenas. Although Gensler agreed with the Senators’ claims about the crypto industry and the need for more policies, he made a case for the underlying technology. Meanwhile, he took the opportunity to request more funding for his agency.

					<description><![CDATA[Digital asset management platform Blofin has released a report that explores the changing narrative of the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the diverging correlation between Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).  The report suggests that BTC is becoming an increasingly prominent macro underlying asset, approaching the status of traditional assets such as foreign exchange and precious metals, while ETH&#8217;s narrative is shifting towards mega stocks. BTC Gaining Prominence As Macro Underlying Asset According to the report, the attractiveness of ETH for liquidity may continue to be weaker than that of BTC, especially in the current era of &#8220;lack of liquidity,&#8221; unless there is a grander narrative and widespread application.  Moreover, the report notes that a new Crypto 3.0 narrative has emerged, which combines macro trading, artificial intelligence (AI), and other factors. The report suggests that BTC&#8217;s macro attributes have been continuously strengthened by existing and external liquidity preferences, with the Bitcoin network becoming a natural macro underlying asset. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro The report also highlights the importance of BTC being a fully compliant asset, unlike ETH, which has not been recognized as a security by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  This ambiguity around ETH&#8217;s status implies risk, while BTC has been identified as a commodity. Institutions are less likely to take risks on compliance, making BTC the preferred choice for many investors. Last but not least, the report also considers three scenarios for the future price of BTC, depending on changes in interest rates and market expectations.  The most optimistic scenario involves a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) passing and pushing BTC&#8217;s market share up to 60%, resulting in a market cap of $960b and a unit price of over $49,400.  However, if investors have no better expectations and the crypto market capitalization is limited, the market capitalization of BTC will fluctuate between $600-$700b, and the price will fluctuate between $30,880-$36,026. Caution Until Bitcoin Can Sustain Above $32,000 Capriole Invest, a leading provider of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investment strategies, has released its latest Bitcoin Macro Index report.  The report provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the current state of the cryptocurrency market, combining over 40 powerful on-chain, macro market, and equity indicators into a single machine-learning model. The report reveals that Bitcoin is facing significant resistance at the $32,000 mark, despite a series of positive news stories for the industry in recent weeks.  While the Blackrock ETF announcement, XRP legal victory, and backing from presidential candidate Kennedy for backing the US Dollar with Bitcoin have all made headlines, they have not been able to sustain momentum above $31,000. Related Reading: Arkansas Senator Calls For Reversal Of Controversial New Crypto Mining Law According to the report, until Bitcoin can convincingly sustain price levels above $32,000, it is prudent to be conservative in the upper $30,000 region. On the high timeframe technicals, Bitcoin has failed to break out of weekly resistance at $32,000, suggesting a greater area of opportunity on a $32,000 break or reversion to the mid-$20,000s. The report concludes that while opportunities for trades may exist if the range lows can hold on to the lower time-frames at the end of the day, the risk-reward opportunity is not present for high-conviction investments. Despite a 50% increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s mining network in the last six months, long-term value remains, but now is probably not the time to go all-in. At present, Bitcoin is facing a challenge to maintain its position above the crucial $30,000 line, which is a fundamental psychological level for investors with a positive outlook for the cryptocurrency.  The leading digital asset in the market is currently trading at $29,750, indicating a 0.8% decline in the past 24 hours.
