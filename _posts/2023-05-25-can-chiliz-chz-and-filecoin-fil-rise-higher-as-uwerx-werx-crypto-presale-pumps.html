<p class="s6">There are over 22,000 cryptocurrencies in the coin market today, yet new coins are introduced almost daily. Uwerx is one of these new coins, and it is already turning heads with its impressive presale. Having completed its first, second, and third presale, this freelance-focused project is the coin to watch in the crypto market. </p>
<p class="s6">This article will explore why Uwerx is turning heads in its presale. But first, we shall look at the latest development in Chiliz (CHZ) and Filecoin (FIL).</p>
<p class="s9">Chiliz (CHZ): Made For Sport Fans</p>
<p class="s6">After Chiliz (CHZ) introduced the One Shirt Pledge in April 2023, the coin experienced a slight rise in price. The One Shirt Pledge was introduced to get athletes to raise money for goals like LGBTQ Acceptance, Gender Equity, and even for support for people affected by earthquakes. This One Shirt Pledge has been a success so far. </p>
<p class="s6">Chiliz then moved on to other ventures. They partnered with Sony Pictures to promote the latest Spider-Man movie, Through the Spider-verse. </p>
<p class="s6">On May 10, 2023, Chiliz (CHZ) announced the launch of the Chiliz Chain mainnet. According to the announcement, The Chiliz Chain Mainnet is the first-of-its-kind blockchain infrastructure for sports and entertainment. On the same day, they announced that the Chiliz Bridge was officially live. Users can use the bridge to migrate their $CHZ from the Ethereum mainnet (ERC-20) to Chiliz Chain (CAP-20).</p>
<p class="s6">Thanks to these new collaborations and innovations, Chiliz (CHZ) experienced a slight rise in value. But in the past 24 hours, Chiliz (CHZ) has fallen by -0.94% and currently trades at $0.11. Although traders and fans still expect a rise soon, analysts advise them to turn to the ongoing Uwerx presale for a chance at profits before the year runs out.</p>
<p class="s9">Filecoin (FIL) Data Storage Innovation Grows</p>
<p class="s6">Filecoin (FIL) has become a critical addition to the decentralized web. This is thanks to its innovative approach to data storage. The project recently made several announcements, including the release of Waterlily, the IPC Subnet, and FIL Covered Call Vaults. </p>
<p class="s6">Waterlily is a generative AI art platform that utilizes the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) to pay artists for their pictures or designs. In addition, the IPC Subnet helps in facilitating high-performance use cases for the apps on FVM. Finally, the FIL Covered Call Vaults is a novel financial product that enables FIL holders to generate additional income by selling call options on their FIL assets. </p>
<p class="s6">Thanks to these innovations, Filecoin (FIL) has performed below better in the past 24 hours. The project sells for $4.42, a 2.16% increase from the last 24 hours. Filecoin (FIL) is ranked #31 in the coin market, with a market cap of $1,866,102,488. </p>
<p class="s6">Analysts believe that as more traders and companies seek decentralized data solutions, Filecoin (FIL) will continue to grow.</p>
<p class="s9">Uwerx (WERX): Set To Break Records In the Freelance Industry </p>
<p class="s6">The freelance industry proved its resilience during the pandemic. While other industries recorded losses, the freelance industry experienced exponential growth. This strong and ever-growing industry is where Uwerx is coming in to make much-needed changes that will benefit freelancers and investors. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx will solve the issues of pending payments, lack of transparency in pricing, high fees, etc. It will provide real-world value while offering incentives to users. So what will freelancers benefit from Uwerx? </p>
<p class="s6">With its blockchain technology, Uwerx will bring decentralization, faster payments, intellectual property rights protection, and affordable fees to the freelance industry. These are features that freelancers have been craving in the industry.</p>
<p class="s6">Regarding fees, traditional freelance platforms charge as high as 20% as a transaction fee, but that will not be the case with Uwerx. Uwerx will charge only 1%. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx has set strong foundations to make it a reckoning force in the freelance sector and the coin market.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers had initially decided to place a 25-year liquidity lock on their tokens, starting at the end of the Uwerx presale. But after a poll in which 82.8% of the Uwerx community favored locking the developer's tokens prior to the end of the presale, the team has agreed to activate the lock before the end of the presale at a soon-to-be-announced date.</p>
<p class="s6">The project has completed audits from InterFi Network and SolidProof before the presale. In addition, the team announced that they would renounce smart contract ownership of Uwerx when the project is ready to list on centralized exchanges. </p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is available now at $0.0315 in its fifth presale stage and selling fast. The team has indicated that a price increase is imminent. To compensate for this rise in demand, Uwerx developers have made some changes. Of the total supply of 750,000,000 WERX tokens, the team has allocated 57% (427,500,000) of it for presale. This allocation is a change from the previous 45% (300,000,000). </p>
<p class="s6">Before now, the team had allocated 60,000,000 tokens for the fourth presale. This allocation has been increased to 77,500,000 tokens. There will now be the 5th stage which will have 72,500,000 tokens available for sale. </p>
<p class="s6">The Uwerx team has also increased the coin's launch price to $0.095 - $0.115. As for the date for the end of the presale, it still remains July 31, 2023. After considering that 98.2% of the Uwerx community voted for a Test Airdrop. The team has decided to run the Airdrop to help users know if they entered their Receiving Wallet address correctly.</p>
<p class="s6">The developers have also decreased the founding team's token allocation from 8% to 7%. Additionally, the Uwerx team has announced that they will share the Alpha version of the Uwerx platform in a few days. Furthermore, on May 19, 2023, they will release the platform's landing page and sign-up/sign-in pages.</p>
<p class="s6">They have also announced the Uwerx Vault, a feature that will help sustain the Uwerx Community by allowing them to store their WERX tokens for a period. </p>
<p class="s6">These features are what have put Uwerx in the limelight. The project currently boasts of 5,000 users. While Chiliz (CHZ) and Filecoin (FIL) have unique features, Uwerx has more factors that tip the scales in its favor. Considering the locked liquidity, full audit done before the presale, low fees, etc., you will see why analysts see tremendous potential in Uwerx. Analysts believe it could increase in value up to $2 by Q4 2023</p>
<p class="s6">Experienced traders know that buying a high-value coin like Uwerx, in its presale stage, is a great way to earn massively in the coin market. There is a 20% bonus for every WERX token purchased, but this bonus will be reduced soon.&nbsp;So, take advantage of this info and join the Uwerx presale now. </p>
