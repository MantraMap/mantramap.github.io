<p>Uniswap founder Hayden Adam&rsquo;s Twitter account suffered a breach, with hackers sending out several tweets leading users to scam websites and phishing links.</p>
<p>Crypto Twitter was quick to warn users of the hack and urged them not to click on any links tweeted by the compromised account.&nbsp;</p>
Back In Control&nbsp;
<p>Adams was able to regain control of his Twitter account a few hours after the attack was first reported. After regaining access to his account, Adams thanked the community for their assistance and warned others of the malicious links tweeted from the account. He also stated that he will share more updates soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In control of my Twitter again. Appreciate everyone who helped out tonight and the effort people put in to help with takedowns, warnings, etc. Will follow up with updates when ready.&rdquo;</p>

Details Of The Hack&nbsp;
<p>The hack was first reported on the &ldquo;Web3 Security Alerts&rdquo; channel on Telegram, which notified its followers that the Twitter account belonging to the Uniswap founder was compromised. Hackers used the account to tweet that Uniswap&rsquo;s Permit2 contract was affected by an unknown exploit and user tokens were at risk. The tweet then encouraged users to click on a malicious link to secure their tokens. However, the scam tweet, the first of many, was online only for a few minutes before being removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after the first tweet, several more malicious tweets from the account were reported, with one tweet asking UniswapX users to check their eligibility to receive gifted $UNI tokens by clicking a link to a website hosted in Russia. A Twitter user was quick to notice that the website in question was registered on the day the hack had been orchestrated, suggesting considerable planning behind the entire episode. The official Uniswap Twitter handle was quick to step in, warning users of the hack and asking them not to click on any of the links, urging them to wait for updates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;@haydenzadamsTwitter account has been hacked. Please do not click on any links. There is no giveaway, airdrop, or bounty. The Protocol has not been hacked or exploited. We will let you know when the issue is resolved.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hack did not impact the Uniswap protocol or any of its functions.&nbsp;</p>
An Age Old Problem&nbsp;
<p>Hackers have long been using social media platforms to exploit user accounts and seize control of their assets. Meta&rsquo;s new Twitter Rival, Threads, saw over 100 million sign-ups in days. However, hackers quickly appeared on the platform, promoting fake non-fungible token projects and impersonating prominent crypto personalities. However, social media organizations have taken notice of the growing menace and have taken steps to curb such attempts. On the 1st of July, Elon Musk announced that Twitter would be introducing a temporary limit on the number of posts users could read in a day as it looked to detect and eliminate bots and other bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security experts have also highlighted the importance of SIM card-based 2FA and also recommended options such as Authy or Google Authenticator to secure their accounts. Both platforms utilize time-sensitive codes on user devices, minimizing the risks of a hack occurring through SIM swaps.</p>
