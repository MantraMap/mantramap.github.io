<p class="s9">Dogecoin (DOGE) Whale Moves 2 Billion DOGE </p>
<p class="s7">A major Dogecoin (DOGE) whale made significant moves on May 9th, unloading 300 million DOGE tokens, equivalent to $21.73 million, onto Binance. A deeper dive into on-chain data reveals that this whale conducted a staggering transaction of 1.98 billion DOGE, valued at $160 million. The transaction saw the transfer of the remaining 1.68 billion DOGE to a new wallet, making it the 8th largest wallet holding 1.21% of the total DOGE in circulation. Concurrently, other whales have shifted their DOGE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) holdings, some opting for PEPE or temporarily stepping back from the market.</p>
<p class="s7">Over the past 24 hours, a total of 2.20 billion DOGE tokens have been shifted. In the same period, DOGE's price has dropped by over 2%, currently valued at $0.073, amidst heightened trading volume due to the whale-induced selloff. Binance's expanded support for tokens like PEPE and FLOKI raises questions about potential impact on DOGE's price. As DOGE trades below critical levels, the likelihood of it hitting the $0.065 support level is high. This downward trend, anticipated by whales, is evident in both Shiba Inu and Dogecoin.</p>
<p class="s9">Huobi Token (HT) Struggles as Decentralized Exchanges Gain Traction</p>
<p class="s7">Exchange cryptocurrencies like Huobi Token (HT) were once considered among the safest investments in the crypto space. However, with the recent failure of FTX, major cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance face regulatory scrutiny, the growing popularity of decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the enthusiasm for Huobi Token (HT) and other exchange-based tokens have waned.</p>
<p class="s7">Huobi Token (HT) roots lie in China, a country currently experiencing technological decoupling from the US. This increases the likelihood of regulatory crackdowns, potentially hindering Huobi Token (HT) from fully recovering from these setbacks. While Huobi Token (HT) prospects and other exchange-based tokens seem bleak, many opportunities abound in the crypto market. For example, Yachtify (YCHT) is aiming to revive the NFT market and momentum is already building in its favor.</p>
