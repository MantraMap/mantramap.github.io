<h2>Disputes Over Robinhood Shares</h2>
<p>FTX co-founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) is trying to regain control of his Robinhood shares that are currently disputed by several parties, including SBF himself, the new FTX management, and bankrupt crypto lender Blockfi.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried has asked the bankruptcy court to deny the motion to enforce the automatic stay (stay motion) filed by the new FTX management on 56,273,269 shares of Robinhood Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: HOOD), worth more than $460 million, a Thursday court filing shows.</p>
<p>The court document details that the former FTX chief &#8220;requests that the stay motion be denied&#8221; because the new FTX management has &#8220;failed to carry their heavy burden of establishing that such an extraordinary remedy is warranted.&#8221; Moreover, the stay motion should be &#8220;moot&#8221; since the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has obtained a warrant to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-seizes-robinhood-shares-linked-to-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">seize the Robinhood shares</a>, the court filing adds, noting that the new FTX management has not withdrawn the stay motion, prompting Bankman-Fried to file an objection.</p>
<p>The court filing further explains that SBF &#8220;requires some of these funds to pay for his criminal defense,&#8221; claiming that a &#8220;financial inability to defend oneself has serious consequences, and is irreparable.&#8221; The filing continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conversely, the FTX debtors face only the possibility of economic loss.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bankman-Fried argued that the Robinhood shares in dispute are not owned by Alameda Research or any other entities implicated in the FTX bankruptcy. Instead, they are owned by Emergent Fidelity Technology Ltd., a company that is 90% owned by him. According to the court filing, Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, another FTX executive, borrowed the funds from Alameda for Emergent to purchase the Robinhood shares.</p>

<h2>Crypto Community Outraged by SBF&#8217;s Statements</h2>
<p>Many people on social media are outraged by Bankman-Fried&#8217;s claim that he is facing greater harm than FTX customers who only suffer &#8220;the possibility of economic loss.&#8221;</p>
<p>One person <a href="https://twitter.com/lex_node/status/1611350015263531010">tweeted</a>: &#8220;SBF gives new meaning to chutzpah. Arguing in court that the balance of equities weighs in favor of him selling HOOD to pay his own legal fees because prison is a priceless harm and FTX creditors will only suffer economic loss.&#8221; Another <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1611312076789805058">opined</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is one of the most disgusting lines I&#8217;ve ever read. Associating your name with a claim that debtors&#8217; economic loss isn&#8217;t a matter of life and death for some people is heartless and out of touch. What happened to &#8216;Nothing matters more than making customers whole&#8217;?</p></blockquote>

Public officials that want to be exempted from this new regulation will have to obtain a waiver from the Nigerian Presidency. </strong></p>
<h2>Government Workers Vulnerable to Money Laundering</h2>
<p>Nigerian government workers will be prohibited from drawing cash from government accounts starting on March 1, Modibbo R. Hamman Tukur, the head of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU), has said. The new rule, which reportedly applies to federal, local and state officials, seeks to tackle the high levels of corruption and money laundering in government.</p>
<p>In addition, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-bar-cash-withdrawals-government-accounts-statement-2023-01-07/#:~:text=ABUJA%2C%20Jan%206%20(Reuters),NFIU)%20said%20in%20a%20statement">Reuters</a> report said the new rule in is tandem with the Nigerian government’s goal of achieving a cashless economy. The report also quotes Tukur explaining the reasons behind this decision. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Civil servants are becoming more and more vulnerable to money laundering and its predicate offences due to their exposure to cash withdrawals from public accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>To support Tukur’s assertions, the report said an analysis by NFIU — an autonomous unit within the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) — had shown that between 2015 and 2022 officials withdrew cash equivalent to $2.45 billion from government accounts. Most of the withdrawals were above the set limits, the report added.</p>

<h2>The CBN&#8217;s New Payments System Blueprint</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in instances where cash is needed, Tukur said officials will have to apply for a waiver from the presidency. However, this may only be granted on a &#8220;case-by-case basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its recently <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2022/CCD/PSMD%20vision%202025%20EDITED%20FINAL.pdf">unveiled</a> Nigeria Payments System Vision 2025 document, the CBN said aims to &#8220;have a cashless and efficient electronic payment system&#8221; that supports financial services in all sectors by 2025. To help it achieve this, the CBN has instituted a number of reforms that include issuing newly designed naira banknotes and phasing out old ones.</p>
<p>The CBN has also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-central-bank-increases-cash-withdrawal-limits-after-receiving-feedback-from-stakeholders/">imposed</a> cash withdrawal limits for both corporate organizations and individuals. Recently, the bank also <a href="https://punchng.com/cbn-bans-over-the-counter-withdrawal-of-new-notes/">reportedly</a> directed banks to stop over-the-counter cash withdrawals of the new banknotes.</p>
<p>Besides limiting the use of cash, the CBN is also seeking to boost the use of its flagging central bank digital currency. However, despite the several steps taken to make the CBDC attractive to users, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-cbdc-still-not-widely-used-a-year-after-launch/">reported</a> in October 2022 that many Nigerians had not embraced this.</p>

The hedge funds were allegedly issued subpoenas by the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office for the Western District of Washington.</strong></p>
<h2>Sources Say U.S. Department of Justice Probes American Hedge Funds in Cryptocurrency Investigation</h2>
<p>Following a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/">report</a> in mid-December 2022 that said Binance is being probed by the U.S. Department of Justice, a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/01/07/binance-subpoenas-crypto-trading/?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=wp_news_alert_revere&amp;location=alert">report</a> from The Washington Post claims American hedge funds are being investigated as part of the probe. The Washington Post contributor Douglas MacMillan details that subpoenas were issued to the hedge funds and they came from the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office for the Western District of Washington.</p>
<p>MacMillan cites two sources who &#8220;reviewed one of the subpoenas and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the confidential matter.&#8221; The reporter further adds that the subpoenas don&#8217;t mean investigators will make any charges. &#8220;Prosecutors are still discussing a possible settlement with Binance and weighing whether they have enough evidence to bring indictments against the company,&#8221; MacMillan wrote.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s largest exchange by global trade volume, Binance, has been dealing with a great deal of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-speculation-and-rumors-surrounding-binance-exchange-token-bnb-suffers-losses-from-the-alleged-fud/">scrutiny</a> over the last two months since FTX collapsed. MacMillan talked to Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, who said that the exchange was talking with &#8220;virtually every regulator across the globe on a daily basis.&#8221; Hillmann, however, and a DOJ spokesperson declined to comment on the alleged investigation.</p>

<p>The subpoenas report comes at a time when media outlets are reporting on a number of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-federal-prosecutors-in-new-york-probe-digital-currency-group-and-subsidiary-genesis/">ostensible probes</a> into crypto asset firms and companies associated with these businesses. At the end of December 2022, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-sec-heightens-probe-into-auditors-servicing-crypto-exchanges/">reported</a> that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating companies that audit crypto exchange reserves. A large handful of the so-called investigations have not been officially verified by U.S. law enforcement officials, but it’s safe to say the reports have the crypto community on edge these days.</p>

Over the past 65 days, gold has soared 14.55% while silver has skyrocketed 22.31% against the greenback since Nov. 3, 2022. According to the head of metals strategy at MKS Pamp Group, there is a &#8220;decent amount of bullish &#8216;pent-up&#8217; demand that has been carried over from last year&#8221; for gold.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank Demand and Ongoing Geopolitical Tensions Continue to Drive Gold&#8217;s Ascent</h2>
<p>The insistence for gold has continued to rise according to market prices during the past seven days. Gold jumped from $1,823 per troy ounce to $1,866 in that time frame. While <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SAXO-XAUUSD/">gold</a> is up 2.36% against the U.S. dollar, a troy <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SAXO-XAUUSD/">ounce of fine silver</a> is down roughly 0.58% since the start of the year.</p>
<p>Over the past two months, both gold and silver have risen a great deal, with gold jumping 14.55% and silver increasing 22.31% against the greenback. With precious metals on the rise, ‘gold bugs’ believe the yellow metal is “set to shine in 2023.”</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4567548-gold-set-to-shine-in-2023-why-you-should-invest-now">two-part series</a>, &#8220;Gold Mining Bull,&#8221; an author for Seeking Alpha, argues that gold will perform better in 2023. The author cites <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-gold-demand-rose-at-the-fastest-pace-in-55-years-analyst-says-silver-could-outperform-gold-in-2023/">central bank demand</a> and “ongoing geopolitical tensions” as reasons for optimism. Gold Mining Bull is paying particularly close attention to central bank gold purchases this year.</p>
<p>“Central banks around the world, particularly in China, Turkey, and India, have been buying gold at a record pace,” the author explains. “This trend has been going on for the past 13 consecutive years, but recently the pace has accelerated.” The analyst adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>They have been increasing their gold reserves in recent years as a way to diversify their foreign exchange holdings and reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the author also believes there are six more things that could boost gold&#8217;s price, including a rebound in jewelry demand, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s eventual pivot, the escalation of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/top-three-macroeconomic-events-to-watch-in-2023-amid-volatile-market-conditions/">Ukraine-Russia war</a>, a weaker U.S. dollar, a limited new mine supply, and the possibility of China invading Taiwan.</p>

<p>Central bank gold purchases have been a particularly influential factor in terms of gold interest over the past year. According to analysts <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e0983ebb-bbe0-4d33-8517-e19fa06e1a77">cited</a> by the Financial Times, Russia and China accumulated the most gold in 2022 in terms of demand.</p>

<h2>MKS Pamp Group&#8217;s Head of Metals Strategy Comments on Gold&#8217;s Positive Market Trend</h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/nixsa84">Nicky Shiels</a>, head of metals strategy and macro for MKS Pamp Group, <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-01-06/Gold-price-surges-back-to-6-month-highs-on-mixed-U-S-data-focus-shifts-to-inflation-next-week.html">told</a> Kitco News on Friday that there has been pent-up demand for gold, which could indicate a positive market trend. Shiels discussed this week&#8217;s rising <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_total_nonfarm_payrolls">U.S. nonfarm payrolls</a> and said there is &#8220;simply nothing recessionary&#8221; about the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">report</a>.</p>
<p>As for gold, it depends on whether the precious metal can maintain its weekly appreciation. &#8220;Depending on whether gold can hold its weekly gains (which is looking increasingly likely), it solidifies the offensive way gold has been trading since it established a mild bull trend since early November – always looking for reasons to rally,&#8221; she said. Shiels continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a decent amount of bullish &#8216;pent-up&#8217; demand that has been rolled over from last year and can get ignited on the right data point (CPI &amp; PCE) will be far more telling.</p></blockquote>
<p>On Jan. 5, 2023, Shiels also shared MKS Pamp Group&#8217;s 2023 <a href="https://twitter.com/MKSPAMP/status/1610990603340492800?s=20&amp;t=Iru5POObuk38dJeXO_wKqg">precious metals forecast</a>, which shows an average price of $1,880 for gold and $22.50 for silver. According to the forecast, gold could reach a high of $2,100 and silver could reach $28 per ounce in 2023. ABN AMRO <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-08-29/ABN-AMRO-downgrades-gold-price-but-sees-solid-support-around-1-700.html">expects</a> gold to be around $1,900 per ounce in 2023, and Saxo Bank has <a href="https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/gold-rockets-to-usd-3000-as-central-banks-fail-on-inflation-mandate-06122022">detailed</a> that gold could reach $3K per ounce this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;2023 is the year that the market finally discovers that inflation is set to remain ablaze for the foreseeable future,&#8221; said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo. Juerg Kiener, managing director and chief investment officer of Swiss Asia Capital, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/gold-at-4000-analysts-share-their-2023-outlook-for-prices.html">thinks</a> gold could possibly even surge to $4K per ounce in 2023.</p>

In a statement, representatives from Banxico, the central bank of Mexico, stated the development of the currency was still in its initial stages, and there is still no date set for its launch.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mexican CBDC Launch Date Still Not Determined</h2>
<p>On Dec. 29, 2021, the Mexican government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mexico-announces-it-will-issue-its-own-digital-coin-by-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the development of its own digital peso via social media, which would be launched circa 2024. However, this timeline is becoming more and more unlikely to be fulfilled, according to new information coming from Banxico, the central bank of the country.</p>
<p>According to local sources, the Mexican central bank digital currency (CBDC) is still in its initial stages of development, with the general directorate of payment systems and market infrastructures, the division of the bank tasked with its construction, still determining the requirements for its issuance.</p>
<p>On the possible date of issuance of the digital peso, Banxico <a href="https://www.elsoldemexico.com.mx/finanzas/moneda-digital-de-banxico-se-encuentra-en-fase-inicial-9408699.html/amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The result of this initial phase entails the preparation of a budget that is currently being determined, and will in turn allow establishing a probable date on which said CBDC will be available.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, it was disclosed more than $500,000 was used for the development of this currency during 2022, allocated from funds provided by Banxico.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Other Launch Date Estimates and Details</h2>
<p>Other estimations for the launch date of the Mexican CBDC have been made by different officers of the government. In April, the governor of Banxico, Victoria Rodríguez Ceja, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-peso-to-be-launched-in-three-years-according-to-governor-of-banxico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the whole development cycle would take the institution around three years. However, this contradicts the statements made by the institution claiming that there is still no launch date for the digital peso.</p>
<p>At the time, Rodriguez Ceja also established a clear distinction between the future CBDC and other cryptocurrencies, stating that they were unsupported assets, and were not legal tender in the country. The Mexican CBDC is designed to be interconnected with the traditional financial system, allowing banks to facilitate the transaction of these tokens through the already-existent payment system.</p>
<p>Mexico is another country on the long list of nations that are currently investigating or already developing their CBDCs. According to the Bank of International Settlements, eight of every ten central banks are currently studying these solutions.</p>

The searches took place in late 2022 following an earlier investigation which established that crypto traders had failed to report digital assets exceeding $50 million in value. </strong></p>
<h2>Law Enforcement and Tax Authorities in Romania Go After Crypto Taxpayers</h2>
<p>Police and tax officials in Romania have carried out 17 raids in the fall of last year as part of an investigation against persons accused of evading taxation by concealing profits from transactions with cryptocurrencies, local media revealed.</p>
<p>Addresses were searched in the capital Bucharest as well as the counties of Dâmbovița, Ilfov and Olt, according to Cristian Roman, partner at the Iordăchescu &amp; Asociații law firm, who shared the information with Romania Journal.</p>
<p>The lawyer was referring to data provided by the Romanian police. Law enforcement authorities in the EU country allege that, between 2019 and 2022, 19 targeted individuals formed or joined an organized crime group for the purpose of tax evasion.</p>
<p>The taxable income, which they tried to hide, was obtained from transactions with digital currencies, investigators claim. According to preliminary estimates, their activities have resulted in losses for the state budget totalling 3 million Romanian lei (almost $650,000).</p>
<h2>Tax Authority Moves to Increase Compliance Among Crypto Taxpayers</h2>
<p>The operation was conducted after the tax fraud combatting unit of the National Agency for Fiscal Administration (ANAF) launched a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tax-agency-starts-checking-crypto-traders-in-romania/">probe</a> last summer into proceeds from crypto trading received between 2016 and 2021 through various platforms such as Binance, Kucoin, Maiar, Bitmart, and the now-bankrupt <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/turkey-investigates-former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-for-fraud-seizes-assets/">FTX</a>.</p>
<p>At the time, tax inspectors identified revenues of over €131 million obtained by 63 Romanian citizens. They were also able to establish that the persons had failed to report over €48 million worth of digital assets on their tax returns.</p>
<p>ANAF explained that its actions were part of a push to increase taxation and compliance among taxpayers. According to amendments to the Romanian Tax Code passed by the parliament in 2019, income resulting from the transfer of virtual currencies is taxable at a 10% rate on capital gains exceeding an annual threshold of 600 lei (approx. $130).</p>

According to the executive, the need to tighten regulatory oversight stems from the “disorder” in the industry throughout the past year.</strong></p>
<h2>Licensing Should Replace Registration for Crypto Firms in France, Governor Galhau Says</h2>
<p>Banque de France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has urged for subjecting crypto businesses to stricter regulatory requirements. Licensing must be introduced instead of the current registration in response to the recent volatility in the sector, he insisted.</p>
<p>De Galhau also thinks that Paris should not hesitate but act even before the upcoming EU regulations take effect and make it obligatory for Digital Asset Service Providers (DASPs) to obtain licenses from the French government, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>Around 60 platforms working with cryptocurrencies have so far registered with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (<a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMF</a>), France’s financial markets authority, including global players such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-approved-by-french-regulator-fully-regulated-digital-asset-service-provider/">Binance</a>, the world’s largest crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Licenses are still optional and there are no licensees yet among the digital asset service providers registered in France. Speaking to representatives of the financial sector on said Thursday, Villeroy de Galhau stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>All the disorder in 2022 feeds a simple belief: it is desirable for France to move to an obligatory licensing of DASP as soon as possible, rather than just registration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Digital asset service providers which want to be granted a license are required by the AMF to comply with certain standards in terms of organization, available financial resources and business conduct, the report notes.</p>
<p>The governor’s proposal comes after last summer key EU institutions and member states reached an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-makes-deal-on-mica-legislation-to-regulate-crypto-markets/">agreement</a> on the new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation and achieved <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-agreement-reached-on-anti-money-laundering-rules-for-cryptocurrencies/">consensus</a> on a set of new anti-money laundering rules for the industry.</p>
<p>The regulatory package is expected to enter into force in 2023 but businesses will have another 12 to 18 months to comply with it. Brussels also wants to oblige platforms processing crypto transactions for EU residents to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brussels-wants-all-crypto-service-providers-to-report-transactions-of-europeans/">report</a> to tax authorities in the Union.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think France will introduce a licensing regime for crypto companies before MiCA enters into force? Share your expectations in the comments section below. </strong></em></p>

The former FTX executive has been charged with &#8220;defrauding customers of FTX.com, investors in FTX.com, and lenders to Alameda Research,&#8221; the Justice Department noted.</strong></p>
<h2>DOJ Urges Victims of SBF Fraud to Come Forward</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) reached out to victims of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)&#8217;s fraud via its website Friday, explaining their rights and asking them to come forward. Bankman-Fried co-founded FTX and served as its CEO when the crypto exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed for bankruptcy</a> in November last year.</p>
<p>The DOJ wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you believe that you may have been a victim of fraud by Samuel Bankman-Fried, a/k/a &#8216;SBF,&#8217; please contact the victim/witness coordinator at the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office … for assistance in verifying whether you are a victim in this case.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Justice Department explained that on Dec. 13, 2022, &#8220;an eight-count indictment was unsealed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-indicted-by-federal-grand-jury-in-manhattan-bahamian-magistrate-denies-sbfs-bail/">charging</a> Samuel Bankman-Fried with defrauding customers of FTX.com, investors in FTX.com, and lenders to Alameda Research.&#8221;</p>
<p>The DOJ detailed: &#8220;Bankman-Fried is charged with wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and conspiracy to defraud the United States and violate the campaign finance laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors are required by federal law to contact possible crime victims to inform them of their rights.</p>
<p>However, in court papers filed on Friday, federal prosecutors in Manhattan asked U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who has been assigned to the SBF case, for permission to use a website to notify victims, rather than contacting each individually. They claimed that the collapsed crypto exchange FTX could owe money to more than one million people, making it &#8220;impracticable&#8221; to contact each person.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried, who is currently at his parents&#8217; house on a $250 billion bond, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-ftx-ceo-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty-to-criminal-charges-bond-signees-names-remain-sealed/">pleaded not guilty</a> to fraud charges. Meanwhile, the DOJ has moved to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-seizes-robinhood-shares-linked-to-ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried/">seize</a> shares of Robinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), worth about $460 million, linked to the former FTX boss.</p>
