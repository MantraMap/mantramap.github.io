<li>Bitcoin cash is facing barrier near the $105 and $108 resistance levels against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above the $100 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $100 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $104 and $105 to continue higher in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is climbing above $100 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-aims-steady-increase-to-18k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $105 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $95 level. BCH started a recovery wave and was able to clear the $98 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $99 and $100 resistance levels. Recently, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $100 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The pair is now trading above the $100 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-downside-break-below-100-seems-real/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $104 level. The next major resistance is near the $105 level, above which the price may perhaps rise towards the $110 level. Any more gains above $110 and $112 could set the pace for a move towards the $120 level in the coming days.</p>
<p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $100 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $95 swing low to $104 high.</p>
<p>The first major support sits near the $98 level. It is near the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $95 swing low to $104 high. The next major support is near $95, below which the bears might aim $90. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $88 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao – the man behind famed digital currency exchange Binance – has pledged <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/25/terra-luna-20-binance-ceo-reveals-huge-2-billion-fund-after-ftx-meltdown-crashed-the-bitcoin-and-crypto-price/?sh=20081532753b" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">roughly $2 billion to help</a> save the digital currency arena.</p>
<h2>Binance Is Looking to Save the Crypto Space</h2>
<p>The crypto space has been failing as of late. Bitcoin, for example, has lost more than 70 percent of its overall value since it reached its new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021. In general, crypto has lost more than $2.2 trillion in valuation, and many companies have either had to file for bankruptcy or have disappeared from the world of trading and digital coins for good.</p>
<p>One of the biggest fiascos to emerge from all this hype and drama was FTX, the once-glorified crypto exchange that rose through the ranks to become one of the most prominent digital currency trading companies out there. Beginning in 2019, FTX was only three years old, but was labeled the golden child of the space.</p>
<p>This all changed in mid-November when after <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">experiencing a liquidity crunch</a>, the company was forced into <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">bankruptcy rather suddenly</a>, and its head executive (Sam Bankman-Fried) resigned from his post. For a while, it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">looked like Binance was</a> going to be the company that saved it from the darkness, but this wasn’t meant to be.</p>
<p>The money provided by Binance will allegedly go towards supporting several different companies and projects within the industry’s borders. According to a blog post issued by the exchange:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mandate of this new effort is to support the most promising and highest quality companies and projects built by the best technologists and entrepreneurs that, through no fault of their own, are facing significant, short-term, financial difficulties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, Binance was saying it would only pledge $1 billion, though this quickly changed. Changpeng Zhao wrote on Twitter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Binance allocated another $1 billion [in Binance&#8217;s dollar-pegged stable coin] to the industry recovery initiative. It&#8217;s not the end of crypto. Far from it. It&#8217;s the beginning of a new chapter.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not everyone is crazy about the idea. Cory Klippensten – a known crypto skeptic – said of the situation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously, a CZ-led recovery fund won&#8217;t be any better than an SBF-led effort to &#8216;save crypto.’ All it means is more money pumped into the casino to fuel greater fool gambling on inherently worthless non-bitcoin crypto tokens. If CZ succeeds in further centralizing the non-bitcoin crypto industry, it will only make it more prone to collapse or regulatory capture.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Not Everyone&#8217;s Convinced This Will Work</h2>
<p>Liron Shapira – a crypto market commentator – also expressed doubt, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s hard to imagine a scenario where this particular fund does much to stop the inevitable collapse. The idea of an insurance fund against a structural, cascading collapse never works. At best, it can keep delaying by another day which is the whole way the Ponzi works in the first place. The more money they burn through, the longer they can keep it going.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tom Lee of Fundstrat fame believes that what happened with the now disgraced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto exchange FTX</a> should not reflect on bitcoin <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-crypto-crash-bitcoin-invest-untouchable-fundstrat-tom-lee-2022-11" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">or the industry in general</a>. He still believes in the power of crypto and doesn’t think the arena should suffer because of what a few bad actors have done.</p>
<h2>Tom Lee on Bitcoin and FTX</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Lee commented that the current bear run the crypto space is enduring is similar with the one it experienced in 2018. He said that bear run came to an end sooner than people anticipated. He commented that the space showed valid recovery in the following years, and he’s confident the same thing will happen this time around.</p>
<p>He further stated that the FTX fiasco isn’t likely to deliver a heavy-enough blow to the crypto sector given that bitcoin has historically always delivered solid returns. He further mentioned that this isn’t necessarily a bad thing in that many illicit firms and companies have now been permanently cut out.</p>
<p>Lee commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s an important moment for the industry. I think it is cleaning a lot of and cleansing a lot of bad players, but do I think crypto is dead? No, I think there [are] a lot of people throwing gasoline in a crowded theatre and yelling ‘fire,’ and it&#8217;s just going to be important for those who really like what decentralization and bitcoin are doing.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further mentioned that 2022 was a horrendous year for the crypto sector. Aside from many companies filing bankruptcy or disappearing from the space, the bitcoin price has suffered heavily. In November of 2021, for example, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap rose to a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit. Now, however, the asset is trading in the mid-$16K range, meaning it’s lost more than 70 percent of its value in about 12 months.</p>
<p>Lee said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been a horrific year for crypto. Nobody has made money in crypto in 2022. We first read about bitcoin in 2017, and we recommended people put one percent of their funds into bitcoin at the time. Bitcoin was under $1,000. That holding today would be 40 percent of their portfolio without rebalance.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Could Come Out Stronger</h2>
<p>Despite all the trouble the space has endured over the past year or so, he says his firm is still advising clients not to turn their backs on bitcoin and to invest in the digital asset in small doses so they can experience rewards once the market comes back. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, does bitcoin still make sense for someone who wants to sort of have some sort of ballast? Yes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastly, Lee said the crypto companies that survive the FTX drama will be like the banks that survived the 2008 financial collapse.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tiantian Kullander – the founder of digital currency firm Amber Group – is <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/young-crypto-founder-shocks-industry-233735362.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">alleged to have passed</a> away in his sleep on November 23 according to a statement from the company.</p>
<h2>Tiantian Kullander Has Passed On</h2>
<p>Kullander launched the enterprise in 2017. At the time of his death, the firm was valued at more than $3 billion and was in the process of garnering another $100 million. The company was composed of several workers who spent time in the traditional finance sector, some of whom had even worked with giants like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group.</p>
<p>In 2019, he was even placed on the Forbes under 30 list. He was also known as “TT” amongst those who were closest to him. In a statement, the company wrote the following about Kullander:</p>
<blockquote><p>He put his heart and soul into the company, in every stage of its growth. He led by example with his intellect, generosity, humility, diligence, and creativity… His depth of knowledge, his willingness to collaborate, and his desire to always help others benefited countless startups and individuals. His insights and creativity inspired many projects, people, and communities. We lost a great partner and a true friend in TT, and words cannot express our sorrow at this time. TT’s legacy will live on, and we will work even harder to make Amber the category-defining leader of our industry as this was TT’s ambition and dream.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aside from his work with Amber, he founded Keeper DAO prior to giving it back to the community. He also sat on the board of Fnatic, an e-sports organization. The company continued its praise of Kullander with:</p>
<blockquote><p>TT was a devoted husband, a loving father, and a fierce friend. His passing is a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family. He is survived by his wife and their beloved son. We kindly request that you respect their privacy during this difficult time.</p></blockquote>
<p>His death marks the second in crypto over the course of just the last few weeks, the first being Nikolas Mushegian who, at 29 years of age, was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-innovator-nikolai-mushegian-dies-in-puerto-rico/" data-wpel-link="internal">discovered along the shores</a> of Puerto Rico after purportedly drowning. The circumstances surrounding his death are mysterious given that just hours before his passing, he spoke on Twitter of an alleged plot by the CIA and other agencies within the U.S. to take his life and blame him for crimes he hadn’t committed.</p>
<h2>Two Over the Course of a Few Weeks</h2>
<p>At the time of his death, an unnamed source stated the following about Mushegian:</p>
<blockquote><p>He had mental problems. He saw a psychiatrist at times. He smoked a lot of pot. A tremendous amount. Some of his paranoia was based on fact. He’d discover things. He knew things. Nikolai got bored a lot with the mundane of life.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, Jan 4, 2023 – LBank Exchange, a global digital asset trading platform, will list LongRun (LR) on January 6, 2023. For all users of LBank Exchange, the LR/USDT trading pair will be officially available for trading at 9:00 UTC on January 6, 2023.</p>
<p>As a platform integrating sports IP with NFT, <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xb7bd2284680277fccd52f0a9eff50c7277367605?a=0x3DdfCffa85BA026f45Cc392405fB668d0fb36197" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">LongRun</a> (LR) builds a metaverse where users can enjoy sports while earning rewards. Its native token LR will be listed on LBank Exchange at 9:00 UTC on January 6, 2023, to further expand its global reach and help it achieve its vision.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing </strong><strong>LongRun</strong></p>
<p>Different from other NFT fields where creativity and community are considered as the main performance indicators, sports NFT projects are highly dependent on intellectual property (IP). LongRun is a project aimed at becoming a global sports IP NFT solution provider. It holds sports competitions and issues private NFTs accordingly to build a safe platform and create a healthy sports culture ecosystem.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of connectivity between sports NFT projects, LongRun believes that there’s massive value which remains untapped. The development and successful maintenance of sports NFT projects do not belong to the business areas of most sports IP (walking, running, etc.) owners, which may slow down the growth of these sports IP. Therefore, LongRun is committed to providing a fully customized UI and platform for global IP owners who want to enter the NFT or metaverse world.</p>
<p>One of the major features provided by LongRun platform is NFT game. In its solo mode, users can wear NFT sneakers and move to earn tokens. It also has mystery box, a loot box that drops randomly when entering solo mode. In addition to the solo mode, the game also features marathon mode. There are weekly and monthly marathons, to participate, users must register at least 24 hours before starting. Furthermore, there’s background mode, in which users can continue to receive tokens even if the application is not active; item mode, in which users can obtain a variety of items; and quest mode, in which users can receive rewards by completing various quests with different difficulties.</p>
<p>The goal of LongRun is to establish a decentralized platform to connect various sports to the metaverse. By using the LongRun platform, sports related companies and services can easily enter the metaverse world, and utilize officially licensed IP to build a blockchain based fan community, supporting multiple types of products and features. In 2023, LongRun plans to act as a main sponsor for one sports event and as a sponsor for two Korean prosports. Through this, it will create NFTs, safely distribute LR tokens, and build an ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>About LR Token</strong></p>
<p>LR is the native token of LongRun ecosystem. Unlike many other sports based solutions, LR token is not only a simple sports fan token, but also launched based on actual users&#8217; use/activity, and paid for rewards through walking, running, etc. It will also become the governance token of LongRun ecosystem.</p>
<p>Based on BEP-20, LR has a total supply of 1 billion (i.e., 1,000,000,000) tokens, of which 20% is provided for seed round, 30% is allocated to the team and advisors, 20% is provided for airdrop, 5% will be used for marketing, and the remaining 25% is allocated for the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The LR token will be listed on LBank Exchange at 9:00 UTC on January 6, 2023, investors who are interested in the LongRun investment can easily buy and sell LR token on LBank Exchange by then. The listing of LR token on LBank Exchange will undoubtedly help it further expand its business and draw more attention in the market.</p>
