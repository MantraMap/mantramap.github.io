<p class="s6">Investing early in a growth-bound project is considered the most profitable investment strategy. Market bulls usually follow this strategy, and have done it again with Tradecurve. Soon after the presale of Tradecurve was launched, investors started to accumulate a large number of TCRV tokens. It is projected to rise 50x during the presale phase, and 100x upon launch. On the contrary, Decentraland (MANA) and Uniswap (UNI) have lost their growth momentum.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s9">Uniswap (UNI) Crosses $1.5 Trillion In Trading Volume</p>
<p class="s6">The decentralized crypto exchange, Uniswap (UNI), has crossed a major milestone by trading volume. According to the latest data, Uniswap (UNI) has officially passed $1.5 trillion in trading volume. The Uniswap (UNI) exchange has witnessed a cumulative trading volume increase of $500 billion since April 2022. According to experts, Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) developmental measures taken in the past few months have been the primary reason behind the increased trading volume of the exchange. Recently, Uniswap (UNI) successfully secured approval from Apple&rsquo;s App Store for its iOS mobile app, which can increase its trade volume further. Meanwhile, the price of Uniswap (UNI) has increased by 3% in the past week. Currently, Uniswap (UNI) is changing hands at $5.61.</p>
<p class="s9">Decentraland (MANA) Falls Vertically</p>
<p class="s6">Amid the fizzling hype around the metaverse-based cryptocurrencies, Decentraland (MANA) has been pushing forward with new initiatives to increase its market presence. However, the price movement of Decentraland (MANA) has not followed the projects&rsquo; development. The market value of Decentraland (MANA) has plunged by 7% in the past month. Consequently, Decentraland (MANA) is currently trading at $0.56. The much-anticipated 2023 Metaverse Fashion Week of Decentraland (MANA) failed to attract users, due to the declining popularity of the project. Now, in the latest event, Decentraland (MANA) has partnered with Fidelity International to build an education-based metaverse. However, investors are worried whether Decentraland (MANA) will ever be able to regain its market, as the user count on the platform is continuously declining.</p>

<p class="s9">Tradecurve (TCRV) Shows The Best Growth Potential</p>
<p class="s6">There are many exchanges that allow the trade of cryptocurrencies, while others facilitate the trading of traditional instruments like equities, bonds, ETFs, Options, commodities, and more. However, there was an absence of a platform that enabled trading of all asset classes under a single hood, until the launch of Tradecurve.io </p>
<p class="s6">It is a Web3 trading exchange that allows the trading of a wide range of assets, without FIAT payments. Notably, the cryptocurrency market size was expected to showcase a CAGR of 12.8% from 2021 to 2030. Besides, a survey has indicated that 71% of top global investors expect the trading of equities to grow in 2023. Hence, Tradecurve has massive growth potential, and bulls are buoyed by this. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="s6">On this platform, traders can open an account using an email ID, and begin trading without any KYC process. Moreover, its users hold their keys, and control their assets. The platform also protects users&rsquo; privacy through DeFi capabilities, unlike platforms like Binance, which has mandated the completion of KYC before trading. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">Tradecurve's presale phase is live, and currently in its first stage. TCRV tokens are currently available at $0.01, and only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be supplied during the presale phase.</p>
