<p>SOL token lost 9.5% Friday to trade at $12.82 &#8211; according to CoinMarketCap &#8211; after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hopes-high-as-charles-hoskinson-speaks-on-solana-becoming-a-sidechain-to-cardano/">Solana</a>-based decentralized exchange Raydium was compromised for $2.2 million. In an afternoon <a href="https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol/status/1603762271028748289?s=20&amp;t=BRoVaUUWRSckHGIvoCAweg">tweet</a> on December 16, Raydium protocol wrote that the hacker overrode owners&#8217; authority in the liquidity pools.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>An exploit on Raydium is being investigated that affected liquidity pools</em>,&#8221; the tweet read. The post, which included the hacker&#8217;s account details, added that the &#8220;<em>initial understanding is the attacker overtook owner authority, but the authority has been halted on AMM &amp; farm programs for now</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>The exploit was discovered at around 2 PM UTC on Dec. 16, when Raydium admin posted 1,000 transactions to the Solana network – where each transaction moved liquidity without depositing an equivalent LP token. The vulnerability allowed the bad actor to access the LPs&#8217; funds – draining USDC, Wrapped SOL, and native Raydium token RAY.</p>



<p>Per data from analytics firm Nansen, &#8220;<em>The wallet draining LP Pools from Raydium liquidity pools has received over $2.2 million now, including $1.6 million SOL</em>,&#8221; the company shared the information on its official Twitter account.</p>



<h2 id="h-major-platforms-on-raydium-including-prism-and-compendium-withdraw-funds"><strong>Major platforms on Raydium, including Prism and Compendium, withdraw funds</strong></h2>



<p>Responding to the security breach, notable platforms based on Raydium have withdrawn their assets &#8211; even as the online crypto community faults the DEX for not having a multisig cold storage.</p>



<p>Compendium Foundation announced that it had temporarily withdrawn $CMFI, $USDC, and $SOL liquidity from Raydium following the incident. According to the firm,&#8221; <em>the attacker gained access to keys used (for collecting) fees from LP pools, and authority has since been halted</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>PRISM – a DEX aggregator aggregating liquidity sources across Raydium and Solana – has also pulled its fund from the exchange. The platform withdrew PRISM/USDC liquidity from Raydium, urging users to do the same. Per Prism&#8217;s account of the events, the malicious wallet was &#8220;<em>draining LP pools from Raydium liquidity pools using admin wallet as a signer without burning LP tokens</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>Raydium is a decentralized exchange on Solana that allows users to trade varying cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. According to data from DeFi aggregator DefiLlama, Raydium&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is $36 million &#8211; down 98% from a high of $2.21 billion in November before the fall of FTX.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market value, plunged further Friday as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-take-a-nosedive-as-fed-signal-more-interest-rates-hike/">hawkish comments</a> by Fed’s Chair Jeremy Powell on Wednesday continued to weigh down on investors.</p>



<p>Since tapping an all-time high in November last year, Bitcoin has lost over 75% of its value thanks to a myriad of factors. Attempts by price to recover were thwarted earlier last month by the unexpected debacle of crypto exchange FTX, sending prices below the $18,300 psychological support, which has increasingly become harder for bulls to breach.</p>



<p>According to data from IntoTheBlock, only 36% of BTC holders are making a profit at current prices, 14% are at breakeven, and 51% are in the red. Notably, a majority of those in profit are investors who have held coins for more than one year. Further, a majority of investors continue to hold a bearish outlook on Bitcoin, which is one of the most prevalent signals of an impending trend change.</p>



<h2 id="h-investors-scoop-more-btc"><strong>Investors Scoop More BTC</strong></h2>



<p>However, despite the continued drop in crypto prices, the number of Bitcoin investors stacking BTC recently has been rising, based on data by Glassnode.</p>



<p><em>“Bitcoin&#8217;s addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC have bought $726m in BTC the past 9 days,”</em> Glassnode wrote on Thursday, adding that 40,747 more Bitcoin (worth $726 million) had collectively entered those key whale wallets within that period. It is important to note that this category represents only 0.0364% of all BTC addresses. However, despite being small, this group typically makes decisions leading to future price movements.</p>



<p>Stablecoins have also been painting an encouraging picture. <em>“Stablecoin assets like USDT, BUSD, &amp; DAI are also being bought quickly. This is a recipe for good things,”</em> the firm added.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/hWazW20CMd3lmIU_5lzPxqeUbOBwFfgkIoEykxXU4Q4_lDXJQ279dQIyil1hLkhjauaoAyuodsaZAjiTXWG9ZrYv7D-Wx32LGtVUnzri_XKLTDl8XxdVroj2PGzy0TJz4Zg8o-uopdmSxMcttYGEgfmwm0uPVgf-6Ra2blaRtyVdWNXt5oQb_h6rP9lVGhNrWFiIXaqP_w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The chart above illustrates the percentage of supply held by key price-moving addresses for BTC, USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI and can be used to reveal the future of crypto prices.</p>



<p>According to the firm, “<em>when these lines are mainly going down, it&#8217;s not a great sign”</em> because it suggests wealthy players and institutional investors are exiting the markets. The chart thus depicts increased interest by more prominent players to purchase the said assets after reducing their holdings for about 14 months straight. Although we are yet to see a turnaround in price, with whales finally accumulating rather than dumping, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-on-why-bitcoin-price-has-likely-reached-bottom/">Bitcoin&#8217;s ebbing tide</a> may be in the offing.</p>



<p>At press time, the largest cryptocurrency by market value was trading at $16,829 after a 3.84% decrease in the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Earlier yesterday, the price attempted to recover, surging as much as $17,486 after bouncing off weekly support at $17,250 before deteriorating.</p>

<ul>
<li>The New York State Department of Financial Services has issued a new guideline to protect customers against the dangers of another cryptocurrency crash.</li>



<li>The new policy will make banks submit a detailed business plan to the body 90 days before they delve into cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>As New York takes the bull by the horn, other jurisdictions are expected to follow suit in the coming months.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>A cross-section of players in the digital asset industry believes it needs strategic regulations across all sectors to bring up dwindling confidence among investors.</p>



<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has released a new cryptocurrency regulation for banks and other financial institutions in its jurisdiction. The new guideline gives banks a 90-day window to submit a business plan to the authorities before dealing with digital asset firms.</p>



<p>As more banks and institutions delve into digital assets, the guideline will act as checks to monitor their investments and levels of exposure. The business plan submitted must be detailed, capturing key areas to enable the DFS to carry out consumer protection analysis, corporate governance, and oversight, as well as risk analysis.</p>



<p>The hallmark of this new move, according to the NYDFS, is to protect consumers&#8217; “hard-earned money” in the wake of the FTX collapse. </p>



<p>“<em>It is critical that regulators communicate in a timely, transparent manner about the evolution of our regulatory approach</em>,” NYDFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris highlighted in a statement issued by the department.</p>



<p>The NYDFS, in a statement, said that the regulation is final as it deals with essential issues in protecting users but promised to continue engaging with stakeholders in the industry to make better laws.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-regulations-to-follow"><strong>More regulations to follow</strong></h2>



<p>As New York releases a new guideline for banks, several jurisdictions within and outside the United States are pushing for broader and more robust cryptocurrency regulations to prevent a repeat of FTX. At the FTX hearing yesterday, Kevin O’Leary, executive producer of Shark Tank, and Sen. Cynthia Lummis stressed the need for more <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">regulation</a> to “<em>save the industry.”</em></p>



<p>The Deputy Secretary US Treasury, Wally Adeyemo, has called for more international cooperation to regulate the industry, which will promote stability and prevent the illegal use of digital assets.</p>



<p>Across industry spaces, users&#8217; and investors’ confidence went a step back following the FTX issue, leading to widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). As new and tighter regulations begin to take effect, it creates a ripple effect of increasing investor confidence and pushing back FUDs in users in the long run.</p>

<p>The NFT community, alongside the broader cryptocurrency market, has expressed shock over the recent announcement from former U.S. President <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cryptocurrency-explosion-is-coming-former-u-s-president-donald-trump-warns/">Donald Trump</a>. In what most have termed one of the most unexpected “announcements”  in the NFT ecosystem this year, Trump has put up some Superman-based NFT trading cards for sale.</p>



<h2 id="h-doland-trump-receives-feedback-from-concerned-supporters"><strong>Doland Trump receives feedback from concerned supporters</strong></h2>



<p>The announcement was made on his own social media platform called “Truth Social.” It has since been received positively on the platform, with over 1,000 post shares and over 3,000 comments. The card shows Trump dressed in the famous Superman full-body suit, while a rage with the letter “T” is labelled on the suit.</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT! My official Donald Trump Digital Trading Card collection is here,” he said on the platform. </p>



<p>He then revealed some details about the cards, noting that they were limited while adding that they are significant for their connection to his personal life and career.</p>



<p>As excerpts of the statement read;</p>



<p><em>“These limited edition cards feature amazing ART of my Life &amp; Career! Collect all your favorite Trump Digital Trading Cards, very much like a baseball card, but hopefully much more exciting.”</em></p>



<p>NFT collectors and onlookers alike have voiced concerns about the price, which they consider extremely low, especially coming from the former President. However, Trump assured that they would be acquired and sold out in no time.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;GET YOUR CARDS NOW! Only $99 each! Would make a great Christmas gift. Don&#8217;t Wait. They will be gone, I believe, very quickly!” He urged.</em></p>



<p>While the NFT community awaits the sale turnout, Twitter users in the NFT community have expressed dissatisfaction with the move. Their collective sentiments highlight shock, mirroring their disapproval of the cards,  which they believe isn’t worth it.</p>



<p>One critique is quoted saying; “Trump is releasing NFT trading cards of himself… it really is the end of the road,&#8221;</p>



<h2><strong>NFT market hurdles persist</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, the NFT market is still bearish, as the decline in NFT sales persists.</p>



<p>The NFT market has gone from $1.02 trillion to $970.03 billion from January to September 2022. In November alone, NFT sales volume declined by 20%. </p>



<p>Popular entrepreneur Gary Vee attempted to grace the root cause of the problem by citing greed, oversupply and mediocre project launch as some of the factors propelling the industry’s downfall.</p>

<p>Crypto exchange KuCoin is operating in the Netherlands without the appropriate license, according to the De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) — the Dutch central bank.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-kucoin-is-illegally-operating-in-the-netherlands-authorities">&#8216;<strong>KuCoin Is Illegally Operating In the Netherlands&#8217;: Authorities</strong></h2>



<p>De Nederlandsche Bank has issued a warning to the KuCoin exchange for offering crypto services to local residents.</p>



<p>In a December 15 statement, the central bank said that MEK Global Limited (MGL), registered in Seychelles and does business in the Netherlands as KuCoin, was not compliant with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act. According to De Nederlandsche Bank, KuCoin is illegally offering crypto services as well as custodian wallets without the required legal registration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">DNB warns against MEK Global Limited, doing business as KuCoin<a href="https://t.co/kgh6XVkYbI">https://t.co/kgh6XVkYbI</a></p>&mdash; De Nederlandsche Bank (@DNB_NL) <a href="https://twitter.com/DNB_NL/status/1603360786755325952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>MGL Customers are not in breach of the legislation, the bank noted. “However, this may increase the risk of customers becoming involved in money laundering or terrorist financing.”</p>



<p>As one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world by trading volume, KuCoin has often been the centre of several regulatory duals around the world amid the crypto market turmoil and the implosion of the FTX exchange.</p>



<p>KuCoin chief executive officer, Johnny Lyu, <a href="https://twitter.com/lyu_johnny/status/1543062668051120128">dismissed </a>rumours of the exchange being insolvent in July. He added that the exchange had no plans to halt withdrawals and that KuCoin was operating well.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance was slapped with similar allegations in 2021, as Dutch regulators stated that the firm was operating illegally. Binance ultimately <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dutch-central-bank-nukes-crypto-exchange-binance-with-3-4-million-fine/">paid an administrative fine of $3.4 million</a> for offering services to Dutch citizens without being registered in the Netherlands.</p>



<p>Like KuCoin and Binance, Coinbase grabbed headlines in the Netherlands in 2022. But unlike the other two exchanges, the American publicly-traded firm was in the limelight for becoming the first-ever major crypto exchange to win regulatory approval from the Dutch Central bank.</p>

<p>Leading Ethereum software company Consensys has partnered with PayPal to enable US customers to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-whales-ignore-market-tsunami-splashing-nearly-a-billion-dollars-on-fresh-eth-buys/">purchase Ethereum</a>. According to a Wednesday announcement, <em>“PayPal will seamlessly integrate within the MetaMask wallet, providing customers with a simple and convenient way to buy Ethereum with PayPal.”</em></p>



<p>However, the functionality will only be available to eligible PayPal application users in the U.S. Following the integration, Metamask becomes the first Web3 wallet to leverage PayPal to drive on-ramp transactions. Commenting on the newly achieved milestone, Lorenzo Santos, Product Manager for MetaMask, said, “<em>This integration with PayPal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through MetaMask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem.”</em> </p>



<p>The MetaMask and PayPal integration comes even as the two firms <a href="https://zycrypto.com/russian-banking-giant-sber-adds-ethereum-and-metamask-support/">double down</a> on their push for more diversified crypto payment options. Launched in 2016, MetaMask is the world’s leading non-custodial crypto wallet and boasts more than 30 million monthly active users, according to a recent report. Apart from being a mobile app, the wallet has a browser extension that acts as a cryptocurrency wallet for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and any Ethereum-compatible networks.</p>



<p>Metamask offers a bushel of functionalities, including enabling users to interact with NFT marketplaces, play and earn games, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and metaverse worlds.</p>



<p>Notably, due to the spike in demand for digital assets by institutions, MetaMask has increasingly focused on meeting the needs of that particular group through its MetaMask Institutional (MMI) service. In the past year or so, MetaMask has onboarded more than five institutional custodians to enhance choice, security, and operational efficiency for crypto funds, market-makers, trading desks, DAOs and other organizations seeking exposure to the digital asset class.</p>



<p>PayPal officially <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-finally-enables-bitcoin-transfers-to-third-party-crypto-wallets-and-exchanges/">unveiled crypto services</a> in the US on June 7 2022, allowing customers the flexibility to move Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin between Paypal and other wallets or exchanges. According to the most recent report by the company, there are about 429 million active PayPal users worldwide, with 75% of Americans using the service. Recently, the payments company expanded its crypto services to Luxembourg, signalling its intention to expand to the entire European union while complying with existing and pending regulations.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC, ETH, and SOL shed value on Wednesday following the central bank’s decision to increase interest rates again.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Digital assets were not alone as the stock market also dipped following the news, further signifying trading correlation. </li>



<li>A cross-section of digital asset enthusiasts expressed worry that their favourite assets may have blown their last opportunity for an uptick before the end of the year.</li>
</ul>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin (BTC) traded above $18,000 for the first time since the FTX crash, to the delight of users, but the joy was short-lived in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-76473" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-3-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/news/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Major digital currencies tumbled following the news of an increased interest rate approved by the Federal Reserve, wiping off little gains made in the past few days. BTC was already flying above $18k, trading at $18,310, lost 4.77% a few hours after the announcement and is currently exchanging hands at $17,404.</p>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) and Dogecoin (DOGE) followed the trend losing about 5.5% and 6.38%, respectively. This year has not been great for ETH as it keeps struggling despite all the prospects it held at the start of the year. The altcoin giant is valued at $1,270 just a few weeks before the year&#8217;s end, which has seen it lose over 50% of its value.</p>



<p>For the greater part of the year, the stock market and the cryptocurrency market have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-cuts-link-with-the-stock-market-thanks-to-a-spike-in-the-number-of-long-term-hodlers/">traded</a> similarly under the influence of wider macroeconomic trends. Yesterday was no different, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 103 points following the news while the S&amp;P 500 fell by 0.5%.</p>



<p>With these frequent rises in interest rates, investors keep moving away from high-risk assets making the market take a bearish trend.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-users-cannot-see-the-light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel"><strong>Users cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel</strong></h2>



<p>The Federal Reserve has used hikes in interest rates to counter inflationary trends in the market in recent months across various regions. Though the recent increase was by 0.5 points, the bank has signalled more increases in the coming months to push back inflation.</p>



<p>Most digital asset enthusiasts have described this year as unfortunate for the market due to major <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-token-crashes-85-in-minutes-ftt-becoming-the-next-luna/">incidents</a> that have hit the industry, wiping billions from the market cap. The larger crypto market cap is now a shadow of its former self as it struggles below $1 trillion. Even with the present negative trends, some users have expressed hopes for a better 2023.</p>

<ul>
<li>Kevin O’Leary has roped Binance into the infamous FTX scandal, claiming that the exchange deliberately caused the collapse. </li>



<li>He also called for increased regulation in the industry, hinting that, at the end of the day, only proper laws will save the market. </li>



<li>Fear and doubts from investors still loom over the market as the FTX hearing proceeds.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, Alameda Capital, and now Binance, the blame game, continue for FTX&#8217;s woes which put the market multiple steps backwards.</p>



<p>Canadian businessman and co-executive producer of the reality show Shark Tank, Kevin O’Leary, has blamed Binance for the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftx-token-crashes-85-in-minutes-ftt-becoming-the-next-luna/">collapse</a> of fellow exchange FTX despite its effort to save FTX at the early stages of the saga.</p>



<p>Speaking at the US Senate in the FTX hearing titled “Why the FTX Bubble Burst and the Harm to Consumers,” O’Leary used strong words to describe Binance&#8217;s involvement in the FTX debacle. He claimed that Binance caused it on purpose and is now a “<em>massive, unregulated monopoly now.</em>”</p>



<p>Explaining his views, he stated that the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-to-liquidate-ftxs-ftt-holdings-due-to-recent-revelations/">disclosed</a> that he would begin to sell FTX native tokens on Binance, a move that led to the bankruptcy filing a few days later.</p>



<p>O’Leary called for more regulations around the industry to avoid a repeat of the ugly incident and to gain investor confidence. According to him, LedgerX, an FTX-owned derivatives trading platform, was the only “<em>entity that didn’t go to zero” </em>due to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission’s regulation.</p>



<p>Senator Cynthia Lummis toed the path of O’Leary during the session pushing for more regulations in the market.</p>



<p><em>“It is time to separate digital assets from corrupt organizations. FTX is good old-fashioned fraud. Mismanagement, failure of people, and inadequate controls are what’s on trial. We need to regulate this business and lay digital assets on top of our existing financial framework.”</em></p>



<h2 id="h-binance-new-monopoly"><strong>Binance new monopoly </strong></h2>



<p>Following the collapse of FTX, a major competition of Binance, it is now perceived as having an unhealthy monopoly in the market. However, Binance has been the leading crypto exchange for many years. O’Leary is not alone in this, as many users feel Binance is now heading to a point where it cannot be matched by its competition and can dictate what happens in the industry.</p>



<p>A Binance monopoly is considered by analysts as unhealthy for the industry, just as O’Leary pointed out, as it could lead to centralization. Last week, users withdrew over $8 billion from Binance though the CEO described it as “business as usual.” Binance currently dominates the market with a 24-hour trading volume of over $12 billion.</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA) is trading at $0.3122, representing a change of -0.47% in the past day and -0.57% in the past week, per the latest data from CoinMarketCap. The smart contract token has oscillated between $0.30 and $0.32 since November 20.</p>



<p>As ADA trades sideways, its co-founder Charles Hoskinson <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hopes-high-as-charles-hoskinson-speaks-on-solana-becoming-a-sidechain-to-cardano/">suggests having Solana</a> as a sidechain (a separate blockchain connected to the main blockchain) for Cardano. Hoskinson floated the idea during an ‘Ask Me Anything&#8217; session on December 12.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>So you could take Solana to replace (its) current consensus algorithm with something 25 times faster and does not collapse all the time, make it a Cardano sidechain,</em>&#8221; the 35-year-old developer who is also behind Ethereum said. &#8220;<em>Solana would then be paid to ADA holders to maintain it, and they don’t have to worry about security anymore … and then all those dApps move over, and they get better reliability and security, and they get faster.</em>&#8220;</p>



<h2 id="h-hoskinson-envisions-multiple-major-blockchains-connected-to-cardano"><strong>Hoskinson envisions multiple major blockchains connected to Cardano</strong></h2>



<p>In the more than 2 hours AMA video, Hoskinson said that his blockchain has been exploring the possibility of accommodating sidechains for over six years–where Cardano becomes the main chain and other networks can plug in. According to the entrepreneur, the arrangement will let the partner sidechains pay block rewards to stake pool operators and the ADA token holders, as Cardano takes care of the security elements of the whole ecosystem.</p>



<p>Hoskinson has been pushing his ambitious plan for a while now. After Elon Musk acquired Twitter towards the end of October, he floated the idea of having Dogecoin <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doges-chances-of-being-merged-with-twitter-soar-as-hoskinson-proposes-making-dogecoin-a-cardano-sidechain/">as a sidechain</a> to Cardano. In a tweet dated October 28, the American blockchain developer said: &#8220;<em>Now that Twitter is in the hands of (Elon Musk,) I can see a real possibility that DOGE will somehow merge with (Cardano). He added that he would &#8220;do the migration free… and even add smart contracts.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Bitcoin and altcoins (non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies) are recovering – after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics showed better-than-expected inflation data. BLS published a Consumer Price Index report showing the inflation rate for November at 7.1%, compared to an expected rate of 7.3%. As a result, Bitcoin surged past $18,000 – the highest level in more than a month – as major altcoins, including ETH, XRP, DOGE, and LTC, registered positive gains.</p>

<p>Goldman Sachs plans to splash “tens of millions of dollars” on investments or buyouts in crypto firms after the FTX collapse hit last month and suppressed investor interest.</p>



<p>The FTX collapse and subsequent contagion across major lending firms had elicited calls for more regulatory oversight on players, assuring big banks of the sector&#8217;s stability. In an interview with Reuters, Mathew McDermott, Goldman&#8217;s head of digital assets, revealed that the bank was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/goldman-sachs-reportedly-keen-to-raise-2-billion-to-purchase-celsius-assets/">conducting due diligence</a> on several crypto firms noting that they saw an opportunity for businesses in the crypto sector to pick up.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We do see some really interesting opportunities, priced much more sensibly,&#8221;</em> McDermott said without giving details. According to the banker, despite the FTX debacle setting the crypto market back by far, they were focused on leveraging the sector’s underlying technology, which they project will explode in growth in a few years.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely set the market back in terms of sentiment.&nbsp;There&#8217;s absolutely no doubt of that. FTX was a poster child in many parts of the ecosystem. But to reiterate, the underlying technology continues to perform,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>While this is not the first time that the $129.48B bank is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/goldman-sachs-exploring-direct-crypto-offerings-to-clients/">showing interest</a> in investing in the crypto sector, its particular timing of the bear market surprised many players who have expressed little to no plans on increasing their exposure to crypto-related investments.</p>



<p>Notably, according to McDermont, FTX’s collapse had been a blessing in disguise for the bank since its trading volumes had shot up as investors who sought to trade with regulated and well-capitalised counterparties were onboarded.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>What&#8217;s increased is the number of financial institutions wanting to trade with us. I suspect a number of them traded with FTX, but I can&#8217;t say that with cast iron certainty,</em>” he went on.</p>



<p>In a November 10 interview, David Solomon, the bank&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, said that although he viewed cryptocurrencies as “highly speculative”, he saw a lot of potential in the underlying technology as its infrastructure becomes more formalised.</p>



<p>So far, Goldman has a stake in 11 digital asset companies which provide services such as compliance, cryptocurrency data and blockchain management. On November 3, the bank partnered with MSCI and Coin Metrics to launch Datonomy, a new classification system for the digital assets market.</p>



<p>According to McDermott, the bank has also been building its own private distributed ledger technology as it seeks to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain to offer improved speed and transparency.</p>

<p>According to a new report, despite the FTX implosion sinking over $2 billion of investors’ money in the past month, close to double that amount was lost to scams and rug-pulls in 2022.</p>



<p>Published by cybersecurity and data privacy firm Privacy Affairs, the report revealed that the five biggest crypto losses, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-doj-seizes-7-seven-domain-names-used-in-pig-butchering-crypto-schemes/">scams</a> and hacks of 2022, ranked by the amount of money lost or stolen ($100 million and above), accounted for nearly $3.5 billion.</p>



<p>As of November 2022, the collapse of FTX had become the biggest case of money lost, with between $1 to $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency evaporating, while Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network was second in place with $615 million, followed by the Wormhole crypto bridge scam with $320 million.</p>



<p>Hackers stole $1.9 billion in cryptocurrency between January and July, 2022-which is a 37% increase in the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftc-report-says-victims-of-crypto-scams-have-lost-over-1-billion-since-2021/">same period last year</a>. Accordingly, the report noted that 97% of all stolen cryptocurrency came from DeFi protocols in Q1 2022. Bitcoin, Tether and Ether emerged as the most preferred cryptocurrencies by scammers to set up their cons, with social media platforms led by Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Telegram being the most used playgrounds for crypto scams.</p>



<p>Notably, the firm cautioned over a spike in cryptocurrency flash loan scams. Flash loans allow users to borrow large amounts of virtual funds for a short period without collateral. Attackers who secure the loans and have extensive voting rights can execute a malicious vote for a malicious proposal allowing themselves to send funds to a wallet they control.</p>



<p>According to the firm, 27 flash loan attacks resulted in a loss of over $308 million in Q2 2022, marking a 66.7% increase in losses resulting from the vice from Q1 2022. Notable firms that have fallen victim to this scam include Decentralized Finance (DeFi) project Beanstalk, which lost $182M in April and the crypto trading platform Mango Market which was siphoned of $100 million in October.</p>



<p>The firm also noted that more than 188,000 rug pulls were executed on various blockchains this year, representing a 20% jump from 2021. Last year, $2.8 billion was lost to rug pulls, with more than $2.5 billion being lost to the Turkey-based Thodex crypto exchange alone.</p>



<p>According to Privacy Affairs CEO and Founder Miklos Zoltap, people in the 20-40 age group were the most susceptible to crypto scams. <em>&#8220;What our research shows is that cryptocurrency scams and related fraudulent activities are not plummeting anytime soon,&#8221;</em> he said.</p>



<p>That said, crypto-related scams are showing zero signs of abating; the executive advised people to protect themselves by, “<em>using established cryptos and tokens, avoiding cryptocurrency projects that guarantee significant returns, and never get crypto investment advice from dating sites and influencers.”</em></p>

<p>Binance has recorded massive withdrawals in the last seven days sparking concerns over the future of the exchange.</p>



<ul>
<li>The exchange saw $8.6 billion leave its platform and only a $5.1 billion inflow leading to a $3.6 billion deficit.</li>



<li>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has played off fears describing it as a “business as usual” with some bad days and good days.</li>
</ul>



<p>Sequel to the collapse of FTX, panic has ravaged the industry, with investors more sceptical than ever about centralized exchanges and service providers.</p>



<p>Although Binance has enjoyed the trust of millions of users since its launch, a lot may be changing in recent weeks. Binance has recorded huge withdrawals, most of which have come in the past seven days totalling up to $8.6 billion.</p>



<p>According to blockchain data analytics firm Nansen, the firm <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1602677725218492416?s=21&amp;t=kcM-Q5UmZY79Bef63vftCw">recorded</a> the highest amount of daily withdrawals since June on Tuesday, pushing up the weekly figure to $8.6 billion. Amidst increasing withdrawals, the exchange had an inflow of $5.1 billion, leaving it with a net outflow of $3.6 billion.</p>



<p>Binance withdrawal figures topped other centralized exchanges (CEXs), including Coinbase and Binance US, which both had net outflows of about $800 million and $38.7 million respectively. Crypto firms like JumpCrypto among others lead the pack in making the highest withdrawals on Binance. In two weeks, the firm has taken off $141 million from Binance’s balance sheet. </p>



<p>Despite this ugly trend, Zhao has played down the fears of users <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1602676998094069760?s=21&amp;t=b0eRGCSIaV12uKaEPdCldQ">describing</a> the incident as “<em>business as usual.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“We saw some withdrawals today. I actually think it is a good idea to ‘stress test withdrawals’ on each CEX on a rotating basis.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>In the midst of record withdrawals, Binance still holds assets worth over $58 billion, signalling a strong financial base for the exchange. </p>



<h2 id="h-more-fear-mounts-as-usdc-withdrawal-halted"><strong>More fear mounts as USDC withdrawal halted</strong></h2>



<p>On Tuesday, Binance temporarily halted withdrawals of USD Coin (USDC), with Zhao citing “token swap issues.” Recall that Binance announced a token swap policy in September, which will see USDC and two other stablecoins converted to BUSD.</p>



<p>The initial halt raised a lot of eyebrows and tension, with the CEO explaining that they received an increase in USDC withdrawals and the banks were not open for two hours of the halt because swapping tokens requires traditional fiat at the bank.</p>



<p>Withdrawals of USDC have resumed on the exchange, with the company giving an assurance that funds are backed 1:1.</p>

<ul>
<li>The deep-pocketed investors are transferring funds outside Binance.</li>



<li>Binance is under investigation by US regulators for money laundering claims.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-whales-on-a-gigantic-accumulation-spree-as-ripple-mulls-ipo-after-sec-lawsuit-ends/">XRP whales</a> holding between 100,000 and 10 million tokens increased their off holdings by 1.5% to 18.29% as of December 11 – per data provided by analytics firm Santiment. The buying activities were further accelerated by plans by the US lawmakers to prosecute Binance&#8217;s CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and &#8216;red flags&#8217; in the firm&#8217;s proof of reserves.</p>



<p>The largest exchange by trading volumes is reportedly under probe by the US Department of Justice and the Internal Revenue Service for alleged money laundering and violation of criminal sanctions. Despite division on the side of the prosecutors – with some claiming that they have enough evidence against CZ&#8217;s exchange while others believe otherwise – Binance is recording increased outflows.</p>



<p>At the start of the week, the exchange recorded a net outflow of $902 million, according to data from Nansen. Among the investors moving XRP are whales, as reported by WhaleAlert. The tracker tweeted on December 13 that 300,000,000 XRP worth $115 million were sent from Binance to an unknown destination.</p>



<h2 id="h-xrp-outflows-from-binance-are-linked-to-the-exchange-s-opaque-proof-of-reserves"><strong>XRP outflows from Binance are linked to the exchange&#8217;s opaque proof of reserves</strong></h2>



<p>Hours apart, another 37,371,039 XRP worth $14 million moved from Binance to an unverified destination. Part of Binance&#8217;s outflows – which now amount to more than $1 billion – could partly be tied to the irregularities on the exchange&#8217;s recently declared proof of reserves by Mazars.</p>



<p>The audit firm&#8217;s letter read: &#8220;<em>we found that Binance was 97% collateralized without taking into account the Out-Of-Scope assets pledged by customers as collateral for In-Scope-Assets lent through the margin and loans service offering resulting in negative balances on the customer liability report. With the inclusion of In-Scope Assets lent to customers through margin and loans overcollateralized by Out-Of-Scope Assets, we found that Binance was 101% collateralized.</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Based on the report, industry experts are questioning why the exchange did not fully disclose its internal controls and their effectiveness. The former chief of the Securities Exchange Commission&#8217;s Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark, said: <em>&#8220;Binance&#8217;s proof of reserve report does not address the effectiveness of internal financial controls, does not express an opinion or assurance conclusion and does not vouch for the numbers.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Mazars’ report – released on December 7 – showed that Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin reserves manage more than 575,742.42, worth $9.7 billion at the current price. The company has also advocated for the Merkle tree proof of reserves, letting users verify their assets – something experts term inadequate because it fails to include liabilities.</p>

<ul>
<li>Former BitMEX CEO thinks that Bitcoin’s prices cannot go any lower after a series of implosions sent prices tumbling.</li>



<li>He notes that “irresponsible entities” have run out of Bitcoin to sell, and the only way for the asset is up.</li>



<li>Bitcoin stands on a delicate precipice ahead of the release of new inflation data.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has suffered from a string of negative reports involving some of the largest entities in the digital asset industry. However, BitMEX founder believes the asset has survived its darkest days and can expect a rally in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>Arthur Hayes, ex-CEO of digital asset derivatives platform BitMEX, thinks BTC is set for a rally since the “largest most irresponsible entities” have sold the last of their Bitcoins. Hayes argues that all the firms prone to going bankrupt have all gone bankrupt, leaving the coast clear for the bulls.</p>



<p><em>“I can’t demonstratively prove that all Bitcoin held by these failed institutions was sold during the multiple crashes, but it does look as if they tried their best to liquidate the most liquid crypto collateral they could right before they went under,”</em> said Hayes.</p>



<p>The former CEO backs his theory by saying that firms facing a liquidity crisis have no reason to hold onto their BTC when they urgently need fiat. Hayes notes that the typical playbook for distressed firms is to call in loans and then sell their BTC holdings to avoid going under.</p>



<p>In the weeks after FTX’s collapse, BTC fell to $15,599 as entities affected by the black swan event unloaded their BTC holdings. In the last few months, several top players in the industry have filed for bankruptcy, including FTX, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/blockfi-has-10-billion-in-assets-and-liabilities-and-100000-creditors-bankruptcy-filing/">BlockFi</a>, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), and Celsius.</p>



<h2 id="h-btc-has-an-eventful-week-ahead"><strong>BTC has an eventful week ahead</strong></h2>



<p>Some analysts have termed this week the most important for BTC, with several key events on the horizon. First on the list is the release of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-despite-us-cpi-data-spooking-investors-is-a-crash-to-12000-in-the-offing/">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) for November and the decision of the Federal Reserve regarding rate hikes.</p>



<p>Analysts believe that with two weeks till the end of the year, Bitcoin could go on a historical “Santa Rally”. Other factors that could decide BTC’s path are the U.S. dollar index (DXY) movement, Bitcoin’s supply shock ratio nearing a 10-year high, and the end of miners selling their assets.</p>



<p><em>“The mother of all decisions is coming, expect huge volatility next week,” </em>said one financial analyst. <em>“The incoming DXY move will decide the fate of the crypto and stock market.”</em></p>
