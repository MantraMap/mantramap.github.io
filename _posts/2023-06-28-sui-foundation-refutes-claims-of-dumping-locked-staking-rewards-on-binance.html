The team behind the Sui network and its native SUI token has taken to Twitter to deny allegations of selling locked staking rewards on Binance. Word on the street is that the team moved a huge amount of locked staking rewards and dumped them on Binance to cash in. Sui Foundation Denies Selling Locked Staking Rewards Pump and dump schemes have become very common in the crypto world. According to a report by Chainalysis, 24% of tokens launched in 2022 that were analyzed saw a price decline in the first week indicative of possible pump-and-dump activity.  Related Reading: FTX Puts Sale Of $500 Million Stake In AI Firm Anthropic On Hold According to the foundation, the Sui Foundation has not sold staking rewards or any other tokens from locked and non-circulating staked SUI on Binance or any other exchange. &#8220;All insider token allocations remain subject to and compliant with their lock-ups and other restrictions on transfer,&#8221; said the statement. The Origin Of The Claims A rumor started circulating on Twitter on Thursday that the Sui Foundation was unlocking and dumping locked staking rewards on Binance. According to a Twitter thread by @DefiSquared, a popular crypto trader and commentator, &#8220;locked&#8221; and &#8220;non-circulating&#8221; staked SUI were manipulated by the foundation. The party behind the account claims that the SUI foundation has nearly 3 billion non-circulating and locked SUI staked, which is six times more than the entire circulating supply. DefiSquared also goes on to provide on-chain data showing how millions of SUI rewards were transferred. These tokens were split many times, with most of them ending on Binance. An example was a transfer of 2,500,000 SUI rewards from 0x341f to 0x209f on May 31st. However, The Sui Foundation has since referred to the transaction as a payment subject to a contractual lockup.
