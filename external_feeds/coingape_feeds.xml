The coin price currently trades at the $0.000165 mark, and a daily candle close below the mentioned support will accelerate the current selling pressure. This development encourages further downfall in Terra coin price</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A descending trendline governs the ongoing downfall in Terra classic coin price</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish divergence in the RSI indicator, which reflects the speed and magnitude of the coin’s recent price, indicates a higher chance for buyers to break the overhead trendline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the LUNC coin is $89.5 Million, indicating an 11.2% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/8/8eePKu22.png" alt="LUNC price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a descending trendline, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/will-lunc-price-recovery-continue-for-the-coming-week/">LUNC price action</a> has shown a steady downfall over the two months. The altcoin has thrice turned down from this resistance, indicating the traders are actively selling on rallies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, the LUNC price recently reverted from the overhead trendline. As a result, the prices tumbled 8% and currently exchange hand at the $0.000165 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If market sentiment remains bearish, the coin price could plunge another 10% to revisit the last swing low support of $0.00015-$0.000147. Losing the mentioned support would intensify the selling momentum and plummet the price to the $0.0001 psychological mark.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the LUNC price may prolong its losses until it remains below the resistance trendline.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a possible breakout from this trendline will offer early signs for price recovery. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> In contrary to the sideways price action,  the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> showed evident growth, indicating the buying activity is rising at the lower level. This bullish divergence also increases the change of LUNC price to break the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> with the recent bearish reversal, the coin price has nosedive below the 20-day EMA slope offering an extra edge for market sellers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">LUNC</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.000165</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.000167  and $0.000187</span></li>

The core factor leading to this is the declining hashrate and mining difficulty, coupled with the dwindling mining operations &amp; their poor state of affairs in the current bear market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Mining Difficulty</h2>
<p>The mining difficulty of Bitcoin experienced a significant drop on December 6th and it was an extremely unusual occurrence as the last time it took place was in July of 2021. According to the data on the BTC.com mining pool, the level of difficulty decreased by 7.32 % at a block height of 766,080.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/category/bitcoin-mining/">Bitcoin miners</a> seem to be turning down their mining machines as a result of the ongoing bearish market sentiment that has affected the whole cryptocurrency market. This is the lowest level seen since a 28% decline in July of last year, when China banned the mining of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Moreover, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/hash-rate" rel="nofollow">on-chain</a> data shows that the Bitcoin hashrate (MA30) has also recently started to subside, along with the difficulty level.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-130279" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/07195208/1kVNyyrth_9cf52c53c51b4995bed2ba89bc27c8f82c12659e2054765401b38831d2aa6948.png" alt="" width="1280" height="683" /></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Industry Stutters</h2>
<p>The ripple effect can be seen in mining companies as well, with a few inching towards shutting down or declaring bankruptcy.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/core-scientific/">Core Scientific Inc.</a>, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining business in the U.S., reported a $1.7 billion loss for the first nine months of the year. The firm further issued a warning in October that it might have to <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/">declare bankruptcy</a> if it can’t obtain more capital to pay off its debt, which totals more than $1 billion. It suffered a $434 million loss in the third quarter.</p>

<p>The value of the company’s stock has decreased by approximately 99% this year, to just 16 cents ($0.16). Another mining company &#8212; Stronghold Digital Mining (SDGI) has fallen over -25.4% on news of the NASDAQ delisting crisis.</p>
<p>Crypto analysts and experts anticipate a domino effect once one of the top mining units suspends operations and files for bankruptcy proceedings.</p>

<p>Combined with declining hashrate, mining difficulty and companies struggling to sustain, crypto analysts expect the Bitcoin (BTC) price to further dip in the near short term.</p>

<p>A nonfungible token (NFT) is a digital file that has been tokenized on the blockchain. To tokenize something means to circulate it by converting it into a digital token that can be used on blockchain applications like NFT marketplaces or blockchain games.</p>
<p>Each NFT has a distinct identifier, a history, and a monetary value. The factors that determine the value of an NFT are typically rarity, utility, and consumer interest. Art, trading cards, and blockchain game items are the most popular NFTs.</p>
<p>NFTs are interesting, but their values are volatile. Similar to collecting tangible art, determining the exact value of any NFT is difficult.</p>
<h2>What is Crypto?</h2>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Cryptocurrency</a>, also known as crypto, is a type of digital currency. In cryptocurrency the transactions are recorded on blockchain. In terms of popularity <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is known to be the most popular cryptocurrency, Irrespective of Bitcoin other cryptocurrency are fall in the category of altcoins. As of november total number of cryptocurrency is 21,684.</p>
<p>In terms of advantage as compared to fiat currency cryptocurrency is known for fast money transfers. Since cryptocurrency functions on decentralized system it is pretty tough to hack. However, crypto has volatility. Any coin, at any given time, could increase or decrease in value — largely impacted by consumer interest — so there’s no guarantee that you’ll earn money if you invest in crypto.</p>
<h3 id="nfts-vs-crypto-the-differences">Difference between NFTs and Crypto</h3>
<p>The main distinction is that NFTs are all unique with varying values, whereas crypto coins are fungible, or mutually interchangeable. Another distinction is how crypto coins are distributed. NFTs are &#8220;minted,&#8221; whereas coins are &#8220;mined.&#8221; In a nutshell, a miner is a computer that performs an accounting function on the blockchain and is compensated in new coins. Minting an NFT entails converting a file into a token that can be used on a blockchain. The blockchain verifies the transaction and assesses a fee.</p>
<h3 id="nfts-vs-crypto-the-similarities">How much similar NFTs and Crypto are ?</h3>
<p>Tokens and coins are both digital assets that can be purchased and sold, and they both exist on blockchains. The blockchain records all transactions involving a token or coin, making it simple to verify the authenticity of an NFT or coin.</p>
<h3 id="nfts-vs-crypto-where-to-buy">NFTs vs. crypto: Where to buy?</h3>
<p>Users can buy and sell NFTs on blockchain-based marketplaces. The majority of NFT marketplaces are built on the Ethereum blockchain, with some built on EOS, Solana, GateChain, or other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchains</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that because so many NFT marketplaces are built on Ethereum, you&#8217;ll almost certainly need Ethereum&#8217;s native asset, Ether (ETH), to purchase an NFT. Furthermore, many NFTs are ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency can be purchased through brokers or crypto exchanges. At the time of writing, there are over 300 crypto exchanges in the United States, but be aware of state regulations that apply depending on where you live. Before you buy cryptocurrency, make sure the exchange you choose is legal in your state.</p>

<h2> What does Binance PoR Report say?</h2>
<p>In a Tweet, Binance mentioned that as part of its user fund transparency work and Proof of Reserve, they are working with the Mazars, a global financial audit firm. It mentioned that BTC proof of Reserves is out now. However, it added that the reports for other tokens will be out soon.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://veritas.mazars.com/binance/Binance_POR_Report_7_December_2022.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report stated</a> that Binance underwent a Proof of Reserves and Proof of Liabilities verification on November 22, 2022.

<p>Binance&#8217;s Bitcoin net customer balance stands at 575742.4228.</p>
<h2>Duplication of ID&#8217;s?</h2>
<p>The auditing firm stated that it compared the total mentioned balance of each blockchain in scope asset. However, they were unable to find any variances greater than 1%.</p>
<p>The firm inspected the Customer Liabilit Report for any duplications of user ID’s. They found that the user ID’d were hashed and truncated to 16 bytes. However, no duplication of user Id’s were found.</p>

<p style="color: #252525">In the world of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">DeFi</a>, users are increasingly engaging with autonomous markets powered by blockchain technology, i.e.,<a href="https://coingape.com/tag/decentralized-exchange/"> decentralised exchanges (DEX)</a>.<br style="color: #252525" /> <br style="color: #252525" />In contrast to centralised cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase, which are run by a single corporate company, decentralised exchanges (DEXs) enable trading without an intermediary.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">While Ethereum is the main choice for developing DeFi protocols, a Binance-backed protocol called PancakeSwap has emerged as a competitor.</p>
<h3 style="color: #252525"><strong>What is PancakeSwap?</strong></h3>
<p style="color: #252525"><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://pancakeswap.finance/" rel="nofollow">PancakeSwap</a> is a decentralised exchange (DEX) that allows users to swap cryptocurrencies and tokens without the need for a centralised intermediary while maintaining custody of their tokens. It is based on automated smart contracts deployed on Binance Smart Chain (BNB), Binance&#8217;s blockchain platform.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">PancakeSwap is similar to UniSwap, a DEX based on the Ethereum blockchain. <strong>Since PancakeSwap is built on Binance Smart Chain rather than Ethereum, it has substantially lower trading fees.</strong></p>
<p style="color: #252525">PancakeSwap is used particularly for BEP-20 tokens operating on the Binance Smart Chain, while tokens from other platforms can be brought over via Binance Bridge and &#8220;wrapped&#8221; as BEP-20 tokens for use on the DEX.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">PancakeSwap was built by anonymous developers, and despite the fact that it runs on Binance&#8217;s blockchain platform, Binance does not control or operate PancakeSwap.</p>
<h3><strong>How Does PancakeSwap Works?</strong></h3>
<p style="color: #252525">It operates on the <strong>automated market maker (AMM) model, which relies on user-fueled liquidity pools</strong> rather than the traditional market model.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Users lock their tokens into a permissionless liquidity pool via smart contracts, rather than dealing with the traditional market model of an order book and finding someone else who wants to trade the tokens. This allows users to perform the desired swap while users who put their coins in the pool earn a share of the rewards generated by transactions.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Individuals who <strong>put money into these liquidity pools get an LP (liquidity provider) token in return</strong>. They also get paid to make their assets available for lending. People who want to access this liquidity pool, on the other hand, must pay a fee to the DeFi platform. This charge is then shared among those who contributed to the pool. A small portion of this amount is held in the PancakeSwap treasury to support the platform.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The more you put into pools, the more you get back. Profits can be made by trading LP tokens. Furthermore, they can be farmed in another form of liquidity pool to earn CAKE, PancakeSwap&#8217;s native BEP-20 token. Not only that, but another type of pool, known as SYRUP, is more rewarding than the others.</p>

Since Musk took over, the chances of Twitter crypto payments have only intensified. Meanwhile, the Dogecoin army continues to rally its support to the cryptocurrency amid volatile market environment. As with all cryptocurrencies, DOGE price also suffered significantly due to the recent FTX collapse.</p>

<h2>Demand For DOGE Emoji</h2>
<p>Owing to Elon Musk huge support for the DOGE community, the environment remains bullish for the long term. I this context, strong DOGE supporters are calling for adding an emoji next to #Dogecoin on Twitter. Currently, only Bitcoin enjoys the privilege of having an emoji next to its hashtag on the social media platform. With <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> at the helm of affairs at Twitter now, the Dogecoin emoji could very well be a possibility. Ever since the Tesla CEO took over the company, there were sea changes in terms of policy decisions and layoffs.</p>
<p>Doge Dillionaire, a crypto enthusiast, is repeatedly tweeting on the demand for the emoji. The latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/DogeDillionaire/status/1600396786505351168?s=20&amp;t=mUMhThc1ZlnGXGJZoPXwhw" rel="nofollow">tweet</a> read,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hey Elon Musk, could you please add an emoji to #Doge&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the memecoin suffered a sharp decline in price on Wednesday. As of writing, DOGE price stands at $0.09573, down 4.80% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<h2>The Payments Option</h2>
<p>Recently, the memecoin price spiked over speculation of Twitter launching its own &#8216;Twitter Coin&#8217;. Among Musk&#8217;s plans for the ongoing Twitter ramp is the proposal to have a monetization tool. The <a href="https://coingape.com/dogecoin-price-spike-over-twitter-coin-tip/">Twitter coin news</a> was centered around the social media platform having a section to add tips. However, the speculation was neither confirmed nor hinted by anyone from the company.</p>

The changes include regulations requiring miners to purchase only surplus electricity from the public grid, new tax rules governing crypto, and plans to ban cryptocurrency transactions advertising.</p>
<h2>Kazakhstan Shifts From Easing To Strict Crypto Regulations</h2>
<p>The Mäjilis, the lower house of Parliament of Kazakhstan, has <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1600452192846368768" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">approved</a> several cryptocurrency-related bills including the &#8220;On Digital Assets of the Republic of Kazakhstan&#8221; and four bills to regulate crypto mining in Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Miners can purchase electricity from the common power grid only in case of availability of surplus. Moreover, miners can exclusively buy through the Kazakhstan Electricity and Power Market Operator (KOREM) exchange in an auction for electricity in which a higher bidder wins.</p>
<p>Furthermore, mining licensing is proposed to be divided into two categories. Digital miners who own the infrastructure such as data processing centers with appropriate requirements for equipment, location, and security comes under the first category. The second category is digital miners who rent cells in data processing centers and do not claim an energy quota.</p>
<p>Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the Majilis&#8217; Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The bill, in addition to mandatory accreditation, introduces separate requirements for mining pools in terms of the location of their server capacities in Kazakhstan and compliance with information security rules.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, new crypto taxes have been introduced including miners&#8217; tax, mining pool commission, value-added tax, and tax on crypto exchanges as business entities.</p>
<p>Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva asserted that cryptocurrencies and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> activities are prohibited in Kazakhstan. Crypto activities are only part of an experimental legal regime under the jurisdiction of AIFC. Furthermore, a plan to introduce a ban on advertising crypto trading.</p>
<h2>Could This Impact the Crypto Adoption Plan of the President?</h2>
<p>Kazakhstan has introduced several crypto-progressive initiatives after President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev approved legalizing crypto trading and mining in the country. Kazakhstan <a href="https://coingape.com/kazakhstan-first-draft-law-on-crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented a draft law on crypto mining</a> in September to efficiently regulate crypto mining.</p>
<p>Binance gained a <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-license-kazakhstan-crypto-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent license from the AIFC Financial Services Authority</a> (AFSA) on October 6. In fact, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NKB) plans to integrate its <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">central bank digital currency</a> Digital Tenge with the BNB Chain.</p>

Much has been spoken about tech giants such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Google making investments in <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaverse</a>; in this article, we will discuss Roblox and Roblox Metaverse.</p>
<h2>What is Roblox?</h2>
<p>Roblox is an <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/crypto-metaverse-games/">online gaming platform</a> where millions of people come together each day to imagine, develop, and share experiences with each other in immersive, user-generated 3D worlds. The types of gameplay on Roblox are simply as endless as the creators&#8217; imagination.</p>
<p>Members of the Roblox community have created all the online games you see on the platform for members of the Roblox community. Players can create the ultimate theme park, contest as a professional race car driver, star in a fashion show, become a superhero, or design a dream home and hang out with mates. Roblox is free to download and free-to-play (F2P) on all modern smartphones, including tablets, computers, Xbox One, Oculus Rift, and HTC Vive. It is making a virtual economy that is powered by a community of creators and users.</p>
<p>Roblox has been one of the early players making a lot of efforts to create its strong identity in the Metaverse. The gaming platform, which boasts a huge user base, has witnessed exponential growth, mainly after the COVID pandemic. Created initially as a common gaming platform, Roblox has now shifted its focus to the Metaverse.</p>
<h2>What is Roblox Metaverse?</h2>
<p>The Roblox <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/">Metaverse</a> mainly focuses on creating an immersive virtual world in the current gaming platform and technology. At a time when companies working on the Metaverse are investing massively in technology such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), Roblox has chosen a different path. The gaming giant wants to use existing and proven technologies to create the best possible user experience.<br />
The Roblox metaverse is a growing phenomenon where real-life brands and trends lure more companies to work with the Roblox platform. Roblox seeps into mainstream culture and makes money by entering into partnerships with franchises like Stranger Things and big brands during events happening in their virtual worlds. For example, Nike teamed with Roblox last year to work on promotional and explorable events. The duo entered a partnership to create a virtual world known as Nikeland. Users can dress up their avatars by buying in-game items like Nike-branded sneakers and apparel. These can be bought only by using real-world currency. Meanwhile, Creators get their portion of the revenue depending on the performance of their game. Nikeland promotes the clothing brand on Roblox.</p>
<p>Recently, given the popularity of Roblox&#8217;s younger audience of gamers, big-box retailer Walmart used the gaming platform to foray into the virtual world. Walmart is looking to enter the Metaverse with two experiences: Walmart Land and Walmart&#8217;s Universe of Play.</p>
<p>Roblox makes most of its money from in-app purchases, advertisements, and promotional activities.</p>
<p>As Roblox&#8217;s user base has grown, more retailers and brands have swooped in. These include well-known designers like Ralph Lauren and leading teen-oriented brands such as PacSun. Sports footwear brand Vans has built a virtual skate park in Roblox.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Walmart filed for Metaverse-related trademarks. Some of the trademarks are related to asking for or selling virtual goods and offering users virtual currency and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs).</p>
<h3>How does Roblox Metaverse work?</h3>
<p>Like any other Metaverse, the Roblox Metaverse functions with the essential elements of a virtual world, such as items, currency, events, mini-games, etc. One thing that makes Roblox different from other platforms is that Roblox is a creator-driven platform. This is because other significant rivals design their games and publish them on the platform.<br />
Given below are some crucial aspects of the Roblox Metaverse that keep its users engaged and help it support its economy:</p>
<h3>Roblox Studio:</h3>
<p>Roblox Studio, the firm&#8217;s proprietary engine, allows its creators to create virtual worlds/games and publish their purchasable in-game items. A major part of Roblox&#8217;s 40+ Million games are user-generated, i.e, made by &#8220;amateur&#8221; game creators in Roblox studio.</p>
<h3>In-Game Purchases:</h3>
<p>These include different types of purchasable items in the Roblox Metaverse. One of the most important and known items is clothing and accessories for avatars. An Avatar is basically the virtual personality of members of the Metaverse, which can be customized by buying gear and accessories. Every purchase is made using Roblox&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrency</a>, Robux. Users are needed to exchange real-world money for Robux coins. Roblox offers native pricing in some countries. If native pricing is not supported for your country, pricing will display in USD by default.<br />
Any user can purchase in-game items, but just a few members of the Roblox Metaverse are allowed to sell them. Right now, only an account with a membership can <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313260-How-to-Sell-Items" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">participate</a> in private selling. Additionally, as with trading, only items marked as Limited or Limited U can be sold.</p>
<h3>Events and Other Attractions:</h3>
<p>Events like concerts and ceremonies are the spine of Metaverse&#8217;s economy. The Roblox Metaverse intends to organize events appropriate for its target audience, mainly minors.</p>
<h3>Brand Collaborations:</h3>
<p>Several popular brands have been spending excessive money on advertising in the Metaverse.<br />
In the Roblox Metaverse, luxury brands have partnered to promote their products. Some behemoths who have endorsed their products in the Roblox Metaverse include; Spotify, Walmart, Gucci, Lego, Nike, and Netflix. Roblox provides multiple channels to promote a branded experience, create a fanbase, and grow the audience for a brand.</p>
<h3>Some Popular Games on Roblox:</h3>
<p>Roblox&#8217;s top-grossing games, which witnessed billions of visits in the past years, include Adopt Me!, Blox Fruits, Brookhaven RP, and Shindo Life. Other popular games which have lured millions of players include Pet Simulator X, Sonic Speed Simulator, King Legacy, Gacha Online, and Livetopia.<br />
Roblox metaverse can be accessed on smartphones and other mobile devices sans the need for VR headsets. Roblox supports Facebook-owned Oculus Rift &amp; HTC Vive on Windows PCs.</p>

<p>Manhattan&#8217;s attorney speaks to the media after pleading guilty to The Trump Organization on all 17 counts.

<p>The company said in its defence that the employee did all this work for his personal benefit, in such a situation it is absurd to blame the company itself.</p>

Meanwhile, comments and <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-new-dates-in-xrp-lawsuit-whales-move-85-mln-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rulings coming out of the Ripple lawsuit</a> have directly impacted the XRP price in the long game. However, Ripple and SEC are seeking a Summary Judgement in their favor.</p>
<h2>Are Whales moving XRP?</h2>
<p>As per the data provided by WhaleStats, more than 4 billion XRP tokens have been moved in multiple transactions. Data depicts that around $1.5 billion worth of XRP was moved from the Bittrex crypto exchange to an unknown wallet. This move is expected to be related to the positive XRP news.</p>
<p>The<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1600398308958158848" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> biggest transaction recorded</a> by the tracker has been of moving 500 million (approx worth $189.3 million) from the exchange.</p>
<p>However, whales have been on a buying spree of XRP tokens. Coingape reported that <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-whales-move-143-mln-xrp-is-ripple-winning-the-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whales moved more than 143 million XRP</a> tokens amid the price dip.</p>
<p>On the market side, the XRP price is down by 20% over the past 30 days. XRP is trading at an average of $0.378, at press time. Its 24 hour trading volume stands at around $900 million. However, XRP is still holding a market cap of more than $19 billion despite facing a lawsuit from the US SEC.</p>
<h2>Who’s winning the XRP lawsuit?</h2>
<p>The crucial lawsuit between <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-approaching-to-its-end-heres-what-ripple-counsel-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple and SEC has submitted their briefs</a> to the US district judge urging them to provide Summary Judgment in favor. Filings asked Judge Analisa Torres to not so pass the case to trial.</p>
<p>Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s General Counsel mentioned that this is just the beginning of the end with the SEC lawsuit. </p>

The move comes as Japanese arm is taking more time to resume withdrawals and return customer funds. The FSA in November ordered FTX Japan to suspend operations such as accepting new customers, and work on resuming withdrawals.</p>
<h2>FTX Japan To Delay Returning of Customer Funds</h2>
<p>Japan&#8217;s Financial Services Agency plans to extend FTX Japan suspension order based on the Payment Services Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act beyond December 9.</p>
<p>FTX Trading&#8217;s Japanese subsidiary is still unable to resume withdrawals and taking more time to return customer funds, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB0774Z0X01C22A2000000/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> Nikkei on December 7. Moreover, it&#8217;s unclear if the firm plans to return customer funds soon.</p>
<p>On November 10, Japan&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-ftx-japan-ordered-by-regulator-to-suspend-operations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FSA ordered FTX Japan to suspend operations</a> after it suspended crypto asset withdrawals. Crypto exchange FTX faced liquidity issues after a massive selloff of FTX Token (FTT) due to misappropriating customer funds with sister firm Alameda. It led to FTX halting withdrawals for an indefinite period.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-japan-might-soon-allow-fund-withdrawals-to-its-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX Japan has announced returning customer funds</a> as the assets are unaffected by FTX bankruptcy. The crypto exchange looks to restart withdrawals after confirmation from bankruptcy lawyers in the U.S. The crypto assets in the Japanese subsidiary are held under Japanese law. Thus, it can be returned to customers after a security audit, incorporating controls, reconciliation, and reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-japan-to-resume-withdrawals-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX Japan executive earlier claimed</a> that a separate withdrawal system is under development to resume withdrawals for customers by the end of this year. The Japanese arm reportedly has around 19.6 billion yen ($138 million) in deposits as of November 10.</p>
<p>The FTX Token price currently trades at $1.40, up nearly 1% in the last 24 hours and over 3% in a week. The FTT token price fell over 95% amid the collapse of FTX.</p>

On November 10, 2021, the value of BTC reached an all-time high of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin-price/">$68.789.63</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">However, its value has <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bitcoin-price-analysis/">plummeted by $51,963 in just a year</a> and is now worth $16,826 (as of writing this), according to <a rel='nofollow'  rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">Coindesk</a>.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Even if bitcoin is worth much less than when it was at its peak, a $1,000 investment seven years ago (in 2015) would have resulted in a massive profit.</p>
<h3><strong>A Future That Paid Off</strong></h3>
<p style="color: #252525">In 2015, Bitcoin was, sort of, coming into mainstream and was the talk of the town, especially among crypto enthusiasts. Throughout 2015, the price of bitcoin fluctuated between $200 and $430.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s assume that you invested $10,000 in Bitcoin in December 2015 at the rate of $400 per BTC. That would have bought you 25 Bitcoins at that time.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to today&#8217;s (as of 7th December, 2022) price,<strong> 25 Bitcoins would be worth $420, 650</strong> &#8211; a  making you rich simply by reaping the benefits perseverance, a 7 year long perseverance.</p>
<p style="color: #252525"><em>You could argue that who had $10,000 lying around in 2015, not me!  </em>Well, if you had just bought $1000 worth of Bitcoins in 2015 (at $400 per BTC), you could have made $42,000 today, which is a<strong> 42x return on investment</strong>.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Similarly, $500 invested in Bitcoin 7 years ago is now worth $21,000, and $100 invested in Bitcoin 7 years ago is now worth $4200.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Please keep in mind that this estimate excludes any additional fees or transaction costs.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">PSA: If you bought BTC when it peaked at $65,000–68,000, sit tight.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Disclaimer: This is strictly not an investment advice. Please do your due diligence before investing in any asset.</p>

However, Bitcoin going anything above this is still very unpredictable and remains a suspense.</p>
<h2>Will Bitcoin price breach $18k?</h2>
<p>The market still seems to be bearish and the bears should step in to see this kind of high. After hitting this level Bitcoin will come down again to a lower low. The other possible scenario is that it will not hit a lower low. Instead, it will hit a higher low; if the market is more bearish.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.loom.com/share/8ff43afe159f4714a5e7f8f55940c552" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/8ff43afe159f4714a5e7f8f55940c552-1670373777082-with-play.gif" /></a></p>
<p>There is an expectation of Ethereum hitting a lower low. If Bitcoin takes the higher low, then Ethereum will have to go to a lower low for taking these lows. Bitcoin has already taken its liquidity from the lows. It is anticipated to go above Ethereum. Ethereum, along with other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">Altcoins</a> will hit a low and then Bitcoin will start showing strength against them, ultimately breaking out.</p>
<p>Invalidation level is clearly starting at 16k, thus, the validation level according to the analyst should definitely be somewhere around 18k to 19k.</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">So, Is The Bear Market In Crypto Finally Over?</span></h2>
<p>The bear market was predicted to end by 2022, as we enter the new year. However, it is still very prominent in the crypto market. The dust from FTX debacle has settled but the market is yet far from entering the bullish momentum.</p>
<blockquote><p>A bear market occurs when the market experiences a long-term decline in prices. It typically describes a situation where security prices fall 20% or more from recent highs amid widespread pessimism and negative investor sentiment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bear markets are often associated with declines in the overall market or an index such as the S&amp;P 500, but individual securities or commodities can also be considered a bear market if they experience declines of 20% or more over a long period of time—usually two months or more. This market can also accompany a general economic downturn, such as a recession. It can be contrasted with rising bull markets.</p>
