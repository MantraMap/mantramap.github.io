Last month, Custodia started serving external business customers in select U.S. states, offering U.S. dollar deposits and government money market fund services, with bitcoin custody pending launch. The launch comes after overcoming regulatory pressures and challenges with the Federal Reserve Board. </strong></p>
<h2>Custodia Bank Debuts Services</h2>
<p>Many crypto and narrow banking proponents have awaited the arrival of <a href="https://custodiabank.com/">Custodia Bank</a>, a financial institution that is tech-forward and customer-centric. “We&#8217;re grateful to our partners, who appreciate our approach of complying with banking laws and regulations; to Wyoming for its enabling laws; to our team and investors; and to the law-abiding digital asset industry,” <a href="https://twitter.com/custodiabank/status/1690012708513390592?s=20">said</a> CEO Caitlin Long. Custodia says the bank&#8217;s regional bank-style risk management program, along with its dedication to following regulations, sets it apart from competitors.</p>
<p>Services now available include U.S. dollar deposits and U.S. government money market fund services, tailored to U.S.-based business customers. This includes digital asset businesses, fintechs, banks, corporate treasurers, trusts, pension funds, and start-ups. The bank&#8217;s strategy is to eventually serve customers worldwide, providing enhanced regulatory clarity and minimized transactional risk with its unique reserve model.</p>
<p>Custodia operates under the first special purpose depository institution (SPDI) legal and regulatory framework in the United States. This approach allows the bank to offer a full suite of financial services for both U.S. dollars and digital assets. Demand deposit accounts are protected under a 100% reserve requirement, and the bank offers API solutions for programmable accounts, payments, settlement, and future custody products, Custodia’s website <a href="https://custodiabank.com/">discloses</a>.</p>
<p>Custodia Bank&#8217;s journey to this point has been marked by challenges. In December, they informed the U.S. Federal Reserve of their intention to complete a specific task list and followed through despite it no longer being required. Independent reviews, new partnerships, and the development of new services to meet market needs were all part of the process, Custodia detailed on Friday.</p>

<p>In January 2023, the Federal Reserve Board <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-bank-custodia-denied-membership-in-us-federal-reserve-system/">issued a denial</a> for Custodia&#8217;s application to become a member of the system, citing “significant safety and soundness risks” related to crypto assets and an insufficient risk management framework. The denial reflected <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-look-at-the-feds-recent-custodia-bank-denial-and-the-central-banks-push-back-against-narrow-banking/">broader regulatory skepticism</a> towards digital assets and narrow banking techniques. However, Custodia&#8217;s perseverance and alignment with Wyoming&#8217;s innovative legal framework for SPDIs have allowed them to navigate these challenges and emerge as a regulated bank.</p>

Folashodun Shonubi, the acting governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, insists that the naira is currently undervalued. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said Nigeria&#8217;s &#8220;loose&#8221; fiscal and monetary policies are to blame for the naira&#8217;s woes.</strong></p>
<h2>Nigeria May Abandon New Exchange Rate Policy</h2>
<p>Nigeria’s rapidly depreciating currency recently breached the 900 per dollar mark for the first time after its parallel market exchange rate versus the greenback reportedly fell to a new low of NGN950:USD1 on Aug 9. The currency’s latest plunge came just days after the Economic Intelligence Unit <a href="https://country.eiu.com/nigeria">warned</a> that Nigerian authorities may consider abandoning the floating exchange rate regime adopted in mid-June.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.thecable.ng/breaking-naira-tumbles-to-all-time-low-of-n950-at-parallel-market">report</a> from The Cable, the ongoing shortages of the greenback on both the formal and informal markets have fueled the naira’s latest slide versus major currencies. Meanwhile, the currency’s fall has now prompted some Nigerian economic commentators to forecast a further depreciation of the naira over the course of the next few weeks.</p>
<p>However, despite the currency’s continuing decline, Folashodun Shonubi, the Central Bank of Nigeria’s acting governor, insists that the naira is currently undervalued. In his remarks made at the National Institute of Security Studies (NISS), Shonubi maintained economic modeling had proven this assertion to be correct.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were to conduct an economic modelling of Nigeria using purchasing power parity, you would discover that the Naira is currently significantly undervalued,&#8221; the acting governor <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/08/naira-is-currently-undervalued-says-ag-cbn-governor/#:~:text=CBN%20Governor,-%E2%80%A6&amp;text=The%20Acting%20Governor%20of%20the,modelling%20using%20purchasing%20power%20parity.">said</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<p>Shonubi identified the channeling of diaspora remittances away from the formal foreign exchange market as one of the reasons why the naira has performed badly against the greenback. He also accused unnamed Nigerian banks of fueling the naira’s depreciation via &#8220;illegal&#8221; dollar sales. The acting governor warned that the CBN would soon descend on banks suspected to be behind the unsanctioned dollar sales.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has reportedly blamed the naira’s woes on the country’s &#8220;loose&#8221; fiscal and monetary policies. However, according to Ari Aisen, the global lender’s representative in Nigeria, the country can still give the naira a fighting chance by tightening its policies.</p>

Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press disclosed a synopsis of the August 11 hearing on the social media outlet X, where Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal counsel revealed that the attorneys intended to challenge the ruling. However, despite these intentions, Bankman-Fried was subsequently taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals.</strong></p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Remanded to Jail After Bail Revocation</h2>
<p>In the past fortnight, the legal team prosecuting the case against Sam Bankman-Fried has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">striving to incarcerate</a> the former FTX CEO on grounds of suspected witness tampering. Bankman-Fried disseminated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ex-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-google-docs-diary-exposes-struggles-prior-to-ftx-collapse/">selected passages</a> from an online journal penned by former Alameda CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-suggest-caroline-ellison-is-working-with-feds-and-snitching-on-ftx-co-founder-bankman-fried/">Caroline Ellison</a> to a New York Times journalist.</p>
<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has asserted that these leaked fragments were designed to cow a witness slated to testify against the one-time head of FTX. Since these excerpts surfaced, a heated debate has ensued between the parties, as they sparred over whether Bankman-Fried&#8217;s action constitutes a mere exercise of free speech or a deliberate attempt at witness intimidation.</p>
<p>According to an <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690061503645229056?s=20">X thread</a> published by Matthew Russell Lee of the Inner City Press, the judge presiding over the case has decided to remand Bankman-Fried to jail. Just before mentioning the revocation, the judge <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/prosecutors-seek-restrictions-on-former-ftx-ceos-electronic-devices-following-vpn-use-for-football-streaming/">mentioned</a> Bankman-Fried leveraging a VPN to watch television.</p>
<p>“[Bankman-Fried] subscribed from the Bahamas and used a VPN as if he were in the Bahamas when he was in Palo Alto and could have watched it on public TV. It shows the mindset. All things considered, I am going to revoke bail,” the judge said in a quote <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690080018565627904?s=20">cited</a> by the Inner City Press.</p>
<p>Then the judge and the U.S. government discussed sending Bankman-Fried to the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) or Putnam County Correctional Facility. The discussion concerning which jail to send him was about whether or not Bankman-Fried could still access a laptop.</p>

<p>“The FBI would assist with transporting him to Putnam. During trial, in the MDC,” the prosecutor <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690081938743218178?s=20">said</a> and the judge agreed. The prosecutor further noted that there was “a reason for concern,” and further <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690083129292095488?s=20">stated</a> “who knows what mischief he could accomplish in the next few days.”</p>

<p>Russell Lee then detailed that after the judge’s decision was made, U.S. Marshals moved in to arrest Bankman-Fried. He had to take off his jacket and tie and remove his shoelaces. “Now, still in [the] courtroom, handcuffs are applied to Sam Bankman-Fried. He&#8217;s taken out the door,” Russell Lee’s account of the proceedings <a href="https://twitter.com/innercitypress/status/1690084652805996544?s=20">explained</a>.</p>

<h2>SEC Seeks Public Opinion on Spot Bitcoin ETF</h2>
<p>The SEC put out a 34-page <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/cboebzx/2023/34-98112.pdf">request for comment</a> on the Ark Invest and 21Shares application, seeking views on whether the proposal meets regulatory standards. The move pushes any decision on the bitcoin ETF beyond the initially reported August deadline.</p>
<p>The agency asked for public input on concerns around potential manipulation of the proposed ETF and the underlying bitcoin market. It raised questions about whether the CME bitcoin futures market is a “regulated market of significant size” for the spot ETF.</p>
<p>The SEC also seeks feedback on the liquidity and efficiency of bitcoin markets and plans for the ETF sponsors to share surveillance data with the agency. “Written data, views, and arguments&#8221; are due in 21 days, the request details.</p>

<p>This marks the latest roadblock for approval of a spot bitcoin ETF after years of applications. The SEC has greenlighted bitcoin futures ETFs but resisted spot funds over worries about manipulation and insufficient regulation of crypto markets.</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s request likely extends the long wait for a spot bitcoin ETF, which issuers say would provide a safer way for mainstream investors to gain exposure. The SEC will weigh the new feedback before making any final decision on the Ark and 21Shares application. The senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg, Eric Balchunas, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1690009258643890176?s=20">said</a> the SEC move was “pretty standard.”</p>

The majority of value locked comprises 75,244 ether and nearly $26 million worth of the USDC stablecoin.</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase&#x2019;s Base Grows to $175 Million TVL</h2>
<p>As one of the pioneer publicly-listed firms to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/base-opens-ethereum-bridge-mainnet-to-launch-august-9/">roll out</a> its own L2 blockchain, Coinbase&#x2019;s Base has witnessed consistent growth. On July 30, 2023, daily active Base users reached 55,417 and surged to an all-time high of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2839431/4741865">136,047</a> just 11 days later. This surpassed L2 Optimism&#x2019;s <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/optimism">114,736</a> daily active users on the same day.</p>
<p>Unlike Coinbase&#x2019;s Base protocol, Optimism&#x2019;s usage also benefited from the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-opens-probe-into-worldcoin-personal-data-treatment-procedures/">Worldcoin</a> launch since its native asset WLD resides on the L2 network. At 9:00 a.m. (ET) on Friday, August 11, 2023, the total value locked (TVL) within Base was approximately $175,915,994 based on Dune Analytics metrics.</p>
<p><a href="https://dune.com/tk-research/base">Dune data</a> shows the Base TVL mainly consists of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> and USDC with 75,244 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> and 26,075,940 USDC secured in Coinbase&#x2019;s layer. About 6,428,425 DAI is also circulating on Base along with 2,183 CBETH &#x2014; Coinbase&#x2019;s liquid staking Ethereum derivative token.</p>

<p>Data from defillama.com <a href="https://defillama.com/chains">reveals</a> that on August 11, Base&#x2019;s TVL would have ranked beneath Cardano&#x2019;s TVL, if it were listed. At that time Cardano&#x2019;s TVL stood at $179.17 million spread across 24 defi protocols and encompassing 36,160 users. Surpassing Bitcoin&#x2019;s value locked at $171.73 million &#x2014; Base&#x2019;s TVL lags compared to Arbitrum and Optimism with respective TVLs of $849.42 million and $1.928 billion.</p>
<p>Base&#x2019;s <a href="https://dune.com/tk-research/base">daily transaction count</a> peaked at 607,699 on July 30 and achieved 579,752 transfers on August 10. Coinbase&#x2019;s defi solutions have become prominent fixtures in the ecosystem as the company&#x2019;s liquid staking derivative protocol holds the <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">second-largest</a> number of ether locked, under Lido Finance.</p>

Simultaneously, five days ago when the contract recorded 408,721 unique addresses in possession of WLD, the figure modestly rose by 14.61% or roughly 59,745 wallets.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Users Claim 15.82 Million WLD, Unique Addresses Rise 14% in Five Days, Market Value Struggles</h2>
<p>Worldcoin&#x2019;s activity is still on an upward trajectory, with 2.2 million individuals having registered to scan their irises. To date, the <a href="https://dune.com/tk-research/worldcoin">data reveals</a> that 15,825,757 WLD have been successfully claimed by users.</p>
<p>As the rate of these claims accelerates, a two-week market analysis confirms a loss of 21.4% against the greenback and a decline of 24.6% over the last seven days. Worldcoin&#x2019;s price achieved an all-time high 18 days ago, but since that pinnacle, it has tumbled 48.18% from the $3.30 high that was marked on July 24, 2023.</p>
<p>Trading at a current rate of $1.71 per WLD, the coin now stands at 2.85% above its all-time low of $1.66, also recorded on that same day. A mere five days ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/while-worldcoin-sees-a-148-surge-in-unique-addresses-the-top-20-wallets-command-94-of-wld-supply/">covered</a> WLD&#x2019;s 148% upswing in unique addresses, and this figure has further escalated by 14.61% since the report was published.</p>
<p>At present, the WLD smart contract reveals that <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1#balances">468,466 addresses</a> are clutching WLD. Worldcoin manages two smart contract addresses, holding 55.4380% and 17.3248% respectively. These two wallets, under Worldcoin&#x2019;s command, collectively seize 72.7628% of the holdings. Binance, the manager of the third largest wallet, controls 12,095,562.94 WLD, or 6.7623% of the circulating supply, at the time of this writing.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0xdc6ff44d5d932cbd77b52e5612ba0529dc6226f1">closer examination</a> of the top 100 WLD holders reveals that they jointly possess 94.27% or 168,611,629.94 of the total WLD supply. The coin is also <a href="https://dune.com/worldcoin/worldcoin">witnessing activity</a> on decentralized exchange (dex) platforms, with the peak number of WLD swaps having transpired on August 8, 2023.</p>

<p>Yet, as of August 11, Binance stands out as the most active exchange for swapping WLD, with the leading trading pair being WLD/<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>, boasting a trading volume of $26,373,919 in the last 24 hours. Other cryptocurrency exchanges contributing to the WLD trading momentum include Okx and Bitget.</p>
<p>While the count of unique addresses and WLD claimants continues to swell, it&#x2019;s worth noting that distribution still rests predominantly in the grasp of a select few, encompassing Worldcoin&#x2019;s wallets and a substantial array of market makers.</p>

Specifically, on July 26, 2023, this very wallet sent 2,500 ether, valued at over $4.6 million, to a well known burn address, a definitive action that ensures those funds are irretrievable and permanently removed from circulation. </strong></p>
<h2>Mystery Crypto Address Annihilates Millions in Assets: From 2,500 Ether to Blue-Chip NFTs</h2>
<p>Picture possessing 2,500 ether, only to spontaneously decide to obliterate the funds by transferring the crypto assets, valued at $4.6 million, to a burn address. This exact scenario unfolded when the crypto address nd4.eth <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x36f899bb27aa365c30a6f559c3512c063c366dae515d43fe05ec530ed440bb5a">executed</a> this irreversible action on July 26, 2023, and it hasn&#x2019;t ceased its relentless destruction of crypto assets since.</p>
<p>On August 9, 2023, Arkham Intelligence&#x2019;s X account <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1689311156425609216?s=20">explained</a> that nd4.eth transferred three blue-chip NFTs, namely a Bored Ape Yacht Club, a Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and a Bored Ape Kennel Club. These three NFTs, Arkham detailed, carried a combined value of $88,300.</p>
<p>&#x201C;These tokens are all completely unrecoverable. Why would someone do this?&#x201D; Arkham asked.</p>
<p>The discussion further observed that nd4.eth incinerated $18,000 worth of APE, along with other crypto assets like GNS and GMX, amounting to a few thousand dollars. Arkham noted that nd4.eth functioned as a trader, boasting a substantial $25 million counterparty volume with Uniswap and $20 million with Binance.</p>
<p>&#x201C;[nd4.eth] received around 5.5K <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> in Dec 2022 from enditall.eth, but [nd4.eth] didn&#x2019;t burn that &#x2013; instead bridging it to Arbitrum, and buying GMX,&#x201D; Arkham explained. The <a href="https://blockchair.com/ethereum/address/0xdead000000000000000042069420694206942069">burn address</a> itself carries a notable reputation, as Vitalik Buterin famously transmitted a large sum of SHIB to the address in 2021.</p>

<p>Although the burn address is home to the notorious SHIB from Buterin, the 2,500 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> from nd4.eth constitutes its entire holding in terms of ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>), with the sole exception being a cumulative total of 3.24 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, dispatched by a large handful of other senders. Statistics show nd4.eth held a total of 11,058 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> worth roughly $17 million and it now holds 0.00254 ether worth just over $4.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Network&#x2019;s Inherent Properties and the Security of PoS Chains</h2>
<p>The CTO told Bitcoin.com News that proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains and app chains can also potentially benefit from the robust bitcoin-grade security that a bitcoin staking protocol brings. As explained in <a href="https://www.babylonchain.io/">Babylon Chain&#x2019;s</a> whitepaper, bitcoin staking means holders of the top crypto asset can &#x201C;trustlessly stake their bitcoins without bridging them to the PoS chain but yet provides the chain with full slashable security guarantees.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Concerning the so-called blockchain trilemma (a network&#x2019;s inability to simultaneously excel in security, scalability, and decentralization), Yu insisted that this can be overcome by &#x201C;allowing bitcoin holders to stake their idle bitcoins,&#x201D; which in turn helps to &#x201C;enhance the overall economic security of PoS chains.&#x201D; Yu, in the meantime, revealed how the Bitcoin network&#x2019;s timestamping service &#x201C;enables tight synchronization between the Bitcoin network and the PoS chains.&#x201D; According to the CTO, it is this synchronization which enables &#x201C;bitcoin stakers to have fast unstaking without affecting the PoS chains&#x2019; security.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the rest of his written answers sent to Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, Yu also explained how Babylon&#x2019;s bitcoin staking protocol strikes a balance between security and PoS chains&#x2019; need for autonomy. Below are Yu&#x2019;s answers.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): In terms of security, the Bitcoin network has proved its resilience over the last 14 years. The network has never shut down and it is said that no bitcoin has been stolen from the chain. What is it about Bitcoin that makes it such a powerful foundation for security?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fisher Yu (FY):</strong> Bitcoin&#x2019;s robustness is founded on its decentralized nature and proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. As a decentralized network with no single point of failure, it is less vulnerable to attacks. The enormous computational power required to manipulate the Bitcoin network makes it economically infeasible for attackers, and Babylon leverages these inherent properties, and the asset it protects, i.e., the bitcoins, to enhance the security of PoS chains.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Your crypto project has introduced a bitcoin staking protocol that reportedly promises to bring Bitcoin security to PoS chains, applications and app chains while incentivizing the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holders. Bitcoin is said to lack native smart contract support and only offers limited scripting capabilities. So, how does Babylon make bitcoin staking a reality without relying on bridges or centralized lenders?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FY:</strong> The core of PoS security is slashable staking: If a validator of the PoS chain attacks it, its staked assets will be slashed. Thus, any slashable asset is a potential staking asset for a PoS chain.</p>
<p>Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol turns bitcoin into a first-class staking asset for PoS chains: A bitcoin staker simply locks its desired amount of bitcoins on the Bitcoin network using a special signature algorithm already supported by the current Bitcoin network. The secret key to this lock will be leaked if and (very importantly) only if the Bitcoin staker attacks the PoS chain. Once leaked, it can be used to send the locked bitcoins (either entirely or partially) to a burn address using a covenant emulation technique supported by the existing Bitcoin scripting language. This way, the locked bitcoins are effectively a first-class staking asset: honest Bitcoin stakers&#x2019; bitcoins are absolutely secure, and they can earn yields, but malicious Bitcoin stakers will have their bitcoins slashed to secure the PoS chains.</p>
<p>Since all techniques in Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol are already supported by the existing Bitcoin network, the protocol does not need any smart contract. Also, since the bitcoin locking is self-custodial on the Bitcoin network, the bitcoin stakers do not need to trust or give their bitcoins to any third parties, which eliminates the need for bridges and lenders.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: The blockchain trilemma &#x2014; a network&#x2019;s inability to simultaneously excel in security, scalability, and decentralization &#x2014; remains an unsolved issue. Some PoS chains have done fairly well in terms of scalability and decentralization. Do you think the additional Bitcoin security provided by your protocol could help the PoS ecosystem solve the trilemma?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FY:</strong> Absolutely. Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol addresses both the security and decentralization aspects of the Blockchain Trilemma for PoS chains. By allowing bitcoin holders to stake their idle bitcoins, we enhance the overall economic security of PoS chains. In addition, the Bitcoin network is the most decentralized network in the world, making Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol the most decentralized staking mechanism. These, in turn, empower PoS chains to focus more on scalability without compromising security or decentralization.</p>
<p>From another perspective, Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol also helps the Bitcoin network to solve its trilemma. Being the most secure and decentralised network, Bitcoin has very little scalability. Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol integrates the Bitcoin network with the vast PoS world, which effectively scales it.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: The Bitcoin network has limited capabilities and slow transaction speeds. Would recording the PoS chains&#x2019; mass transactions on the Bitcoin network deteriorate its transaction speed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FY:</strong> Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol provides economic security to PoS chains through staking. It does not require PoS chain transactions to be posted to the Bitcoin network at all. Having this said, the protocol does utilize advanced signature aggregation techniques that allow Babylon to obtain Bitcoin timestamps for any PoS chains. The footage is only 150 bytes per timestamp on the Bitcoin network no matter how many PoS chains are aggregated and timestamped. With this timestamping service, the protocol enables tight synchronization between the Bitcoin network and the PoS chains, which allows bitcoin stakers to have fast unstaking without affecting the PoS chains&#x2019; security.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: When looked at from a PoS chain or app chain&#x2019;s perspective, would relying on the Bitcoin Staking protocol for security compromise their autonomy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FY:</strong> Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin Staking protocol is a modular design that does not affect the autonomy of the PoS chains. From a consensus perspective, it adds extra block finality to PoS blocks without interfering with the base consensus protocol of the PoS chain. From a governance perspective, bitcoin stakers do not participate in the on-chain governance voting if there is any. From an economic perspective, the PoS chain has the full power to decide how much Bitcoin stake to take and how much rewards to give.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: The security needs of blockchains and app chains are constantly evolving in the multi-chain world with numerous sovereign and interconnected app chains. How does the Bitcoin staking protocol help secure cross-chain transactions, if at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>FY:</strong> Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin staking protocol greatly enhances the security of both the two counterparty chains, which means the actual transactions under the hood of the cross-chain trading become more secure. In addition, the protocol itself acts as a control plane for all the PoS chains and, thus, can also be used to settle cross-chain transactions. Moreover, when two chains use a decentralized bridge to facilitate their trading, Babylon&#x2019;s Bitcoin staking protocol can be used to secure the decentralized bridge itself, which is otherwise usually the weakest spot of the trading.</p>

<p>The Bank of Russia is completing preparations for the upcoming digital ruble pilot test that will start on August 15. The bank recently announced that all banks that expressed their desire to be part of this test have already confirmed their participation in the pilot, making technical arrangements specifically directed for this test.</p>
<p>According to the Russian state news agency Tass, the first deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1658291" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>13 banks completed all the preparatory activities as regards technical preparations and development of their own mobile apps and ready to start transactions with real clients together with us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The level of involvement of banks in this pilot was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-launch-digital-ruble-transactions-with-real-users-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> earlier by the chairman of the board of Ingosstrakh Bank, Stanislav Danysh, who explained that the participating banks would allow users and corporations to transact using the digital ruble. However, the first phase, he stated, would be limited, only including bank partners and employees.</p>

<h2>Retail Users&#8217; Involvement Confirmed</h2>
<p>While Skorobogatova did not offer a time frame for the activities of the pilot test, she did explain that customers of the banks would be able to participate directly in the pilot.</p>
<p>Skorobogatova declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Retail clients of banks participating in the pilot project will be able after some time to submit applications for digital ruble testing in real transactions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other banks not participating in the test this year are expected to be part of the pilot test. Skorobogatova revealed that sixteen more banks will be part of the digital ruble test network next year.</p>
<p>In July, the Bank of Russia also considered integrating the digital ruble network with other digital currencies to interconnect different payment systems. This would allow the bank to harness the digital ruble as a cross-border payment currency. At the time, the governor of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-of-russia-discusses-digital-ruble-integration-with-other-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that several ways for reaching this integration were being discussed with friendly countries.</p>

He is convinced that a digitized greenback and other digital fiats represent a threat to democracy in the United States.</strong></p>
<h2>CBDC Is the ‘Latest Trojan Horse of the Great Reset,’ Opponent Ramaswamy Says</h2>
<p>Vivek Ramaswamy, one of the runners in the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, has criticized the U.S. government for considering a digital version of the dollar. “It’s telling that Janet Yellen is pushing for the U.S. to adopt CBDCs, begging Americans to keep up with the Jinpings,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1689035239417393152" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy believes that “CBDCs are just the latest Trojan horse of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Reset</a> and are a clear path to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social credit system</a> that will permanently embed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESG</a> into our currency itself.” In his view, “the dollar will be *stronger* if we protect it from digitization.”</p>
<p>In a video posted on X, formerly Twitter, the American entrepreneur said he is a “big opponent” of central bank digital currencies, which he considers to be “a grave threat to liberty in this country,” for the same reason that China is adopting them. He elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the U.S., that’s become an argument to say we need to do that to keep up. I view it the other way — precisely for the reasons that Xi Jinping wants to adopt it, is exactly the reasons why we in the United States shouldn’t.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Fed Should Focus on Stabilizing Dollar, White House Hopeful Suggests</h2>
<p>Vivek Ramaswamy also slammed the U.S. Federal Reserve for its behavior in the past couple of decades, calling the central bank “a bad actor” for “trying to hit two targets with one arrow, inflation and unemployment, which has proven to be a disastrous 25-year experiment.”</p>
<p>“I think what the Federal Reserve needs to do is go back to focusing on what it did focus on, even after it went off the gold standard … stabilizing the U.S. dollar as a unit of measurement. That, too, is a big impediment to GDP growth,” the presidential candidate explained.</p>
<p>Ramaswamy’s comments on CBDCs come after last month, another contender to become the Republican nominee for the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/done-dead-desantis-to-nix-central-bank-digital-currency-on-day-1/">vowed</a> to “nix central bank digital currency,” if he is elected president, describing it as a “massive threat to American liberty.”</p>
