<p>As updated in an earlier Coincu News article, the rumor of SBF, the founder of the empire that has collapsed <strong>FTX for over a year now, has been <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150689-sbf-secretly-sponsored-the-block/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secretly sponsoring</a> a crypto media fund The Block</strong> company through<strong> funds sent to its chief executive officer, Michael McCaffrey</strong>.</p>



<p>On December 10, Zhu Su, co-founder of Three Arrows Capital, tweeted that <strong>The Block has always been wholly owned by SBF</strong>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The idea that the CEO of the Block has been bribed massively, that the company has been de facto wholly owned by SBF for years now, yet the underlying reporting was solid, is mindboggling.<br><br>SBF was solo source for many of their &quot;scoops.&quot; He ran the entire editorial direction.</p>&mdash; Zhu Su <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f53a.png" alt="🔺" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@zhusu) <a href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1601418381449924609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 10, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>He emphasized that the SBF is the sole source of much of their proprietary news, and that the SBF is responsible for directing control of the entire news editor.</p>



<p><strong>Zhu Su added that Larry Cermak, vice president of The Block, has a lot of money stuck on FTX</strong>. He often tweets about trading news and listings on the trading platform, but he never mentioned this incident.</p>



<p>The 3AC co-founder believes that The Block will get rid of Michael McCaffrey and SBF These things will have a better research and development direction after the fact. Also, the podcast by The Block&#8217;s news director Frank Chaparro is also sponsored by FTX, but he doesn&#8217;t think Frank has a problem, he says most of the team is excellent.</p>

<p>However, Su Zhu&#8217;s allegations were not corroborated by any evidence, so the community came to the conclusion that he was just overfishing with murky water. Similar to taking advantage of the collapse of FTX to blame the collapse of 3AC on FTX and Alameda bad play.</p>



<p>As previously reported, the <strong>CEO of The Block <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150663-the-block-ceo-resigns-after-loans-from-sbf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has resigned</a> for failing to disclose a $43 million loan</strong> for various purposes he received from Alameda Research.</p>

<p>According to a forum post by <strong>Devin Walsh</strong>, the foundation&#8217;s executive director, Uniswap community members will be able to vote on a reorganization package that would increase the DAO&#8217;s efficiency and efficacy on <strong>December 14</strong>.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In November, we made a proposal to reduce friction in the Uniswap community governance process. <br><br>Delegates provided their feedback &#8211; and today we are posting an updated proposal. <br><br>We plan to hold a vote on these changes on Wed., Dec. 14.<a href="https://t.co/3xXQ4ymzuw" target="_blank">https://t.co/3xXQ4ymzuw</a></p>&mdash; Uniswap Foundation (@UniswapFND) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniswapFND/status/1601227009278910464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December 9, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The most significant change would be a reduction in the requirement for off-chain snapshot votes prior to on-chain votes in the governance. It would significantly raise the bar for obtaining preliminary votes, preventing lower-quality proposals from passing. The final governance votes will remain unchanged.</p>



<p>Revisions and updates to <strong>Request for Comment</strong> include: increasing the <strong>new “RFC” process </strong>to a <strong>minimum of 7 days</strong> rather than the originally proposed <strong>3 days</strong>; increasing the quorum for the <strong>new Temperature Check</strong>, the remaining off-chain Snapshot poll, to <strong>10 million UNI</strong> rather than the originally proposed <strong>5 million UNI</strong>; increasing the quorum to <strong>10 million UNI increases</strong> the effectiveness of this phase as a signal of community support.</p>

<p>Regardless of interest income risks, the bank&#8217;s report indicates that revenue expectations for <strong>2023</strong> are likely unduly optimistic.</p>



<p>Coinbase CEO <strong>Brian Armstrong</strong> said that the company&#8217;s revenue would be half or less of what it was last year as the exchange struggles amid sharp drops in cryptocurrency prices and the collapse of crypto exchange <strong>FTX</strong>.</p>

<p>The company claims <strong>their balance on FTX represents 18% of the company&#8217;s equivalent</strong>, which is within the counterparty&#8217;s risk limit. Even without recovering any assets from FTX, FalconX said it remains “one of the best-capitalized digital asset companies.”</p>

<p>According to documents filed with the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, <strong>Symbiont.io, a New York financial technology company, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysb.314462/gov.uscourts.nysb.314462.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has filed </a>for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the U.S. bankruptcy law on December 1</strong>. According to the document, its assets and liabilities all range from $1 million to $10 million.</p>



<p>Founded in 2013 as Math Money FX, Symbiont.io aims to help financial institutions use blockchain to &#8220;reduce risk, save costs, and increase efficiency&#8221;.</p>

<p>It has raised capital from financial magnates, including the former CEO of the New York Stock Exchange. Symbiont has previously reached partnerships with major institutions like index fund giant Vanguard.</p>



<p>As was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, SWIFT, the Global Consortium for Interbank Financial Telecommunication, is <a href="https://news.coincu.com/124830-swift-partners-with-symbiont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnering with blockchain enterprise firm Symbiont</a> on a project.</p>



<p>However, the company still could not escape the death spiral of the crypto winter and had to add itself to the list of bankrupt crypto companies.</p>

<p>According to Michael McCaffrey&#8217;s Tweet, <strong>he was the only person with knowledge of the funding at the company.</strong></p>

<p><strong>McCaffrey obtained three loans</strong>, the first of which was <strong>$12 million</strong> and it was used in 2021 to buy out other investors from the provider of cryptocurrency news, statistics, and research. The second loan of <strong>$15 million</strong> had been made in January, which was used to help fund daily operations before an additional <strong>$16 million</strong> was borrowed to buy private property in the Bahamas.</p>



<p>His resignation is the most recent in the line of business losses related to the collapse of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150561-bankman-fried-says-he-is-willing-to-testify/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/150561-bankman-fried-says-he-is-willing-to-testify/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bankman-Fried</a>’s crypto empire. Besides, <strong>Bobby Moran, The Block’s Chief Revenue Officer, will step into the role of CEO</strong>. Prior to The Block, Bobby was the Chief Revenue Officer at POLITICO and the online educational service, EverFi.</p>



<p>Additionally, McCaffrey will leave his position as CEO as well as the company&#8217;s board, which will now have three members. <strong>The business is currently looking to add two more people to the extended group to join Moran</strong>. However, McCaffrey remains the company’s majority shareholder</p>
