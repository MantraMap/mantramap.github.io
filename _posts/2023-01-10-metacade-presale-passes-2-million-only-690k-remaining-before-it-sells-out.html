<p>Metacade is the world&rsquo;s first community-run play-to-earn (P2E) arcade built on blockchain. The Ethereum-backed metaverse project will offer a thriving GameFi hub for gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike. It will be a place to earn, learn and connect with like-minded individuals while playing some of the hottest P2E games that GameFi space has to offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Built to last, the Metacade roadmap showcases the project&rsquo;s ambition and longevity. Beyond its stellar blockchain game offering, the platform will host leaderboards, trending games, GameFi alpha, and much more to keep the community engaged. To further show its support to the gaming community the platform will launch a jobs board to help people new roles in Web3 and a Metagrants initiative to support game developers keen to build on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCADE, the platform&rsquo;s native token, will power activity and transactions on Metacade. Players will use it to access pay-to-play games and be rewarded for their gaming efforts in MCADE. There will be further earning opportunities through competitions and tournaments, sharing gaming alpha, and writing reviews. Staking will also be an option for MCADE holders wanting to top up their income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCADE has a fixed token supply of 2 billion tokens, with seventy percent of these being made available during the presale. The other thirty percent of these tokens have been reserved for development, liquidity provisions, competition pool funding, and exchange listings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MCADE will soon be listed on Bitmart, one of the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, which is ranked 21st in the CoinMarketCap exchange rankings. Metacade signed the terms with the Singapore-based digital asset exchange in December 2022 and shared the news on its Twitter account. This is just the beginning for the MCADE token as the team has revealed they are in talks with other crypto exchanges and have a top 10 exchange listing announcement coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
Head of Product for Metacade Russell Bennett said: "The Bitmart listing will give millions of people easy access to the MCADE token in a secure and safe trading environment. The public listing will propel awareness of Metacade and help the project gain further traction and following. With another popular exchange announcement soon to be revealed, we&rsquo;re thrilled by the spectacular welcome Metacade has received from the GameFi space."
