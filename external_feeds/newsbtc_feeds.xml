					<description><![CDATA[PEPE, the popular meme coin, has recently been listed on OKX, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This move has generated excitement among investors who believe that the coin has the potential to become a major player in the crypto market and the meme coin sector.  Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Retests Multi-Month Trend Line, Bulls Prevailing Again? PEPE Coin Leaps Into The Big Leagues The recent listing on OKX is a significant milestone for PEPE, providing the coin with greater exposure and access to a larger pool of investors. OKX is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, and its listing requirements are rigorous, which speaks to the increased enthusiasm generated by the cryptocurrency. This move also bodes well for the coin&#8217;s future, as it may lead to additional listings on other major exchanges. Furthermore, there is speculation that Binance, another major player in the crypto space, may list PEPE if it meets their criteria. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently hinted at this possibility during an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) session, further fueling excitement around the coin. In addition to the already thrilling news, there has been a surge of over 90% in the value of the meme coin since yesterday. This has resulted in a record-breaking market capitalization of over $435 million, making it the 101st most valuable coin in the cryptocurrency market, as reported by NewsBTC. Frogging Amazing, Meme Coin Takes The Crypto World by Storm According to Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, three “SmartMoneys” have sold a portion of their PEPE holdings and made a profit of over $1 million. This impressive feat was achieved in just two weeks. Lookonchain has reported that an individual with the following wallet has significantly profited from investing in PEPE. According to Lookonchain, the wallet holder purchased 5.42 trillion PEPE tokens for the equivalent of 1 Ethereum, worth approximately $2,100. The wallet holder sold 3.42 trillion PEPE tokens for 929 Ethereum, worth around $1.77 million. Despite selling some holdings, the individual still holds 2 trillion PEPE tokens, worth approximately $2.37 million at current market prices. If this investor were to sell their remaining meme coin tokens at the current market price, it could potentially profit approximately $4.14 million.  Furthermore,  a user using dimethyltryptamine.eth has made a significant profit investing in the cryptocurrency project. The user reportedly purchased 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens for the equivalent of 0.125 Ethereum, worth approximately $251. Dimethyltryptamine.eth sold 2 trillion meme coin tokens for 560 Ethereum, worth around $1.06 million. Despite selling a portion of their holdings, dimethyltryptamine.eth still holds 3.9 trillion PEPE tokens worth approximately $2.37 million at current market prices.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have continued to sell recently, a sign that can be bearish for the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Been Going Down Since Rally Started As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, BTC miners have continued to shave coins off their reserve recently. The &#8220;miner reserve&#8221; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that all miners are holding in their wallets currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis When the value of this metric goes up, it means the miners are depositing a net number of coins into their wallets. This trend suggests these blockchain validators are accumulating the cryptocurrency. As miners are often a source of selling pressure in the market, their holding on and adding to their supply can be bullish for the price. On the other hand, a decreasing value in this indicator implies that miners are transferring some BTC out of their reserve. Since one of the main reasons why these investors may withdraw from their wallets is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have bearish consequences for the asset&#8217;s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner reserve over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have gone down in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin miner reserve saw a sharp plunge just as the rally began in January, suggesting that these investors sold to take advantage of the profit-taking opportunity. The drawdown in the metric was also quite sharp in this case and surpassed the levels seen during the FTX crash last November. The miner reserve has only moved sideways or down since this selloff, suggesting that these holders haven&#8217;t participated in any accumulation in recent months; they have only been looking at chances to exit. Recently, when Bitcoin plunged from the $30,000 mark, the indicator again saw a sharp leg down, meaning that this cohort was again selling their BTC. The drawdown in the indicator has also continued through the volatile price action observed in the last few days, suggesting that the BTC miners are still disposing of their coins. Though these investors may have been selling a net amount of coins recently, the actual scale of their selling isn&#8217;t that significant compared to their total reserve (they currently hold upwards of 1.82 million BTC in their wallets).

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) has been experiencing a volatile price action since late April, with significant fluctuations in its value. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 3% decline in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $28,400. However, it has now settled within an accumulation range of $27,800 to $30,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Destroys 3.26 Billion SHIB in April Amid Price Decline Bitcoin Bulls Take Caution BaroVirtual from Cryptoquant recently shared his analysis regarding the potential downside targets for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the bearish divergence of the BTC: On-Chain Summation Index suggests a target of approximately $27.200. A Head and Shoulders (H&#38;S) pattern also indicates a lower range target of $25,000. The BTC on-Chain Summation Index is a metric that tracks the number of Bitcoin being transferred on the blockchain. When the index shows a bearish divergence, it suggests a decrease in the amount of Bitcoin being transferred, which could lead to a decline in price. On the same note,  Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, received its largest single Bitcoin deposit in the past week. The deposit, made to an address that had remained inactive for four months, came from five separate addresses and totaled over 1,200 BTC, worth over $35M at current market prices. Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions, reported the news. The firm noted that the deposit was made in a single transaction and that the funds were sent to a previously unused deposit address. Will this translate into an extension of the bearish momentum? It remains to be seen.  Moreover, according to Material Indicators, a crypto analytics firm, the recent Bitcoin monthly candle close/open has signaled a potential short-term price correction for the cryptocurrency. The firm&#8217;s Trend Precognition A2+ algo flashed a short signal, indicating a potential decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, as seen in the chart below.  However, according to Material Indicators, the signal is tentative until the candle closes, and a pump above the April high could invalidate it. Additionally, Wednesday&#8217;s upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Federal Reserve interest rate decision could catalyze a significant price move in either direction. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 basis points, it could lead to a stronger US dollar and put downward pressure on Bitcoin&#8217;s price. However, continuing to pause or maintain current rates could boost investor confidence and lead to a price increase for the cryptocurrency. Although the potential downside targets predicted for BTC, evidence suggests that the $27,000 mark could support the cryptocurrency and push back the bears. This level has already demonstrated its resilience as a support floor, holding up well against significant selling pressure since April 21st.

					<description><![CDATA[While Bitcoin (BTC) has continued a downtrend, the asset has recently recorded a high volume in daily transactions nearing its all-time high. According to a report by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, “Bitcoin daily transaction counts are approaching All-time-highs, seeing an explosive uptick in 2023.’ Regardless of this news, Bitcoin has continued to move downward after its weekend plateau of trading at just between $29,300. The asset trading volume has also surged slightly indicating a possible violent sell-off.   Bitcoin Records Daily Transactions Nearing Peak Levels According to Glassnode, on the 30-day moving average, Bitcoin daily transactions have reached an amount of 348,700. While the peak level which was seen in 2017 remains at 379,000 transactions per day. This has proved Bitcoin’s daily transactions are beginning to near the all-time high last seen about 5 years ago. Furthermore, according to the Glassnode report, this surge in Bitcoin daily transactions is thanks to the Ordinal inscriptions. The Ordinal inscriptions also known as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or Ordinals, are inscriptions (digital artifacts) inscribed on satoshis (sats) – little units of Bitcoin. Glassnode noted the inscription accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of mined transactions and 10% to 20% of fees paid. Meanwhile, the remaining majority of transactions are monetary in nature, frequently conducted through exchanges.  According to Glassnode, compared to Ordinals activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC exchange activity is relatively low, representing roughly 30% of fees and transactions. The trend of creating inscriptions initially gained popularity in February when users started inscribing NFTs on satoshis. However, the recent resurgence has been dominated by inscriptions that are based on text. Glassnode noted: Bitcoin transaction counts, address activity, Inscriptions, and Mempool congestion are all elevated. As is the degree of HODLing, and supply acquired below $30k. Conviction remains. BTC Continues Downtrend Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to make any significant move in the past few days. Instead, it has only seemed to pick up from where it left off in its downward trend in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the top crypto has plummeted nearly 4% with a market price of $28,435, at the time of writing.  This downtrend follows a notable fall from the $30,000 region in recent weeks. So far, Bitcoin has a 24-hour range between a low of $28,315 and a high of $29,944. Meanwhile, the BTC market cap is still in the green while its trading volume signals selling pressure, indicating a possible continuous bearish trend.  Over the past week, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surged from a low of $528 billion on April 24 to as high as $550 billion as of today. Its trading volume has also spiked from a daily trading volume of $15.4 billion to $19.8 billion, over the same time period. Featured image from Unsplash, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The bearish trend a few days ago brought Chainlink (LINK) down to $6.735 on April 26. The bulls tried to recover and drove the price of LINK to a solid 24-hour high of $7.30, but it later fell to a 7-day low of $6.773. Due to the current FUD and increased regulatory pressure in the United States, Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price dropped below $29,000. But if the bulls build strong momentum, BTC may test $30k and climb higher, dragging the rest of the altcoin market, including LINK, with it. Will Bearish Trend Continue? As of the time of writing, the LINK market is still moving down, falling by 2.49% to $7.06. According to CoinMarketCap info, LINK&#8217;s market cap decreased by 3.11%, while its 24-hour trading volume rose by 30.83% during the downtrend.  Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying The increasing trading volume suggests a possible change in investors&#8217; sentiment for LINK. It indicates that network activities are increasing despite the downturn, which might push the LINK price to a rally.  However, if more traders attempt to sell their holdings, a market sell-off may occur, potentially adding to downward pressure on the price. Notably, due to the ongoing Spring 2023 hackathon, long-term holders stopped selling. This recent event might draw new network players and start a long-lasting bull movement. LINK Technical Analysis LINK has seen a few rejections at the supply zone of $7.50 in the past few days, which is also the primary resistance zone. On April 30, the LINK price hit the resistance zone and went down, which attracted the bears. Chainlink trades between support and resistance levels of $6.773 and $7.500. The first significant resistance level for LINK is $7.500. The following resistance zone is $8.831 if the price moves above this current zone. But if the bears build strong momentum, the next support will be $5.492.

If the bullish momentum doesn&#8217;t pick up, the trend may change to a potential bearish market.  The 50-day SMA established a Death Cross by crossing below the 200-day SMA, indicating a potentially bearish signal and suggesting a selling opportunity. At the time of analysis, the RSI is 40.86 below the neutral zone. Therefore, this shows that LINK is not in the overbought zone but seems to be heading toward the oversold zone.  The bears are aggressively pushing the price of LINK to the oversold zone while the bulls are still trying to hold the market, even though the momentum is weak. The MACD is currently trading below the signal line, showing bearish sentiment in the market. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>
