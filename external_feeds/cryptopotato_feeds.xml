            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">With Twitter <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-to-x-this-cryptocurrency-soars-1400-in-return/" data-wpel-link="internal">rebranding</a> to X and Elon Musk posting the Dogecoin logo in his bio, the price was quick to react.</p>
<p><strong>Key Support levels: $0.073</strong></p>
<p><strong>Key Resistance levels: $0.085</strong></p>
<h2>1. The Elon Musk Effect</h2>
<p>The price immediately took to the upside when the market saw that the richest man in the world was promoting DOGE in his bio. Moreover, Elon <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-to-x-this-cryptocurrency-soars-1400-in-return/" data-wpel-link="internal">plans</a> to turn Twitter or X into one of the largest payment systems, which might also include cryptocurrencies. With that in mind, DOGE is one of the prime candidates for such a roll-out.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262344" style="width: 1187px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262344" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon.jpg" alt="Elon Effect" width="1187" height="631" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon.jpg 1187w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-300x159.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-1024x544.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-768x408.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/elon-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1187px) 100vw, 1187px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262344" class="wp-caption-text">The Elon Effect</figcaption></figure>
<h2>2. Momentum Turns Bullish</h2>
<p>While most of the market is in red or trying to find support, DOGE entered a sustained uptrend. In the process, it turned the key resistance at $0.073 into support, and now the next target for this cryptocurrency will be found at $0.085.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262346" style="width: 1825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262346" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49.png" alt="DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49" width="1825" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49.png 1825w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-768x380.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-15-49-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1825px) 100vw, 1825px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262346" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>3. Sustained Buy Volume</h2>
<p>The anticipation of Twitter&#8217;s rebranding has led to many speculators taking a position in DOGE in the past two weeks. Buyers dominated the chart in July, and these levels of buy pressure were last seen back in April when DOGE made a local high at 10 cents.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262345" style="width: 1825px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262345" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42.png" alt="DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42" width="1825" height="902" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42.png 1825w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-300x148.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-1024x506.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-768x380.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-1536x759.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/DOGEUSDT_2023-07-25_10-28-42-50x25.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1825px) 100vw, 1825px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262345" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Bias</h2>
<p>The bias for DOGE is bullish.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Prediction for ADA Price</h2>
<p>With momentum picking up, DOGE might be able to reach its current target at $0.085. If that resistance will break as well, the road to 10 cents becomes clearer.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The recent correction of the cryptocurrency market seems to have caused panic among major investors, with some selling a chunk of their holdings.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Dumping Ethereum (ETH) appears to be the main trend, whereas some whales have also ditched their Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) possessions.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Decline&#8217;s Outcome</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1683677550567112704" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">revealed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> by Lookonchain, several cryptocurrency whales have recently dumped their stash &#8220;in panic&#8221; amid the recent correction of the digital asset market.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One Ethereum investor sold nearly 4,000 ETH for over $7.3 million when the token&#8217;s price stood at $1,846. Another dumped 7,115 ETH for $13.12 million. Currently, the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization trades slightly higher at over $1,855 (per CoinGecko&#8217;s data).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shortly after, an investor </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1683684848844832768" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">dumped</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> 16,751 ETH for almost $31 million. They then deposited the amount to the crypto exchange Binance and withdrew $30.8 million in USDT. The stash was later distributed to Aave and Compound through two addresses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The sell-off did not include only Ethereum. Whale &#8220;0x700b&#8221; parted with 150 WBTC at a selling price of $29,053, meaning the transaction was worth $4.36 million.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">While some argued that this was a wise move considering the market correction, others disagreed. Twitter user OxVivek </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/0x_Vivek/status/1683687699109269504" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">maintained</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that every downturn presents &#8220;potential opportunity for growth.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Unlike ETH and WBTC whales, major investors of XRP recently began an accumulation mode.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The renewed enthusiasm surrounding the asst seems to be fueled by Ripple&#8217;s triumph in the legal battle against the United Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Singapore, Singapore, July 25th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://labsgroup.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">LABS Group</a>, the frontrunner in blockchain-based real estate investment, is delighted to announce the successful distribution of dividends to early investors of the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort project based in Indonesia. This significant accomplishment underpins LABS Group&#8217;s commitment to rewarding its community members and cementing trust in the burgeoning world of decentralized real estate investing.</p>
<p>The Kunang Kunang Tent Resort, nestled in a coveted location famed for its natural beauty, has become a point of interest for avant-garde investors seeking unique real estate market opportunities. By adopting a novel approach and employing blockchain technology, LABS Group has transformed the way people invest in real estate, offering fractional ownership through tokenization.</p>
<p>Early investors of the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort have been vital to supporting this revolutionary project from its genesis. In recognition of their contributions and to share in the success of the project, LABS Group is thrilled to distribute dividends to these esteemed community members. Despite the delay in the resort&#8217;s completion due to COVID restrictions, it was successfully finalized in April 2022 and has since earned recognition in East Java.</p>
<p>Gravity Resorts, the hotel management team, remained undeterred despite temporary flight suspensions from Bali to Banyuwangi due to reduced travel volume. They have achieved impressive ratings across major platforms like <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/id/kunang-kunang-tent-resort.ms.html?label=Share-joF9O0%401688643925&amp;auth_success=1&amp;aid=356980" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Booking.com</a> (9.6), <a href="https://www.agoda.com/kunang-kunang-tent-resort/hotel/banyuwangi-id.html?cid=1844104" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Agoda</a> (9.3), and <a href="https://www.google.com.my/travel/hotels/entity/ChoI_YHAtvPJs7ydARoNL2cvMTFwejN4NTZqYhAB?utm_campaign=sharing&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=htls&amp;ved=0CAAQ5JsGahcKEwiQ_rj774OAAxUAAAAAHQAAAAAQAw&amp;ts=CAESABoECgIaACoECgAaAA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Google Review</a> (4.8/5). The resort managed an average occupancy rate of 68% in its first year and distributed dividends amounting to an approximate yield of 10%, demonstrating profitability despite a slow start.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our early investors have been instrumental in turning the vision of the Kunang Kunang Tent Resort into a reality,&#8221; said Bernard Lau, CEO of LABS Group. &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to reciprocate their trust and faith in our platform by distributing dividends that demonstrate the financial potential of blockchain-based real estate investments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>LABS Group ardently believes in the potency of decentralized finance to open new investment avenues for individuals worldwide. By harnessing blockchain technology, the platform presents a secure and transparent investment ecosystem, enabling individuals to partake in real estate projects once limited to a select few.</p>
<p>This achievement not only commemorates the dividend distribution but also accentuates the trust and credibility that LABS Group has cultivated within the community. As the real estate market continues to evolve, LABS Group remains at the cutting edge, pioneering the confluence of blockchain and real estate to conceive innovative investment opportunities and catalyze positive transformations.</p>
<p>As a token of appreciation and a way of giving back to its community, LABS Group is launching the Owner’s Circle NFT collection, which can be purchased with the LABS native token to gain the ability to receive rewards from profits generated from resort operations managed by LABS Group. The majority of net profits generated from property operations will be distributed equally amongst the Owner’s Circle members with the BNB token.</p>
<p>The proceeds received from the sale of the Owner’s Circle collection will be used to set up the Owner’s Fund, which will be used to invest in Real Estate related businesses to increase the pool of rewards which will be distributed on a monthly or annual basis depending on the type of property. With Kunang-Kunang as the pilot project, the purchasers will be seeing immediate value with proof of performance and an ever-growing portfolio of Real Estate projects which will be parked under the Owner’s Circle collection.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP has been making headlines for many months now, with the excitement mostly circling around the case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Earlier in July, Judge Analisa Torres <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.874.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ruled</a> that secondary sales of XRP do not constitute investment contracts. The news was widely perceived as positive, and the markets reacted immediately, with the cryptocurrency almost doubling in price.</p>
<p>And while the Commission has more or less confirmed that there will be an appeal, this doesn&#8217;t seem to discourage traders, especially now that many exchanges relisted XRP.</p>
<h2>XRP Becomes 2023&#8217;s Most Traded Altcoin</h2>
<p>Data from the analytics resource Kaiko <a href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1683513794536906752" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that XRP has taken the spot of the most-traded altcoin in 2023 so far.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262342" style="width: 1306px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262342" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko.jpg" alt="xrp_chart_kaiko" width="1306" height="708" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko.jpg 1306w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-300x163.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-1024x555.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-768x416.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/xrp_chart_kaiko-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1306px) 100vw, 1306px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262342" class="wp-caption-text">Source: Kaiko via Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p>Trailing behind it, albeit by a lot, are SOL, the popular meme coin DOGE, BNB, MATIC, and others. It&#8217;s highly likely that the surge in trading volume has resulted directly from Ripple&#8217;s partial win against the SEC following the most recent court ruling.</p>
<p>Many leading cryptocurrency exchanges <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-exchanges-that-delisted-xrp-following-the-ripple-sec-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">delisted</a> XRP back in 2020 when the Commission filed its lawsuit, essentially alleging that the altcoin fits the criteria of security. Once the court ruling was out, though, and it found that secondary sales of XRP didn&#8217;t constitute an investment contract, most of these re-listed the altcoin, prompting a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-breaks-another-2023-record-today-heres-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">massive surge</a> in trading volume and open interest.</p>
<p>The above was also clearly reflected in the comments of Max Sandy &#8211; Senior Product Manager at Ramp Network. When reached for his opinion last week, Sandy said:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been a booming week for XRP. According to Ramp Network data, XRP&#8217;s worldwide volume surged by an astonishing 1113% compared to the previous 90-day average. The number of users buying XRP through Ramp increased by 834% worldwide, while new users joining the XRP party skyrocketed by a remarkable 1,215% demonstrating an increased interest from both the old and new guard.</p></blockquote>
<p>The PM also said that XRP became the #1 most-purchased cryptocurrency in the UK on their platform.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next for XRP? Nexo CEO Antoni Trenchev Chips In</h2>
<p><em>CryptoPotato </em>reached out to Antony Trenchev for his thoughts as well. According to him, XRP&#8217;s increase has had a ripple effect on the market, but he also acknowledged that if we zoom out, reaching its previous all-time highs won&#8217;t be as straightforward.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look back over the past week, XRP has had a ripple effect on the market. Zooming out the battle for previous all time highs will not be a straight line. Further upward movement is conceivable if macro tailwinds work to crypto&#8217;s advantage coupled with a Bitcoin ETF approval. &#8211; Trenchev said.</p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_214536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214536" style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class=" wp-image-214536" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev.jpg" alt="Trenchev" width="389" height="259" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev.jpg 1200w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Trenchev-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 389px) 100vw, 389px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-214536" class="wp-caption-text">Antoni Trenchev, CEO at Nexo</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, many have pointed out BlackRock&#8217;s success rate in getting their ETF filings approved. It&#8217;s 575 to 1. That&#8217;s right, the asset management behemoth has only had one of its filings rejected.</p>
<p>Trenchev also noted that XRP has a devoted following in the East, while the recent court ruling has also had an effect on other cryptocurrencies as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the East, particularly Korea, XRP has a devoted following. In the west, meanwhile, the court ruling has been taken as a sign that the SEC’s most punitive enforcers have been reined in. Combined, these events have had a powerful effect not only on XRP, but on other cryptos. If this is the start of crypto’s alt season, it would be fitting that XRP would be the coin to lead the breakout.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been another wild ride in the meme coin market this week, with several ups and downs catching investors’ attention.</p>
<p>Dogecoin led the gains, surging 15% amid renewed interest, while the highly-anticipated Evil Pepe Coin presale hit the $730,000 mark.</p>
<p>On a less positive note, $PEPE witnessed an ongoing price decline, leading to rising investor skepticism about the token’s long-term potential.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Continues Rebound &amp; Soars 15%</h2>
<p>Meme coin legend Dogecoin ($DOGE) saw a double-digit price increase in the past week, surging 15% to hit the $0.077 level.</p>
<p>This continued Dogecoin&#8217;s steady uptrend from the lows of mid-June when the token was valued at just $0.058.</p>
<p>The price uptick seems to be driven by renewed interest and hype within the $DOGE community on social media.</p>
<p>For instance, the r/Dogecoin <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> has been flooded with speculation due to the recent bullish price trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262394" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-32-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Dogecoin’s price boost puts it back at number seven in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap’s</a> list of the world’s biggest cryptocurrencies, with the coin now boasting a market cap of $10.8 billion.</p>
<p>Moreover, with Dogecoin’s current momentum, some in the crypto community think the coin can continue even higher – potentially hitting the resistance level around $0.083.</p>
<p>With the hype building around $DOGE again, it&#8217;s undoubtedly a coin to watch this week.</p>
<h2>Evil Pepe Coin Raises $730,000 with Only 8 Days Remaining on Presale</h2>
<p>Another meme coin worth watching is the presale sensation <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Evil Pepe Coin ($EVILPEPE)</a>.</p>
<p>$EVILPEPE is one of the most hyped new meme coins on the market and has now raised a whopping $730,000 in its ongoing presale phase.</p>
<p>Although the presale was only launched a week ago, it has already attracted tremendous interest, with traders from around the world eager to participate.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262393" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="235" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30-300x117.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-30-50x20.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>However, with only eight days remaining in Evil Pepe Coin’s presale, prospective investors must move quickly to purchase $EVILPEPE tokens at the discounted price of $0.000333.</p>
<p>This low entry point could prove fruitful, given that $EVILPEPE benefits from its indirect association with the original $PEPE coin, which kickstarted the meme coin frenzy in April.</p>
<p>Moreover, the success of recent “2.0 coins”, essentially copycats of other high-profile tokens, has added credibility to Evil Pepe Coin’s strategy.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_evilpepe_35234?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">presale</a> nearing its end, investors have one final chance to get on board this high-potential meme coin on the ground floor.</p>
<h2>$PEPE’s Bearish Momentum Shows No Signs of Stopping</h2>
<p>While Evil Pepe Coin is showing bullish momentum, the original Pepe ($PEPE) is continuing its bearish trend, with price down 17% over the past week.</p>
<p>$PEPE is now trading around the $0.0000013 level – the same as in mid-June.</p>
<p>Most of the gains made throughout the last week of June and early July have now been erased, leaving $PEPE holders discouraged.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262391" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="287" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24-300x143.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-24-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This extended slump suggests the hype and momentum around $PEPE may be drying up.</p>
<p>The meme coin shot up by over 10,000% when it hit the market in April but has struggled to maintain its value since then.</p>
<p>One of the main issues plaguing $PEPE is its lack of long-term utility, presenting a challenge for crypto investors to justify holding it.</p>
<p>However, with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko</a> data showing that the 24-hour $PEPE trading volume exceeded $109 million, there may still be some interest in the coin – offering a silver lining to bulls.</p>
<h2>Trending Token Wall Street Memes Enters Final Stages of Presale with $17.5m Raised</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> has been one of the breakout stars in the meme coin space this year, with the project’s presale having raised an incredible $17.5 million – and counting.</p>
<p>As its name implies, Wall Street Memes draws inspiration from the WallStreetBets subreddit, which changed meme culture forever.</p>
<p>However, Wall Street Memes has its own online community of 1.1 million &#8220;degens&#8221; spread across platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstmemes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wallstbets/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262390" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="300" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-8-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The power that this community wields is evidenced by Wall Street Memes’ huge presale raise, with $WSM now gearing up for exchange listings in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This early momentum hints that Wall Street Memes could have enormous price potential once it makes its open market debut.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=5-meme-coin-stories-to-watch-this-week-dogecoin-surges-15-following-twitter-rebrand-pepe-coin-price-slides-but-evil-pepe-coin-raises-730000" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">presale</a> now in Stage 25 out of 30, prospective investors only have a narrow window to buy $WSM at the price of $0.0322.</p>
<h2>AI-X Coin Sees Huge Spike in Trading Volume</h2>
<p>Lastly, the newly-launched meme coin <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ai-x/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AI-X ($X)</a> is a trending project capitalizing on the excitement around artificial intelligence and Elon Musk.</p>
<p>This ERC-20 token brands itself as “Musk’s favorite” and aims to fund advancements in AI technology.</p>
<p>Boasting no transaction fees and a burned liquidity pool, $X offers deflationary tokenomics designed to help foster sustained price growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262389" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="602" height="336" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-5-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Adding to the token&#8217;s hype is that Elon Musk has just decided to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/twitter-musk-logo-idTRNIKBN2Z40CP" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">rebrand</a> Twitter as “X” – getting rid of the platform’s iconic blue logo.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this has boosted the momentum around the AI-X token, given that it has the ticker symbol $X.</p>
<p>With price up 1,400% over the past day, the AI-X community is capitalizing on this stroke of fortune, making it a token worth watching closely in the coming days.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The total crypto market cap is down by $40 billion in a day.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After failing to remain above $30,000, bitcoin took another turn for the worse and dumped to a new monthly low of just below $29,000.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are bleeding out just as badly, if not worse, with XRP, SOL, BCH, and a few others dumping by more than 5% in a day.</p>
<h2>BTC Sees Monthly Low</h2>
<p>Bitcoin registered its most impressive price surge two weeks ago when Ripple won a minor victory in court against the SEC. Along with the rest of the market, BTC soared to a multi-month peak at just under $32,000.</p>
<p>However, the hype began to fade quickly, and the cryptocurrency fell back down to just over $30,000 in the next few days. Stagnation followed, and BTC remained mostly around that level, with a few dips below it.</p>
<p>The landscape changed for the worse yesterday when bitcoin plummeted by more than a grand after it was rejected at $30,300. This price drop drove it south to a monthly low at just under $29,000, leaving <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/150-million-in-liquidations-as-btc-dumps-to-monthly-lows/" data-wpel-link="internal">millions of liquidations</a>.</p>
<p>BTC has managed to add a few hundred dollars since then, but its market capitalization is back down to $565 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins sits tight at 48.5%.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262361" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD-21.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262361" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD-21.png" alt="BTCUSD.

<h2>Alts Bleed Out</h2>
<p>The alternative coins have also seen better days as the past few brought nothing but pain for the bulls. Ethereum stood above $2,000 amid the Ripple-driven hype but is now back down to $1,850 following another minor daily decline.</p>
<p>Binance Coin, Tron, Polygon, Litecoin, Polkadot, TONCOIN, and Shiba Inu have charted similar daily drops. Even more painful losses come from the likes of Ripple, Solana, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, NEAR Protocol, Aptos, and others. All of them are down by more than 5% daily.</p>
<p>Dogecoin is the only larger-cap alt in the green today, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doge-defies-market-sentiment-with-7-surge-btc-remains-under-30k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">similar to yesterday</a>, perhaps driven by the DOGE payment speculations at Twitter.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[A bold move previously attempted by Coinbase and Bittrex will now be undertaken by Binance too.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Binance’s legal team filed a motion in an Illinois district court yesterday evening, notifying the judge presiding over the case that two separate requests to dismiss charges against Binance and CZ will be served on the 27th of July.</p>
<h2>Joint Motion, Along With One for Former Compliance Officer</h2>
<p>Although a single joint motion will be filed to dismiss charges against CZ and Binance, respectively, another one will also be submitted on behalf of former compliance officer Samuel Lim. However, certain parts of the CZ &amp; Binance joint motion will also serve as part of Lim’s defense.</p>
<p>Prior to the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767/gov.uscourts.ilnd.431767.53.0_1.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">notice of intent</a>, Binance’s legal defense team notified the CFTC of their intent off the record. In turn, the agency authorized Binance’s legal team to state that they are not in opposition to the request being filed.</p>
<p>Binance’s request is the third of its kind in the crypto industry over the past month, with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bittrex-mirrors-coinbase-requests-sec-lawsuit-dismissal/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase and Bittrex</a> attempting the same strategy. So far, the court has not ruled on either request.</p>
<h2>Request to Exceed Document Page Limit</h2>
<p>Aside from notifying the CFTC of the intent, Binance’s lawyers have also requested an exemption from the 15-page limit usually enacted for requests of this sort.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/binance-and-ceo-zhao-to-seek-dismissal-of-cftc-lawsuit" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to Bloomberg, the exemption was requested due to the complexity and length of the CFTC’s complaint – which spread out over 73 pages and 236 paragraphs. In order to accurately respond to all allegations brought against the defendants, more than 15 pages will be needed.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Defendants endeavored to comply with the page limit of Local Rule 7.1. But given the complexity of the CFTC’s Complaint and the number of arguments Defendants anticipate making in support of their Motions to Dismiss, Defendants anticipate that their Memoranda of Law in support of the two motions will exceed the fifteen-page limits. Accordingly, Defendants respectfully request an expansion of the page limit allowed[…].”</p></blockquote>
<p>Should the request be granted, the length of the defense motion would stretch to 50 pages – which is still 25 shorter than the laundry list of accusations brought against the defendants.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the CFTC lawsuit will be overruled by the court in response to Binance’s actions. If the motion goes through, it would still leave the exchange to contend with a separate lawsuit filed against them in early June by the SEC and an investigation by the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">DOJ</a> for allegedly failing to comply with government-imposed sanctions on Russian markets.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Institutional investors are getting cold feet on crypto again as fund flows flip to negative and market volatility and liquidity decline.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Digital asset investment products have returned to negative territory following four weeks of solid inflows.</p>
<p>According to asset manager CoinShares, there was a total outflow of $6.5 million from crypto funds last week, reversing the trend of inflows.</p>
<p>However, the outflow is minor compared to the prior four weeks, which totaled $742 million of inflows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Pro Investors Switch to ETH Funds</h2>
<p>Bitcoin saw the lion’s share of outflows, with $13 million leaving such funds and products. Furthermore, short BTC investment products saw outflows for the 13th consecutive week totaling $5.5 million.</p>
<p>The paper also showed a slump in trading volumes last week. They were below the year-weekly average at $1.2 billion, less than half of the $2.4 billion in volume the previous week.</p>
<p>The negative sentiment was primarily focused on the North American market as the regulatory war on crypto continues.</p>
<p>However, the news was not all bad in the world of institutional investment. Professional traders have flipped from Bitcoin to Ethereum, with ETH-based funds seeing an inflow of $6.6 million for the week.</p>
<p>This “suggests sentiment, which has been poor this year, is slowly beginning to turn around,” noted CoinShares.</p>
<p>Ripple-related funds also saw $2.6 million of inflows due to the firm’s recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-boss-brad-garlinghouse-lambastes-sec-for-creating-this-mess/" data-wpel-link="internal">partial victory</a> against the SEC and XRP prices getting a major boost.</p>
<p>Solana, Uniswap, and Polygon saw inflows totaling $1.1 million, $0.7 million, and $0.7 million, respectively, the report revealed.</p>
<p>The overall picture could be a signal that sentiment is about to switch back to negative, however. Previously low weeks of institutional flows following larger ones have led to trend reversals.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Lethargy Continues</h2>
<p>Crypto market volatility, volumes, and liquidity are at multi-year lows as asset prices remain stagnant.</p>
<p>The total market cap has dropped a further 1.4% on the day to $1.21 trillion, but it remains within its tight multi-monthly range.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin prices</a> have dipped 2.3% as the asset tumbles towards $29,000 and sentiment weakens. The asset currently trades at its lowest level in over a month.</p>
<p>Ethereum is moving in its shadow with a 1.2% slide to $1,847 at the time of writing. The rest of the altcoins are a sea of red aside from <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/doge-defies-market-sentiment-with-7-surge-btc-remains-under-30k-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogecoin</a>, which is up 9% on the day.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Although SBF agreed to refrain from making comments that could influence the trial, his legal team requested that the other side play by the same rules.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial draws ever closer, the prosecution has taken action to prevent him from tampering with witnesses in the case by attempting to influence them one way or another.</p>
<h2>SBF Suspected of Ellison Leak</h2>
<p>The moment FTX collapsed, Sam Bankman-Fried started an “apology tour,” telling various reporters and government representatives that he hadn’t done anything wrong and making excuses for the mismanagement of his former empire.</p>
<p>It all concluded in a whiny yet trite <a href="https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">substack</a> post explaining how FTX had actually been solvent until John J Ray III took over. His arrest followed soon after.</p>
<p>Although SBF has already been barred from directly interacting with witnesses, following his attempts to reach out to Ray and several former FTX employees, the prosecution suspects that he is still attempting to manipulate public opinion of key witnesses, something that could be very helpful for him in a jury trial.</p>
<p>Last week, an anonymous source <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/caroline-ellison-felt-unsuited-to-run-alameda-amid-sbf-relationship-drama/" data-wpel-link="internal">leaked</a> Caroline Ellison’s private diary to the media. Despite the purported anonymity, U.S. government representatives strongly believe the leaker responsible for the New York Times <a href="https://archive.is/9qLjF" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">story</a> to be none other than SBF himself, given the circumstances.</p>
<p>As a result, the prosecution sought a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">gag order</a> for SBF in order to prevent further shenanigans.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In addition to tainting the jury pool, the effect, if not the intent, of the defendant’s conduct is not only to harass Ellison but also to deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying. As the Government prepares for trial, a common refrain from witnesses’ attorneys […] is witness hesitation about testifying in a case that has received persistent national and international media attention.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>SBF Accepts, Requests One of His Own</h2>
<p>Responding to the request, SBF’s legal team accepted the gag order instead of fighting it in court.</p>
<p>However, his legal team also <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.178.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">requested</a> that a similar one be placed on John J Ray III, on the prosecution, and on various other potential sources. The rationale behind this request is that the jury might be unduly influenced by reading about SBF’s exploits in the press. Ray is specifically mentioned as targeting SBF with ad hominem attacks.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mr. Ray’s repeated ad hominem attacks on Mr. Bankman-Fried—which have very little do with his role recovering assets for FTX creditors and seem more directed towards publicly vilifying Mr. Bankman-Fried—have, along with other negative coverage, created a toxic media environment that has left Mr. Bankman-Fried with little choice but to respond.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The irony of the situation is that Bankman-Fried did a very good job of vilifying himself before he was arrested, whether out of genuine belief or due to an obviously faulty strategy.</p>
<p>It’s doubtful that Judge Kaplan will rule in favor of the return gag order request. Even if he were to do so, SBF’s alleged misdeeds have already been extensively covered by various reputable journalistic institutes.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Russia’s digital ruble pilot begins August 1, and will be completely optional to use.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world’s largest country by landmass is set to roll out a digital ruble next week after Russian President Vladimir Putin greenlighted the project on Thursday.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/document/0001202307240009?index=1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">text of the bill</a> amends Russia’s Civil Code to allow the digital ruble to be used for payments, while empowering Russia’s central bank to let real citizens use the currency starting August 1.</li>
<li>Accounts for the digital ruble will be managed directly by the central bank, rather than commercial banks.<br />
In a <a href="https://ria.ru/20230721/rubl-1885538360.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a> shared by Russian media central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina clarified that the use of the currency is purely optional.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“We really hope that it will be more convenient, and cheaper for both people and businesses, and they will start using it,” she said. “This is a new opportunity.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The Russian government first began exploring the digital ruble in October 2020, and began piloting the system with Russian banks in February 2022. Two weeks ago, the State Duma <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/russias-state-duma-approvea-national-cbdc-project/" data-wpel-link="internal">approved</a> the new law that will allow the currency’s use by individuals.</li>
<li>The currency will be programmable to implement certain transaction limits, and restrictions on what citizens can spend their money on.</li>
<li>While Western nations like the United States and Canada are merely exploring CBDCs, critical politicians in each country have blasted the concept for exactly this feature.</li>
<li>In March, Florida Governor Ron De Santis <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-says-governor-ron-desantis/" data-wpel-link="internal">called</a> CBDCs a tool for “surveilling Americans, and controlling behavior of Americans.”</li>
<li>By contrast, Putin and the Russian parliament have already banned the use of private cryptocurrencies for payments within the country, only <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bank-of-russia-to-greenlight-cross-border-payments-with-crypto-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">approving</a> their use for cross-border trade.</li>
</ul>
