					<description><![CDATA[If historical Bitcoin price performance leads, one trader is adamant that the coin is at a critical inflection point at spot rates. Based on astronomical patterns and moon arrangement, trading desk QCP Capital believes Bitcoin prices can swing higher in a bull run towards the $33,000 to $35,000 level, reversing following sharp losses in 2022. Conversely, after a recovery that has seen Bitcoin price rally 20% from mid-June 2023, there can be a contraction that may see the coin dip after an impressive performance in the past few trading weeks. Supermoons Coincide With Key Bitcoin Price Reversals Based on technical and fundamental actions, the trading desk cited the past performance of Bitcoin at different cyclical stages. For instance, when Bitcoin fell in the early days of 2020, primarily due to fears of the far-reaching consequences of lockdowns brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, it posted a 161% rally from early March to May 2020. The same was observed from mid-June to August 2022 when Bitcoin, at the depth of the last cyclical bear market, prices soared 43%. Marking peaks, Bitcoin corrected from the end of April to June 2021, falling 51% in a predominantly bullish market. According to the trading desk, major reversals in bearish and bullish runs occurred during a &#8220;supermoon.&#8221; In astrology, a supermoon is a full moon that forms when the moon is at its closest point to the Earth in its elliptical orbit. The moon appears brighter than usual during this time and happens only once or twice a year. A supermoon formed on July 4, and the trader believes Bitcoin is at a critical reaction point. Related Reading: AAVE Records 26% Weekly Gain, Looks To Break Key Resistance For years, there has been a belief that supermoons correlate with bullish markets. However, no scientific findings support this, and neither have statistical correlations. Still, based on the trader&#8217;s analysis, the multiple correlations and timing of peaks and bottoms of Bitcoin prices during supermoons can be used to predict BTC markets. Will Prices Rally Or Dump? While it is yet to be seen whether BTC will edge higher, breaking above $31,300 and rally towards the $35,000 zone, the trading desk says fundamental factors will play a critical role and remains bullish that BTC may rally to within the $33,000 to $35,000 liquidation zone. Overall, monitoring how the Federal Reserve of the United States will implement its monetary policies will be necessary in the future. Although inflation has been dropping, the trader observes that it has not fallen low enough to warrant a rate cut. Rate cuts tend to move the capital to store-of-value assets from which Bitcoin will likely benefit.  Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why On a more pessimistic side, the trading desk expresses caution saying BTC has strong resistance at spot levels since the recent leg up was most likely the fifth and the last wave from November 2022 lows. At the same time, the $33,000 to $35,000 resistance zone is a critical resistance trend line. For this reason, any dump may see BTC retest the $24,000 and $26,000 support zone.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu community continues to mark new milestones with its testnet, Shibarium, as a steady surge of users links their crypto wallets to the network. Shibarium&#8217;s testnet, also known as Puppynet, launched on March 11 and has seen an increase in overall transaction count over the past 24 hours. Shibarium added almost a million transactions in a single day, catapulting past the 27 million mark and setting a new record. On June 13, a peak of 324,000 transactions was recorded, after which it slightly decreased over the following days. However, since June 19, the daily transactions have hovered around the 274,000 mark. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Records Surge In Daily New Addresses In Q2: A Sign Of Growing Interest? Consistent Growth In Wallet Links And Blocks Alongside transaction growth, the number of wallets linked to Shibarium continues to rise, albeit slower, according to Puppyscan data. The current count of linked wallets is over 17 million, with no substantial spikes recorded recently. The total blocks have increased to surpass 1.56 million, and the time required to create a new block has been reduced to 8.3 seconds. Notably, the community anticipates the official launch of Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet, with excitement fueled by a statement from the lead developer of Shiba Inu and Shibarium, the elusive Shytoshi Kusama. The developer informed the SHIB army about the planned &#8220;launch strategy&#8221; for Shibarium, noting that the date and time have been confirmed. The community speculates that the Shibarium mainnet could be launched between August 13 and 16 in Toronto, Canada, during the annual ETHToronto event. This event celebrates the creation of Ethereum, and given SHIB&#8217;s original launch on this blockchain, the community believes it would serve as a fitting tribute to Ethereum and its founder, Vitalik Buterin. Awaiting The Launch Of Shibarium Mainnet Kusama recently dropped a hint in a Telegram channel solely for Shibarium discussions, possibly confirming the theory regarding the mainnet&#8217;s launch date and location. Before this, he disclosed that Shiba Inu was &#8220;going somewhere&#8221; and clarified that this location would be outside the United States.

The dog-themed meme coin has declined by nearly 4% and is currently trading for $0.00000745 at the time of writing. However, over the past week, SHIB&#8217;s market capitalization has surged by $200 million. The asset&#8217;s trading volume has also recorded a slight surge in the past week from $100 million seen last Wednesday to $117 million in the past 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[The total Bitcoin Options open interest, the number of open call and put orders, recently rose to $14.87 billion on June 30 before falling to $10.74 billion on July 4, on-chain data on July 5 shows. Related Reading: Valkyrie Follows In BlackRock’s Footsteps, Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF At $14.87 billion, the total number of Bitcoin Options open interest at top trading platforms, mostly Deribit, CME, and OKX, stood at near all-time highs registered in October 2021 when prices went on to rally, printing all-time highs of over $69,000. On October 21, the total Bitcoin open interest stood at $15.06 billion, a record high that has never been broken. BTC Options At Near 2021 Peaks Many traders seem optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, as open interest remains high and trending near the peak levels of October 2021. With a strong close to the first half of 2023, the expectation is for prices to continue rising. The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching new highs in June 2023 at $31,300, could be seen as a sign of overall bullishness, similar to the period before prices reached over $69,000 in November 2021. This skew and apparent optimism can be shown by the distribution of &#8220;call&#8221; and &#8220;put&#8221; Bitcoin options across major crypto derivatives trading platforms of which Deribit dominates. For instance, as of July 5, over 65% of all Bitcoin options orders are &#8220;calls,&#8221; meaning more traders expect prices to rise from spot rates. At this level, roughly 206,000 BTC orders are placed as &#8220;calls.&#8221;  Meanwhile, a minority of traders expect price contracts from spot rates towards $28,300 or lower in the coming months. About 99,000 BTC options have been placed as &#8220;puts&#8221; to align with traders&#8217; expectations of worse prices in the coming months. Bitcoin Traders Bullish The same can be observed in trading patterns over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin prices falling 2% but staying above the $30,000 psychological level, most options traders are bullish since there are more &#8220;calls&#8221; than &#8220;puts.&#8221;  Typically, Options give the contract holder the right or the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed price on or before the expiry date. Mostly, options contracted are used by traders to mitigate risks. More &#8220;calls&#8221; could mean more BTC traders are optimistic, expecting the coin to clear recent resistance levels.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The total Bitcoin Options open interest, the number of open call and put orders, recently rose to $14.87 billion on June 30 before falling to $10.74 billion on July 4, on-chain <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coinglass.com/options" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data</a> on July 5 shows.</p>

<p>At $14.87 billion, the total number of Bitcoin Options open interest at top trading platforms, mostly Deribit, CME, and OKX, stood at near all-time highs registered in October 2021 when prices went on to rally, printing all-time highs of over $69,000. </p>
<p>On October 21, the total Bitcoin open interest stood at $15.06 billion, a record high that has never been broken.</p>
<h2>BTC Options At Near 2021 Peaks</h2>
<p>Many traders seem optimistic about the future of Bitcoin, as open interest remains high and trending near the peak levels of October 2021. With a strong close to the first half of 2023, the expectation is for prices to continue rising.</p>
<p>The recent surge in Bitcoin prices, reaching new highs in June 2023 at $31,300, could be seen as a sign of overall bullishness, similar to the period before prices reached over $69,000 in November 2021.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/5AlO6jcF/" rel="nofollow"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/5AlO6jcF/" alt="BTC price on July 5| Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" width="1226" height="595"/></a>
<p>This skew and apparent optimism can be shown by the distribution of &#8220;call&#8221; and &#8220;put&#8221; Bitcoin options across major crypto derivatives trading platforms of which Deribit dominates. For instance, as of July 5, over 65% of all Bitcoin options orders are &#8220;calls,&#8221; meaning more traders expect prices to rise from spot rates. At this level, roughly 206,000 BTC orders are placed as &#8220;calls.&#8221; </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a minority of traders expect price contracts from spot rates towards $28,300 or lower in the coming months. About 99,000 BTC options have been placed as &#8220;puts&#8221; to align with traders&#8217; expectations of worse prices in the coming months.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Traders Bullish</h2>
<p>The same can be observed in trading patterns over the past 24 hours. Despite Bitcoin prices falling 2% but staying above the $30,000 psychological level, most options traders are bullish since there are more &#8220;calls&#8221; than &#8220;puts.&#8221; </p>
<p>Typically, Options give the contract holder the right or the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at an agreed price on or before the expiry date. Mostly, options contracted are used by traders to mitigate risks. More &#8220;calls&#8221; could mean more BTC traders are optimistic, expecting the coin to clear recent resistance levels.</p>
<p>Based on recent trends, Options trading volumes have been decreasing on Deribit. After peaking at $3.29 billion on October 16, 2021, participation levels have been shrinking over the past 20 months. </p>

<p>Trading was suppressed throughout 2022 during the bear market, which saw Bitcoin drop below $16,000 in November 2022. Since then, Options trading volumes rose, peaking at over $2.3 billion in March 2023. It has since dropped below the $1 billion level when writing on July 5.  </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano is one of the most prominent proof of stake (POS) blockchains that requires users to stake their native tokens, ADA, to confirm and secure transactions on the network. Over time, the network has held the record for the largest percentage of its token supply staked. And once again, the blockchain has solidified its position in this regard as it reaches a new high for the total amount of ADA staked in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Cardano Token TVL Reaches New All-Time High Back in September 2021, Cardano saw the completion of the Alonzo hard fork upgrade, an update that brought smart contracts capability to the network. What this meant was that developers could now build decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain, finally bringing the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector to Cardano. Related Reading: Ethereum Eyes $2,000 As Crypto Market Shakes Off SEC Woes Since then, there has been a steady rise in the number of DeFi protocols being built on the blockchain. And as developers have flocked to the network, investors have followed suit, leading to a rapid rise in the number of staked ADA as users invested in various protocols. Although there were dips along the way, especially in the crypto winter of 2022, the tide has turned in 2023 and the number of staked ADA has now hit a new high. According to data from DeFiLlama, the total number of ADA staked on the network reached 560.7 million on Tuesday, July 4, a new all-time high. Total ADA staked in DeFi protocols reaches ATH &#124; Source: DeFiLlama However, the new milestone is only reflected in the number of ADA staked and not in the total valued locked (TVL) in dollar terms. DeFiLlama shows that the current dollar equivalent of $161.82 million is still 50% below its March 2022 all-time high of $316.36 million. How Will ADA Price Respond? Like the altcoins in the crypto market, the price of ADA has responded closely to the movement of Bitcoin. As a result, over the last day, the digital asset has recorded a decline in its price. This is happening despite the latest TVL milestone. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Records Accelerated Burn Rate, But Price Fails To Respond This decline suggests that the price of ADA is not reacting positively to the new all-time high in Cardano TVL, meaning it remains isolated at this point. However, it could point to a bullish movement further out as the DeFi interest in the blockchain continues to grow. Currently, ADA is trading at a price of $0.28 which translates to a 3.30% decline in the last 24 hours. But on the 7-day chart, the altcoin is still seeing gains of around 5%. If the general market rallies again, then ADA is likely to retest the $0.3 resistance.

					<description><![CDATA[StarkWare, an Israeli-based company working to scale Ethereum (ETH), has released the testnet for its latest layer-2 solution, Starknet v12.0. The new version focuses on improving performance and user experience, with a significant 10x increase in throughput achieved through the implementation of the Sequencer in Rust.  Starknet Upgrade Signals Boost for Ethereum&#8217;s Scalability According to the company’s blog post, the Sequencer has been optimized with the help of LambdaClass, resulting in a smoother user experience by removing the PENDING status for transactions. A new syscall has also been introduced to retrieve past block hashes easily.  Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Will Reach $100, Here’s Why Furthermore, the new version of Starknet supports a new Cairo syntax that focuses on safety. This means that the new syntax is designed to make it easier for developers to write secure smart contracts that are less prone to errors and vulnerabilities. The network upgrade to Starknet v12.0 will undergo a community vote, ensuring widespread participation and input. The community will have the opportunity to shape the future of Starknet, and the upgrade protocol for breaking changes includes a six-month window in which contracts compiled with the older compiler version (v1.1.0) will still be accepted. Starknet’s vision is to achieve substantial scalability in scale and cost, with the next priority being reducing transaction costs. The long-term goal is to provide a scalable, flexible, cost-effective infrastructure for decentralized applications. The upcoming vote for Starknet Alpha V0.12.0 will allow the community to examine and test the upgraded version before approving it for Mainnet deployment. Everyone is invited to participate in the proposal and vote on whether to upgrade Starknet Mainnet accordingly. Starknet empowers developers to code solutions that make a difference, and the new version allows developers to start their Cairo development journey. With the Cairo docs, Cairo Basecamp, and tutorials, developers can stay up to date with all version updates by signing up for the Starknet Developers Newsletter. The release of Starknet Alpha V0.12.0 represents a significant milestone for StarkWare and Ethereum, with the layer-2 solution&#8217;s focus on performance and user experience promising to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs for decentralized applications. Ethereum Prices Surge, But Network Activity Shows No Significant Boost According to recent data from Glassnode, despite the recent rise in Ethereum prices, network activity has not experienced a significant boost, with gas prices remaining relatively low. This contrasts the situation during the Shanghai upgrade in April, which preceded a similar rally in ETH markets, where gas prices rose by 78%. Gas prices on the Ethereum network measure the cost of executing smart contracts and transactions. When demand for transaction processing exceeds the available network capacity, gas prices rise as users compete to process their transactions more quickly. This often happens during high network activity periods, such as upgrades and market rallies. Related Reading: Valkyrie Follows In BlackRock’s Footsteps, Refiles For Spot Bitcoin ETF However, the recent rally in Ethereum prices does not seem to have led to a significant increase in network activity, as gas prices have remained relatively stable.  This could be due to several factors, such as that the current rally is driven more by institutional investors and DeFi protocols rather than individual users. Additionally, there may be more network capacity available now than during the Shanghai upgrade, which could be helping to keep gas prices in check. Despite the low gas prices, there are still signs of growth and development within the Ethereum ecosystem. The recent release of the Starknet v12.0 testnet by StarkWare, for example, is a significant milestone for Ethereum, as it promises to enhance scalability and reduce transaction costs for decentralized applications built on the network. ETH is trading at $1,900, following the steps of Bitcoin, and has decreased by 1.8% in the last 24 hours. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In recent months, the crypto markets have witnessed significant turbulence leading to the lowest quarterly trade volume since 2020. Amid varying economic factors, a bearish perception of investors toward cryptocurrencies and the broader economic climate reflects a dynamic yet challenging landscape. Kaiko, a crypto market data provider, shed light on this development alongside various key industry trends. Despite the lowered trade volumes, the crypto industry concluded the quarter positively, demonstrating resilience. Challenges Faced By TrueUSD And Impact On Crypto Market Prime Trust, the crypto custodian of TrueUSD (TUSD), has encountered financial difficulties, placing the stablecoin under scrutiny. The custodian&#8217;s financial shortfall, amounting to approximately $82 million, led to significant challenges, with customers unable to execute withdrawals. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap Poised For Breakout: Analyst Predict 23% Upside Potential The challenges also included considerable sales pressure on TrueUSD on decentralized exchanges after the disclosure that True USD&#8217;s present auditing firm is a restructured version of FTX&#8217;s auditor. However, despite the selling pressure on decentralized exchanges, the price of TUSD remained around $0.999. Kaiko revealed that the potential liquidation of Prime Trust&#8217;s holdings could significantly impact the token&#8217;s price due to the holdings&#8217; scale.  Mixed Performances And Emerging Trends In the realm of performance, the second quarter witnessed a drop in the open interest for altcoins. Layer 2 tokens, which had initially reported gains in the first quarter, experienced a reduction ranging from 20% to 40% during Q2, according to Kaiko. On the flip side, DeFi tokens wrapped up the quarter marking a decline of 8%, yet picked up steam in June, largely fueled by the rise of tokens like MakerDAO&#8217;s MKR and Compound&#8217;s COMP. COMP experienced a boost of over 50% as large-scale investors in Binance intensified their purchasing activities. Kaiko further revealed that the Korean won (KRW)-denominated trade volume surpassed USD in the quarter&#8217;s final week, primarily spurred by WAVES and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The spike in volume was largely attributed to WAVES&#8217; price jump after securing support from DWF Labs, while Bitcoin Cash (BCH) saw a massive rise following its listing on EDX Markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Up 55% Following BlackRock’s ETF Application, EDX Markets Launch Meanwhile, EUR-denominated volume on centralized exchanges recorded a two-year low since the crypto bull run in late 2020. This trend indicates a shift in European market sentiment, adding to the quarter&#8217;s varied developments. Regardless, the crypto market has shown recovery from its bloodbath last year. Over the last 7 months, the crypto market has grown compared to the bearish trend seen all through 2022. Both small caps and Larger crypto assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have broken multiple resistance surpassing important levels. Bitcoin has recently traded above $31,000 before retracing below $30,427 at the time of writing. Ethereum, on the other hand, has also surged and trades above the $1,900 mark and now looking to break past the $2,000 region. Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The dream of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US is still yet to become a reality as various investment firms continue to seek approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) despite multiple rejections. In a recent turn of events, Valkyrie, an alternative asset management company specializing in the emerging cryptocurrency sector, refiled its application for a Spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund. Valkyrie Takes Another Swing At Bitcoin ETF Approval In a new 19b-4 form submitted by the Tennessee-based firm, the latest Bitcoin ETF filing includes some key differences that may improve its chances of approval by the SEC.

For starters, Valkyrie mentions it is now bringing on Coinbase as a partner for market surveillance in support of the fund. The company also mentions that Coinbase had &#8220;executed a term sheet with Nasdaq&#8221; to &#8220;enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement.” Given that Coinbase is the largest cryptocurrency exchange based in the United States, Valkyrie&#8217;s partnership with Coinbase is most likely going to increase the likelihood that the application will be approved. Valkyrie is, however, not new to the BTC business, as the company is majorly focused on bridging the gap between traditional finance and the rapidly evolving digital asset industry. In 2022, the company received approval from the SEC for its Bitcoin Futures Fund.  In 2021, Valkyrie filed for a Spot Bitcoin ETF, but it was outrightly rejected by the SEC for the reason of being too risky for investors for various reasons such as market manipulation.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin is up 5% during the past week, but data from Santiment reveals that social media talk around the asset still continues to be low. Interest In Dogecoin Remains Low Despite Surge In Price According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, there haven&#8217;t been many discussions around DOGE on social media recently. The relevant indicator here is &#8220;social dominance,&#8221; which tells us about the percentage of the total discussions happening on social media platforms related to the top 100 assets (by market cap) that involve the topic of Dogecoin. When the value of this metric is high, it means that the DOGE-related talks currently make up a significant part of the discussions involving the wider cryptocurrency market. Such a trend is usually a sign that the interest in the asset is high among the general investor. On the other hand, low values imply that social media users aren&#8217;t talking that much about the meme coin. Naturally, this kind of trend suggests that there is no excitement around the coin in the market at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in Dogecoin&#8217;s social dominance over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has been relatively low in recent days &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the Dogecoin social dominance has been quite low during the past month. Currently, the indicator&#8217;s value is around 1.4%, which means that DOGE-related discussions make up for just 1.4% of all talks related to the top 100 assets. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? These recent low values of the metric are particularly notable as the meme coin has observed an increase of about 5% during the last week or so. It would appear that despite this rise, interest in the cryptocurrency hasn&#8217;t particularly shifted one way or the other. In the chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another indicator: the &#8220;Binance funding rate.&#8221; This metric keeps track of the periodic fee that Dogecoin futures traders are exchanging with each other on the Binance platform. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that this indicator became quite negative a while back, implying that a large number of short contracts piled up. Before long, however, the metric turned back positive as the price observed its latest rally. This timing would suggest that a &#8220;short squeeze&#8221; might have helped with the recent price growth. A short squeeze is an event where a mass liquidation of short contracts takes place at once and ends up providing fuel for an upward price move. Even though this was the largest short squeeze of 2023, it would appear that social media users have remained uninterested in the asset. This may not be all bad for Dogecoin, though, as excessive social media hype usually ends up in a top formation for the meme coin.

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has recorded progressive gains in the past week, with its 7-day high at 15.95%. It is currently trading at $18.73 today with slight gains on its price. Although SOL is still 92.61% below its all-time high value of $260, its recent gains in the past week have pushed its price closer to the $20 price level.  SOL Price Outlook This Week Suggests A Bearish Trend SOL is in a sideways trend this week, following positive price action in the last two weeks. It has formed a small red candle on the weekly chart implying that the bears are active this week. Also, SOL is still trading in the lower region of the Donchian Channel (DC), expressing a bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Humpback Wallets Reach ATH, Is BlackRock Behind The Surge? Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 45.60 in the neutral zone between the oversold region of 30 and the overbought region of 70. The RSI indicator reflects the sideways trend this week. SOL&#8217;s Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is slightly above its signal line and shows convergence which is a bearish signal.  Although the MACD displays a negative value, the Histogram bars are green, signaling a bullish recovery ahead. So if the bulls prevail, SOL will likely move to an uptrend in the coming weeks.  SOL’s Key Support And Resistance Levels SOL is trading at $18.73 after it found critical support at the $15.43 price level weeks ago. This puts the altcoin close to the $19.48 resistance level. A break above the $19.48 resistance level will help to boost its price to reclaim the $20 psychological resistance level. If this happens, SOL will likely rally to the $21.81 resistance level after breaking above $20. However, a price decline below $18 in the short term remains possible due to its bearish outlook on the weekly chart.  Factors Influencing Solana’s Price There are several factors right now that could influence the SOL&#8217;s price. These factors include macroeconomic factors such as inflation and crypto regulation in several areas. Also, utility and adoption are vital factors alongside recent trends and developments in the ecosystem.  Another trend in SOL&#8217;s ecosystem likely influencing its price action this week is its decentralized exchange (DEX) volume. According to a report from the on-chain analytic platform DefiLlama, Solana&#8217;s weekly DEX volume increased to see it rank fifth on the list at press time.  Related Reading: Lido (LDO) Sustains Weekly Run With 16% Gain – What Fuels It? SOL’s DEX volume surged by 84%, and its 24-hour volume rose above $38 million. This increase will likely help to boost its price action in the coming week. However, despite an increase in its total DEX volume, its Total Value Locked (TVL) is stagnant. DefiLlama shows that SOL&#8217;s TVL has been stagnant since its decline in November 2022 following the collapse of FTX. The TVL is currently sitting at $273.26 million, with no notable increase in value despite slight gains in SOL&#8217;s price on the daily chart.
