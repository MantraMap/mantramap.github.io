The world&#8217;s largest exchange Binance announced on Tuesday, August 15, intentions to delist three tokens from its trading platform. According to the exchange&#8217;s official statement, it regularly conducts a periodic review of all cryptocurrencies and trading products on its platform, ensuring they are of the highest standards in order to protect its customers’ interests. This review is based on certain factors, including trading volume and liquidity, network stability, network security against attacks, and the project’s team commitment, among others.  Based on the results of their latest reviews, Binance states the following tokens are lacking in compliance in relation to these factors: Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII). Therefore, the exchange will be delisting all trading pairs related to these tokens at exactly 03:00 (UTC) on August 22, 2023. In addition, the order extends to other platforms affiliated with the exchange, including Binance Simple Earn, Binance Loans, Binance Gift Card, and Binance Pay. Albeit, the enforcement date varies for some of these platforms.  Related Reading: Will Bitcoin Price Crash Similarly To 2019 And 2020? Binance Delisting Leads To Heavy Losses For Tokens Following Binance’s announcement, Sonm (SNM), Serum (SRM), and DFI.Money (YFII) have all seen their value plunged into double-digit losses. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the SNM token is the largest loser of the trio declining by 79.09% in the last 24 hours.  Meanwhile, SRM and YFII are down by 29.19% and 19.55%, respectively, over the last day. These losses are quite unsurprising, as delisting by any exchange is commonly interpreted by investors as a disapproval of the token. Considering Binance’s status as a key player in the global crypto space boasting over 150 million users, the exchange delisting a token can be quite detrimental, as seen above. At the time of writing, SNM is trading at $0.05924, while SRM and YFII are exchanging hands at $0.5053 and $584.63, respectively.  SNM trading at $0.0597 on the daily chart &#124; Source: SNM/USDT chart on Tradingview.com Binance Connect Shuts Down In other news, Binance has decided to close down its regulated buy and sell service, Binance Connect, due to the deactivation of supporting card payments on the platform by its provider.
