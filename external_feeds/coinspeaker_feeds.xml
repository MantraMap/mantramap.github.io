<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mortgage-demand-interest-rate/">Mortgage Demand Swells amid Suspended Interest Rate Hikes</a></p>
<p>Mortgage demand in the US <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/10/mortgage-demand-surged-after-fed-signaled-potential-pause-in-rate-hikes.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">recently climbed</a> considerably after the Federal Reserve signaled that it could pause interest rate hikes. The increase in applications for home-buying was a direct result of reduced mortgage rates last week. Although last week’s drop in mortgage rates was not substantial, it was enough to induce current homeownership demand. As it stands, more homeowners look to refinance their mortgages to lower rates.</p>
<p>Mortgage refinancing applications jumped 10% last week compared with the preceding week. However, applications to refinance a home were still 44% lower compared to the same period last year. In addition, mortgage applications for home-buying rose 5% this week, although the figure was still way off on a year-over-year (YoY) basis. During the same week in 2022, applications for mortgages were 32% higher.</p>
<p>The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage contract interest rate with loan balances of $726,200 or less declined last week to 6.48% from 6.50%. Additionally, inherent points also decreased from 0.63 (including the origination fee) to 0.61 for loans with a down payment of 20%. In addition, the Mortgage Bankers Association’s weekly survey said that mortgage rates decreased over the week for all surveyed loan types.</p>
<h2>Comments by Mortgage Bankers Association Deputy Chief Economist</h2>
<p>In a release, the MBA’s deputy chief economist Joel Kan talked about the mortgage application development, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mortgage applications responded positively to a drop in rates last week, as the Fed signaled a potential pause at the current level for the federal funds rate in anticipation of inflation slowing and tightening financial conditions that will slow economic and job growth.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the Fed cooling off on further rate hikes, the prices of homes remain relatively high from previous exertions. Although home prices have appeared to ease since last summer, strong demand and low supply contribute to rising prices.</p>
<p>In March, mortgage demand rose despite volatile interest rates in the first quarter of the year. At the time, prospective homebuyers, seemingly unperturbed by the Fed’s inflation-induced fiscal exertions, increasingly applied for home-purchase assistance. However, despite mortgage demand jumping 7% on the week to mark a second consecutive week climb, it still paled YoY. March reports stated that the demand to buy homes was still at a 38% drawdown compared to the same period in 2022.</p>
<h2>Demand Up amid Interest Rate Volatility in March</h2>
<p>In the first quarter of 2023, leading home construction company Lennar Corp (NYSE: LEN) posted commendable earnings. Lennar Corp benefitted from the spike in mortgage-related activities in March, with the company’s chairman Stuart Miller, explaining in a release:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Home buyers are considering the possibility that today’s interest rate environment may be the new normal. Accordingly, the housing market continues shifting as growing household and family formation continued to drive demand against a chronic supply shortage.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Miller also added that Lennar Corp experienced a “generally” strong economy as the housing market continued to find its footing.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-capital-connect-vip-users/">Binance Launches Capital Connect for VIP Program Users</a></p>
<p>The leading centralized exchange with more than $38 billion in daily traded volume <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has continued to re-invent the financial markets for the betterment of the globally unbanked population. The exchange takes pride in more than 120 million global registered users who actively trade more than 350 digital assets. With its huge global reach, the crypto exchange has worked to separate high-net-worth investors to get VIP services.</p>
<p>For instance, the exchange has four VIP sub-programs &#8211; including Trader VIP, Holder VIP, Investor VIP, and Borrower VIP &#8211; meant to bring together investors for the betterment of the crypto and blockchain industry.</p>
<h2>Binance Launches Capital Connect</h2>
<p>Binance crypto exchange announced that it has unveiled a new product dubbed Capital Connect to help bridge institutional investors with crypto investment fund managers. Notably, the new product by Binance is currently available for VIP program users including hedge funds and high-net-worth investors, among others.</p>
<p>“Investors and fund managers continue to encounter network inefficiencies due to a lack of market standards,&#8221; Catherine Chen, Head of Binance VIP and Institutional, <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/vip/binance-vip-and-institutional-launches-capital-connect-connecting-investors-and-investment-managers-4081079031133794475" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>. &#8220;With Capital Connect, we can help create information disclosure standards for market participants with different investing and fund-raising needs.”</p>
<p>The company noted that Capital Connect is meant to help institutional investors tap into the fast-developing crypto market in a safe environment. Moreover, Binance is highly regulated around the world and has earned a good reputation among investors. In this regard, Binance noted that it will provide crucial information through Capital Connect including assets under management (AUM) of different funds, their performance records, and minimum investment amounts, among others.</p>
<p>The Capital Connect platform intends to keep details about users anonymous until a deal has been reached. In that case, investment managers can freely communicate with clients without limitations of outside parameters. Nevertheless, Binance intends to maintain high standards for Capital Connect through Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Know-Your-Business (KYB).</p>
<p>Reportedly, more than 20 fund managers have been listed on Binance&#8217;s Capital Connect, with more expected in the near future. Moreover, Binance announced that it on-boarded 8.3 percent more institutional clients during the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Binance remains privately held with its value soaring amid global crypto mainstream adoption. Led by CEO and co-founder <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/changpeng-zhao/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changpeng Zhao</a>, the exchange holds more than 500k Bitcoins in its wallet reserves. Thus making it a crucial player in the Bitcoin and blockchain development initiatives.</p>
<p>The top crypto assets have consolidated in the past few weeks, after recording a profitable first three months. Nevertheless, the rise of new meme coins has kept the crypto trading volume up amid bearish sentiments.</p>

<p>Memecoin Turbo, created entirely from scratch using ChatGPT 4, has gained massive momentum with its market cap reaching $100 million within 10 days of launch. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/pepe-whale-turbo-chatgpt-memecoin/">PEPE Whale Puts Attention to Turbo &#8211; ChatGPT Created Memecoin</a></p>
<p>A whale holding a massive quantity of the frog-themed memecoin <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/pepe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PEPE</a> has recently generated a new trade in a token dubbed Turbo (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/turbo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TURBO</a>), created by using ChatGPT&#8217;s language model for just $69. A whale, who was an early investor in Pepe coin and earned $14.5 million in profits, has been aggressively buying Turbo since the beginning of the month, May 3, as per data provided by on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain.</p>
<p>The trader has so far purchased 1.38 billion Turbo tokens and is already in the green. As of date, the value of this purchase is currently. In their update on Twitter, Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1655787865304084481" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">&#8220;A smart whale who earned ~$14.5M on </span><span class="r-18u37iz">$PEPE</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> has been buying </span><span class="r-18u37iz">$TURBO</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> since May 3. He bought a total of 1.38B </span><span class="r-18u37iz">$TURBO</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> ($1.1M currently) with $977K, the average buying price is $0.0007055. This whale was not an early buyer of <span class="r-18u37iz">$PEPE</span>, but he kept buying <span class="r-18u37iz">$PEPE</span> from Apr 19 to 27 when the price of <span class="r-18u37iz">$PEPE</span> was depressed.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p>It is clear that the whale in the notice has been rotating profits smartly from Pepecoin to Turbo.</p>
<h2>Turbo Token Price Surges amid Memecoin Craze</h2>
<p>Pepecoin has recently triggered a fresh memecoin craze giving investors multifold returns within less than a month of launch. The Pepecoin rally has triggered a massive frenzy among crypto traders and investors driving a renewed interest in this crypto asset class.</p>
<p>The action continues in this ChatGPT-based token which has led many to believe that the crypto winter may be ending anytime soon. Of course, trading in such tokens is obviously risky and decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap has been currently warning investors about the same. Over the last weekend, the Turbo token prize rallied all the way to $0.003007, as per <a href="https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x7baece5d47f1bc5e1953fbe0e9931d54dab6d810" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> from DexScreener.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just 10 days since the developer launched the turbo memecoin built from scratch with ChatGPT-4. As per the project&#8217;s whitepaper, the project has a budget of $69 with a total supply of 69 billion tokens. It says that the memecoin &#8220;aims to establish itself as a leading meme coin with a unique identity and a strong focus on simplicity, fairness, and community engagement&#8221;.</p>
<p>Since the trading of Turbo tokens ramped up earlier this month, the token has more than doubled in price, with its market cap reaching close to $100 million.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bnb-chain-l2-boba-network-april/">BNB Chain L2 Boba Network Achieves Record Transaction Volume in April</a></p>
<p><a href="https://boba.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Boba Network</a> said today its Layer-2 scaling solution had achieved mass adoption on Binance’s <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/introducing-bnb-chain-the-evolution-of-binance-smart-chain-421499824684903436" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">BNB Chain</a>, with its transaction volume more than quadrupling in April compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>The network’s developers revealed that Boba processed <a href="https://blockexplorer.bnb.boba.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2,863,240 transactions</a> throughout April, averaging around 100,000 per day. The network handled 585,818 transactions in March, up from just 99,362 in February. What’s driving this transaction growth is the rate at which BobaBNB attracts new users, with more than 45,000 wallets created on the network at the end of the month.</p>
<p>This fact demonstrates  Boba Network’s multichain focus. Whereas a lot of Layer-2 platforms are geared towards a specific blockchain, Boba supports multiple chains, including BNB Chain, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>, Avalanche, and Fantom.</p>
<p>L2s have emerged as a critical aspect of the Web3 economy. Boba Network allows users’ transactions to be processed off-chain, helping ease the burden on the main network. By doing this, it can process transactions much faster and with lower costs as it reduces the amount of data stored directly on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Boba Network employs optimistic rollups, which bundle hundreds of transactions into a single batch and then submit them to the main network for finalization as one. It works by assuming those transactions are valid unless challenged. Should a transaction be challenged, it allows for them to be checked and verified using fraud computations.</p>
<p>Several projects building on BNB Chain such as <a href="https://www.rovi.network/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ROVI Network</a> and <a href="https://megaworld.game-server.ca" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">MegaWorld</a> already use Boba&#8217;s features. ROVI is the creator of a Crypto Super App platform that includes payments, games, and Web3 infrastructure services and is committed to onboarding millions of users to the world of crypto. Meanwhile, MegaWorld is a popular multiplayer “play-to-earn” game that’s modeled on the classic title “The Sims”.</p>
<p>Boba said its users on BNB Chain are saving around 80% on transaction fees by using its network.</p>
<p>The network also provides developers with new opportunities. With Hybrid Compute, developers can connect their decentralized applications to Web2 systems via smart contracts. This allows them to access real-world data such as the weather, sports results, financial markets, etc.</p>
<p>According to Boba, its growth on BNB Chain is an important milestone as it’s the first time that any L2 scaling platform has reached such a significant transaction volume on a blockchain that isn’t Ethereum. Wider adoption of the network promises to benefit users, as it means more revenue for Boba that will then be used to fund and accelerate its development.</p>
<p>“BNB Chain provides a significant opportunity for Boba Network as the only multichain layer 2 as it has more active addresses than any other blockchain,” a core contributor to Boba Network said.</p>
<p>BNB Chain Head of Marketing &amp; Dev Relations Zoe Wei also commented on this news. “We are glad to see the growing adoption of BobaBNB with these remarkable transaction volumes,” she added.</p>

<p>Despite the fall off of the US stock futures, there is no doubt that the fight against inflation is yielding a relatively positive fruit in the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stock-futures-slump-inflation/">Stock Futures Slump as US Inflation Remains Pegged at 4.9%</a></p>
<p>The US stock futures are seeing a very concerning slump today following the release of the latest inflation figure for the month of April. According to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the month of April increased by 0.4% when seasonally adjusted, and by 4.9% over the last 12 months when not seasonally adjusted.</p>
<p>This figure showed that inflation stayed relatively stable from the month of March to April. Notably, the US stock futures had been jumping with a negative rhythm in the hours leading to the official data release as investor agitation to know whether the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies had been effective thus far.</p>
<p>The futures tied to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq Composite</a> (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) fell 0.63% while those linked to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500 Index</a> (INDEXSP: .INX). The futures tied to the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-index-djia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (INDEXDJX: .DJI) did not fare better, slipping by 0.17% amid raging volatility.</p>
<p>While normalcy is expected to return to the market following the release of the data. However, many of the stocks on Wall Street remain in the red at the time of writing. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/airbnb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Airbnb Inc</a> (NASDAQ: ABNB) led losses in the Pre-market with a 13.1% slump while Twilio Inc (NYSE: TWLO) compounded its price slip with an 18.14% slump.</p>
<p>The market expectation for the released data according to EP Wealth Advisors’ Adam Phillips is that the data will show the pathway to the inflationary normalization is not a linear one.</p>
<p>“It won’t change our thinking for the Fed,” Phillips <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>. “The market could respond since they respond to anything that’s inflation-related these days, but when you get down to it, I don’t think it’s necessarily going to change the Fed’s calculus either.”</p>
<h2>US Stock Futures and Apparent Progress</h2>
<p>Despite the fall off of the US stock futures, there is no doubt that the fight against inflation is yielding a relatively positive fruit in the United States.</p>
<p>Thus far, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has increased the interest rate 10 consecutive times as it showed its unrelenting effort to return the inflationary figures which previously stood at a 40-year high above 10%.</p>
<p>The last interest rate hike earlier this month was <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-fed-25-basis-point-rate-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pegged at 25 basis points</a> with the possibility of pivoting in the near term. The interest rate hike somewhat came as a shock to some analysts who had hoped the Feds will reroute its approach considering the instability in the US financial services industry.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Fed Chairman <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/jerome-powell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jerome Powell</a> noted that the American banking industry is healthy, and as such, any formal sentiment about rate hike reduction was shunned. The Feds has revealed that its next policy meeting will be geared toward reviewing data to consider whether or not it will adopt a more dovish approach in its monetary policies moving forward.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/chiliz-blockchain-sports-web3/">Chiliz Launches Layer-1 Blockchain to Foster Transition of Sports Brands to Web3</a></p>
<p>Leading blockchain provider for the sports industry Chiliz has announced the launch of its Chiliz Chain public mainnet. This marks the next step in the firm’s mission to help sports teams and brands build direct relationships with their fans and communities from around the world using blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Chiliz Chain is a Layer-1, interoperable blockchain ecosystem and is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It is set to introduce a network of 11 active Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA) node validators. These will include some established blockchain firms and leading sports entities. They will be responsible for validating transactions and securing the Chiliz ecosystem to enable developers to “build the projects that will form the backbone of web3 in sport.”  So far, Jump Crypto, Paribu, and Meria (formerly known as Just Mining) have been named as validators.</p>
<p>Chiliz Chain’s PoSA model is expected to provide lower fees, support shorter block time, and use significantly less energy as part of the company’s pledge to sustainability. All network fees will be paid using the blockchain’s native $CHZ token. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/introduction-chiliz-chz-crypto-option-sports-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$CHZ</a> holders will play an integral role in the development of the ecosystem and be rewarded for staking their $CHZ on the chain.</p>
<p>Alexandre Dreyfus, CEO of Chiliz, <a href="https://medium.com/chiliz/chiliz-aims-to-take-sports-from-web2-to-web3-as-it-completes-public-launch-of-its-new-layer-1-6a44849b823b" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re proud to officially introduce the global sports community to Chiliz Chain, the Sports Blockchain. We’ve been building towards this moment for a long time and it’s a huge step forward for us. Through our long-term commitment to innovation, our network, new partnerships and by fostering sports focused blockchain projects, Chiliz Chain can grow to form the backbone of web3 in sport, providing the infrastructure behind the next generation of products, experiences and services for teams, brands and their fans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Chiliz has a network of over 150 major sports teams and is the creator of fan Tokens and leading fan engagement and rewards app Socios.com. Fan tokens are digital utility tokens that grant the holder access to fan communities on Socios.com. The Socios.com and Fan Token ecosystem has over 2 million wallets and features major sports teams including the soccer teams FC Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City, Juventus, S.S.C Napoli, Inter Milan, AC Milan, Arsenal, Atlético Madrid, A.S Roma. It is also home to some of the biggest UFC and Formula 1 teams.</p>
<p>Through its Chiliz Labs accelerator and incubator, the firm is set to empower early-stage Web3 sports projects looking to build on the Chiliz Chain. The $50 million $50M Jump Crypto-backed program will assist projects for metaverse-based sports, football, and football manager games, rewards and engagement-driven community platforms, social gaming platforms, AI-based content platforms, 3D quality digital sports collectibles, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> ticketing programs.</p>
<p>Chiliz is also looking to attract developers interested in building Web3 sports projects by holding hackathons in major stadiums and sports arenas all over the world. The details of this are yet to be announced.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/president-biden-crypto-investors/">President Biden Digs at Wealthy Crypto Investors </a></p>
<p>The 46th elected president of the United States <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/joe-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Joe Biden</a> has announced his intention to close tax loopholes for “wealthy crypto investors”. He tweeted requesting Congress to cut loopholes that help the crypto tycoons. Biden also accused MAGA House Republicans of supporting wealthy crypto investors and failing to support the food safety inspections budget. The president made this statement with respect to his proposed fiscal year 2024 budget.</p>
<p>While Congress supported the tax loopholes from wealthy crypto investors, it opposed the food safety inspection budget. Proposed taxes from crypto investors amounted to $18 billion, while the food safety inspection budget was $15 billion. Biden explained that reducing the budget is a priority for every country worldwide. He said Republicans prefer to cut programs critical to seniors and middle-class working families for their selfish interest.</p>
<p>The disagreement between Biden and Republicans surfaced after the Treasury warned of an impending debt crisis. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the US could run out of cash if Congress does not suspend the debt limit before the stated date. Comparing the GOP’s proposed federal budget cuts, Biden <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/230100" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We don’t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They’re telling us.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier this year, the Biden-led administration plans to generate approximately $24 billion through tax rules. This implies that taxes would apply to crypto assets like stocks and other securities. The crypto rules will focus on wash trading. On May 2, Biden also plans to impose a 30% tax on mining activities. Currently, there is no projected amount to be generated from the tax proposal. However, Biden aims at taxing crypto firms rather than wealthy crypto investors. On the other end, Republicans are waiting to oppose the US central bank digital currency (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) proposal.</p>
<p>Notably, some Republicans have drawn closer to the burgeoning crypto industry in the past few years. For instance, the conservative Club for Growth launched two crypto-focused super PACs in the last election cycle.</p>
<h2>Biden Wars Against Wealthy Crypto Investors</h2>
<p>Biden’s latest action against crypto has garnered several opposing reactions from the crypto community. Billy Markus, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/dogecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dogecoin</a> co-creator, said American crypto investors are not wealthy like Biden thinks. Peter Conradi, a community moderator for Beeple and Async Art, said Biden should back off his proposed tax codes. Conradi added that other countries are tapping into the innovative opportunities embedded in the financial revolution.</p>
<p>In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) confiscated crypto assets belonging to various crypto firms. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/brian-armstrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brain Armstrong</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> CEO, has called out the regulatory body, saying it is incapable of regulating the affairs of the cryptocurrency space. The crypto community has also accused SEC of selling unregistered securities from Genesis, Terra Labs, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/justin-sun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Justin Sun</a> and his companies, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bittrex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bittrex</a>.</p>

<p>Chicago Board Options Exchange parent Cboe has again filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the SEC despite being rejected in late January. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/cboe-third-attempt-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Cboe Files Third Attempt at Securing Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval from SEC</a></p>
<p>In a recent regulatory filing, Cboe Global Markets <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/cboe-files-with-us-sec-third-time-list-ark-21shares-bitcoin-etf-2023-05-09/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">made</a> its third attempt to list the ARK 21Shares <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> exchange-traded fund (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-an-exchange-traded-fund-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETF</a>). On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cboe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicago Board Options Exchange</a> parent company sought approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>). The latest regulatory filing reflects the Cboe&#8217;s struggle for a US Spot Bitcoin ETF. The SEC has rejected all previous attempts, with the latest in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-cboe-ark-21shares-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">late January</a>.</p>
<p>However, Cboe is one of many entities that find it challenging to secure SEC regulatory approval for spot BTC ETFs. The Commission has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-wisdomtree-spot-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected similar bids</a> from other firms such as <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grayscale</a>, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/fidelity-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fidelity</a>, and New York Digital Investment Group (NYDIG).</p>
<h2>Cboe Unrelenting in Quest to Secure Spot Bitcoin ETF Approval from SEC</h2>
<p>Nonetheless, Cboe appears determined to secure the necessary approval to list and trade the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/21shares-ark-investment-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spot Bitcoin ETF shares</a> from Ark Invest and crypto investment product firm 21. Should Cboe eventually succeed, the company would be the first to publicly list a spot BTC ETF in the US.</p>
<p>For practical reasons, the SEC has struck down all previous attempts by various platforms to list spot Bitcoin ETFs. So far, the securities regulator believes all spot ETF proposals need more adequate investor protection measures. However, although the Commission remains opposed to spot ETFs, it has approved several other Bitcoin ETF types in recent years.</p>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s best intentions, several aggrieved spot ETF hopefuls feel the regulator&#8217;s stance is unjustified. As a result, firms such as Grayscale and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) have launched <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-joins-grayscale-in-fighting-for-bitcoin-etf-approval-from-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legal proceedings against</a> the SEC. In the summer of last year, Grayscale filed a lawsuit against the regulatory agency, with Coinbase later playing a supporting role. Referring to the SEC&#8217;s refusal to approve its spot ETF last June as &#8220;arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory,&#8221; Grayscale expressed its intent to fight for the fund. The digital currency asset management company also argued that the regulator&#8217;s position was inconsistent in light of previous approvals of other BTC-based ETFs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase opined that the SEC&#8217;s stance was due to its limited knowledge of blockchain technology and digital assets. At the time, the aggrieved group described ETFs as &#8220;ideally suited for investors that desire exposure to Bitcoin&#8221; and questioned the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;thumb on the scale&#8221; approach.</p>
<h2>US Government &amp; &#8216;High-Risk&#8217; Digital Assets</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s approach to digital assets once reflected the US government&#8217;s unwavering aversion to crypto. However, Washington has recently seemed more amenable to embracing crypto and outlined proper regulations to protect consumers. If spot ETFs are to see US approval, these securities will seemingly only come to light once enough regulation is in place.</p>
<p>While the US has yet to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, other nations have had them for some time. These include neighboring Canada and far-away Australia, with Brazil joining them last November.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jane-street-jump-crypto-us/">Jane Street and Jump Crypto Withdraws from US amid Regulatory Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Market-making firms Jane Street Group and Jump Crypto are retreating from crypto trading in the United States due to regulatory uncertainty in the country.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-09/jane-street-jump-pull-back-crypto-trading-amid-us-crackdown" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> from Bloomberg, people familiar with the situation stated that Jane Street is taking a step further by lowering its global cryptocurrency ambitions. On the other hand, Jump Crypto, the digital-assets unit of Jump Trading has emphasized that it would still maintain its position of expanding globally despite its decision to exit the crypto market in the US.</p>
<p>Notably, the crypto industry has been subject to increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities in recent times following the collapse of renowned firms and projects including the defunct <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX exchange</a>. As a result, some companies are reconsidering their participation in the industry, at least until there is more clarity on the regulatory front.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) has <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-international-exchange-btc-eth-futures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> an International Exchange with BTC and ETH Futures for Non-US Institutional Clients in Response to SEC Crackdown. Accordingly, the company stated that it has also received a regulatory license to operate in Bermuda and is also making plans to expand into the UAE.</p>
<p>Similarly, the CEO of Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz has also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/galaxy-digital-global-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that his firm is pushing its boundaries to attain global regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Remarkably, it&#8217;s not unusual for businesses in the cryptocurrency sector to think about establishing operations in nations with more hospitable regulatory frameworks. Markedly, this can help them stay competitive and continue to grow their business in a rapidly evolving industry.</p>
<p>While regulatory uncertainty in the US can be a challenge for crypto firms, exiting the US may not necessarily be a straightforward solution. It is important that firms consider the potential challenges and opportunities of relocating to a new jurisdiction before making such decisions.</p>
<p>Potential challenges that can be encountered include reputation risks, talent acquisition, and reduced market access. Exiting the US could also have financial consequences for crypto companies, such as the need to incur expenditures connected with relocating to a new country or adapting to a new regulatory environment.</p>
<h2>Jane Street and Jump Crypto’s Exit, Potential Impact</h2>
<p>Market-making firms play an important role in the crypto ecosystem by providing liquidity. Additionally, they help to ensure that there is a market for buyers and sellers to trade cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>They accomplish this by acting as middlemen between buyers and sellers, purchasing and selling assets to maintain market order, and earning from the difference between purchase and sell prices. They also serve to lessen market volatility by providing liquidity and avoiding massive buy or sell orders from causing rapid price swings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is important to note that market makers are controlled by financial authorities in many countries and must follow particular rules and regulations, such as declaring their trading activities and practicing proper risk management. The exit of Jane Street and Jump Crypto will contribute to the liquidity crunch in the market segment, an outlook that is unhealthy for the industry.</p>

<p>In a post earlier this week on May 8, Miller Thomson, a law firm representing the users of defunct cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX announced that they would start an interim distribution of funds linked with the exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy proceedings in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As per the bankruptcy trustee <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ernst-young/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ernst and Young</a>, this interim distribution would be in consultation with estate inspectors. Very soon, the trustee will also post a Notice to Affected Users with the details about the manner and procedure of the distribution.</p>
<p>Law firm Miller Thomson stated that a small number of affected users are likely to receive notice of Disallowance of Claim, which means that the creditor&#8217;s claim has been either revised or disallowed in the bankruptcy process. The law firm <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-quadrigacx-to-start-interim-distribution-of-funds" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“If you received a Notice of Disallowance, you have the right to appeal the decision . The first step is to review the reasons for the revision or disallowance and gather any necessary evidence to support their claim. In this case, the Trustee is most likely to have issued a Notice of Disallowance if there was a discrepancy in your proof of claim.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Fall of the QuadrigaCX Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>Once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, QuadrigaCX became insolvent back in February 2019 soon after founder Gerald Cotton died in India while taking along the private keys of QuadrigaCX’s offline storage systems.</p>
<p>Later, as estimated by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), QuadrigaCX owes its clients an estimated $160 million. Along with losing access to the cold storage, the OSC has also alleged that Gerald Cotton had realized $86 million in crypto trading losses on the QuadrigaCX platform.</p>
<p>In 2020, Jennifer Robertson, the widow of QuadrigaCX founder Gerald Cotten <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/quadrigacx-widow-surrender-9-million-repay-users/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> that she will hand over more than $9 million (12 million CAD) in assets. Over the years, bankruptcy trustee Ernst &amp; Young recovered $34.3 million worth of assets. The OSC wrote, “We did not identify any other assets beyond those identified by Ernst &amp; Young.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the fall of QuadrigaCX, online streaming giant Netflix is planning to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/netflix-documentary-quadrigacx-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> a documentary on the entire episode. However, there haven&#8217;t been many details regarding this so far.</p>
<p>Crypto exchange bankruptcies have shot up recently in the current market scenario especially after the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US SEC</a> initiated a major crackdown on crypto trading firms, especially after the fall of crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>.</p>
