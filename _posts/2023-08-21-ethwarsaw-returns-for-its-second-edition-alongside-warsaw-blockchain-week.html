<p>Warsaw, Poland, August 21st, 2023, Chainwire</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ETHWarsaw, a web3 conference and hackathon, organized by a passionate group of local Ethereum enthusiasts, returns for its second edition. The event is set to take place from August 31st to September 3rd, 2023 in Warsaw, Poland, bringing together a global community of builders, founders, and educators in web3.</p>
<p>Building upon the achievements of its debut, the second edition of ETHWarsaw promises enhanced experience as it will coincide with the first in the history Warsaw Blockchain Week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite the backdrop of crypto&rsquo;s resurgence after a challenging year, we&rsquo;re ready to deliver an even more comprehensive experience for the global community traveling across the world to Poland. This year we&rsquo;re literally transforming Warsaw, a tech hub teeming with talent, into a hotbed of web3 action.&rdquo; said Lukasz Stoczynski, ETHWarsaw&rsquo;s Co-Founder, Business Development Lead.</p>
<p>This collaborative initiative, set against the charming blend of tradition and modernity that defines Warsaw, promises community-organized side events, including conferences, networking meetups, and parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collective effort is poised to make this year&rsquo;s ETHWarsaw, for the second year in a row, the biggest web3 conference in the CEE region and Warsaw Blockchain Week the largest blockchain event ever held in Poland.</p>
<p>ETHWarsaw is structured to cater to both seasoned professionals and curious newcomers including web2 developers and students. The conference spans two dynamic days of talks, panels and fireside chats divided into six key tracks: DeFi, Scalability, Security, Infrastructure, Governance, and Non-Tech.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s speakers include Marius Van Der Wijden, Ethereum Foundation; Akram El Milligy, Ledger; Patrick McCorry, Arbitrum Foundation; Artis from Gitcoin, and Adam Gagol from Aleph Zero.</p>
<p>Similarly to last year, the overnight hackathon will start on Friday evening and it will be a 48 hours marathon of non-stop building. There will be opportunities for teams and individuals to get hands-on, practical experience working with applications and advanced tools with ~$50,000 in value to be won from various competitions.</p>
<p>ETHWarsaw&rsquo;s reputation as a hub for breakthroughs in the blockchain realm continues to be reinforced by the awe-inspiring success stories of projects born from the event. Antoni Zolciak, Co-founder of Aleph Zero, Ocean Sponsor of ETHWarsaw, explains: &ldquo;The brilliant team behind our recently launched ecosystem company, AZERO.ID, was formed after they emerged as victorious champions of the ETHWarsaw hackathon. This win led them to secure a grant, develop the platform&rsquo;s first version, and successfully close an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round. Their mainnet launch on Aleph Zero is just weeks away, marking an exciting beginning for AZERO.ID. We&rsquo;re excited for this year&rsquo;s hackathon during ETHWarsaw and have no doubt that this year&rsquo;s edition will not disappoint.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other ETHWarsaw returning sponsors include RedStone Oracles, Arweave, Octant, Scroll, IPOR. In addition, EthWarsaw secured support for the vol2 event from companies like Lukso, zkSync, Request Network, PROPERLY, Beamer Bridge, Mantle &amp; Chronicle.</p>
