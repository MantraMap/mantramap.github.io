<p dir="ltr">The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), in its recent study, emphasised the importance of judiciously regulating cryptocurrencies rather than imposing outright bans.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto is a mirage
<p dir="ltr">The study hinted at the increasing allure of digital currencies but cautioned against their mirage-like appeal. The research by BIS, a global financial institution known as the "central bank for central banks", pointed out the swelling enthusiasm for digital currencies. They cited their promise for faster and cheaper remittances, increased financial inclusion, and potential as an alternative investment vehicle.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows; the BIS also underlined some inherent vulnerabilities. These include potential misuse for illicit activities, energy concerns associated with crypto mining, and heightened market risks.</p>
A complete ban is not the answer
<p dir="ltr">The BIS study further stressed that simply banning these digital currencies might not be the solution. Outlawing them could stifle innovation and push activities to unregulated sectors, increasing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Instead, the institution recommends establishing robust regulatory frameworks. These frameworks should prioritise transparency, combat illicit activities, and protect consumers while fostering technological advancements in the financial space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The paper concludes by highlighting that while cryptocurrencies are indisputably transformative, their optimal utility can only be realised in a well-regulated environment. It's a balance of harnessing their potential while ensuring they don't jeopardise the broader financial ecosystem's stability.</p>
Opinion
<p dir="ltr">It should be borne in mind when reading the BIS report that this organisation is set on seeing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) rolled out across the globe. CBDCs are only an extension of the existing fiat currencies but they can also be used to totally control spending, right down to the individual level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The BIS admits to being worried about cryptocurrencies going elsewhere if they are banned in certain countries, so their thinking is to put crypto into a regulatory straitjacket in order to stop private money in its tracks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To central banks and central planners decentralised money is anathema. They see the danger to the continuance of the fiat monetary system that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies present and will fight tooth and nail to suppress this new technology in order to be able to establish CBDCs and thereby obtain ultimate control over citizens.</p>
