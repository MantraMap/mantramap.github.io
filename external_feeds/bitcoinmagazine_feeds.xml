The problem: “unhosted wallet providers” do not exist. “Unhosted wallets,” or non-custodial wallets, are simply software. </p><h2>Infringing On The First Amendment</h2><p>The enactment of section three, part a would hence require anyone writing software which enabled the sending, receiving and signing of bitcoin transactions to obtain a money transmitter license. This attempt at restricting the writing of code is nothing new and a directly unconstitutional approach, as the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/amdt1-7-1/ALDE_00013537/#:~:text=First%20Amendment%3A,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances.">U.S. constitution clearly states</a> that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” </p><p>Under these circumstances, attempts at regulating the writing of software have been struck down by U.S. courts <a href="https://brownpoliticalreview.org/2022/03/decoding-speech/#:~:text=City%20Studios%2C%20Inc.-,v.,is%20unrelated%20to%20constitutional%20inquiry.">numerous times</a>. </p><p>In Universal City Studios vs. Corley, 2001, for instance, the second circuit <a href="http://digital-law-online.info/lpdi1.0/treatise50.html">addressed</a> the attempted restriction on computer code with the following arguments:</p><ul><li>Communication does not lose constitutional protection as “speech” simply because it is expressed in the language of computer code. If someone chose to write a novel entirely in computer object code by using strings of ones and zeroes for each letter of each word, the resulting work would be no different for constitutional purposes than if it had been written in English.</li><li>Computer programs are not exempted from the category of First Amendment speech simply because their instructions require use of a computer. A recipe is no less “speech” because it calls for the use of an oven, and a musical score is no less “speech” because it specifies performance on an electric guitar. The fact that a program has the capacity to direct the functioning of a computer does not mean that it lacks the additional capacity to convey information, and it is the conveying of information that renders instructions as “speech” for purposes of the First Amendment.</li><li>Limiting the First Amendment protections of programmers to descriptions of computer code (but not the code itself) would impede discourse among computer scholars, just as limiting protection for musicians to descriptions of musical scores (but not sequences of notes) would impede their exchange of ideas and expression. Instructions that communicate information comprehensible to a human qualify as speech whether the instructions are designed for execution by a computer or a human (or both).</li></ul><p>The court further cited that the limiting of free speech under the U.S. constitution is permitted if, and only if, it serves a substantial governmental interest, the interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression and the regulation is narrowly tailored, which, in this context, requires that the means chosen do not burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government’s legitimate interests.</p><h2>The Key Moving The House Around</h2><p>That section three of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act serves any other purpose but the direct restriction of free expression is yet to be proven by Senator Warren. And even so, the section appears much too broad in scope to be legally applied without directly violating constitutional rights, particularly as developers of non-custodial wallets serve no purpose in the transmission of money. </p><p>Non-custodial wallets transmit bitcoin the currency as much as the key to one’s door moves the house around. Non-custodial wallets function as signing devices, which transfer the <em>access rights</em> to bitcoin — while the asset itself never moves. The attempt at restricting the development of non-custodial wallets would therefore constitute a regulation of public-private key cryptography, which, too, <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1212&amp;context=uclf">has been attempted before and struck down</a> due to violation of the first amendment of the U.S. constitution. </p><p>Similarly nonsensical as framing developers of non-custodial wallets as money transmitters is the idea that “nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions” and “independent network participants” must be defined as money service businesses, consequently constituting that anyone who runs a Bitcoin node must obtain a license to do so.</p><p>By definition, Bitcoin nodes do not secure third-party transactions. Rather, Bitcoin nodes validate one’s own version of the blockchain against copies obtained through other nodes in the network. Nodes neither secure nor transmit third-party transactions. No other user’s funds are affected if a Bitcoin node goes down. </p><p>The attempt of ruling Bitcoin node operators as money transmitters can therefore be seen as the attempt at regulating which individuals are allowed to compare information. Again, the proposed bill is unable to sufficiently prove that section three is narrow enough in scope to sufficiently warrant the approval of such a bill without infringing on further aspects of free speech and the freedom of information. </p><p>Section three further attempts to regulate bitcoin miners as money service businesses. Here, too, the bill exhibits an embarrassing level of misunderstanding of the inherent technology it attempts to restrict. </p><p>A bitcoin miner is nothing more than a computer, meaning a machine which processes code as speech. In no scenario does a bitcoin miner transmit bitcoin from A to B. Rather, a bitcoin miner propagates blocks of information to the network. A regulation of bitcoin miners does not hold up from a technological point of view. In addition section three again fails to prove that the permissioned use of bitcoin miners would not constitute further violations on anyone using a computer, particularly to access and broadcasting speech as protected under the U.S. constitution. </p><h2>Violating Well-Established Human Rights</h2><p>By attempting to restrict the handling, using or transacting of business with digital assets that have been anonymized as declared under section three, part d, the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act further infringes on aspects of the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act">Fair Credit Reporting Act</a> (FCRA), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_privacy_laws_in_the_United_States#California_Privacy_Act">California Privacy Act</a>, the U.S. constitution’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privileges_and_Immunities_Clause">Privileges and Immunities Clause</a>, as well as Article 12 and Article 13 parts a and b of the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>. </p><p>The FCRA of 1970 is a U.S. federal legislation which regulates the accuracy, fairness and privacy of consumer information as handled by credit reporting agencies in the scope of the collection, dissemination and use of consumer information, including consumer credit information. Under the act, credit reporting agencies are required to remove negative information seven years after the date of first delinquency, except for bankruptcies (10 years) and tax liens (seven years from the time they are paid). </p><p>Bitcoin transactions provide an immutable history of themselves. The restriction of privacy services and tools as defined under the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act as services “designed to conceal or obfuscate the origin, destination, and counterparties of digital asset transactions” directly violate FCRA regulations, as credit reporting agencies would be enabled to maintain indefinite records of any user’s financial information and transactions without the possibility of deletion. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act">Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> is a U.S. constitutional act guiding the regulation of banking companies, insurance companies and securities companies. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, companies are required to provide consumers with privacy notices at the time of the establishment of consumer relationships, documenting the scope of use of financial information. In accordance with the FCRA, users must be given the right to opt out of the sharing of information.</p><p>Because the blockchain is a public ledger, with the restriction of privacy protecting tools and services, users would be unable to opt out of the sharing of information, as financial information regarding bitcoin transactions is shared with everyone and anyone able to view the Bitcoin blockchain by default. The restriction of privacy tools and services therefore constitutes a direct violation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. </p><p>The California Privacy Act is a state-level privacy act which governs the handling of consumer information, including financial information. It is often seen as <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Gramm-Leach-Bliley-Act">a more strict implementation of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a>. The act herein constitutes that financial information must be maintained within one financial entity, restricting access to other financial entities based on affiliation. </p><p>In the case of bitcoin transactions, any financial business conducting transactions on the blockchain on behalf of customers unavoidably shares customer’s financial information with other financial entities — namely anyone able to view a block explorer — as, again, the blockchain is a public ledger. Restricting the use of privacy technologies such as blinded e-cash or CoinJoin for businesses herein directly violates the relevant sections of the California Privacy Act. </p><p>The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act further violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Privacy_Rights_Act">California Privacy Rights Act of 2020</a> which constitutes that businesses must obtain permission through a parent or guardian to collect data on individuals below the age of 16; a regulation unenforceable with the restriction of privacy tools as the age of Bitcoin users cannot clearly be distinguished in the bulk collection of chain analysis data. </p><p>The Privileges and Immunity Clause is part of the U.S. constitution, governing the freedom of movement. In 1869’s Paul v. Virginia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_movement_under_United_States_law#:~:text=In%20Paul%20v.,to%20protect%20freedom%20of%20movement.">court ruled that</a> U.S. persons must retain the “right of free ingress into other States, and egress from them,” leading to the creation of this clause. With the restriction of the obfuscation of the origin of funds, as well as restrictions regarding the obfuscation of senders and receivers, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act directly opens individuals up to arbitrary restrictions on their freedom of movement, as no individual is able to cross state lines without purchasing the necessary means, such as gas or train tickets. </p><p>The ramifications of fully surveillable means of payment on individuals’ freedom of movement have been clear most recently through <a href="https://qz.com/1642441/extradition-law-why-hong-kong-protesters-didnt-use-own-metro-cards">protests in Hong Kong</a>, during which protestors were identified by the times and places where their train tickets were purchased with digital means of payment. </p><p>For these reasons, it can further be argued that the Digital Assets Anti-Money Laundering Act infringes on articles 18, 19 and 22 of the 1966<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights"> International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>, which govern individual’s right to protest and freely assemble, as well as Article 11, which governs the right to free association, and Article 9, which governs the freedom of religion, as neither of these rights are effectively enactable by the individual’s side without a private form of payment.</p><p>In addition, for the reasons above, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act violates Article 13 of the Universal Declaration Of Human Rights, which constitutes the right to freedom of movement, stating that any human must retain the right to leave any country and return to their own countries, as well as Article 12, which states that no one should be made subject to arbitrary interference with their privacy. </p><p>Section three, part d of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act proposes the enabling of total surveillance of anyone using bitcoin as a currency under the pretense of anti-money laundering regulations. Yet, the <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">Chainalysis crypto crime report of 2021</a> found that illicit activity in cryptocurrency use had reached an all-time low as volumes reach all-time highs, clearly rendering the proposed prohibitions of privacy technologies in cryptocurrency as arbitrary, therefore constituting a clear violation of Article 12. </p><p>It additionally violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Financial_Privacy_Act">Right to Financial Privacy Act</a> (RFPA), a federal law under which governments must obtain consent of the customer to access financial information, another regulation which would become virtually non-enforceable with the restriction of privacy tools and services and the enabling of bulk surveillance of Bitcoin users. While the RFPA was amended by the Patriot Act in 2001 to include the compelling of disclosures of requested information to intelligence and counterintelligence agencies for any investigation related to terrorism, the bulk surveillance of all cryptocurrency users can hardly be argued under the Patriot Act, in light of a $15.8 trillion market cap at a rate of an associated <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">illicit transaction volume of 0.15%. </a></p><p>As pointed out by the non-profit research and advocacy center Coincenter, the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act may additionally be in violation of the fourth amendment of the US constitution, as it orders the warrantless surveillance of cryptocurency users through developers and miners while serving no purpose towards their operations.</p><p>It can be suggested that that Sen. Warren spends less time attempting to regulate technology that she clearly does not understand and more time learning about existing financial regulations. She would further be well advised in refraining from attempting to violate her constituents’ constitutional rights and instead put her effort toward protecting them. After all, that’s what we pay her for.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by L0la L33tz.

Core Scientific currently has an existing loan with B Riley totaling $42 million. The new $72 million loan would be “on favorable terms,” and aim to provide two years of runway before anticipating profitability from the company.<br><br>In the lender’s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/b-riley-financial-issues-open-letter-to-core-scientific-investors-301703337.html">released statement</a> it described how, “We believe that there is a path forward and have been proactive in working through a solution, specifically by providing debt on a number of unencumbered assets.” </p><p>The mining firm has faced various headwinds in recent months. Bitcoin Magazine PRO <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/public-miner-capitulation-takes-and-core-scientific">detailed these back</a> in late October of this year, describing how “Core Scientific is halting all debt service payments; Bitcoin holdings are now 24 — they sold 1,027 over the last month; Cash resources will be depleted by the end of the year or sooner; and Core Scientific claims Celsius owes them $5.4 million.” <br><br>In addition to these, last week a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221208006081/en/Kirby-McInerney-LLP-Announces-the-Filing-of-a-Securities-Class-Action-on-Behalf-of-Core-Scientific-Inc.-CORZ-Investors">lawsuit was filed</a> by Kirby McInerne LLP on behalf of Core Scientific investors. </p><p><br>Despite this and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rosemariemiller/2022/10/27/core-scientific-unable-to-pay-bills-warns-of-bankruptcy/?sh=b2565565c4b6">statements</a> by the mining firm that bankruptcy was not off the table, B Riley states that they believe “bankruptcy is not necessary at all.” <br><br>The lender explains that the miner’s previous loans “were made when the price of Bitcoin was significantly higher than it is today and the theoretical payoff on miners was significantly faster. These debts were incurred as part of an aggressive, ill-conceived strategy by the Company to continue to build out power facilities and expand miners while never selling Bitcoin on hand and never hedging prices … This decision combined with the fast maturity associated with mining has led the Company to its current position.”<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5NzMwNDMwMjE0MjE5NDUy/immersion-cooling-bitcoin-miner.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Visiting El Salvador’s Slums, It’s Clear Bitcoin Country Must Go Further]]></title><description><![CDATA[A visit to Soyapango, one of El Salvador’s most impoverished slums, shows that the Bitcoin experiment isn’t reaching those who need it most.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-slums-need-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Poverty]]></category><category><![CDATA[Violence]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nayib Bukele]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rikki]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 18:11:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">A visit to Soyapango, one of El Salvador’s most impoverished slums, shows that the Bitcoin experiment isn’t reaching those who need it most.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rikki, author and co-host of the “Bitcoin Italia,” and “Stupefatti” podcasts. He is one half of the Bitcoin Explorers, along with </em><a href="https://twitter.com/Lorinaura"><em>Laura</em></a><em>, who chronicle Bitcoin adoption around the world, one country at a time.</em></p><p>A few days before this writing, El Salvador's president Nayib Bukele announced an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-deploys-10000-troops-gang-run-capital-suburb-2022-12-03/">immense police operation</a>. San Salvador's satellite city of Soyapango was surrounded by 8,500 military and 1,500 police officers, who went searching from house to house for gang members still hiding in the area. <a href="https://insightcrime.org/news/true-cost-el-salvador-war-on-gangs/">More than 150 arrests were counted</a>.</p><p>Soyapango represents one of the most difficult realities for the country. With <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2022/12/05/watch-el-salvador-troops-surround-entire-city-part-war-gangs/">300,000 inhabitants</a>, it is home to several "comunidades," the name used locally to define slums or “favelas,” if you prefer.</p><p>The news of the police operation hit me hard because, only two days before, I had visited two different neighborhoods in that very city: the extremely poor Ciudad de Dios, which stands on an old garbage dump, and the violent Santa Lucia, one of the historical lairs for criminal gangs.</p><p>My visit was carefully planned well in advance and the only reason it was possible for me to even enter these places was that the "pandilleros," the gangsters, have been hit hard by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Salvadoran_gang_crackdown">government crackdown in recent months</a>, a direct result of the upsurge in clashes between rival gangs that had bloodied the country again earlier this year. </p><p>Had I tried to enter a year ago, my own life would have likely been in danger. Nevertheless, as a precaution, I had a local driver, only rarely was I allowed out of the car, and we were escorted by a person known in the neighborhood who rode ahead of us on a motorcycle. Our guide was from those streets, had lived for five years under a bridge and had a history of drug addiction, from which he recovered with the help of the community.</p><p>It was an enlightening day for me and a necessary one.</p><h2>Solving Extreme Poverty</h2><p>My reason for visiting these places to report on them comes from a conversation I had recently with a rather famous Bitcoiner: a developer who is well educated and highly intelligent and has been in the industry for many, many years. Well, his thesis is that El Salvador is not really as poor as people would have you believe, but rather an economically-backward country where the incidence of extreme poverty is not unlike that of far more developed nations.</p><p>This viewpoint, frankly, left me in shock.</p><p>According to official data in El Salvador, <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/SLV/el-salvador/poverty-rate">26% of the population</a> lives below the poverty line. That is <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">1.7 million people</a>. </p><p>Yet it is true that many of the Bitcoiner tourists who come here believe it is the lady selling pupusas on the street corner who is poor. She is not. That lady is an entrepreneur. She has a store, a business. The lady, despite the plain clothes creased by hard work, is lower-middle class in El Salvador. Poverty, the real kind, is hidden in huge neighborhoods made of tin houses, without running water, sewage or electricity. Invisible cities, where no one goes and that no one talks about.</p><p>This is a serious mistake.</p><p>If we want Bitcoin to succeed here, we must also improve the living conditions of these people. Because they are the ones who need it the most and because it is their poverty, as the police operation of the last few days showed us, that directly fuels crime.</p><p>The Bitcoiners who come to El Salvador dreaming of a freer nation than the one from which they escape, the entrepreneurs who want to invest here, must understand that among their priorities must be the inclusion of those living in the slums of Soyapango, otherwise it is their very future here, it is their very investments, that are in danger. Indeed, the military solution to the gang problem can only be a temporary palliative. Crime feeds on the slums. This is where bosses recruit new thugs, this is where they sell drugs and profit, this is where they live, rule and hide. If we don't solve the problem of extreme poverty in El Salvador, the gangs will keep coming back, more dangerous and better organized than before, and El Salvador will never be a truly safe country.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmBLOOJAvxs">footage I shot in the slums of Soyapango</a> is a blow to the stomach. But I think it was also necessary to show our community this side of El Salvador, which is too often forgotten.</p><section><figure>

It is time, therefore, to take some stock.</p><p>As I have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/rikki">extensively documented</a>, Bitcoin adoption in El Salvador is slowing down. There are many merchants who have stopped accepting BTC as a form of payment. The reasons they always give have been twofold: Bitcoin is too complicated and there is a lack of volume. Very few want to pay this way.</p><p>While we have already shown how too much complexity is to blame for the shortcomings of the Chivo wallet, the second problem is far more serious and delicate. On the one hand, there are the citizens of El Salvador who earn and spend dollars — a strong currency, not a victim of serious inflation — and they view digital payments with suspicion. On the other, however, there are the encouraging data that tell of a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/el-salvador-weekly-tourism-minister-says-bitcoins-led-to-spike-in-visitors/">strong increase in tourism in this country</a>, also related to the many Bitcoiners who come here to visit the country of BTC legal tender.</p><p>But if there are thousands of Bitcoiners coming to visit, how is it possible that the volume of BTC transactions in the streets is not increasing? Maybe we are not numerically sufficient?</p><p>Maybe. But I think the problem is also another one.</p><p>Let me give you an example: A few weeks ago, outside the Mi Primer Bitcoin graduation ceremony in the small town of Ataco, I met a Spanish gentleman who had come to the country specifically for Bitcoin. Tall and grizzled, in his 40s, he was helping this association that educates very young people in El Salvador about Bitcoin. He was an examiner, one of the "experts" called upon to assess the children's preparation. Wearing a Bitcoin Beach cap and Bitcoin t-shirt, with a lean and tanned physique, he appeared to be a typical fanboy, in appearance.</p><p>We lingered talking outside of the school and I happened, almost by accident, to mention how I was a bit disappointed with the worsening adoption of Bitcoin among people there.</p><p>It was at this point that he started telling me how he himself, strong, in perfect Spanish, always asks whenever he buys something if he can pay in bitcoin. But when he gets an affirmative answer, he starts investigating with the merchant to figure out exactly what they are going to do with the satoshis he would be sending him. Basically, it’s an interrogation. If the poor merchant responded that they wanted to keep the sats for the future, then they will receive some from the experienced Western Bitcoiner via a Lightning transaction. But if they instead admits that they want to exchange or receive the bitcoin directly in dollars, then this Westerner gives up using bitcoin and pays directly in fiat.</p><p>Can you see how idiotic that is? It makes no sense at all.</p><p>I thought that our mission in El Salvador was to incentivize adoption as much as possible, to help these people through a new and alternative economic system. But no! Now we even demand that they be HODLers. Otherwise they are not worthy of our bitcoin. This is a creepy mindset and pure selfishness.</p><p>When I pointed out to him that the future of these people also depends on the success of bitcoin in the country and that perhaps his attitude is a bit selfish — because after all, we can sacrifice a few thousand satoshi to incentivize adoption, even if they are converted to dollars — he went on a rampage and started screeching that he lives in El Zonte and that all of his friends are the poor in the village and that he cares about the fate of them all.</p><p>Evidently, however, not enough to sacrifice a few dollars in sats. </p><p>And, mind you, there are many other people who think like this. I have seen plenty of Bitcoiners here paying in cash or with their flaming credit cards. We are all familiar with the narrative behind this gesture: "Bitcoin are not to be spent. HODL to the death. Bitcoin will be worth billions, it's not like they're being spent today. We wouldn't want to end up like that fool <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-is-more-than-a-meme-hes-a-mining-pioneer">Laszlo</a>!"</p><p>Too bad that Bitcoin's success in El Salvador is also linked to transaction volume and that if we win our battle in this country, the value in bitcoin's markets will be positively affected, to the benefit of our entire community. So evidently, we all want bitcoin to gain in value, but only a few are willing to sacrifice a handful of satoshis to really contribute to the ultimate victory. How boorish and selfish.</p><p>I mean this in no uncertain terms: At the risk of angering someone, if you come to visit this country for Bitcoin and you are not willing to pay in bitcoin, do El Salvador a favor, stay home.</p><p>PS</p><p>I saw the guy again a few weeks later in El Zonte, comfortably seated, eating a shrimp cocktail, peering out to sea at Palo Verde, one of the most exclusive resorts in the village. It is one of those places that his "so many poor friends" cannot even afford to look at from a distance.</p><p>PPS </p><p>Laszlo Hanyencz is a hero and has gone down in the history books, unlike all of those who consider him a fool.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rikki.

It would also prohibit financial institutions from interacting with privacy tools such as CoinJoin in an effort to limit the ability of users to maintain their privacy. While the bill focuses on such measures in order to curb money laundering, tools such as CoinJoin simply restore the users’ ability to use bitcoin in a way that more closely resembles physical cash. That is, the bank knows when a client withdraws cash at an ATM, but has limited knowledge of what any user does with it afterwards. This cash-like attribute is only realized in cryptocurrencies through tools such as CoinJoins. In addition to this, regulating bodies would be allowed to file reports and surveil users without need for a warrant or government request. <br></p><p>According to the bill, it also calls for a “rule classifying custodial and unhosted wallet providers, cryptocurrency miners, validators, or other nodes who may act to validate or secure third-party transactions, independent network participants, including MEV searchers, and other validators with control over network protocols as money service businesses,” which would imply that Bitcoin nodes would be classified as such as well.<br><br>The bill seeks for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) to implement the guidance which, according to <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-digital-asset-anti-money-laundering-act-is-an-opportunistic-unconstitutional-assault-on-cryptocurrency-self-custody-developers-and-node-operators/">blockchain advocacy group CoinCenter</a>, “is the most direct attack on the personal freedom and privacy of cryptocurrency users and developers we’ve yet seen.”<br><br>Senator Elizabeth Warren has previously expressed her desire to regulate the cryptocurrency industry, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/senator-warren-in-wall-street-journal-op-ed-ftxs-implosion-should-be-a-wake-up-call">most recently</a> after the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">collapse of FTX</a>. The bill would likely face extensive scrutiny as, amongst many other issues, it would force unhosted wallets providers to register before publishing their products, effectively placing limits on free speech, as code has been <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/remembering-case-established-code-speech">proven to be free speech</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Japan’s Largest Power Company, TEPCO, To Mine Bitcoin With Excess Energy]]></title><description><![CDATA[TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess power.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/tepco-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-power</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Japan]]></category><category><![CDATA[Power grid]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Namcios]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 12:43:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">TEPCO Power Grid is deploying bitcoin mining operations across Japan in a partnership with a local semiconductor company to capitalize on excess power.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Japan’s largest electric power company is about to start mining bitcoin.</p><p>Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) Power Grid is partnering with TRIPLE-1, a local semiconductor designer and developer, to mine bitcoin with excess energy across the country, CoinDesk first reported. TEPCO is the country’s largest electric power company in total assets, per <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/868685/leading-companies-electricity-industry-by-total-assets-japan/">Statista</a> data.</p><p>TEPCO is the utility behind the Fukushima nuclear reactor, which in 2011 was struck by an earthquake and huge tsunami that knocked out some of its cooling systems, allowing three reactors to melt down. The power company later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/13/world/asia/tepco-admits-failure-in-acknowledging-risks-at-nuclear-plant.html">admitted</a> that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent such disasters. TEPCO is still suffering from the accident, as compensation for victims is <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14610645">taking a toll on its profitability</a> to this day. Now, its power transmission and distribution company, TEPCO Power Grid, is seeking ways to monetize surplus power with bitcoin mining through its wholly-owned subsidiary Agile Energy X.</p><p>TEPCO is joining major global energy companies in jumping on the bitcoin mining bandwagon. And a common denominator for most of them is a need to monetize excess power, something BTC mining does very well. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/conocophillips-is-selling-extra-gas-to-bitcoin-miners">ConocoPhillips is selling stranded gas to bitcoin miners</a> in the Bakken, an oil-abundant region in the U.S. –– a similar strategy to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/exxon-is-mining-bitcoin-with-excess-gas-report">what Exxon is doing</a>. The oil giant reportedly has an agreement with Crusoe Energy Systems to redirect gas that would otherwise be wasted from an oil well pad to mobile bitcoin mines. TEPCO's setup also goes along those lines.</p><p>According to a translated version of a Wednesday <a href="https://www.tepco.co.jp/pg/company/press-information/information/2022/pdf/221214a.pdf">statement</a> by the Japanese energy giant, Agile Energy X signed a memorandum of understanding with TRIPLE-1 on November 11 to build a constructive strategic partnership. Through the collaboration, Agile aims to deploy distributed data centers throughout Japan that repurposes surplus electricity from renewable energy with semiconductors from TRIPLE-1.</p><p>A pilot project has already been set up on the premises of TEPCO Power Grid’s office in the Tokyo metropolitan area, per the statement. “We have started experiments to confirm the system behavior and the impact on the power grid when equipment is operated with a large amount of power on the scale of 1,500 kW, and have confirmed that the equipment can operate normally.”</p><figure>

I also offer some cost mitigating suggestions to hopefully encourage more participation on the bitcoin network.</p><p>Before exploring the costs involved: <strong><em>What is a bitcoin node</em>?</strong></p><p>A<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/"> bitcoin node</a> is software that connects to the Bitcoin peer-peer network. A node receives, validates and broadcasts transactions/blocks to other nodes on the network, according to the network rules.<a href="https://unchained.com/blog/what-is-a-bitcoin-node/"> Ted Stevenot</a> concisely described nodes as <em>the messengers and rule keepers of Bitcoin.</em></p><p>The broadcast blocks are part of a distributed ledger which contains records of each transaction, keeps track of bitcoin ownership and the corresponding amount owned. This publicly shared ledger is generally known as the Bitcoin <em>blockchain</em>.</p><p>A Bitcoin node is usually run on portable single-board computers (SBCs) like the<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/"> Raspberry Pi</a>, or on a <a href="https://umbrel.com/">personal computer</a>. However, a node can also be run in a virtual machine or on a smartphone. Bitcoin Core is the most widely used bitcoin node software and can be downloaded<a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/download/"> here</a>.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0Mjk1Njg1/image6.jpg" height="427" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Nodes can either be full or light:</p><ul><li>A full node stores a full copy of the blockchain and verifies every transaction and block, from the first block — the genesis block — against the consensus rules.<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Consensus"> Consensus rules</a> are specific rulesets enforced by full nodes to determine the validity of a block and its transactions.</li></ul><p>There are two types of full nodes: <em>archival nodes</em> and <em>pruned nodes</em>. Archival nodes store the entire blockchain locally and relay it to other nodes, this also helps to bootstrap new ones. Meanwhile, a pruned node only saves a specified minimum number of blocks as it verifies transactions and blocks. Therefore, more computer disk is saved by pruned nodes compared to archival nodes. However, pruned nodes are unable to serve the entire blockchain to other nodes.</p><ul><li>A light node does not enforce the consensus rules and relies on third party run full nodes to receive block data, which involves a privacy trade-off.</li></ul><p>Full nodes will be the main focus of this article — any mention of <em>“node”</em> hereafter implies a full node unless explicitly stated.</p><h2>Why Run A Node?</h2><p>There are personal and network benefits to running a node. Some of these include:</p><ul><li>Privacy when broadcasting transactions, verifying bitcoin received in your wallet, and exploring blockchain data, without third parties logging your personal information.</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/">Enforcing the consensus rules</a> which helps uphold bitcoin’s integrity and your investment in it. Furthermore, running a node enables you to either reject or support any proposed changes — <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/may-the-forks-be-with-you-e02d00366ae3">soft or hard forks</a> — to the consensus rules. Reciting Raspiblitz’s slogan:<a href="https://shop.fulmo.org/"> <em>Not your node, not your rules</em></a> .</li></ul><ul><li>Strengthening the Bitcoin network. The more nodes on the network, the more decentralized and resilient Bitcoin is against malicious parties, jurisdictional restrictions or black swan events.</li></ul><ul><li>Increasing your understanding of how the bitcoin network operates and sharing this acquired knowledge with others. </li></ul><p>With some of the benefits outlined, let’s analyze the costs of running a node from a Nigerian perspective.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The common hardware, that meet the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node">minimum requirements</a>, used to run a bitcoin node on are either:</p><ul><li>Plug and Play nodes or</li><li>Do-It-Yourself (DIY) nodes.</li></ul><h3>Plug And Play Node</h3><p>Some bitcoin companies offer plug and play full node products that run on SBCs like the Raspberry Pi, <a href="https://www.pine64.org/rockpro64/">RockPro64</a> and <a href="https://rockpi.org/rockpi4">Rock Pi4</a>, and mini PCs like the<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/details/nuc.html"> Intel NUC</a> and<a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-mini/"> Librem Mini</a>. Some of these node providers are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://mynodebtc.com/">MyNode</a></li><li><a href="https://shop.fulmo.org/raspiblitz/">Raspiblitz</a></li><li><a href="https://samouraiwallet.com/ronin">RoninDojo</a> and</li><li><a href="https://start9.com/">Start9</a></li></ul><p>Node prices range from $300 to $700 — excluding shipping ($100 minimum to Nigeria) and customs duty — dependent on hardware and storage size. Currently, international purchases made on most Nigerian Naira debit cards are limited to $20 per month, a reduction from a previous $100 limit. Your node purchase options are to use a dollar debit card — tied to a domiciliary account — with deposited dollars obtained from the black market (currently 70% above the official rate), use a virtual dollar card which offers convenience but at a higher rate than the black market, and bitcoin.</p><p>There are other obstacles you might encounter in purchasing a node. Firstly, not all node providers ship to Nigeria. Additionally, due to chip shortages, some of these products are out of stock. One way of surmounting some of these hurdles is employing the alternative availed by node providers of sourcing node components yourself, and installing their respective bitcoin core embedded software on your assembled node.</p><h3>DIY Node</h3><p>In sourcing hardware components, we’ll only consider SBCs as they are cheaper than mini-PCs. The hardware components required to run an SBC node are:</p><ul><li>SBC + power supply</li><li>SD card + reader</li><li>SSD + enclosure</li><li>Heatsink case/fan</li></ul><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MDMzNTQx/image2.jpg" height="215" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The current chip shortages and high demand for single board computers have led to a massive increase in prices and supply deficits, Raspberry Pis in particular both locally (used and new) and <a href="https://rpilocator.com/">internationally</a>. However, some Raspberry Pis and RockPro64s are available on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">Aliexpress</a>. Regardless, there are some fake sellers on the platform, you need to be especially wary of newly created stores, read negative reviews and request a refund if an item does not arrive within the estimated period. </p><p>Considering the international purchase limit on Naira debit cards, these SBCs will need to be purchased using a dollar card — there is no bitcoin purchase option. The table below summarizes average hardware component costs from Aliexpress, for building new Raspberry Pi or RockPro64 nodes.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MzYxMjIx/image5.png" height="390" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Data</h2><p>Before a node is able to perform its role as a messenger and rule keeper on the bitcoin network, it needs to be synchronized with other nodes on the network. This is done by downloading and verifying all the blocks from the genesis block in a process known as the Initial block download (IBD). Currently, the bitcoin blockchain is approximately <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size">440 GB</a> in size.</p><p>The following table summarizes the average data costs, from network providers, for the IBD and roughly <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_blockchain_size">5.3 GB</a> required monthly to sync your node with the blockchain. An assumption is made that you reside in an area with somewhat reliable 4G network coverage.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MjMwMTQ5/image3.png" height="305" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Power</h2><p>To simplify the power cost analysis, the assumption is made that you live in a region with no electricity (at least 80% of the time in my location) and will need a solar generator to power the node and router, which isn’t ideal as it’s weather dependent. Replicating something similar to Chimezie Chuta’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/06/16/one-mans-mission-to-deploy-solar-powered-bitcoin-nodes-across-africa/">Spacebox</a> incurs the subsequent mean costs.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Finally, the estimated full node setup costs is tabulated below.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0NDI3NjY0Njg0MTY0NjEz/image4.png" height="211" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>In Conclusion</h2><p>Running your own Bitcoin node has a lot of benefits, some of which were listed earlier on. However, with ongoing chip shortages, inflation and node setup costs (despite the assumptions and cost-cutting recommendations made herein), running a node might not be feasible for everyone. One practical solution would be to implement Arman The Parman’s <a href="https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/">circle of trust</a> idea or Obi Nwosu’s <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/whats-fueling-bitcoin-adoption-in-nigeria-390dd37fde2f">guardians and users</a> model of having a technical individual run a node for a trusted group of people like close friends, a family or community. This approach does involve a trade off, but is much better than connecting to third party nodes and helps in easing bitcoin’s custody challenge.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by </em><em>Chinedu</em><em>.

On the other hand, if we look at their underlying open-source software, we see radical differences: </p><ul><li>Bitcoin’s protocol is specifically configured for minimizing uncertainty with conservative parameters and a constrained feature set, and its simple ledger architecture results in <a href="https://www.pierrerochard.com/auditing-bitcoin-supply/">supply auditability of BTC</a>. </li><li>Ethereum is optimized for cutting-edge experimentation and a wide range of programmable features, but its complex ledger architecture results in an <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinIsSaving/status/1505356218759528452">unauditable supply of ETH</a>.</li><li>Luna was <a href="https://mishtalk.com/economics/congratulations-to-luna-the-first-crypto-to-hyperinflate-now-worth-zero">programmed to automatically hyperinflate</a> to try to prop up the value of a stablecoin, Terra, and that’s exactly what it did. </li></ul><p>Putting all three of these assets into a single “crypto” bucket is reductive — they are different technologies optimizing for different outcomes. Bitcoin has accomplished long-term network stability — you could have run the same node software continuously for the past decade without any problems. The same cannot be said for Ethereum node software, which <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/">completely changed its consensus mechanism in September 2022</a>. This change was only able to occur because the Ethereum Foundation has a unique <em>centralized</em> role in designating the official staking contract. Ethereum has to be more centralized than Bitcoin to push through aggressive “upgrades” to its protocol. Bitcoin has no such centralized operator or authority, and its consensus rules are unofficial: a <a href="https://pierre-rochard.medium.com/bitcoin-governance-37e86299470f">spontaneous, inter-subjective, network-wide agreement</a> among the users. </p><p>To address the second element in Sixsmith’s line of reasoning: the intrinsic value of holding any form of money is that you are <a href="https://mises.org/library/yield-money-held-reconsidered">minimizing uncertainty by hedging</a> against unpredictable future cash flows. In the fiat system, the least-uncertain assets are physical cash and government-insured bank accounts; however, even those are subject to the fiat power of the governments issuing such currencies and insuring those bank accounts — that is, your money is only as good as the applicable government’s promises.</p><p>Setting aside Bitcoin’s exchange rate, on a fundamental engineering level, holding BTC with your own private keys and verifying the ledger with your own node results in less uncertainty than holding even physical cash or an insured bank account. <em>That is bitcoin’s intrinsic value</em>. While the spot price/purchasing power of BTC can be subject to the whims of market forces, the uncertainty-minimizing principles of how to receive, hold and send BTC have not changed since its inception. Thus, you can be <em>certain</em> that the smart contracts locking your BTC will execute as written, so that only a signature from your private keys can move your money.</p><p>The third element addressed in Sixsmith’s piece relates to the speculative trading of cryptocurrencies on exchanges. Exchanges operating in the United States are legal entities subject to U.S. laws governing exchanges and are subject to compliance with both state and federal money transmitter, custodian and investor protection regulations. They are regulated federally by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and they have clear terms of service and user agreements. Even an “offshore” exchange in the Bahamas is accountable to the <a href="https://guides.law.fsu.edu/caribbean/bahamas#:~:text=The%20Bahamas&amp;text=It%20gained%20independence%20from%20the,Law%20as%20its%20legal%20system.">English Common Law</a>. To label these entities as “crypto” exchanges obfuscates their centralized fiat nature. </p><p>Sixsmith states, “...we knew that crypto-currencies were not a surefire route to freedom and independence when their value hinged on the good sense and morals of a bunch of weird nerds online.” </p><p>While humorous, this statement conflates Bitcoin’s value with the (mis-)management of fiat/crypto exchanges; akin to questioning the value of tomatoes because a supermarket went bankrupt. Furthermore, there’s nothing inherent about BTC that would necessitate leaving it at a fiat exchange, vulnerable to theft. It is harder and riskier to properly secure and use an exchange account’s password than it is to do so with BTC private keys. Furthermore, there are bitcoin-only brokerages that encourage or require the delivery of BTC directly to the client’s keys. Countless individuals and businesses receive BTC not as a trade for fiat, but as revenue for goods and services. The continued development of a circular economy will lessen the need to ever exchange for fiat.</p><p>In conclusion, despite adjacent cryptocurrencies and fiat exchanges that are centralized and unreliable, Bitcoin is a decentralized and reliable alternative monetary system. Bitcoin’s vision for the future is not utopian or idealistic, rather it is simply looking at the past decade of successful adoption, noting that Bitcoin’s fundamental properties have only improved, and projecting out continued growth. Perhaps the bottleneck in Bitcoin’s adoption is peoples’ understanding of what differentiates Bitcoin from fiat and crypto.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Pierre Rochard.

    </figure><p>Is bitcoin volatile? How does one determine volatility? How can those with diamond hands so decisively say “no,” while those stuck in the fiat mindset so emphatically say “yes”? Which one is correct? Is it just that both sides have to agree to disagree, or can both of these seeming contradictions simultaneously be true? </p><p>To truly answer these questions, we should first analyze Albert Einstein’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity">special theory of relativity</a>…</p><h2>The Special Theory Of Relativity</h2><p>In Einstein’s attempt to better understand how the elapsed time of two clocks moved differently, we need to look at one of his thought experiments: Imagine two individual observers, one sitting as a passenger on a train and the other onlooking from a nearby platform. The train passenger sees two bolts of lightning strike each end of the train, the first bolt from the front of the train, and the second bolt from the rear. Meanwhile, the onlooker on the nearby platform sees the two bolts strike both the front and the rear of the train at the same time. The train passenger claims that the front strike happened before the rear strike, while the onlooker claims that the strikes happened simultaneously.</p><p>Whose perception is accurate? Can both of them be? Einstein believed that both interpretations are valid because they each have their own frame of reference. </p><p>This phenomenon led to Einstein’s theory of special relativity: different reference frames necessitate different perceptions on the simultaneity of events. Said more simply, having a different reference point changes one’s perception. Granted, this is a gross oversimplification and a narrow view of a much broader concept, but this limited scope will suffice for how it relates to the disparity in perceptions regarding bitcoin’s volatility.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Not Volatile</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>In this analogy, let’s consider Bitcoiners as the passengers on the train. Due to the nature of the technology, we’re traveling at a consistent speed set by math and code. Inside this protocol, we see that one bitcoin equals one bitcoin. We can verify its scarcity with a supply hard cap of 21 million. We understand how the lack of need for trusted third parties or central authorities ensures a trustless and permissionless peer-to-peer system. We realize that a whale has no more clout over the control of the ledger than a shrimp. We know that every two weeks, the difficulty adjustment will continue to produce blocks at an estimated once every ten minutes; we grok the term “tick tock, next block.” </p><p>None of this speaks to volatility; just the opposite, in fact. All of this speaks to consistency; the consistency of the network. It speaks to our grounded perception from within a stable and secure system of value transfer over space and time. We passengers inside the train that is Bitcoin are better able to make economic decisions based on sound systemic fundamentals. This is one of the main reasons that Bitcoiners are able to have and maintain a low time preference; we’re not as susceptible to the distortions created by less-volatile systems, which leads to erratic economic behavior. Said differently, the predictability of the protocol perpetuates low time preference.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Volatile</h2><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-cryptocurrency-rollercoaster/"><em>Source</em></a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>From an outside onlooker’s perspective, it’s clear that bitcoin is volatile. Their main frame of reference is not the network, but simply the asset (specifically, the BTC/USD exchange rate). When the supply of the dollar fluctuates wildly, when the cost of capital is consistently manipulated — not to mention with the competing, equally-flawed currencies attempting to claw their way out of hyperinflation — the onlooker’s perception is distorted. </p><p>This is a real-world application of <a href="https://coffeeandjunk.com/wittgensteins-ruler/">Wittgenstein’s Ruler</a>, a concept which states that, “Unless you have confidence in the ruler’s reliability, if you use a ruler to measure a table you may also be using the table to measure the ruler.” </p><p>Fiat onlookers’ view of bitcoin the asset are obfuscated by their frame of reference, which is to say, an unnecessarily convoluted one.</p><p>What’s worse is that, because of this perceived volatility, onlookers are disincentivized to take a deeper look into Bitcoin the network. They find comfort in the known. They’re unwilling to do the work to understand why their arbitrarily-chosen system is flawed. As <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth/status/1592796329687715841">Jeff Booth</a> points out, “Perhaps the biggest impediment for people understanding Bitcoin is bringing their baggage from how the monetary system works today and in the past, versus how it will work in the future.” </p><p>All of the misinformation inside the fiat system pushes its constituents away from connecting the dots… while they are simultaneously seated on a sporadic and spastic merry-go-round. They’ve either consciously or otherwise accepted that the fate of their money (in its forms as a store of value, medium of exchange and a unit of account) will potentially change roughly every four years with election cycles. They’ve been conditioned to believe there must be a small group of elites who “know best” how to manipulate the growth of an economy (while also ignoring the elites’ inherent incentives). They overlook the fact that the currency they’re compelled to use has lost 99% of its value over its lifetime. </p><p>This last point nudges those inside the fiat system to adopt a high time preference, knowing the value of their time and efforts will be devalued over time. This further distorts their frame of reference, thus their ability to make sound, economic decisions; choosing between a volatile, alternative asset which requires a low time preference and a lot of effort to understand versus a new, gizmo gadget providing endless dopamine dumps… well, I can see how it’s an easy choice for them.</p><h2>The Theory Of Monetary Relativity</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>All of this can simply be stated as: Bitcoiners determine volatility based from the reference of its network and protocol while fiateers derive its volatility from the reference of bitcoin the asset. </p><p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1594297942974038016">Gigi says</a>, “Bitcoin isn't volatile. Humans are.” Therefore, we must continue to reframe the conversation from the asset to the network and protocol. The asset will continue to show volatility (to the upside over the long term), which is not due to Bitcoin the network or protocol, but due to the volatility of human nature.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tim Niemeyer.

Check this: Money has no inherent value. And, besides being a special kind of money that allows for disintermediated transfers, the same applies to bitcoin. </p><p>As banal as it may sound, money <em>is </em>just a means to an end. As a matter of fact, it’s a means to any number of ends. And those ends are what matter. Money — whether dollars, satoshis or the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180502-the-tiny-island-with-human-sized-money">rai stones of Yap</a> — is not valuable for what it is, but for what it lets us do. We transform money into experiences, and experiences are what make a life, not ledger entries. Everything else is <a href="https://youtu.be/fjg5TuXV09U">bank propaganda devised to generate interest</a>.</p><p>As long as it’s “just” a store of value, bitcoin is even further removed from the ends that matter (unless watching charts is your thing). At least by turning bitcoin into a medium of exchange that can be traded for those valuable experiences, the Lightning Network moves bitcoin closer to what matters.</p><p>In fact, here’s a general postulate: bitcoin’s value is inversely proportional to the friction between the blockchain and the experiences it enables. Lightning was one big step in reducing that friction, and Lightning itself has taken several steps in the last four or so years to diminish it further, including:</p><ul><li>Mobile Lightning nodes</li><li>On-the-fly channel creation</li><li>Zero-confirmation channels</li><li>LSPs to manage users’ connectivity and liquidity</li></ul><p>Still, though it’s painful to admit, there remains more friction in non-custodial Lightning than in the best custodial and fiat solutions, and users will choose whatever gets them to those experiences faster and easier. </p><p>Less friction means moving bitcoin closer to creating experiences, which means more value in bitcoin and <em>in life</em>.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>The First Key To Reducing Friction: P2P Interaction </h2><p>The peer-to-peer (P2P) economy refers to disintermediated exchange, like creative people trading the fruits of their creativity — podcasts, videos, fanfic novels, 3D-printed cosplay accessories — with users for cash, without the intervention of banks, payment processors or aggregators. </p><p>Each intermediary in an interaction induces friction and increases the distance from the desired experience, and they can’t help it. Banks have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Aggregation platforms have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. Payment processors have to placate shareholders and regulators and make a profit. </p><p>Notice the pattern? While each intermediary claims to be giving people what they want, they’re actually serving different groups who want different things at the same time. That intermediaries always take a cut, induce friction and increase the distance between people and experiences isn’t the result of bad management or evil intentions, it’s just the nature of the beast.</p><p>So, why not create something far better for users? Let people interact directly, pay each other directly, exchange goods and services directly. There are even services out there — social networks, messaging services, content aggregators, gaming platforms — that would like to facilitate transactions among their users, but they can’t because legacy intermediaries induce too much (financial, regulatory, UX) friction. Worse still, the centralization induced by these large data networks increases their power over each user and, therefore, increases the risk of abuse to all users.</p><p>The P2P economy isn’t some billionaire’s pipe dream; it describes a world where we’re closer to the experiences we value and to each other. That’s what Lightning was made for. We just need to make it happen.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjU0NzA3NDI0ODk2Njg5/p2p.jpg" height="413" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>Web 2.0 interaction is you paying a conglomerate with money controlled by someone else; the P2P economy is just two people trading ideas, goods or a laugh for some P2P cash.

    </figure><h2>The Second Key To Reducing Friction: Fitting The Right Application To The Experience</h2><p>A lesson we’ve drawn from developing Breez is that different kinds of experiences (ends) need different payment interfaces (means). For example, the point-of-sale (PoS) terminal and podcast player that are included in our app are meant to feel like their own little self-contained interfaces, tailor-made for their respective purposes (or as close as we could get with the technological limitations of running a node on a phone).</p><p>But you can only cram so many activities and experiences into a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/no-such-thing-as-lightning-wallet">non-custodial Lightning payment app</a>. And, however clever, charming and good looking a team behind the payment app may be, they’re not necessarily best placed to devise new ways of applying P2P payments to new types of experience. We know how to make Lightning mobile and how to improve its UX, but when it comes to commerce, music, video streaming or any other vertical solution, experts in those fields know better how to craft the best experience.</p><p>Indeed, the PoS mode and the podcast player are just scratching the surface of what’s possible. We implemented them according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">the KISS principle</a>. Though they have scaled and attracted new users, they’re basically demo versions implemented to showcase how people interface with the P2P economy.</p><p>Could others with fine-grained expertise of those and other kinds of experience come up with better ways to apply P2P money to P2P interaction? <em>Of course they could</em>. And would those better applications achieve scale that our neophyte, outsider attempts never could? <em>Absolutely</em>.</p><p>And that’s the point. The better we apply the tech, the closer people get to the experiences they want, the more they will use the tech, the faster Lightning will scale. The scale we’re aiming for is not X orders of magnitude; we’re shooting for a world where kids roll their eyes whenever an adult says “Back in the fiat days…”</p><p>Achieving scale is a matter of reducing friction, and multiple, tailor-made apps that apply Lightning technology optimally to life’s many worthwhile pursuits is the best way of minimizing friction and expanding the P2P economy. It’s not about making the best wallet that can do everything; it’s about adapting Lightning — the means — to whatever end users want and whatever kinds of experience they want in exchange.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>LaaS Liberates Lightning </h2><p>Those who understand the technical requirements of running a non-custodial Lightning app will have realized already that adapting Lightning payments to any number of existing and yet-unimagined applications is incompatible with running a node in a single app. Lightning is far too technically demanding to scale the P2P economy as we have described it. Running the kind of always-on node required is an experience that few users, developers, creators or vendors out there will relish. </p><p>We’re envisioning <strong>Lightning as a Service (LaaS)</strong>. LaaS is about using Lightning to remove friction from life, from the experiences we crave. The point isn’t to improve the user experience <em>in the app</em>, but to improve the users’ experience <em>of Lightning as a whole</em> that gives them more value in their lives.</p><p>And LaaS is doable. Our vision for LaaS has three major components:</p><h3>1. A Lightning Software Development Kit (SDK)</h3><p>As it stands, anyone seeking to integrate Lightning payments to their existing business faces a steep learning curve. Accepting payments over Lightning requires them to run a node, secure liquidity with a Lightning service provider (LSP), manage fiat exchanges, perform swaps on and off the Bitcoin blockchain, manage a wallet, and so on. A non-custodial SDK would give P2P entrepreneurs and existing web utilities access to those functions without having to start from scratch. </p><p>With a well-designed SDK, developers could select the Lightning functions they need from a menu and integrate them quickly and easily into their own applications. Instead of having to learn the Lightning tech stack, a Lightning SDK will let developers simply plug it into their own tech stacks.</p><h3>2. Hybrid Architecture</h3><p>Lightning needs to be immediately available wherever and whenever people want to make payments. Locking a user’s functionality into a single app or on a single device would require the user to adapt to the technology, which is backwards. That’s friction.</p><p>At the same time, though, KYC friction and global, cross-market expansion requires a P2P, non-custodial solution. As soon as LSPs start acting like banks, regulators will start treating them like banks. That’s friction too.</p><p>The solution is a hybrid architecture based on <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/get-ready-for-a-fresh-breez-multiple-apps-one-node-optimal-ux-519c4daf2536">sovereign remote nodes</a>, but that locates those nodes in the cloud rather than on users’ local devices. Any service could access these nodes from any device, but as long as the users’ keys are locally stored, users would maintain custody of their own funds, minimizing the operators’ regulatory profile. </p><p>P2P plus minimal friction equals scale.</p><h3>3. Decentralizing Liquidity</h3><p>There is no credit on Lightning. The liquidity to settle any transaction needs to be preloaded onto the network. While this imposes a significant liquidity burden on those seeking to process users’ payments, it also presents the rich opportunity of a snowball effect: the more liquidity the network contains, the more transactions it can process, the more transaction fees the operators can collect, the more liquidity they have to invest in the network, and so on.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/lightning-network/">Lyn Alden</a> recently put it:</p><p>“Once there are tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or millions of participants, and with larger average channel balances, then routing a payment from any arbitrary point to any other arbitrary point on the network becomes exponentially easier and more reliable.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In order to get the snowball rolling, we must distribute the burden of preloading the network with liquidity by onboarding new LSPs. By attracting LSP collaborators, we will raise the liquidity level of the network overall, turning the snowball into an unstoppable avalanche of liquidity.</p><h2>A Postscript On Shortcuts And Friction </h2><p>A dear, old teacher of mine always used to say, “Doing it the right way <em>is</em> the shortcut.” Like so much wisdom gained from experience, this was infuriating to hear as a young person, which makes it no less wise.</p><p>The thoughts above about how to scale Lightning and catalyze the exponential growth of the P2P economy never even flirt with the idea of third-party custodians. And yet I would be the first to admit that connecting users via third-party custodians would make everything <em>so much easier</em>. Throw together a jazzy interface for an app in a few weeks or so, have your developers implement a database in the backend to manage users’ transactions, cut everything down to a single node and a handful of big payment channels, and you’re off. Less hassle for Lightning operators, a tighter network and a shallower learning curve for Lightning users.</p><p>We could push this even further. For all its revolutionary potential, bitcoin can be a pain in the neck. Private keys can get irretrievably lost or stolen. The network needs a certain amount of energy to run. A satoshi can only be in one place at any given time, limiting financial innovation. Why not just tell everyone that we’re moving their bitcoin around, when in fact they have no bitcoin … and neither do we? Same database, same interface, infinitesimal hassle, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z82ktt/lambo_math_a_story_in_4_parts/">free Lambos for everybody</a>.</p><p>I'm joking, of course. It’s been tried. Repeatedly. FTX. BlockFi. Genesis. Solana. It’s already a cliché that “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-24/the-vaccine-is-not-a-competition">the story of cryptocurrency is in large part a story about rediscovering traditional finance.</a>” And not only will operators lose users’ money (or magic beans, as the case may be) sooner or later, but the network would consist of <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/why-bitcoin-needs-to-become-a-medium-of-exchange-80d5c9e1de65?source=collection_home---4------9-----------------------">a limited number of choke points</a>, begging to be regulated, throttled and censored.</p><p>At which point we’d have to learn from our mistakes, start over from scratch, and do it again the right way. Fortunately, it’s still early days, and we can still <em>do it right the first time</em>. An omniscient being able to view all possible timelines would assure us that the sometimes tedious path of sovereignty and self-custody is, in fact, the shortest route to our P2P future. Though LaaS envisions a slightly different network than we have now to realize the future of Lightning, the principles and technological integrity that make Bitcoin worthwhile must remain inviolate.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Case Study: How I Got My Lawyer Friend Into Bitcoin</h2><p>A good friend of mine is an intellectually-curious guy. He's sharp, works in legal and always enjoys discussing economics, finance, politics, etc. </p><p>For years he'd ask generic questions in passing about Bitcoin because knew I was active in the space. And for years I'd try to give my most thorough, soup-to-nuts overview. </p><p>Each time I got the same subtle, discouraging, eyes-glaze-over reaction.</p><p>But one day I tried the inverse approach and sent the questions back his way. After some discovery I noticed all he wanted to talk about was Bitcoin's potential role during wartime. Something we'd never discussed before.</p><p>I explained how a Bitcoin sound money standard could very well make wars significantly less affordable for authoritarian governments to finance.</p><p>I also walked him through how refugees who are able to memorize or hang on to their seed phrases can transport 100% of their net worth stored in the network with them while fleeing their countries.</p><p>Once he realized that Bitcoin is a universal language — a network that can be tapped into from anywhere in the world with 24 words — was what inspired him to do his own research and gravitate towards the space.</p><p><em>"Brooks, this is so obvious... why does this matter?" </em></p><p>I know. But had I gone on about mining, digital signatures or the importance of the software being open-source ... I would've gotten the inevitable eyes-glaze-over moment, and we'd probably have one less Bitcoiner in the space.</p><p>What seems obvious in your head could be the light-bulb moment for another person.</p><p>If an opportunity comes up to discuss Bitcoin with a newbie, instead of jumping into an explanation of who Satoshi is, inflation graphs, or hash rate growth – I highly recommend starting with probing questions instead:</p><p><em>- “What are your opinions on the legacy financial system?”</em></p><p><em>- “Have you ever had a frustrating experience or delay with your bank?”</em></p><p><em>- “How large of an impact would you say the world wide web has had on the world?”</em></p><p><em>- “If you were in a position of high power, how would you go about making wars more difficult to finance?”</em></p><p><em>- “Do you feel as if your overall purchasing power has increased or decreased in the last decade?”</em></p><p><em>- “Would you consider yourself an early, middle or late adopter of new technology?”</em></p><p>Asking simple, but related questions will uncover the information you need to have a more vibrant conversation that helps build <em>the other person’s</em> knowledge base instead of reinforcing <em>your</em> existing knowledge base.</p><p>It’s the<em> </em><a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171177695/why-you-love-that-ikea-table-even-if-its-crooked">IKEA Effect</a> in action: for the same reasons consumers place disproportionately high levels of value on products they’ve assembled themselves, people attribute more value to conversations where they’ve been an active participant in.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Let’s look at some example scenarios of how to get to the IKEA Effect.</p><h2>The Counter-Productive Approach:</h2><p>Other person: <em>"Bitcoin is going to get shut down by the U.S. government."</em></p><p>You: <em>"That’s actually technologically unachievable. It's a distributed network of computer nodes and if you don't understand basic computer science then you’re not really allowed to have an opinion on this."</em></p><p>Other person: <em>“The government can shut down anything they want. They have the top hackers in the world working for them.”</em></p><p>You:<em> “Whatever, you just don’t get it and you’re going to miss out on Bitcoin with that mindset.”</em></p><p>Net: Nobody wins.</p><h2>The More Productive Approach:</h2><p>Other person: <em>"Bitcoin is going to get shut down by the US government."</em></p><p>You: <em>"I thought that at first too. You’d actually be really interested in it. Have you ever looked into distributed networks or cryptography before?</em>"</p><p>Other person: <em>“Not really. I’m not super tech savvy.”</em></p><p>You: <em>"Would you say the separation of money and state is a good or bad thing?</em>"</p><p>Other person: <em>“I’d say it’s a good thing. Inflation is really doing damage and pricing younger generations out of society. It’s funny how much money older generations paid for nice homes with land versus what the situation is now. It’s honestly super unsustainable in my opinion, but I’m no expert.”</em></p><p>You:<em> “Do you see that continuing or improving?”</em></p><p>Other person: <em>“At this point, probably continuing.”</em></p><p>You:<em> “What do you see as a viable alternative?”</em></p><p>Other person: <em>“I’m not sure. Maybe you could explain to me how Bitcoin works?”</em></p><p>Net: Other person talks themselves into Bitcoin.</p><p>Of course, it won’t always be straightforward. But this simple shift in your approach can be the difference between a newbie spending 8 months of their life shitcoining instead of starting out Bitcoin-only in the first place.</p><p>Robert Cialdini discusses in his book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Influence-Psychology-Persuasion-Robert-Cialdini/dp/006124189X">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a>,” which states that humans have a deep psychological need to be perceived as consistent.</p><p>How can we leverage this principle when explaining Bitcoin to others?</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Doing the work to understand the other person’s specific context will lead to a lot less frustration than getting aggressive &amp; annoyed when they fail to see Bitcoin from your perspective.</p><p>It’s the polar opposite of the high-pressure salesperson that jumps straight to the signature on the dotted line.</p><p>The best possible emotion you can invoke in someone when it comes to adopting new technology is curiosity.</p><p>Personal relevance is one of the biggest factors in those early conversations, says Joshua Guest, who provides Bitcoin education at <a href="https://hifibitcoin.substack.com/p/your-bitcoin-one-stop-shop">The HiFi Bitcoin Letters</a>. He explains,<em> “There are few forces in the world that have a greater capacity to change individuals and society for the better than Bitcoin does. So helping new and veteran entrants to the space learn how Bitcoin can be personally relevant to them can have profound results.”</em></p><p>You’re already savvy with Bitcoin as a technology. Why not be equally as savvy at explaining it to newbies?</p><p>The higher our collective conversion rate as a community, the faster the network spreads, and the faster fiat dies.</p><h2>Conclusion: </h2><p>1.

Aside from the occasional blind umpire, the rules are pretty fair and consistent. In our particular game though, let’s pretend I’m not only the opposition but also the umpire, rule maker and historian. When you score a run, I can overturn the call. After the game, I can change whatever rule could have prevented your run in my favor. Just for good measure, because I can, I strike your run from the record books. How long would you want to play before you chose to quit and play a different game?</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Bitcoin’s rules of the game are set and consistently enforced with no entity able to change the rules to benefit themselves.</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>There may be some that prefer playing a game where a central authority makes the call. Seems legit — neither team has ultimate control, so it should be fair, right? In this situation, both sides must (should) agree to not only the rules but who makes and enforces said rules. Unfortunately, human nature creeps in; handshakes are made, backdoor agreements are done and, before you know it, one team has colluded with the central authority to gain some level of control over the ruleset. When a game like this happens, where one side benefits from being nearer to the source of control, we claim the game is rigged.</p><p>Everyone, regardless of political orientation, has witnessed numerous situations where the “other side” has seemed to rig the game in their favor. The easy route is to blame the other side and call them bad, evil or cheaters. The fault lies though in the way the game was set up in the first place. If two sides were playing a game, and I walked up wanting to play, what options would I have? If I had friends on one side, I could jump right in with them. If I were a little more opportunistic, I could watch an inning and determine which side is currently dominating, then join that side. This becomes an endless cycle of not playing the game, but playing the game inside the game — tug of war over the rulebook.</p><p>As I watch this game more intensely, I observe many players looking like they don’t even want to be playing. They look, by choice or unconscious habit, like they are just going through the motions because they either don’t realize that the game is rigged or they do in fact realize the game is rigged and they just keep playing and hoping their side somehow seizes control of the rulebook. It seems like there are a lot of disillusioned spectators. I wonder if they can sense it’s a rigged game.</p><p>The more I watch this game, I notice the players spending an unnecessary amount of time, not actually playing the game, but rather bickering over balls and strikes. Each inning is more about debating the rules than it is playing the game. I wonder why they choose to keep fighting over their game, then I see one of the multitude of rules posted — you must play this game only; players are not allowed to make their own game and rules.</p><p>At this point, I scoff and walk away. The game just loses its appeal. Why would I choose to play a game that I don’t have any say over if or how I get to play or not? Can I consider it a game if I’m coerced to play by an ever-changing rule set manipulated by players with clout and connections? Doesn’t seem fair. What’s not fair about it is not the outputs but the inputs. When the inputs are subject to change by whomever is the most politically connected, the outputs become increasingly distorted. This is not a game I’m willing to play.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What if, when I first walked up to the game already playing, I was perceptive enough to notice it was already rigged. Then I looked across the way and noticed another game. As I watch this game, I notice all players are there voluntarily. Although they have friends playing in the rigged, top-down created game, they’ve chosen to play a game in a fair, bottom-up created game where the rules were set prior to gameplay, no one regardless of power, status, or hierarchy has the ability to change the rules, and the rules are enforced by an impartial observer. This new, fairer game is Bitcoin.</p><p>As venerable gigabrain <a href="https://twitter.com/breedlove22/status/1525969907380195328?s=46&amp;t=e0bG2k6FYtj09M48OxohoQ">Robert Breedlove states</a>, “<em>In games, fixed rules lead to peaceful gameplay. If you’re spending time fighting over the rules of the game, then you’re not playing the game, you’re engaging in politics. In economics, such fighting lessens aggregate wealth creation. Bitcoin is fixed rules fixing economics</em>.”</p><p>As far as this meager rules-based article is concerned, spoiler alert, Bitcoin is the ultimate tool to compensate us for our time and energy in a way that is moral, unconvoluted, incentivised, and unwaveringly enforced. On the other hand, fiat and now Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are in stark contrast.</p><p>While you may want a game’s rules to be set and consistently enforced with no entity able to change the rules to benefit themselves, the centralized ruleset of fiat and CBDCs are ever-changing, ever-growing, and immorally incentivised to benefit those with the control. While aiming for a monetary system that is equal is admirable, it presupposes the people creating the rules will not succumb to human nature and adjust the rules to benefit themselves and their immediate circle. Can you criticize fiat (and eventually CBDCs’) umpires without getting kicked out of the game? Well, you can just ask <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-fueled-canada-trucker-convoy">truck drivers in northern North America</a> or nonviolent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/21/europe/europe-lockdown-protests-violence-intl/index.html">citizens in Europe</a>…</p><p>Furthermore, allowing a central authority to change the rules at their whim, we are allowing damaging incentives to enter into the game. This manipulates basic market economic signals, which distorts reality. When one small group has the ability to choose who plays (permission to spend), adjusting pitch clocks (money expiration), have only one scoring card (centralized “node”), inconsistently enforced (unpredictable policy), or scoring based on perceived “niceness” (social credit scores), you create a game that’s immoral, convoluted, incentively misaligned, and inconsistently enforced.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin … well, fixes this. It’s a fair game. It’s ironic that early Bitcoiners were ones who disregarded legacy rules to opt into a fair, rule-based system; rules without rulers, ya know? Playing the game of Bitcoin, you can play knowing the rules are fair (spend without permission or expiration), you can have ownership over the rules (run your own node &amp; securely self-custody), and you can play the game more freely with predictable and set rules (fixed supply &amp; monetary policy). You can do all this by simply opting out of the current centralized game of fiat and its digital kissing cousin, CBDCs.</p><p>Thank you for reading.

No point operating if you can’t get the bleeding under control because the patient will die. Money facilitates mutual exchange and helps market actors coordinate price discovery — it is the literal blood of the economy. As fiat currencies slowly bleed out in value, they incentivize fewer people to save. If you want to stop the bleeding in your financial life, you are going to need to find a way to store your wealth in something else. There are plenty of options, but only one that is programmed to stop all bleeding in 2140.</p><p>As peoples’ money bleeds out, so too does their education, time and, I’d even argue, their mental sanity. Blood isn’t oozing out egregiously, but rather being siphoned off from tiny cuts, so most people do not even realize it’s happening. This is a hard pill to swallow. Most Western societies teach people not to question authority: raise your hand if you want to ask questions, and trust the experts. Breaking out of this mentality is difficult. Watch this<a href="https://twitter.com/canindependent/status/1595460390045028352?s=20&amp;t=qIFHdHF4A-8z4nmfle5Mqw"> clip</a> of the White House press secretary to get an idea of how those at the top will treat people who dare question the narrative. </p><h2>Pain Is The Best Teacher</h2><p>Narrative is everything when trying to coerce the masses to accept a “Great Reset” (if you have no idea what the Great Reset is, you can read about it <a href="https://alilybit.substack.com/p/what-the-fuck-is-going-on">here</a>). The scope of this article won’t cover what the Davos elite is attempting to impose on the rest of the world, but rather why Bitcoin stops money from bleeding out. Trying to calculate all of the variables that bring about the emergent, complex behavior of society is futile.

The Federal Reserve is following up its quantitative easing with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-22/fed-s-new-normal-for-pace-of-tightening-may-be-hard-to-escape">tightening monetary policy at record paces trying to get inflation under control</a>. This demand destruction is wreaking havoc all over the economy but is necessary to weed out unprofitable businesses. </p><p>For better or worse, pain is the best teacher. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6CTHoTTMyo">Hard Money</a> recently reported that Trezor has seen a 300% increase in sales revenue after the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX debacle</a>. The whole point of Bitcoin is to not trust ,but verify for yourself. Many ignored this because FTX had the stamp of approval from many mainstream news outlets, politicians and celebrities. </p><p>In the wake of its blow, FTX created tons of new Bitcoin maximalists who now understand why not verifying Bitcoin with your own node means that you are trusting potentially-corrupt third parties. The mainstream media is not doing itself any favors with puff pieces like the one below. Articles like this only serve to increase the pain of those who were robbed and convince more people that the mainstream narrative is corrupt:</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>But Self Education Helps Too</h2><p>The remedy to most of these problems is a better education. Tools like Saylor.org, Udemy and plenty of others have lowered the barrier tremendously. It just requires a desire to learn. </p><p>For me, I found that desire by going down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. Ironically, answering one question would lead me to more questions and that number of questions grew exponentially. It made me wonder how much people are not taught intentionally during their traditional schooling. There is only so much time in the day and teachers must prioritize their curriculums accordingly. I just don’t understand why taxes, how to vote and basic financial literacy aren’t at the top of most public school curriculums. The reader can come to their own conclusions. What’s important is finding a teacher who speaks your language and a subject that brings out your natural curiosity. Learning becomes one of the most euphoric feelings in the world when those two needs are met.</p><p>The standard way of learning has horrible mental models for teaching people, like memorizing things for a test. Oscar Wilde is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4829-experience-is-merely-the-name-men-gave-to-their-mistakes">quoted as saying</a>, “Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.” People are so focused on learning from the experts that they forget that those who changed the world didn’t ask for permission to do so. They just did it. People want a hero to fix all of their problems but the truth is that no one is coming to save you. I’m not saying one should not find great mentors; it’s super valuable being able to listen to those who have become experts in their fields in order to learn. I’m saying one should not worship people like gods who can’t make mistakes. Just look at Sam Bankman-Friend, who many thought was a hero.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Despite all of the educational content out there, the reality is most people will come to understand the difference between paper bitcoin and bitcoin you actually hold the keys for via an expensive lesson. When the majority of Bitcoiners self custody their coins, and stop blindly trusting their heroes, that is when we will see fireworks in regards to bitcoin’s price action. Every person is different and has various forms of risk tolerance. For those who are discouraged by recent events, remember: Rome was not built in a day. Sometimes the only way to get a lesson through someone’s head is for them to suffer the pain of said mistake. </p><h2>FTX And Central Planners Are Not So Different</h2><p>What’s interesting about watching FTX fail so rapidly is that the same thing would happen with our traditional financial system if we didn’t have central banks acting as lenders of last resort. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/10/ftx-violated-its-own-terms-of-service-and-misused-user-funds-lawyers-say/">FTX violated its own terms of service by using customer funds to make bets</a>, but 99.9% of the world just turns a blind eye when banks do this because their terms of service legally allow fractional reserve banking. </p><p>In his book “<a href="https://www.econlib.org/library/Mises/HmA/msHmA.html?chapter_num=6#book-reader">Human Action</a>,”<em> </em>Ludwig von Mises writes:</p><blockquote><p>“The rich, the owners of the already operating plants, have no particular class interest in the maintenance of free competition. They are opposed to confiscation and expropriation of their fortunes, but their vested interests are rather in favor of measures preventing newcomers from challenging their position. Those fighting for free enterprise and free competition do not defend the interests of those rich today. They want a free hand left to unknown men who will be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and whose ingenuity will make the life of coming generations more agreeable. They want the way left open to further economic improvements. They are the spokesmen of progress.”</p></blockquote><p>Technology getting better should lead to massive deflation from productivity gains. Regulatory moats and monopolies prevent this. Fractional reserve banking creates an inflationary environment where tons of capital is misallocated. In a free market, most commercial banks would be insolvent. </p><p>FTX tried to create its own fractional reserve monopoly by <a href="https://www.grid.news/story/economy/2022/11/21/how-ftx-played-both-parties-and-almost-won-washington/">lobbying Congress</a> and creating a regulatory moat around its business which would’ve made it impossible for competitors to compete in the crypto ecosystem. The world is fortunate FTX’s system blew up before it was able to get its way with D.C. </p><p>Mises was right: It is not the incumbents who will create a more agreeable future, it is entrepreneurs and ideas competing in a free market. Bitcoin has over <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/number-of-cryptocurrencies">10,000 competitors</a>, and that number is growing every day. Many, if not all of these tokens, are Ponzi schemes in my opinion, but the idea that D.C could do a better job deciding this than the free market could is ridiculous. </p><p>I understand regulation is difficult when technology is changing things at such rapid rates. The little piece of glass in our pocket allows us to hail a ride, order food or listen to some of the greatest minds on the planet whenever we want. All of these things would seem magical to someone who lived before the creation of smartphones. There are going to be hiccups along the way as humanity tries to come to grips with these new tools. This is why I keep this Hal Finney quote as my Twitter header:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzkzMTM0NDg5MTUwOTgx/hal-finney.jpg" height="206" width="620">

    </figure><p>For all of the wonders that technology can do for humanity, it can also drive a whole new level of control. Free markets lead to optimal price discovery. Too much central planning and markets start to break. Price discovery in a free market is like a hash function. It takes inputs of data and spits out an output that only goes one way. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmtzX-NPFDc">With a normal hash</a>, the algorithm works so that it is unfeasible to reverse-calculate the data. You can verify a hash by making sure the same output is achieved based on the input, but you can’t take the output and figure out the input. In this same vein, a free market will set the price of a good, but you can’t figure out how all of the labor, work, travel and other variables created the price of the good. The function only goes one way. </p><p>Market actors get upset when the coercion variable is notched up and price increases happen. The blame is typically pushed on to the producers rather than the central planners who are causing such issues. Sound familiar? Like say the U.S. government, which is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-oil-companies-unprecedented-profits/">calling out greedy fossil fuel companies</a> for raising the price of gas <a href="https://twitter.com/CurtisHouck/status/1582815157587435520?s=20&amp;t=ka4sWSFgn2gze-DdfIKBkw">while at the same time advocating for the end of fossil fuel use</a>. If price controls are imposed, price discovery completely breaks down, resulting in shortages. Until the creation of money is no longer heavily intermingled with politics these issues will continue to play out.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is More Important Now Than Ever</h2><p>As central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and digital identities are rolled out, it has never been more important to point out why Bitcoin is the remedy. Bitcoin allows the individual to go down a hero’s journey where they can keep the value of their labor in their head. CBDCs and digital IDs offer governments tools to enact monetary policy at the individual level, be at the center of every transaction and turn off people’s money as they see fit. </p><p>Bitcoin offers a better system, one that no one can cheat if they want to be in consensus with the rest of the network.<a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh"> Preston Pysh</a> said it best: “Bitcoin is like the infinity stone.” It takes a great deal of faith to hold on to an asset that has had <a href="https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/fjwealth/blog/2947128-Bitcoin-drawdowns-from-previous-all-time-highs/">multiple 70% to 90% drawdowns</a> before recovering to new all-time highs. Not many can hang on to their bitcoin but those who do over long periods of time are greatly rewarded. </p><p>The network effects of Bitcoin are insane. There is a<a href="https://bitcoin.rocks"> Bitcoin website</a> paying people 21,000 satoshis to post a sticker that it ships to you around their cities. Think about that. You can earn sats and increase the value of those sats by helping raise awareness. Bitcoin is full of these win-win scenarios. The tech is exciting, but the passion I see from Bitcoiners in real life is unlike anything I’ve ever seen before.</p><p>Bitcoin as a technology, a new form of money and an idea are bringing hope to humans around the world who have been disadvantaged because governments have a monopoly on violence. Bitcoin empowers the individual to fight back like never before. There will be growing pains along the way and more turmoil in the short term for those obsessed with measuring things in fiat. The way to fix that is to orient yourself around the new system. </p><p>The possibilities that will come out of this Bitcoin renaissance are endless. Grappling with what this new form of money means is difficult because the world is full of so many paradoxes. When you learn, you become smarter by ending up with more questions. Monopolies have brought about some of the most prosperous and technologically advanced times in human civilizations while also making George Orwell’s “1984” look like a very plausible path for the future. The internet is connecting people like never before and at the same time, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/2022/01/massive-meta-analysis-finds-loneliness-has-increased-in-emerging-adults-in-the-last-43-years-62377">loneliness is increasing</a>. Number go up technology is associated with greed and is what initially attracts people to Bitcoin, yet many stay because they realize Bitcoin is the true effective altruism movement. These paradoxes are a bit mind bending but I do think there is value to be had from chewing on these ideas.</p><p>It can be easy to get bogged down with all of the bleeding going on in the fiat world. Bitcoin is the Band-Aid to fix it. It gives me a lot of confidence knowing my money is secured by open-source software and math rather than <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/structure-federal-reserve-system.htm">12 individuals</a> who decide when it is okay to steal and when it’s time to practice fiscal austerity. </p><p>I’m glad the Fed has finally decided to do the right thing for the economy but it has manipulated the cost of capital for so long that it now risks destroying the entire system if it keeps tightening. The problem is that the Fed’s only other option is to lower rates again, which causes more bleeding via inflation. Bitcoin offers humanity a way out of this paradox where central planners try to fix the bleeding by siphoning more blood out of the patient. Every time central planners manipulate the cost of capital it becomes more clear that market participants are playing a rigged game. Bitcoin is the fairest game humanity has ever created and the best chance we have of separating money and state.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Conor Chepenik.

At the end of November, we saw a 13.1% decline in hash rate from all-time highs. However, of the major hash rate declines since 2016, that’s still relatively small compared to the handful of down periods over 15% during that time. </p><p>The latest 7.32% downward difficulty adjustment is a direct response to all of that hash rate going offline. As we stand today, the hash rate is right around 250 EH/s and down 7.84% from its all-time high of approximately 273 EH/s. This is the largest downward difficulty adjustment we’ve seen since July 2021, when we saw a series of downward difficulty adjustments following the Chinese mining ban. This should bring some temporary relief to current miners, but it's too early to say if this trend in declining hash rate has already concluded.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In bitcoin terms, miners' stock performance continues to fall this year when looking at year-to-date returns versus bitcoin performance. The hash price bear market is alive and well, which has been a core thesis for us when evaluating the current prospects of investing in public miners versus bitcoin. Any miner outperformance in bitcoin short-term has proven to be an opportunity in the market to reprice the equity lower. </p><p>Looking at the market caps of a proxy basket of six public bitcoin miners shows just how much value has been wiped out from 2021. After a 452% rise in value to its November 2021 peak of $19.1 billion, the market wiped out 90% of value in less than a year.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While the worst of the drawdown of public miner market capitalizations and hash price (miner revenue per tera hash) has already taken place, we expect that the tough conditions can last for a sustained period of time, squeezing many market participants along the way. The recent downward difficulty adjustment brought about some relief, but it is barely sufficient for many miners who purchased the bulk of their machines in 2021, expecting $30,000 as their “worst-case scenario.” </p><p>Throw in an environment where global energy prices and interest rates have skyrocketed and many operations are facing immensely difficult circumstances — particularly hosting facilities where companies serve as intermediaries for customers looking to reap the benefits of mining bitcoin. The elephant in the room for the state of the mining industry is the reality that some of the industry’s biggest hosting facilities are either already bankrupt, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy or are completely out of deployable hash rate for idle ASICs. </p><p>We will be intently watching hash rate and the state of the mining industry going forward. Although the industry has been bludgeoned over the course of 2022, we suspect it isn’t out of the woods quite yet. </p><p>The beauty of bitcoin and capitalism is that only the strong will survive. Regardless, blocks will continue to be mined every approximately 10 minutes.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1600880790493069314"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><figure>

Even though they got a late start because of snowfall the night before, there was a sense of eager anticipation in the air.</p><p>Ryan Brisch, a Denver Bitcoiner, had been frequently talking to his significant other about issues Bitcoin could help solve, or some new Bitcoin product that he was excited about. His wife, Nicole, is a sixth grade math teacher at STRIVE Prep and had started to respond that he should come and speak to her class about some of the basic mathematical foundations of Bitcoin. </p><p>In October, Nicole was telling Brisch about an enrichment class led by her coworker, Rawa Abu Alsamah, which was working with an outside group, <a href="https://teamwethrive.org/">We Thrive</a>. We Thrive offers entrepreneurial apprenticeships in which youth start their own ventures, earn real revenue and gain mentorship. Alsamah’s seventh- and eighth-grade students were creating their own businesses through the guidance of We Thrive and would be selling their products at a pop-up market later in the month. </p><p>When hearing about this event, Brisch’s first question was, ‘’Do you think they would be interested in being able to buy and sell their products in bitcoin?” </p><p>From there, the idea was in motion and Brisch reached out to his local Bitcoin Telegram group for the content experts that would be needed to make the idea work. Anthony Feliciano and Mark Maraia quickly volunteered not only their expertise on money, Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, but also their time, energy and sats. Over the next three weeks, Brisch, Feliciano and Maraia, met, spoke and quickly devised a plan of action. Maraia would teach the kids about money and Bitcoin and Feliciano would focus on the use of the Muun wallet and the Lightning Network. </p><p>The first week’s presentation was focused on getting the students to think about money, how it worked, who currently controlled it and then question them about how it could be different and how the Bitcoin network and monetary system worked. It ended with a little homework assignment: to download Muun wallet. The next week, the morning of the pop-up shop, the three men were back at the school, passing out sats that were fundraised over the previous week and showing students how to create and pay invoices. Needless to say, the digital-native students took to Muun wallet and Lightning payments like fish to water! </p><p>On that cold snowy morning, dozens of student vendors arrived before the pop-up event so they could learn how to receive sats in payment for their product or service from other students. The plan called for these students to use the Lightning Network exclusively and that meant the student entrepreneurs needed to know how to create an invoice.</p><p>These student entrepreneurs received $5 to start their day and were encouraged to let the other students know they would accept payment in sats. Within a few minutes, each student had learned wallet basics and went to their booth armed with the knowledge of how to accept bitcoin in payment for their product or service. (The week prior, they had raised about $500 in bitcoin as seed capital for this event with support from a generous group of Rocky Mountain Bitcoiners.)</p><p>Earlier that morning, these young entrepreneurs had set up their booth in the school gym featuring signage which advertised their product/service and a price list offering a wide variety of goods such as homemade cupcakes, cookies, waffles and other handmade goods as well as services such as neck shaves and shoe shines. </p><p>The event began with the students downloading Muun wallet and learning how to create invoices. Next, the students were all instructed to create Lightning invoices to receive $5 worth of sats, as they headed down to the pop-up shop in the gymnasium. Just over 80 students and a couple of teachers were loaded with sats to spend. Some of the boldest students came back to reload after they spent their first sats. It really was a sight to see, just a mere few hours earlier, students were downloading Muun. Sooner after, merchants were creating invoices for goods, kids were running around performing transactions, and through all of the excitement, you could hear merchants yelling “I accept bitcoin!”</p><p>The level of enthusiasm that the students showed toward learning how to send and receive sats was inspiring and would make any Bitcoiner optimistic about our future. The event was a huge success, with many of the students thanking our local Bitcoiners for the lessons and sats. The students, being digital natives, were able to grasp how to use the technology with incredible ease. They were all told of the importance of remembering their four-digit code and using the security features to backup and recover the Muun wallet as needed. This began their first, tentative steps toward owning a form of property with a level of responsibility that none had ever known. </p><p>By the end of the event, the most industrious vendors held more than 180,000 sats in their wallets and a growing awareness that this new kind of money spelled opportunity. </p><p>Our local Bitcoiners also took the time to educate a few of the teachers on how to download a wallet and receive sats. After receiving sats on her Muun wallet, one teacher was blown away with the idea that she didn’t have to provide a phone number, or an address, or a social security number and that it did not require permission from a bank or government. All it takes is a phone and an internet connection to send money to someone on the other side of the world.</p><p>And as our local Bitcoiners left the event, there were many shouts of thanks as they walked out confident that the rabbit hole was drawing near for a new crop of bitcoiners. At the very least, a cohort of seventh and eighth graders were much more curious about Bitcoin. </p><p>The only thing that can top that feeling is to see another million Bitcoiners march into a local school near them and do something similar.

Is that truly a victory for democracy and for the kind of psycho-spiritual wellbeing of all of us and the lives we want to live? Versus something like Bitcoin, that’s a definancializing force that basically says because we think a world might be better where you’re actually able to save money and you don’t just have to spend it or go invest or speculate on some stuff, would that unlock ways for you to feel more fulfilled or satisfied as a person and would you then be able to pursue other things? I think ultimately the end of Bitcoin is that we all think collectively less about money and more about other things that we’re interested in.”</em></p><p>I made these statements on a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRGhFW-a2mQ&amp;t=2096s">episode</a> of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast in a discussion about Bitcoin and the ways I think it can catalyze positive changes in our interior lives, as contrasted with the contemporary state of Web 3.</p><p>We frequently discuss and theorize the ways in which Bitcoin can reshape or reconfigure our external realities, whether they be political, monetary, legislative, etc. But I don’t think enough attention is paid to how Bitcoin can initiate a similarly monumental reshaping of our interior lives, a process which, in the aggregate, can lead to a trickling <em>up </em>of priorities and values.</p><p>I want to talk about two different conceptions of freedom to illustrate why I think we fixate so much on one of them. When folks describe themselves as “freedom maximalists,” they’re primarily referring to the idea of negative freedom, a freedom <em>from</em> intrusive external constraints. This type of freedom is obviously of fundamental, paramount importance. Without freedom from certain external constraints, meaningful pursuit of self-realization, what we would refer to as positive freedom, is difficult, if not impossible to pursue.</p><p>We tend to get so focused on the negative freedom aspects of Bitcoin that we fail to fully appreciate the positive freedom that Bitcoin facilitates. Which is to say we get so fixated on the ways in which Bitcoin precludes external intrusions or constraints (freedom <em>from) </em>that we don’t explore the ways in which Bitcoin can create an environment that allows us to more rigorously pursue the fullest expression of our selves (freedom <em>to</em>).</p><p><em>[N.B. for my humanities/philosophy friends: Yes, I am drawing on the work of Isaiah Berlin with these positive/negative freedom terms]</em></p><p>I would argue that freedom maximalism is not sustainably fulfilling long-term, because it’s not really an end state. It’s a necessary liminal posture, a means to achieving a certain environment in which positive freedom can be productively exercised. However, negative freedom without positive freedom is like having an infinite number of TV channels but no idea what you want to watch. It’s like having the freedom to pursue anything you want without any way of determining what you actually want to pursue or what’s worth pursuing.</p><p>Americans are particularly attuned to ideas of negative freedom, but not particularly adept when it comes to positive freedom. We can see this everywhere, including in the Bitcoin space. If one makes a living, builds a following, or crafts an entire identity around being a “freedom maximalist,” one’s livelihood and sense of self depends on the continuing existence of external constraints for one to decry. One can unwittingly (and mostly subconsciously) become the bird that has grown to love its cage, as author Lewis Hyde once wrote of irony.</p><p>So while freedom maximalism (negative freedom) is vitally important, we should also pursue and prioritize what my wife has aptly coined <em>intentionality maximalism</em> (positive freedom), which is a perspective and a way of living in our interior lives. Bitcoin does not get enough credit for its ability and its potential to foster this type of inward-looking change.</p><p>What does intentionality maximalism look like in our everyday experience of life? One salient example is our relationship with the unbridled consumerism endemic in a fiat monetary system.</p><p>Allow me to share some statistics that illustrate just how warped this relationship has become:</p><p>Per the Los Angeles Times, there are 300,000 items in the average American home.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5525283">NPR</a>, the average size of the American home has nearly tripled in size over the past 50 years.</p><p>Nevertheless, one out of every ten Americans rent offsite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06self-storage-t.html?em&amp;_r=0">storage</a>, which is the fastest growing segment of the commercial real estate industry over the past four decades.</p><p>British <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/8074156/Ten-year-olds-have-7000-worth-of-toys-but-play-with-just-330.html">research</a> found that the average 10-year-old owns 238 toys but plays with just 12 daily.</p><p>The average American family spends $1,700 on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2015/01/15/the-real-cost-of-your-shopping-habits/?sh=236aaef41452">clothes</a> annually, while also throwing away, on average, 65 pounds of <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/closet-cast-offs-clogging_b_554400">clothing</a> per year.</p><p>You get the idea. There is practically no end to the data showing the absurd amount of shit we own and the growing space (physical and mental) that this shit occupies.</p><p>Americans are consuming more than ever.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What explains this? One factor is that we measure our economic health by how much we spend, a singularly fiat and Keynesian way of gauging economic vitality. Consumer spending is roughly 70% of GDP. If we spend less, the metric we use to gauge economic health drops.</p><p>There’s also the fact that we see more ads than ever.</p><p>But, most importantly, there’s a widespread high time preference that is, I think, part of the very fabric of our culture.</p><p>Here’s where I think Bitcoin comes into play. So much of this rat-race orgy of consumption is high-time-preference behavior incentivized by the fiat monetary system, which ensures your money loses value over time. Since your purchasing power is sand in an hourglass, and since you work harder than ever just to keep up, consumer spending serves both a practical and a pacifying purpose. In other words, we are incentivized to spend because not spending or investing means our money just sits and loses value. And if we work so hard, many of us at jobs we don’t particularly enjoy, just to keep up, shouldn’t we also buy all the new cool stuff to make us feel like it’s all worth it?</p><p>If we remove ourselves from some of the rat race stuff it clears space for us to think less about money, which means we can be more intentional about everything else. Hence the idea of intentionality maximalism. We sort of reclaim our positive freedom, our freedom to pursue the highest expression of ourselves. Bitcoin, in my opinion, is ultimately about looking for a sustainable alternative to the rat-race model.</p><p>It’s really a contrast of values. Consumerism is a value of the fiat system. It is both literally a value, since we measure economic health in large part by measuring consumption, and also an ingrained mode of behavior. By disincentivizing mindless, reflexive consumption and incentivizing a lower time preference, Bitcoin, if it continues to grow in adoption, offers the promise of a cultural foregrounding of deeper things, like fulfilling pursuits, relationships, creativity, contribution to community, presence, etc.</p><p>When it comes to this interior transformation, this intentionality maximalism, and the ways in which Bitcoin moves us in that direction, I think Bitcoin shares some fundamental principles with minimalism, a movement that has deep, ancient roots, but has been gathering more popular momentum in the last decade or so. Proponents of minimalism, mindful of the constraints unchecked consumerism can place on our lived experience, pursue lives with fewer unused, unnecessary possessions in order to reclaim freedom and mastery over one’s life and the space to pursue what’s important. Which is to say the pursuit of a more intentional life.</p><p>Joshua Fields Millburn, co-founder of <a href="https://www.theminimalists.com/">theminimalists.com</a>, describes minimalism as “the thing that gets us past the things so we can make room for life’s important things—which aren’t <em>things</em> at all.”</p><p><strong>The promise of Bitcoin, to borrow Millburn’s articulation, is to be the money that, through its soundness, allows us to get past thinking about money all the time so that we can make room for life’s important things - which tend to get lost, neglected, and/or sacrificed in consumption and the systemically coerced pursuit of more and more money.</strong></p><p>We spend so much time thinking about money (how to get it, how to get more of it, how to make it grow, how to keep up with inflation, how to invest it, how to spend it, what to spend it on, how to get rich quick, how to pay the bills, etc). And to a certain extent this will always be true. I am not advocating for the Platonic form of communism here.</p><p>But when money does not hold its value, when it is continuously debased, when the sovereign debt is so massive it must be inflated away, and when the economic health of a country is measured by how much it consumes, it creates an environment in which money is practically all we think about.</p><p>This is why I have been so critical/skeptical of some of the proposals in other corners of the crypto world, many of which seem to be seeking to financialize every corner of our lives. I think this perpetuates, and perhaps intensifies, our high-time-preference environment.</p><p>In contrast, the implications and downstream effects of collectively lowering our time preference, which I think necessarily involves less consumerism, simply cannot be understated. Imagine an entire population finally able to save in a sound money and to spend more time and energy on the things that mean the most to them.</p><p>Now, again, I’m not envisioning a utopian end-state here where we’re all singing songs around the campfire (though I do enjoy songs and campfires). I’m talking about returning some headspace and some presence back to folks who have, by necessity, grown accustomed to spending every waking moment thinking about money and consumption. I’m talking about a transformation of our interior lives, one that clears space for more intentional living. And I think an under-appreciated aspect of Bitcoin is its potential to catalyze such a transformation.</p><p>So be a freedom maximalist, because it’s important. But don’t stop there, because that alone won’t keep you full, long-term. Be an intentionality maximalist, too.</p><p>Many people live lives like this - compelled, constrained, and unintentional within a fiat system:</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9dZQelULDk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9dZQelULDk"><em>Happiness</em></a></p><p>I think Bitcoin is about escaping this.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Logan Bolinger.

Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” </em>In other words what really drives the fiat monetary to a great extent is trust, because without it the system as we know it wouldn’t be functional, however the trust is being placed in untrustworthy individuals and institutions. The Bitcoin monetary system is trustless and decentralized by design and is reliant on cryptographic proof instead, thus removing altogether the need for “trusted intermediaries” in every financial interaction, from the central bank all the way down to transactions between individuals.</p><p><a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">The Blocksize War</a> of 2015-2017 is one of the most significant events in Bitcoin’s history. This was really a battle between those that favored centralization of the protocol by a handful of developers, exchanges and miners (akin to what you have in Ethereum today) versus those that favored decentralization, security and resilience over the long term. For the first time in its existence Bitcoin faced a potential hostile takeover engineered by powerful corporate entities that wanted to capture and impose their will on Bitcoin. What started out as a disagreement on how to scale Bitcoin, whether the size limit of the blocks that make up the Bitcoin blockchain should be increased or not, eventually morphed into a two year long tug of war over the very soul of Bitcoin itself. Two camps emerged; the “big blockers'', who were in favor of increasing the<a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-block-size/"> block size</a> as their priority was ensuring faster and cheaper transactions at the base layer thus making Bitcoin into a global payments system that would rival Visa (i.e. corporate control); and the “small blockers'' who were more focused on Bitcoin being a new form of money, which had to remain fully decentralized if it was to achieve the goal of separating money and state (i.e. individual control).</p><p>Jan3 CEO, Samson Mow, who was at the frontlines of the block size war, in a recent<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war"> article</a> made the following remark about the small blockers, <em>“They prioritized integrity, resilience and security, arguing that if blocks became big, it would become expensive for users to run a node and would thus incentivize hosting nodes in data centers; a one-way street towards centralization and control by a few, not much different from other systems like banks. This would mean the death of the dream of an apolitical, incorruptible, decentralized money.”</em> The small blockers foresaw a scenario in which overtime it would be expensive for users to run full Bitcoin nodes which would have led to further centralization and thus recreating the trusted third parties in another form; the very middlemen that Bitcoin was designed to disrupt. Satoshi designed Bitcoin with the intention of it remaining a technically and socially robust peer-to-peer (P2P) network which should never be “corrupted” through centralization. He summarized it<a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/"> this way</a>, <em>“Digital signatures provide part of the solution, </em><em>but the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required</em><em> to prevent double-spending.”</em></p><p>In order for Bitcoin to remain user-controlled, every attempt or form of centralization has to be fiercely resisted, especially given the innate human tendency to lean more towards centralized systems with a leader. If a handful of business entities and developers could force such a significant change without consensus would that not be akin to how the Federal Reserve plans the economy by dictating interest rates and maintaining “price stability?” As stated earlier, it wasn’t just about block sizes anymore but it was now an ideological clash about control. Who had control, was it the users or the miners or the developers that would steer the protocol? In the book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM"> “The Blocksize War<em>,</em>”</a> the author accurately described this phenomenon and how it was an underlying driver for the big blockers when he noted;</p><p>“<em>In some people’s minds, the idea of a system controlled by end users is too difficult to grasp. Instead, they look for somebody or some entity who controls the system. Some people cannot fathom the idea of a system which has global consensus, but lacks a leader...As for whether Bitcoin really is the leaderless system it proclaims to be and whether this will always remain the case, the jury is still out. However, after the drama and shenanigans of the blocksize war, one thing is clear: there is still hope that the claim is true.”</em></p><p>Ultimately, it was the small blockers that prevailed and as a result Bitcoin remained firmly in the users’ control.</p><p>When it comes to Bitcoin most of the attention is focused on bitcoin the asset and less on the infrastructure required to maintain this global, decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. While the small blockers’ victory in the blocksize war secured Bitcoin’s path towards future mass adoption, it still remains unclear to most people why running a node is so important that it was worth fighting for. Let’s start by defining what a node is. A full node is any computer that maintains and stores the entire Bitcoin blockchain; in order to verify and record new transactions as they happen, according to a common set of network consensus rules. In the absence of a central party, it’s these nodes that act as referees of the Bitcoin network by independently validating all transactions and blocks; and filtering out invalid transactions. This is how the Bitcoin network removes trust in any centralized entity and ensures the integrity of its 21 million supply cap. </p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzMxMTAyMDA4MTI0OTMz/image1.png" height="312" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>While running a full node is important, it’s still optional to do so. Running a full node, grants anyone the ability to broadcast transactions (or blocks) on a permissionless basis. The more nodes there are on the network, the more decentralized Bitcoin becomes. This not only increases redundancy, but it results in Bitcoin being more secure by making it increasingly harder to corrupt or censor. Each full node executes the consensus rules of the network, an important element being Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr,<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-independence-day%3A-luke-dashjr-on-the-lessons-from-segwit-that-were-forgetting"> perfectly summarized</a> it this way, <em>“All of Bitcoin’s advantages — including its security from outright theft and the 21 million BTC cap — stem from the assumption that the majority of the economy are using their own full nodes to verify payments to them. Centralized verification and third-party/custodial wallets are a bigger threat to Bitcoin than anything else.” </em>In other words, nodes are very important parts of the Bitcoin network’s defense mechanism with regards to processing transactions, and they are the last line of defense against centralization and malicious actors. More information regarding running your own node can be found <a href="https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/">here.</a></p><p>Despite the critical role that nodes play in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it’s<a href="https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html"> estimated</a> that the number of Bitcoin nodes has dropped considerably from a peak of 200,000 in 2018 to less than 45,000 today as of time of writing according to Dashjr’s data. Given the fact that users being able to run full nodes was one of the biggest factors that culminated in the blocksize war, it’s definitely of great concern that we are seeing a reduction of nodes on the network in 2022 when compared with 2018. This could potentially make the Bitcoin network less secure and much more prone to centralization. Furthermore from a geographical standpoint, 32.8% of Bitcoin nodes globally are located in just seven countries — the United States, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, as of time of writing according to<a href="https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/"> data</a> from BTC nodes analytics platform <em>Bitnodes.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Ironically in the global south where there is a huge need for Bitcoin from a financial inclusion perspective, there is a paucity of Bitcoin nodes in that part of the world. There are numerous reasons that can explain the decrease of Bitcoin nodes or the lack thereof in other regions; firstly there are a lot of people that are not educated about the importance of running a full Bitcoin node, especially given the current obsession with number go up. Secondly, due to the significant bandwidth usage of Bitcoin full nodes especially as the network scales, the costs of doing so are prohibitive; especially in places with subpar internet connectivity. This is where Erlay comes in. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf">Erlay</a> is a new efficient transaction relay protocol that aims to significantly minimize the bandwidth usage required to connect Bitcoin full nodes. </p><p>Approximately 50% of the bandwidth required to run a Bitcoin node is used just for announcing transactions. When a new bitcoin transaction is broadcast, it is sent to all nodes on Bitcoin’s p2p network and this occurs in two ways. Firstly, after receiving a transaction, a node sends a transaction identifier (i.e. transaction ID) to all of the peers it’s connected with. This transaction ID is subsequently verified by all these peers to ensure that they haven’t received the transaction in question from another peer. If not, the whole transaction is requested from the node that sent the transaction ID. This process repeats continuously and the end result is that there is a plethora of redundant messages being shared on the Bitcoin network, thus unnecessarily consuming a lot of bandwidth. It’s<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf"> estimated </a>that 44% of overall bandwidth used between nodes consists of these redundant messages. The long and short of it is that this approach has high redundancy and poor bandwidth efficiency. The bandwidth costs therefore become a huge impediment for some users to run a full node, which severely limits the extent of decentralization of the network. <br><br></p><p>Secondly, the decentralized nature of the network gives rise to another critical issue with regards to Bitcoin’s node connectivity, which is that it also uses large amounts of bandwidth to keep the connection open with all the other nodes. In other words the current protocol increases bandwidth consumption as the number of connections between nodes increases. This also increases the costs to run a Bitcoin full node as the network scales, which would make the network more prone to centralization. Over and above that, since the security of the Bitcoin network is heavily reliant on the connectivity between nodes (i.e. higher connectivity results in a more secure network) fewer connections between nodes would be bandwidth efficient but would result in a less secure and borderline centralized network. According to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf">white paper</a> that was co-authored by Gleb Naumenko, Bryan Bishop, Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Alexandara Fedorova and Ivan Beschastnikh; Erlay will reduce the amount of bandwidth required to maintain current levels of connectivity between<a href="https://coinrivet.com/dictionary/bitcoin/"> </a>Bitcoin nodes by 40%, while simultaneously maintaining bandwidth usage as the connectivity between nodes increases. To put this in perspective, currently a connection to 32 nodes utilizes approximately 17.3GB per month to relay transactions and Erlay drastically reduces this to a meager 0.94GB per month! This is a huge quantum leap for bandwidth efficiency as shown by the diagrams below:<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf"></a></p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzMxMTAyMDA4MDU5Mzk3/image2.png" height="239" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The paper further states that; “<em>By allowing more connections at a small cost, Erlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate, Erlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin node of a transaction.” </em> In other words Erlay significantly improves bandwidth efficiency by reducing bandwidth used for transaction relay as well as scalability of connections between peers thus making the network more resistant to <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~mohaisen/doc/icdcs19d.pdf">partitioning attacks</a> and fortifies single nodes against <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-an-eclipse-attack">eclipse attacks.</a> While Erlay protocol support signaling has successfully merged into<a href="https://blockchainreporter.net/bitcoin/"> </a>Bitcoin core, this was a development that took three and a half years to materialize, given the extensive review and testing that had to be done beforehand, because stability and security at the base layer are everything.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While Bitcoin is a significant breakthrough in creating a trustless and decentralized monetary system with superior monetary properties, its success is not guaranteed unless we the users remain committed to defending the principles upon which it is anchored. The victory by the small blockers in the blocksize war wasn’t handed to them on a silver platter but it came about through relentless commitment to the goal of separation of money and state. It was all or nothing. Many more attempts to control Bitcoin at the protocol level will be launched, however they will be doomed to fail if we remain resolute and unwavering in preserving the network’s core tenets; of which decentralization is chief among them, in my humble opinion. By keeping the costs of running a node as low as possible,more individual users from around the world are able to participate in validating the network, this is what Erlay represents. It’s a defense against centralization of the network by larger players thus preserving Bitcoin’s identity as a fully decentralized, permissionless and trustless peer-to-peer monetary system. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Short-term holder realized price (STH RP), as indicated by the report, is a more volatile, quick-to-move metric determined by the price of coins moved during a certain period, while long-term holder realized price (LTH RP) is a less volatile, more sticky metric determined by the price of coins held that have been unmoved for longer periods. When price dips below LTH RP, meaning that most long-term holders are underwater, it often coincides with previous bear market lows. The report suggests that the price of bitcoin is likely to flip both LTH RP and STH RP, which it is currently under, which could signal the low of the bear market.</p><figure>

A version of this article was originally published on </em><a href="https://jonathanleger.substack.com/p/how-i-came-to-understand-bitcoin"><em>Substack</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>I was raised in a doomsday cult that taught that God was getting ready to wage the war of Armageddon and bring about the end of the current world order. The governments, all ruled by the devil, would be replaced with the Kingdom of Heaven ruled by Jesus Christ. The cult discouraged any kind of real financial planning because of this worldview. After all, what was the point of investing in a system facing imminent destruction? </p><p>This extreme religious upbringing — and my eventual escape from it — helped me in my path to understanding Bitcoin Maximalism.</p><h2>Discovering Bitcoin</h2><p>My Bitcoin experience began with a losing trade in the summer of 2014. After reading a few articles about this “magic internet money,” I bought my first whole coin for about $500. I wasn’t prepared for how volatile the price swings would be, though, and sold at a loss later that year. If only I had known…</p><p>The last five years have been an intense learning experience for me. At the end of 2017, I left the cult with my wife, who is currently shunned by her entire family (as required by cult doctrine). I lost all of my “friends” as well. We had to learn how the real world worked and how to build a social network outside of the ready-made set of “friends” handed to us by the church, as getting close to non-members was deeply discouraged. All non-members were going to die by God’s hand at Armageddon anyway, so there was no point in getting too familiar. Plus, their wicked ways might rub off on you, so it was best to keep your distance for fear that you might get hit by a stray fireball when the end came.</p><p>After leaving the cult, I embraced life with the fervor of a wrongly-jailed prisoner embracing freedom upon exoneration. I studied politics for the first time, since members didn’t vote or participate in any form of campaigning due to the belief that all earthly governments were Satanic. I read books on how far humanity had advanced and how much better off we all are than in centuries past, however imperfect the current world may be. I was excited and optimistic for the future.</p><p>In 2004, I had started and grew a successful business as a software developer and internet marketing coach. The tools our team developed helped people compete with larger companies for getting websites to the top of the search results in Google, as well as other related use cases. For many years, searching Google for “coolest guy on the planet” returned my website as the number one result, demonstrating the importance of the Bitcoiner mantra, “Don’t trust, verify.”</p><p>Despite making millions of dollars in successful software product launches, I lost most of it through poor financial decisions coupled with intensifying competition from much better capitalized companies. On top of that, I went through a very expensive, acrimonious divorce. </p><p>“Love is grand,” they say, “but divorce is a hundred grand.” I grew up poor and had little formal or personal education in how to properly manage money or what money even really was, so when I finally “made it” I didn’t know how to properly handle it.</p><p>As you might imagine, it wasn’t all bad. The money afforded me many incredible personal experiences. But my personal and home life were a mess, I was still a true believer in the doomsday cult praying for the end of the world, and on balance was very unhappy. I felt like the wealthy writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes</a>, “I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.”</p><p>In 2019, I was 42 years old, had escaped the cult and was remarried to a wonderful woman whom I adore. I spent much of my time studying markets to prevent repeating past mistakes and working to develop a retirement plan. I did well with stocks that year but kept hearing about Bitcoin and how it was like nothing else. After reading “The Bitcoin Standard,” I finally understood why sound money was important and why fiat was doomed to fail. I again bought into BTC, this time at around $9,000.</p><h2>Contagion Hits</h2><p>When COVID-19 first reared its ugly head in early 2020, I did what many people did: listen to the “experts.” But as the scenes of pandemic theater played out, I began to understand that politics exhibited many of the same attributes as the cult I came out of. There were leaders that could not be questioned and members who would shame and shun anyone who dared to speak up. Their god was “The Science,” their Pope, Anthony Fauci, their clergy, the CDC and politicians. Rights were eroded and small businesses shut down while big box chains and mega-corporations raked in record profits, including Big Pharma. Trillions of dollars were printed out of thin air, proving true the Cantillon effect that says the largest beneficiaries of changes in money supply are the people and corporations closest to the money printers.</p><p>Unlike many hardcore Bitcoiners, my investment goals were purely financial, not philosophical. Like so many others in the crypto casino, I was chasing gains. Because of this, I sold my bitcoin at $45,000 and jumped into altcoins with the belief that I could multiply my investment, which I did. In fact, I did well enough to be able to stop writing software for about a year and a half, which was a much-needed hiatus and gave me even more time for the research I was doing.</p><p>Then came the market crash of 2022. With inflation clearly not “transitory,” the money printer was halted, and the Federal Reserve began to raise rates at a historically-unprecedented pace. Markets reacted negatively, bringing all cryptocurrencies down with them. The price of bitcoin cratered along with everything else. Low prices exposed the weakness of overleveraged schemes like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>, sending them into bankruptcy. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">Terra collapsed</a> along with a host of other smaller crypto operations.</p><p>The purportedly second-largest centralized crypto exchange in the world, FTX, stepped in with a promise to rescue the industry, only to turn out to be the<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns"> largest fraud of them all when its own balance sheet was leaked</a>. FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was accused of stealing investors’ and users’ money and sending it to its trading arm, Alameda, where it was gambled away on high-risk trades that spectacularly failed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23451484/ftx-customer-funds-alameda-research-sam-bankman-fried">to the tune of $10 billion</a>. </p><p>A massive “hack” of FTX followed shortly thereafter, the repercussions of which are still playing out. Evidence of political intrigue emerged, supported by the fact that most mainstream media coverage treated SBF with kid gloves, some even painting him as a victim rather than a predator. As of this writing, nobody has been arrested. By way of comparison, <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billionaire-conman-bernard-madoff-arrested">Bernie Madoff was in handcuffs the day after his fraud was uncovered</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin began flying off exchanges while Bitcoiners shook their damn heads at how many people had again ignored one of their most basic truths, “Not your keys, not your coins.” While I was glad to see people finally listening, the damage done was tremendous, both in financial and reputational loss. Since my start with Bitcoin, I always self-custodied my bags and so was unaffected by any of the collapses, at least as far as losing any of my holdings.</p><p>Though I never lost my respect for Bitcoin or the principles of decentralization and sound money, these events returned them front and center to my consciousness. I resumed listening to Bitcoiner podcasts, reading long-form articles, watching videos and reminding myself just how badly off the current world financial system really is. </p><p>“It’s just math,” say the Bitcoiners, and I believe they are correct. There’s no stopping the debt spiral now. The end is indeed coming, just not in the way I had been taught growing up. </p><h2>I Finally Get It: ‘Don’t Trust, Verify’</h2><p>During the time I was trading and HODLing altcoins, I thought Bitcoin Maxis were too extreme. Even though I agreed with their views on sound money and decentralization and agreed that <em>most</em> cryptos were just vaporware rug pulls waiting to happen, I didn’t understand their disdain for <em>every</em> crypto that wasn’t bitcoin. This was especially true for projects that were actively being used in the real world to seemingly beneficial effect.</p><p>As a software developer myself, I am aware that there is no single tool that covers all use cases. There’s Windows, or MacOS X, or Linux for computers, Android or Apple’s iOS for phones, and countless different apps that run on all of those platforms that perform different functions, many of them competing for market share. This competition encourages innovation which ultimately makes all software better. That free-market principle is something Bitcoiners honor, so I didn’t understand why they jettisoned it when it came to cryptocurrencies. My assumption was they did so out of self-interest. If people invested in other projects, they wouldn’t put their money in bitcoin, which hurt the Bitcoiner’s own portfolio.</p><p>Then there was proof of work. It’s power intensive and comparatively slow, even if far superior to bank technologies like SWIFT in terms of speed and guaranteed settlement. Even if the “green” argument was just fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), why stick with proof of work when other tech had proven far faster and more efficient, making it much more viable for payments systems?</p><p>Today, at last, after everything that’s happened over the past three years, I finally get it.</p><p>“Don’t trust, verify.”</p><p>The whole Bitcoiner philosophy comes down to those three words. Trust has always been abused, even if only by a small minority. But all it takes is a minority of people abusing and misusing your trust to cause you, and everyone else who trusts them, grave harm. So don’t trust, verify.</p><p>How does this relate to Bitcoiner’s referring to all other cryptos as “shitcoins” and dismissing them outright? It’s simple. The entire fiat currency system is a Ponzi scheme. Fiat is “money by decree” — it’s not backed by any real asset and only has value because the government says it does. Governments use fiat to rob citizens by printing money without citizens’ consent. This is, in effect, a tax that has not been approved by or voted on by the people. It’s theft.</p><p>For example, prior to fiat, governments would need actual hard currency (usually gold) to fund the wars they wanted to fight. If they didn’t have the money, they couldn’t fight the wars without raising taxes, which is never a popular proposition. With fiat, however, the government can print as much money as they want, pulling the money to fund their self-serving conflicts out of the pockets of the people who use that fiat currency: no permission necessary, and without most people realizing what’s happening.</p><p>Fiat also keeps people on a perpetual hamster wheel through inflation. If you know the money you have in the bank will be worth less next year than it is this year, you must keep trying harder to earn more money, year after year, just to keep your head above water. This keeps the majority of people as perpetual wage slaves, never quite able to get ahead, at least not enough to stop and enjoy their lives.</p><p>Without inflation you could live below your means, save your extra money, and trust in the deflationary effects of technology to make your money stretch much further once you decide to retire. After all, with technology constantly making supply chains more efficient through improvements in transportation and automation, everything <em>should </em>cost <em>less</em> over time, not more. And yet prices keep rising. Why? Inflation.</p><p>So what does fiat have to do with cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin? All other cryptocurrencies are working <em>within</em> the current financial system trying to improve it, make it more efficient, provide better privacy, etc. This has some positive effects. For instance, stablecoins give access to the U.S. dollar to people in countries whose currency is undergoing severe inflation and whose banking systems are corrupt or unreliable. <em>But it still requires the fiat Ponzi to function.</em></p><p>You can talk until you’re blue in the face about how a highly-efficient cryptocurrency could give access to the financial system to billions of unbanked individuals, improving their lives by helping them escape their own inflationary currencies and bypassing their corrupt governments. But it doesn’t matter because you’re only providing those people access <em>to another fiat currency, </em>and fiat is murdering the free market. You can talk about how issuing tokens give small businesses the ability to raise money without having to pay billions to big banks to IPO. Doesn’t matter. You’re still working <em>within the fiat system</em>, and the fiat system is the fundamental root of all the problems to begin with.</p><p>To the Bitcoiner, cryptocurrencies are decks being built onto the Titanic as it sinks, while Bitcoin is the life raft people need to get on to save themselves. The tech of some cryptos might be great, but it only delays the inevitable demise of the sinking ship. Maxis believe that bitcoin is destined to replace fiat, not shore it up, returning sound money to the world. As they often say, “Bitcoin fixes this.”</p><p>For Bitcoiners, this isn’t just about money. It’s a guidestone that influences every aspect of life. It’s a belief system, though I’ll stop short of calling it a religion, since people of every conceivable religion also subscribe to its tenants. To those who aren’t Bitcoiners, maxis can appear to be in some kind of cult, but it’s not a cult. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>Bitcoiners are people who, like me, have <em>escaped</em> a cult: the cult of fiat. Once they were like everyone else, brainwashed into believing that the government could be trusted with control over the money printer, that the Fed was capable of central planning of the economy, and that inflation was necessary for economic growth.</p><p>Plato’s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Allegory of the Cage</a><em> </em>describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave for their entire lives. All they can see is a blank wall and the shadows cast upon it from a fire burning behind them. They give the shadows names, believing them to be actual representations of the real world. One of the prisoners escapes from the cave and, having experienced the actual world, realizes that the shadows are not true representations of it. He returns to the cave to try and convince the other prisoners, but they don’t believe him because the shadows are all they have ever known. Bitcoiners are the escaped man.</p><p>The Bitcoiner tribe can be rowdy and crass and harsh, but you must consider what they’re out to achieve and what they’re up against. Their endeavor is not for the faint of heart. It’s a real David and Goliath moment. The Bitcoiner stands, golden coins in hand, looking the giant in the eye with a defiance that onlookers usually perceive as madness. Maybe it is madness, but without that dauntless quality, Bitcoin wouldn’t have come as far as it has. And I, for one, will cheer them on as the giant collapses.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Leger.

Many newcomers to bitcoin mining will consult the profitability of an ASIC on a mining calculator, expecting that that profitability will stay relatively the same going forwards in the future. This is a misunderstanding as the profitability of any given machine, trends downwards over time. Increases in difficulty should be understood before purchasing an ASIC. </p><p> A simple way of understanding this is comparing an ASIC to any other electronic device. The longer the device is in use, the less relevant it is as new software requires more computing power. If you were to use an iPhone from 6 years ago, its performance would be incredibly frustrating. The older the phone gets, the less utility it has. </p><p>A very similar process happens in mining. When you are mining, you are competing with all the other miners around the world. As more miners turn on machines, it gets more difficult to compete. Having newer and more efficient hardware makes you more competitive, but that hardware is quickly moving towards being less competitive.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment</h2><p> Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment is something built into the Bitcoin protocol in order to ensure Bitcoin has a stable and predictable supply schedule. If there was no difficulty adjustment, all of the bitcoin likely would’ve already been mined and there would be little to no incentive for miners to secure the network. When more miners join the network, blocks are minted at a faster rate as a result of a hash rate increase. The network responds by adjusting the difficulty higher to ensure that blocks come in around 10 minutes. For miners, increased difficulty adjustments mean less profits. For the average Bitcoin user, it means more security for the monetary network they are using. </p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Picture taken from insights.braiins.com</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Downwards difficulty adjustments mean that miners will be earning more profits as these are a result of hash rate coming offline. The famous example of this happening is when China banned Bitcoin mining and a large portion of the network hash rate went offline for a period of time. Downwards difficulty adjustments are not the norm as mining hardware is always getting more powerful and efficient. Even if there was a stagnation of machine efficiency and hash rate increases, more machines would be produced and plugged in. The Bitcoin mining industry is incredibly immature and there is a tremendous amount of room for growth going forward which means that hash rate is almost certainly going to increase at rapid rates going forward over the long run.</p><p>We are currently seeing a bull market in energy prices with a suppressed bitcoin price which means that miners are experiencing quite a bit of pain. There is a possibility that there could be a series of downward difficulty adjustments as hash rate comes offline, but this is not something that miners should put in their models. It is important to prepare for the worst case scenario which is what we have seen the last few months. </p><h2>New Machines Coming To Market</h2><p> Every couple years, ASIC manufacturers release a new machine with significant improvements in regards to hash rate and efficiency. Recent network hash rate increases are largely due to seeing Bitmain’s S19 XP and S19 Hydro being deployed. Another factor is that a large amount of older generation machines are finally being turned on as a result of infrastructure being built out.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzA4ODIzMjA3Mzg4ODQ5/image2.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>This chart is an oversimplification just for visual purposes.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>When you buy an ASIC, its value will be constantly depreciating as both network hash rate increases and new machines come onto the market. The value will fluctuate depending on the Bitcoin price, but it’s safe to say the machine loses value over time. That is why it is incredibly important to have the machine running when you have it. Buying it to plug in later means you are throwing money away unnecessarily.</p><h2>Bitcoin Purchasing Power</h2><p> Bitcoin mining is like taking a long position on Bitcoin, but with a lot of headaches and execution risk. If done correctly, it can be incredibly lucrative. If done incorrectly, it is a fantastic way to get poor quickly. The income the machine makes is fairly consistent, but the purchasing power of that income varies tremendously. Power prices may be stable priced in dollars, but are very volatile when priced in the income you are making from that machine. A S19j Pro may make 38,000-40,000 sats a day in income, but if you are mining on $0.10 a kWh, your power costs will be 41,263 sats with bitcoin trading at $17,461. </p><p>This is why it is incredibly important to try and get the lowest possible electricity prices in order to be profitable and ROI on your equipment. Finding cheap electricity is neither straightforward nor easy. Oftentimes there are hidden fees or complications that cause miners to fail. All miners regardless of how big or small are subjected to these economics of variable purchasing power, network hash rate increases, and machine devaluation/obsoletion. </p><h2>ASIC Pricing</h2><p> There is a base cost for the manufacturers to produce new equipment. We are currently at or reaching that floor for new equipment coming from the manufacturer. As a result, they are either slowing down or halting production of certain models. Individuals choose to pay a premium for new equipment because they come with warranties. Used equipment on the other hand generally does not come with a warranty, and also uncertainty of conditions that it was run in. For this reason, used equipment is often sold at a substantial discount. </p><p>ASIC pricing is variable just like every other industry. Supply and demand are the major factors that determine price. Individuals buying ASICs have a million different reasons why they may want to purchase at a certain time, but Bitcoin price and difficulty are major influences. If the purchasing power of the income being earned by an ASIC is low, there will be less demand and the ASIC price will fall. Bear markets are generally good times to buy because the demand drops significantly. </p><h2>Moore’s Law And The Future Of ASICs</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Moore’s Law: an axiom of microprocessor development usually holding that processing power doubles about every 18 months especially relative to cost or size.”&nbsp;</em>— <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Moore%27s%20law">Merriam Webster</a></p></blockquote><p>We are coming to the end of the computer chip revolution as chip makers are pushing the boundaries of physics. In no way is this the end of massive increases in Bitcoin’s network hash rate. The mining industry is very rough around the edges in regards to very basic principles such as heat dissipation, software implementations, and relationships with energy producers. Computer chips may have slower leaps as far as increases in computing power, but we have barely scratched the surface in regards to other technological leaps forward that will ultimately lead to more power being consumed and more computing power expended in order to secure the Bitcoin Network.</p><p> As bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, and its value understood, the demand for mining is bound to increase globally. The result will naturally be an increase in Network hash rate. As a miner, this is a painful reality as it means the profitability of my hardware will decrease over time. As a Bitcoiner, it gives me confidence in the monetary network that I use daily. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kaboomracks Alex.

As of December of 2021, Canada <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">had 6.48% of global hash rate</a> according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.</p><p>A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/in-canada-bitcoin-mining-is-thriving">Bitcoin Magazine article</a> from 2021 details the various regulatory challenges in Canada, as well as the successful operations that continue to prosper in the country despite these. Recently, the Manitoba province’s government set an <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">18-month moratorium</a> on new mining operations. In the past, Canada has <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/crypto-craze-has-hydro-quebec-ceos-phone-ringing-off-the-hook">experienced large influxes</a> of miners seeking to take advantage of the abundance of power there. <br><br>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quebec-shuns-bitcoin-mining-in-bid-to-conserve-power-11670514921?mod=business_minor_pos13">a report</a> by the Wall Street Journal, “Hydro-Québec charges the lowest rates for industrial power in North America, with average prices as of April 1 of 3.93 cents per kilowatt-hour… The average cost in North America is 8.22 cents, according to Hydro-Québec.”<br></p><p>The request is up for approval by Québec’s energy regulator, Régie de l’énergie du Québec, which is believed to be completed within the next few months. The move would not restrict power to existing firms within the province, but could impact future development and investment into the region. </p><p>Bitcoin miners’ ability to move their equipment does make it possible for operations to shift out of the region to more friendly locations such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/texas-is-the-bitcoin-mining-capital">Texas</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wyoming-aiming-5-bitcoin-mining-hashrate">Wyoming</a>, which could become prime examples of the power of favorable regulation.

The proposed eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation was previously reported on by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/30/eu-crypto-nft-providers-must-report-tax-details-under-leaked-eu-plan/">CoinDesk</a>, and could have wide-reaching implications including forcing non-EU based companies to have to register with tax entities there. <br></p><p>In a statement, the EU Commissioner for tax, Paolo Gentiloni <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/eu-to-make-crypto-companies-report-tax-details-to-authorities/">said</a>, “Anonymity means that many crypto-asset users making significant profits fall under the radar of national tax authorities. This is not acceptable.”</p><p>The enforcement of the measures was not made entirely clear, as the cryptocurrency industry has various entities and actors residing in various jurisdictions, including some who claim no base of operations. Beyond that, there should be concern for the honeypot of user data that registering user holdings creates. Often, holdings on centralized exchanges (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">which are dangerous in their own right</a>) are paired with sensitive identifying information which could potentially be used by criminals to attach people to their holdings. </p><p>There have been various cases of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ledger-hack-victim-scam-details">documented</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/revolut-cyberattack-thousands-exposed/">data</a> <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">leaks</a> in and outside of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/celsius-user-data-dump-crypto-tracing-scammers/">cryptocurrency industry</a>: and these are simply the ones that surface. Forcing companies to provide European tax authorities — including companies based outside of the EU — once again forces firms to collect copious amounts of data exposing user holdings, and then transmit them to tax authorities in Europe whom they must trust to keep them safe. <br></p><p>Concerns have also been voiced that this could have ramifications for the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) which is the “first all-encompassing effort to tackle cryptoassets and brings rules contained in Mifid, Market Abuse and the Prospectus Regulation to the cryptoasset industry,” according to the <a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647jipe3beilngwqlmo/primer-markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">International Financial Law Review</a> (IFLR).</p><p>The European Crypto Initiative made a statement indicating <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/eu-to-make-crypto-companies-report-tax-details-to-authorities/">it was</a> “concerned that it would apply to a far wider range of obliged entities and individuals” than MiCA.</p><p>The EU has said it believes the move could generate as much as $2.5 billion (2.4 billion euros) through the introduction of the directive.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjA3MTM2MjI2NzQ4MTUz/20220926_good-gdog-proof-collaborative-custody-multisig-by-will-schoellkopf_.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Future Of Venture Capital Is Investing In Bitcoin-Only Companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Among the plethora of investors in the crypto world, there is a niche that shares common visions and strategies.

They are the Bitcoin-only venture capitalists.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>“The smartest people in the world are working on Bitcoin, they’re not working on some other project,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeJarmuz">Mike Jarmuz</a> told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re not working on altcoins or selling real estate in a metaverse fantasy land. Your medical records are not going onto some other thing masquerading as a blockchain. We view these as ridiculous and completely uninvestable ideas.”</p><p>Jarmuz is the the managing partner of an investment fund called <a href="https://ltng.ventures/">Lightning Ventures</a>, whose peculiarity is that it focuses its investments solely on companies that develop products and services on bitcoin and no other cryptocurrency. </p><p>“The 21st century digital economy is being built on Bitcoin-native companies,” added <a href="https://twitter.com/mcshane_writes">McShane</a>, a venture partner at Lightning Ventures and employee at BTC Inc, which operates Bitcoin Magazine. “We invest in best-in-class Bitcoin founders who deliver focused, and differentiated, value to humanity. We are determined to return a multiple to our investors through Bitcoin companies that strive to make a positive impact on the world.”</p><p>And Lightning Ventures is not alone, but rather part of a growing niche, that of Bitcoin-only venture capitalists (VCs).</p><h2>The Fall Of Crypto Hedge Funds</h2><p>Last year, at the height of the bull market, it was the crypto VCs who dominated the headlines, pouring over <a href="https://docsend.com/view/pwgbawfj6sc8q7de">$33 billion</a> into crypto/blockchain/Web3 projects and startups. This golden age was very short-lived, as this year's market crash also claimed illustrious victims in the world of hedge funds: one in particular was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/27/three-arrows-capital-default-crypto-voyager-digital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, which defaulted last June after being unable to repay a loan of over $670 million.</p><p>Such sudden gains and collapses are not very common for a venture capital fund, <a href="https://seraf-investor.com/compass/article/charting-course-building-winning-vc-fund-strategy-part-ii#:~:text=Most%20venture%20funds%20have%20a,but%20that%20is%20fairly%20standard.">which traditionally approaches investments with a 10-year time horizon</a>, not horizons of just a few months. When, however, the bet is in projects that issue tokens out of thin air, the moment these appreciate on the wave of enthusiasm, the temptation to turn investment activity into speculation is very strong — with the risk of getting burnt when the markets reverse their course.</p><h2>Low Time Preference</h2><p>The crypto hedge funds demonstrated the mentality of the short term — the opposite of that shared by VCs who believe in Bitcoin's long-term success, investing in those companies that, without issuing useless tokens invented on the spot, try to develop services that bring real value to the market.</p><p>“Early-stage Bitcoin startup or angel investing is definitely a low time preference choice,” Jarmuz specified. “Many ‘crypto’ projects choose to issue unlicensed, unregistered securities, in exchange for equity but you don’t end up with quality investors. What happens is that investors dump those ‘tokens’ or equity the minute they can. With our Lightning Ventures’ thesis and Bitcoin-only investments, we are committed for the life of the company and are not concerned with selling ‘tokens’ the moment we can. When we invest in a company, we back it and support it throughout its entire life cycle.”</p><p>On this same page is <a href="https://twitter.com/mecee">Christopher Calicott</a> of <a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a>, or TVP, who said that the idea of funding projects that attract customers by generating tokens is not only symptomatic of a short-term view, but is also inconsistent with the typical incentives of a venture capital fund.</p><p>“Investing in these tokens, said Calicott, is a fundamental misalignment of interest to really grow the company and achieve maximum success. Investors actually become speculators trying to get out of their position with the best timing.”</p><p>Moreover, while there used to be a feeling that it was difficult to build on Bitcoin — and so many moved to other cryptocurrencies — today things are changing:</p><p>"Bitcoin is becoming a platform and entrepreneurs are starting to realize that,” Calicott continued. “There’s blood in the streets being brought by the crypto industry, but despite this, there are now more entrepreneurs willing to build services on Bitcoin than ever before. We see ourselves as long-term investors. We are trying to make smart bets on companies that we think can usher a whole new global monetary order on a solid standard: Bitcoin.”</p><h2>Overcoming An Obsolete System</h2><p>A new monetary standard, a global store of value, a peer-to-peer payment method that renders the big traditional players obsolete. Whichever way you look at it, Bitcoin offers a vision of the future that completely overturns the paradigms to which we are accustomed: the idea of inflation necessary for growth, that of macro-economic control by states and central banks, that of having to entrust the management of savings and digital payments to intermediaries.</p><p>Is the old way of seeing things compatible with the Bitcoin future? According to <a href="https://egodeath.capital/intro#:~:text=For%20a%20new%20system%20to,a%20false%20sense%20of%20loss.">Ego Death Capital’s website</a>, it is not. </p><p>“For a new system to thrive, to bring abundance, opportunity and accessibility, the old system must self-destruct,” per the website for the VC firm, whose CEO is <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth">Jeff Booth</a>, author of “The Price of Tomorrow.” “For this to happen, it will require a phase of ‘self-surrender and transition.’”</p><p>Confirming the view are <a href="https://twitter.com/nico_lechuga">Nico Lechuga</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/1andipitt">Andi Pitt</a>, both general partners at Ego Death.</p><p>"The traditional system is already self destructing," they explained. “Banking systems fail billions of people around the world — it is very evident in emerging markets but even in Western countries. Meanwhile, the Visa and Mastercard duopoly holds back innovation and opportunity so as competition arises — including through the Lightning Network, providing very fast and low-cost transactions — they are already in the process of self-destructing.”</p><p>The Lightning Network is also seen as a payments gamechanger for <a href="https://twitter.com/olegmikh1">Oleg Mikhalsky</a> of <a href="https://fulgur.ventures/">Fulgur Ventures</a>, because, as he said, “almost-instant settlement with very limited counterparty risk is a feature of Lightning that is well positioned to reduce traditional payment overheads and lower counterparty risk existing in fiat rails.”</p><p>"For the digital economy to grow,” added Mikhalsky, “we need a native digital currency that has two features: velocity and the ability to make micro-transactions. We believe Bitcoin and Lightning will become the global monetary and payment standards. Some aspects of the Lightning Network adoption spectrum are yet to be explored: we see some adoption in video games, digital content monetisation, but there are other use cases such as machine-to-machine payments and micro-transactions for energy."</p><h2>More And More Bitcoin-Only Startups</h2><p>Contrary to what one might think, in a year when the market collapsed dramatically, the world of Bitcoin-only startups has experienced very indicative growth. As confirmed by all VCs surveyed for this article, the number of companies focused exclusively on Bitcoin has grown significantly over the past year. It is plausible to think that when the Pandora's box of the crypto world was discovered, at that point, entrepreneurs realized that it was wiser to focus on the one technology whose fundamentals have never stopped strengthening since the beginning.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/julian_liniger">Julian Liniger</a>, CEO of <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> — a Swiss startup which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin in a non-custodial way — emphasized that future growth.</p><p>“In the long run, it is less risky to invest in Bitcoin-only startups than in crypto startups: investors see Bitcoin-focused companies as more profitable and a more sustainable business model,” he explained. “With Bitcoin-only VCs, we are 100% aligned. They see the future in 10 years, they understand where we are going, they understand that all the experiments that are happening on other blockchains will end up on Bitcoin.”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Federico Rivi.

Here’s how it works and what you can do to get a bitcoin-backed loan.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>Loaning your bitcoin invites an element of risk that you may not need to incur. You should not make any financial, investment, trading or otherwise decision solely based on the information presented in this article.</em></p><p>Bitcoin lending will be the future of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-does-not-need-defi-but-defi-needs-bitcoin">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>. Many DeFi projects are currently sitting on Ethereum due to its built-in support for smart contracts and network effects, but this is changing rapidly.</p><p>Smart contract platforms are being built on Bitcoin to create a new ecosystem that offers the highest protocol security and the sound money network only an established asset like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">bitcoin</a> can offer.</p><p>A bitcoin-backed loan is a type of secured loan that lets you easily borrow cash using your bitcoin as collateral. Due to their rising popularity, BTC loans facilitate the transition to decentralized finance based on a bitcoin standard, where intermediaries have little to no space and the protocol’s solid foundations ensure security. A new financial system opens up plenty of opportunities for everyone, with no censorship allowed.</p><p>Bitcoin’s total value locked (TVL) is <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Bitcoin">$108 million</a> as of October 2022, while Ethereum’s sits at $30.37 billion. Even though the potential of unlocking DeFi on Bitcoin is evidently enormous, there are reasons behind the extreme gap in such comparison.</p><p>One of them is Bitcoin’s true decentralization which prevents any central planning or venture capital funds from interfering with its prodigious independent development. While this is the best thing for Bitcoin, it also means that money for development is limited, making it slower than Ethereum, which is backed by big corporate money.</p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-semantics-of-the-bitcoin-layers">Bitcoin’s base layer</a> is excellent for money transaction settlement, but smart contracts, which are the fundamental components of DeFi, need to be built on upper layers like the Internet is built upon the base TCP/IP layer.</p><p>This article will explore the opportunities that Bitcoin lending could open in DeFi, how it works and where you can look for the current services offered. </p><h2>DeFi vs. CeFi</h2><p>Centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are fast-growing branches of the cryptocurrency space that will likely shape the future of financial services.</p><p>Not to be confused with TradFi (traditional finance), which is the customary way of borrowing and lending money through the banking system, CeFi is still provided by an intermediary while using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to offer cheaper, faster and more secure financial products. People must still place trust in an intermediary; in this case, the centralized platform. </p><p>DeFi, on the other hand, is peer-to-peer financial services and lending where trust is placed in the protocol and smart contracts without an intermediary (other than, perhaps, an escrow service). This is important because third-party gatekeepers can make transactions inefficient while users lose control over their own money. </p><p><em>"To build DeFi on a centralized protocol, or one that is a protocol managed by rulers, is inherently broken from the start" </em>- @AlyseKilleen</p><p>Within the two branches, there are two main types of bitcoin lending platforms: decentralized and centralized lenders. They both offer high-interest rates for lenders and lower-than-usual rates for borrowers; they typically require borrowers to deposit bitcoin as collateral to access a loan.</p><p>However, there are several differences amongst lenders so borrowers should consider carefully when choosing the most suitable platform.</p><p>In particular, DeFi provides more privacy than centralized finance platforms, which usually require some form of verification to allow users to access their services. DeFi platforms work directly through smart contracts without having to trust a central authority.</p><p>User experience and custody are on the side of CeFi, which usually provides an efficient customer interface while taking custody of the users’ bitcoin. With DeFi, users must take responsibility and complete control over their bitcoin while facing the risk of technology hurdles.</p><h2>Why Get A Bitcoin-Backed Loan?</h2><p>Getting a bitcoin-backed loan will help you avoid selling bitcoin — and you’re actually putting your bitcoin to work. HODLing bitcoin is already the best thing you can do if you’re after sound money; however, as a lender or a borrower, you can give bitcoin an additional purpose with the help of DeFi loans. </p><p>Just like banks lend you money in exchange for cash, bitcoin DeFi loans allow you to borrow money from other bitcoin peers in exchange for fiat or stablecoins. However, you will only be able to access a bank loan or lend your money if you have an excellent credit score and provide additional guarantees. With bitcoin DeFi loans, everyone can become a lender or a borrower.</p><p>As a borrower, you won’t be giving up your bitcoin. Instead, you’ll be paying reasonable loan interest rates in order to purchase products and services using fiat — all while usually paying fewer taxes, depending on your jurisdiction. As a lender, you will earn interest on the bitcoin you’re lending. </p><p>In traditional finance, trust between borrowers and lenders must be necessarily ensured by financial institutions that face enormous risks in offering their money to customers. This is why banks and institutions must take strict verification procedures to minimize the chance of losing their money. </p><p>By lending cash in exchange for bitcoin as collateral, businesses do not need any other verification; they will hold the cryptocurrency until the loan is paid back entirely, either in installments or in one lump sum at the end of the term.</p><p>This type of loan will also satisfy the borrower who enjoys a service that is permissionless and is mostly a private matter. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PA5TvqD4bI">emerging countries</a>, ordinary people can’t easily get traditional loans from banks. With bitcoin ownership, they finally have the chance to use it as collateral for loans, which is a game changer for billions of people worldwide.</p><p>We’ll go into more detail in the “How Does It Work” section. However, what has been discussed up to here should already give you an idea of the impact bitcoin lending can have in the financial world.</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>Bitcoin lending is rapidly growing in the world of cryptocurrency finance. However, you should keep in mind that the industry is still in its infancy; there are risks associated with the early days of the technology, coupled with financial hazards.</p><p>Here are a few of the drawbacks to consider before using bitcoin as collateral to take up a loan:</p><ul><li>Collateral loss through bugs in the smart contract or peg.</li><li>Collateral loss through hacks, especially in CeFi platforms.</li><li>Collateral loss if capital dips below the threshold in the event of a bitcoin price drop. For example, in the case of a margin call, borrowers could lose all or part of their capital if they don’t top up the collateral with more bitcoin.</li><li>Some of DeFi lenders are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), so if something happens and you lose your bitcoin, there is no corporation or entity you can sue.</li><li>Rehypothecation and eventual insolvency by the platform.</li></ul><h2>How Does It Work</h2><p>The Bitcoin base layer (also referred to as L1 or Layer 1) is the most immutable, trustworthy, robust and decentralized of all blockchains. This is achieved via a tradeoff: the base layer’s capabilities are very narrow by design and can only support a limited number of basic transactions. Bitcoin is unscalable if you’re limited to the base layer. However, its solid foundational structure is perfect for building upon, enabling development on top of its network to build DeFi and smart contract platforms. </p><p>Bitcoin was designed to scale in layers; even Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696">suggested the possibility</a> in 2010, unlocking a new surge of innovation that can massively expand the Bitcoin economy.</p><p>Here we look to the future of Bitcoin and how this ecosystem will be built. We’ll highlight some projects that are bringing new use cases to Bitcoin.</p><p>The Bitcoin base layer was built to support settlements, not payments. So, for instance, payments are faster and cheaper on the Layer 2 Lightning Network or Liquid sidechain, but remain secure as they settle on Bitcoin’s base layer. Similarly, Layer 2 side chains like RSK or Stacks — they’ll be discussed later — provide functioning smart contract capability that settles on the base layer without changing it.</p><p>To sum up, the base layer is the foundation that ensures decentralization, censorship resistance and a sound environment, while experimentation occurs on the upper layers — along with increased risks.</p><h3>Improving Bitcoin Layers</h3><p>Major scripts’ improvements on the Bitcoin mainchain, like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/pros-cons-and-possibilities-for-bitcoin-discreet-log-contracts">DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts)</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/understanding-taproot-in-a-simple-way">Taproot</a> that allow more efficient and faster transaction verification, inevitably bring benefits to the interaction between the base layer and the multiple Bitcoin layers, too.</p><h3>How It Works For Individuals</h3><p>It would be best if you did your research to find the most suitable Bitcoin DeFi lending platform. You are giving your money to a centralized entity or an escrow that will hold it until you pay back the loan, so you should ensure your money is safe.</p><p>The lending or borrowing process is usually straightforward, supported by user-friendly interfaces and little to no verification required. Strategies exist to help you save money or reduce fees and the risks of being liquidated. For example, you should try to keep the total portfolio loan-to-value (LTV) ratio at 20% to better withstand a possible 50% drawdown in BTC price.</p><p>Your primary strategy should <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-i-did-to-fix-my-bitcoin-loan">work around the LTV element</a> because you risk getting liquidated if the loan’s bitcoin collateral falls in value, making it a margin loan unless you keep topping up with additional bitcoin. Exploring such strategies will better prepare you for facing loan challenges.</p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-i-did-to-fix-my-bitcoin-loan">Learning From Bitcoin Loan Strategies</a></p><h2>Where To Get A Bitcoin-Backed Loan</h2><p>Bitcoin’s native Script language is technically capable of supporting some limited smart contracts; however, it is cumbersome and restricted to prioritize security over programmability. Hence, side chain solutions that settle on the main chain are preferred methods to manage smart contracts and enable DeFi services like borrowing or lending against bitcoin.</p><p>Here are some popular and efficient solutions to choose from if you are considering taking out a bitcoin-backed loan.</p><h3>Sovryn Zero</h3><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDY1ODE1ODI3OTcz/sovryn-2.png" height="620" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><a href="https://www.sovryn.app/">Sovryn</a> is a decentralized trading and lending protocol built on <a href="https://www.rsk.co/">RSK (Rootstock)</a>. RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain that is simultaneously merge-mined with Bitcoin for enhanced security. It has a native currency called RBTC, which is meant to be a 1:1 BTC peg. </p><p>BTC conversion to RBTC is required to access <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/zero">Zero</a>, a decentralized protocol that enables customers to borrow ZUSD — a USD-pegged stablecoin — with zero interest using BTC as collateral. People must still place trust in an intermediary, in this case, the centralized platform.</p><p>The Sovryn loan’s minimum collateral ratio (collateral/debt) is 110%, which means that you must keep your loan collateralized above 110% at all times, without exception. BTC must first be converted into RBTC and then transferred to the Rootstock bitcoin sidechain to be used as collateral. Sovryn claims that the Zero protocol is non-custodial, governed by stakers according to the <a href="https://www.rsk.co/solutions/sovryn">Bitocracy protocol rules</a>, and operated by smart contracts that users interact with in a KYC-free manner.</p><h3>FUJI Finance</h3><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://fuji.money/">Fuji</a> is a <a href="https://liquid.net/#:~:text=The%20Liquid%20Network%20is%20a,top%20of%20the%20Bitcoin%20timechain.">Liquid</a>-based non-custodial protocol that enables the borrowing of synthetic assets (tokens that are digital representations of derivatives), such as stablecoins and synthetic stocks or bonds, against over-collateralized bitcoin positions. </p><p>Anyone can use Fuji to borrow any asset offered on the platform after locking L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin) as collateral in a smart contract. The smart contract creates 1 fUSD (Fuji USD) for each $1.50 worth of BTC locked. More collateral automatically decreases the risk of liquidation.</p><p>The borrower can always get the entire collateral back once the debt is settled. Repayment occurs upon burning the same amount of Fuji assets issued for this collateral, plus a small 0.25% payout for the redemption of the locked collateral.</p><h3>Ledn</h3><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTA5ODM5MjQyNzU3/ledn.png" height="620" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><a href="https://www.ledn.io/">Ledn</a> is a Canadian cryptocurrency platform that provides BTC and USDC savings accounts to its customers, who can earn interest on these assets or borrow against them. Ledn provides Proof-of-Reserve attestations overseen by an independent certified public accountant.</p><p>Clients’ privacy is preserved with a unique anonymized ID for every client reference number; the individual's identity is never revealed to the independent accounting firm. Moreover, Ledn uses <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo</a> for cold storage of clients' deposited bitcoin and doesn’t rehypothecate their collateral assets (i.e. doesn’t lend them to other parties) to earn extra revenue.</p><p>Ledn bitcoin-backed loans require an initial LTV ratio of 50%. When it reaches 70%, Ledn starts warning the borrower that it will liquidate enough BTC to repay part of the debt. If the LTV hits 80%, then all of the collateral Bitcoin will be liquidated unless more collateral is added to the loan.</p><p>Ledn only requires one payment at the end when the client wants to close the loan and avoids monthly interest payments, which is more convenient for the borrower.</p><p>The company has also started rolling out bitcoin mortgages in Ontario, Canada, allowing borrowers to use BTC as collateral in addition to the property's value to secure the loan. Pairing it with the property's value, the mortgage becomes overcollateralized, meaning that the collateral backing a loan is worth more than the loan itself, drastically reducing the chances that a loan is liquidated.</p><h3>HODL HODL</h3><figure>

The platform already offers bitcoin-backed loans, but support by better liquidity providers such as banks should be an added benefit for Hodl Hodl and its customers.</p><p>Their current offer includes non-custodial P2P bitcoin-backed loans that both lenders and borrowers can benefit from anonymously, and by setting their own terms, including loan duration, interest rates, and currencies used. </p><p>The company creates a multisig escrow contract where the borrower’s bitcoin is held. The lender transfers the loan amount to the borrower according to the contract. When the loan is repaid, the lender releases the bitcoin back to the borrower's wallet.</p><h3>Unchained Capital</h3><figure>

Only bitcoin is accepted as collateral on Verify21, the platform has no token and the platform does not rehypothecate client bitcoin or lend out client collateral to other borrowers. Bitcoin collateral is stored with institutional custody partners. Verify21 undertakes a bi-annual proof of reserve audit.</p><p>Initial loans are offered for a one year term at an interest rate of 10%, with an origination fee of 2.5%. This brings the total APR on the loans to 12.5%*</p><p>The company will notify borrowers that they need to top up their collateral when the bitcoin price falls drastically and approaches a risky LTV ratio. If the bitcoin price continues to fall and no collateral top-up has occurred, Verity21 will be forced to liquidate client loan collateral, settle the loan and return any excess loan collateral to the client"</p><h3>Atomic Finance</h3><figure>

    </figure><p>An interesting project that is undergoing its Beta phase is <a href="https://atomic.finance/">Atomic Finance</a>, a bitcoin-only financial services business that wants to provide sound finance to bitcoin holders.</p><p>They are currently testing a way to earn a yield on bitcoin without giving up custody, using Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) that preserve users’ privacy and self-sovereignty. Such smart contract protocols do not need the creation or use of a native token different from bitcoin to unlock DeFi capabilities on the blockchain.</p><p>A DLC consists of two parties sending funds to a multisig address in order to bet on a particular outcome based on some pre-established condition being met. For example, bitcoin’s price at a certain point in the future. An agreed-upon oracle (a party that bridges smart contracts with off-chain data like the price of bitcoin, in this example) — or oracles — sign a transaction that attests the outcome of the event once the result is known. The DLC participant who bet correctly on that outcome will now be the only one who can claim the funds from the DLC multisig.</p><p>Other companies looking to follow the same model as Atomic Finance are <a href="https://www.dglab.com/">DG Lab</a> and <a href="https://suredbits.com/">SuredBits</a>. They are considered the purest forms of bitcoin finance as they allow DeFi to solely use bitcoin without other native tokens to function.</p><h3>ZEST </h3><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.zestprotocol.com/">Zest protocol</a> is an on-chain bitcoin capital market that allows clients to borrow cash from liquidity providers (LPs) who join professionally managed lending pools. LPs can earn 4-6% bitcoin yield this way, while borrowers can obtain on-chain bitcoin loans directly against their balance sheets. Zest is exclusive to institutional and corporate borrowers at this stage.</p><p>Strict KYC procedures are applied to borrowers who must be approved following a standard process. </p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Bitcoin’s Layer 2 DeFi lending platforms could shape the future of finance in a way that has never been experienced before. They are less dependent on the banking system and fairer to the participants, with no borders or censorship allowed in a permissionless environment.</p><p>All of this is being built before our eyes on top of the immutable, robust and trusted Bitcoin protocol. It’s opening opportunities that everyone will be able to seize.</p><p>That being said, to engage in DeFi is to relinquish control of your bitcoin. Losing access to your bitcoin permanently is a risk you must be comfortable with. So caution is advised. If you’re willing to take the risk, then let it be with a small portion of your bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0Mjk5NDE5OTEzMzY0OTk3/bitcoin_backed_loans_thumbnail-01.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDY1ODE1ODI3OTcz/sovryn-2.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDk2Njg1OTA1NTg1/fuji-finance.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTA5ODM5MjQyNzU3/ledn.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTIwODQ1MDk2NDUz/hodl-hodl.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTI3NTU1OTgzMDI1/unchained-capital.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTMzNzI5OTk4NTEz/verify-21.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTQ0NDY3NDE2NzUz/atomic-finance.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTUzODYyNjU3NTQx/zest.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I Quit Investing In The Fiat Ponzi And Started Saving In Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[The tired argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is really more applicable to fiat, which makes it impossible for us to retain savings.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/quit-investing-save-in-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/quit-investing-save-in-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fiat]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mickey Koss]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2NDMxNjgz/bitcoin-dollar.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The tired argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is really more applicable to fiat, which makes it impossible for us to retain savings.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics.

The abject lack of intellectual curiosity is astonishing, yet somehow unsurprising given my recent stint in academia:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>The whole thing depends on even more people parting with their savings…</em>”</p></blockquote><p>Is this not true for the stock market? The housing market? The commodities market? By that logic, every market with fluidity of pricing based on supply and demand is a Ponzi scheme. I guess it’s time to go back to the barter economy? Or does the stock market go up on earnings alone without any buyers or demand?</p><p>In fact, It appears to me that prices have been going up faster than earnings since about 1980, even when taking inflation into account:</p><figure>

Can anyone say “<a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect">Cantillon effect</a>”? </p><h2>Fiat Is The Ponzi</h2><p>Crypto is a symptom, not the underlying problem.

    </figure><p>In what now feels like the blink of an eye, trillions of dollars were created to prevent the system from imploding. Suddenly, the stock market was booming while it seemed like everything was crumbling. I don’t even blame the central bankers. They responded to their incentives and did what they had to, but the effects were dire. If you weren’t already invested, you lost big, making it just that much harder to get your dollars to work for you, to escape inflation and eventually escape the rat race.</p><p>One of the most salient illustrations to me is the below graph. It demonstrates that you should buy a house, any house, it doesn’t matter. Because if you don’t already own a house, if you choose to save instead, you may never actually be able to afford one. It doesn’t take a lot of empathy to understand the financial desperation many are feeling today.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Now, I admit that I’m not a professional statistician, but the charts appear to have some significant correlation. Perhaps CPI inflation may not be the only problem. Perhaps asset price inflation may be forcing savers to become part-time investors. Supply and demand has a price impact on bitcoin, yes, but does the stock market not require new money to support prices as well?</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Savings</h2><blockquote><p>Savings: Money put by the excess of income over expenditures.</p><p>–<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/savings">Merriam-Webster</a></p></blockquote><p>So, why can’t we just save money anymore? The FRED graphs included here tell it all. If you don’t become an investor, you will never keep up. That is, until now. </p><p>Bitcoin is our savings in a world bereft of things worthy of investment. Even if it hits $1 million tomorrow, we’re not selling. What would we even sell it for? To diversify? Into what? A stock market completely dependent upon money printing? An investment property where our tenants won’t have to pay rent following the stroke of a politician’s pen? A shiny rock with “intrinsic value”?</p><p>You see, how could Bitcoin be a Ponzi when Bitcoiners don’t even want your dollars? What you don’t understand is that we’re playing a different game now. What you don’t understand is that we’re trying to build something new; a better future for our children and grandchildren. </p><p>So, if you think bitcoin is doomed to crash and burn then short it. Try to profit off our demise, though I don’t think you will.</p><p>We will just keep buying and holding, continuing to front-run you and Wall Street, and everyone else who refuses to even try to understand Bitcoin. We hold no anger or resentment toward you. We don’t want to eat the rich, or to burn the system down; we just don’t want to play by your rules anymore.

Sam Bankman-Fried, better known by the three letter acronym SBF, burst onto the scene at the peak of the 2017 bubble, founding Alameda Research that September, just four years after graduating from an internship into a full-time position at one of the world’s largest market makers, Jane Street Capital. </p><p>SBF is the son of Stanford Law professor and founder of left-wing super PAC Mind The Gap, Barbara Fried, and Stanford professor Joseph Bankman, an expert on tax shelter laws and government regulation. At the start of 2018, SBF had struck digital gold while taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presenting itself between a higher demand for bitcoin in the Asian market, colloquially known as the “kimchi premium”. By the end of the year, and after amassing a considerable fortune from this high-volume bitcoin/dollar spread, he officially moved to Hong Kong, formally founding the derivatives exchange FTX in the following spring. </p><p>The Bitcoin network that SBF rode from rags to riches and back again was partially launched in direct response to the fiat money experiment rearing its ugly head in the subprime mortgage, real estate and eurodollar crises that culminated into what is now known as the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. </p><blockquote><p>“??EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks%”</p><p>  - Satoshi Nakamoto, January 3, 2009</p></blockquote><p>This now infamous inscription in the genesis block made clear the inappropriate fractional reserve banking and predatory loan fiascos of our regulated banking industry was to be put to rest once and for all by this emergent monetary protocol; a completely transparent and decentralized ledger would de-incentivize fraud and prevent obfuscation of illicit activity. A new competitor to the dollar arose from the ashes of the meltdown, and with it, a new standard for financial fairness, complete with predictable issuance, controlled once and for all by the people for the people. Yet in any system made with good intentions, criminals like SBF and his bought-and-paid-for political and media allies manage to find a way to hurt innocent people for the advantage of an unknown few. Like most intriguing stories of fraudulent financial crimes, this one starts in the Bahamas, and ends with a tidal wave of asset liquidations and broken homes. </p><blockquote><p>“If you think the Bahamas has ruined your global tax system, you have a pretty terrible global tax system.”</p><p>  - Steven Dean, Summer 2020 [1]</p></blockquote><h2>Launching The Stablecoin, CBDC Race To The Bottom</h2><p>The Bahamas seems innocuous enough, and yet there is a long history of U.S. tax avoidance, complete with rum-running bootleggers during the prohibition era. Continuing this tradition, the Caribbean banking centers, including the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, as of August 2022, were the fourth-largest foreign holders of treasury securities, behind only Japan, China and the U.K. Shortly after the time of its founding, FTX was fully taking advantage of the free money era that began with the 2008 crash and was sustained by low-to-zero interest rates brought upon by the Trump administration. </p><p>These rate cuts were started by the Trump-nominated and Biden-renominated Jerome Powell and were further exacerbated by both of their administrations’ COVID responses. An unprecedented pumping of all things dollar denominated occurred, with real estate, stock indexes, bitcoin and a whole bunch of unregistered securities known as altcoins reaching new highs across the board. In June 2019, one month after the founding of FTX, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg announced Libra, a digital currency based on a basket of international currencies; a novel take on stablecoins. This launched the stablecoin and CBDC race in earnest, and coincidentally enough, the Central Bank of the Bahamas became the first such institution to announce its own CBDC, the sand dollar, in October 2020. The sand dollar itself was pegged to the Bahamian dollar, which is itself pegged to the United States dollar, and thus with its government-sanctioned launch, the birth of the first central bank-issued stablecoin dollar came to be on the sandy beaches of SBF’s new home.</p><blockquote><p>"What is the reserve currency of the crypto economy going to be? Right now it's unambiguously the USD. And interestingly it's USD whether or not you're looking at the American crypto economy."</p><p>  - Sam Bankman-Fried, November 5, 2021</p></blockquote><p>While the U.S. government feigned fear of systemic risk at the time, the Chinese government understood the Libra project to be a backdoor dollarization of the G7 currencies rumored to be included in its basket. A Metaverse-held take on the 1985 Plaza Accord, this plan of coordinated central banking would spread USD network users across the internet’s biggest network, sped up by the high velocity available in centralized digital payments and globalized by the borderless nature of the Facebook user base. </p><p>The digital yuan was trialed in April 2021 with great haste in reaction to this development, and by the Winter Olympics 2022, had launched for foreign attendees in Beijing. Not to be outdone by these new-look, same-shit fiat cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin made its own financial history when President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador took to the stage at Bitcoin 2021 to announce the legal tender aspirations of his small but dollarized nation. On March 9, 2022 President Joe Biden signed Executive Order #14067–”Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets”, which included aspirations for mitigation of financial risks in digital asset markets, as well as a clause stating that within 210 days, the attorney general, in consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, must provide a formal proposal for a government-issued CBDC.</p><p><br>By this point, the Bitcoin financial system had been utterly and properly dollar-ified, with billions of dollars in liquidity of dollar-denominated trading pairs making up the lion’s share of market activity. The same can be said for the Ethereum network, which has seen its compliance-driven perversion by non-native assets taking the wheel from its token Ether, as stablecoin and other dollar derivatives now uphold the majority of economic weight of the system. Both stablecoin giants Circle, issuer of USDC, and Tether came out in support of the merge, further ossifying their stake in the now-nearly-70%-OFAC-compliant blockchain. [2] As of this article’s writing, over 15.5 million ether are currently staked without active withdrawals in the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, worth nearly $18 billion dollars.[3] Fortunately for Bitcoin, the consensus weight of its system is not manipulated by user stake, and thus the Bitcoin market has been seemingly unaffected – negatively anyway – by this decade-long development. At least until scammer Do Kwon and his ponzi-scheme Luna wreaked havoc on investors at the start of May of 2022.</p><blockquote><p>“[Crypto is] obviously serious…you want to do right by it in the regulatory space.”</p><p>  - President Bill Clinton, April 27, 2022 (Allegedly) [4]</p></blockquote><h2>Contagion Spreads</h2><p>Only a few weeks after SBF hosted a keynote with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bill Clinton at the FTX-organized Crypto Bahamas conference, one of the largest-ever over-the-counter bitcoin purchases was announced by the LUNA team. </p><p>Terraform Labs and the non-profit Luna Foundation Guard, two entities headed by Do Kwon, had begun a campaign to purchase bitcoin as a reserve asset in the event that their algorithmic stablecoin, UST, deviated from its $1 peg. Shortly before their collapse, the plan had ballooned to the lofty goal of stacking over $10 billion in the hardest known digital commodity known to man. This purchase was financed with Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, and was facilitated by cryptocurrency broker Genesis. </p><p>"Terra's remarkable growth has continuously reshaped crypto markets over the last two years”, said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis. “Genesis is excited to be a liquidity partner to the Terra ecosystem, connecting it to a broader audience of institutional market participants." </p><p>With the bitcoin reserves of Luna Foundation Guard totalling 80,394 BTC, valued at over $3.1 billion on May 5, 2022, this purchase placed LFG among the top-10 bitcoin holders in the world. [5] But only for a moment, for while it might feel like a lifetime ago, what happened next should look awfully familiar; the peg was attacked, the recently-purchased bitcoin fortune was liquidated, Binance, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), aptly halted all trading on LUNA and UST pairs – with notable exceptions to their own stablecoin BUSD – and Kwon seemingly fled to outside of U.S. jurisdiction to Asia. [6] </p><p>Thus begins our first of many repeatable points of inquiry; where exactly did this bitcoin go? According to an audit released in November 2022, over 33,000 bitcoin were transferred to Binance on May 10, 2022, and sold along with other assets while failing to defend the peg. [7] The same day the nearly $1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin hit Binance’s order books, bitcoin’s USD price broke below $30,000, falling from $40,000 just a week before. </p><p>On May 13, SBF purchased a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, the trading platform that came under scrutiny for halting trading during the GameStop fiasco in early 2021. Bloomberg had reported that around 40% of Robinhood’s revenue came directly from selling customers orders to firms such as Two Sigma Securities, and Citadel Securities. [8] Citadel had been fined $700,000 in July 2020 for front running trades placed by customers orders, and in September of that same year, Robinhood itself was questioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for improperly informing clients of selling stock trades to known high-frequency trading firms. </p><p>Previously in December 2020, Robinhood had agreed to pay $65 million to settle charges of repeated misstatements for failure to disclose their receipts of payments from said trading firms. [9] When newly-nominated Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen briefed newly-elected President Joe Biden on this conflict of interest in February 2021, she herself had to acquire an ethics waiver due to having received at least $700,000 in speaker fees from Citadel LLC the year prior. [10] SBF had disclosed this purchase via a filed Schedule 13-D form with the SEC, costing $648.3 billion dollars and giving him 2.8% voting power in their dual-class share structure, under the entity Emergent Fidelity Technologies; a name said to be randomly generated. [11]</p><blockquote><p>“On July 13, Coinbase Exchange will be unifying USD and USDC order books. As part of the unification process, USDC order books will be merged under USD order books to create a better, more seamless trading experience with deeper liquidity for USD and USDC.”</p><p>  - Coinbase Exchange Twitter, June 29, 2022 [12]</p></blockquote><p>Circle, the entity behind the increasingly utilized USDC stablecoin, had previously expanded their international offerings with a subsidiary operation based in Bermuda with an announcement made on July 22, 2019. [13] This entity, filed under the Digital Assets Business Act of 2018 (“DABA”) meant that Circle was the first major stablecoin issuer to receive a Class F (“Full”) DABA license that covered their operation of custody, payment services, exchange, trading and more financial services within the digital asset realm. Circle’s other banking partners, Signet, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital had made USD loans to Celsius, Voyager, Block Fi, Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research. By the time this article was written, all had filed for bankruptcy. Two of their other business affiliates, Galaxy Digital and Genesis, have also reported massive losses in the FTX collapse, with rumors of further contagion effects coming. Coinbase, a publicly-traded exchange under the ticker $COIN, announced in its Q2 2022 shareholder letter that nearly one third of total revenue was derived from interest on USD-denominated holdings, including a large USDC position: </p><p>“Interest income was $33 million, up 211% compared to Q1. The increase was primarily driven by our USDC activity, as well as higher interest rates as we generate interest on fiat customer custodial funds… at the end of Q2, we had $6.2 billion in total $USD resources. In addition, we had $428 million of crypto assets.” [14] </p><p>When the letter was released in late August 2022, interest on USDC holdings for 12 months was up to 4.7%, while one-month yields were an even 4%. By November 16, 2022, USDC yields were down to 0% across all time frames.[15]</p><blockquote><p>“1) Binance converts USDC --&gt; BUSD, and we see the change in supplies. Thus begins the Second Great Stablecoin War.”</p><p>  - @SBF, October 23, 2022 [16]</p></blockquote><p>On September 4, 2022, Binance announced that it would be auto-converting all USDC, USDP and TUSD, three major dollar stablecoins, into its self-issued BUSD, effective in just 25 days. [17] This led to continued concerns about Binance’s solvency with the preceding few months, especially July 2022, seeing the largest known outflows of bitcoin in the exchange’s history, eclipsing even March 2020’s black swan bottom. </p><p>On October 11, 216 days after Biden’s executive order with the aforementioned 210-day clause, BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank with over $43 trillion on the books, and coincidentally, the custodian of Circle’s reserves backing USDC, announced the launch of its digital asset custody program. [18] Involved with more than 20% of the world’s investable assets, the bank founded by the first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, was also listed as a partner in the FedNow pilot. [19] </p><p>Despite these institutional developments, a continued bear market weighed heavily on the now-plummeting bitcoin price. Paradoxically, more and more Bitcoin hash rate poured onto the network. These concurrent movements saw Bitcoin’s hash price plummet to an all-time low, spurring a massive liquidation of bitcoin liabilities off mining operators books. On October 26, Core Scientific, then the largest Bitcoin mining operation in the world, filed for bankruptcy with millions of dollars in debt liabilities, thousands of ASICs, and yet in their filings, held only 24 bitcoin total when the circus came to town. [20] Where exactly did all this bitcoin go? On that same day, barely two weeks before the FTX collapse, Binance saw its largest single day outflow, with 71,579 coins, totalling over $1.1 billion in dollar terms. [21] This pushed net outflows to nearly 95,000 coins from the world’s largest exchange since just that July. Again, where exactly did all this bitcoin go? The very next day, October 27, 2022, SBF appeared on The Big Whale and announced future plans for FTX to launch its very own stablecoin. [22] </p><h2>More Sand Than Dollars</h2><blockquote><p>“CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and caribbean islands. They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex gf who was a spy. They will torture me to death.”</p><p>  - Nikolai Muchgian, October 28, 2022 [23]</p></blockquote><p>On October 24, 2022, the MakerDAO approved a community proposal to custody nearly $1.6 billion USDC with Coinbase Prime. [24] Four days later, Nikolai Muchigan, the co-founder of MakerDAO and inventor of Rai, a DAI-fork stablecoin, tweeted that his life was in danger due to a Caribbean island blackmail ring, supposedly backed by Israeli and U.S. intelligence agents. Three days later, on Halloween, the 29-year-old coder Muchigan was found dead, having drowned in the sea off Condado Beach in Puerto Rico. [25] </p><p>Two days later, on November 2, 2022, CoinDesk reporter Ian Allison released findings that over a third of all assets – around $5.8 billion of $14.6 billion – on the balance sheet of SBF’s Alameda Research was intrinsically, and soon to be fatally, linked to FTX’s exchange token FTT. A “bank” run commenced, and after three days of nearly $6 billion in withdrawals, FTX was left with literally one single bitcoin. Where exactly did all this bitcoin go? The next day in an interview with Fortune, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong made note that USDC will become the de facto central bank digital currency in the U.S. [26]</p><blockquote><p>“The policymakers in the U.S. will set the framework that need to be followed so that the private market will actually create the solutions, and USD coin has been on a really rapid rise… the regulatory environment is one of the biggest unlocks we’re going to have in terms of growing this industry and perhaps even getting the prices to go back up in the right direction”</p><p>  - Brian Armstrong, November 3, 2022</p></blockquote><p>On November 6, CZ announced Binance would liquidate a remaining portion of FTT it had acquired from exiting FTX’s equity, having received around $2.1 billion in BUSD and FTT. Minutes after his announcement, Caroline Ellison, SBF’s partner and the CEO of Alameda Research, offered to purchase the tokens at $22 each, in an over-the-counter fashion. [27] By November 8, CZ and SBF had a phone call and seemingly came to a tentative deal for acquisition, reserving the right to back out of the deal at any time, while interestingly also leaving both U.S.-based proprietary exchanges, Binance.us and FTX.us, outside the scope of the deal. </p><p>“Things have come full circle, and FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc)”, SBF tweeted. [28] </p><p>Later that evening, FTX officially suspended all asset withdrawals. As part of the conditions of the acquisition, SBF was forced to open the FTX books and show the bottom of his pockets; seeing more sand than dollars, CZ backed out of the deal. A few important statements were made in the 48 hours or so that led up to this sudden cataclysm, including from the awfully-quiet U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission itself. </p><blockquote><p>“Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.”</p><p>  - CZ, November 6, 2022 [29]</p></blockquote><p>On November 7, 2022, the SEC officially deemed LBRY, or Library Coin, an unregistered security offering, setting a devastating precedent throughout the extended cryptocurrency market. [30] In the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, the memorandum and order read, “The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933”, the act colloquially known as The Howey Test.</p><p>Due to LBRY reserving a pre-mine of nearly 400 million LBC tokens, and the knowledge that the company to date had spent approximately half of its pre-mined LBC, the SEC determined common enterprise complete with a lack of disclosure and proper filing of its now alleged security offering through required channels in the Gary Gensler-chaired SEC. The implications of this filing sent shockwaves across the pre-mined token industry, including exchanges listing these tokens as well as the entities behind their issuance. Conveniently, the next day was November 8, the United States’ midterm elections, with the balance of the senate and the house — and perhaps the regulatory path of the digital asset industry — once again at stake. </p><p>Searching for FTX on FEC.gov brings up 456 individual campaign contributions from SBF, CEO Ryan Salame, and others. [31] Salame’s contributions total over $14 million towards GOP candidates, while SBF’s “effective altruism” contributed over $20 million in donations to DNC politicians. Having been the second leading donor to the Biden campaign, by the time the final tallies from election night rolled in, SBF’s bankroll had finally caught up with his morals, and he found himself nearly completely bankrupt. </p><p>By November 9, the day after the elections, SBF had reportedly lost 94% of his net worth, down to $1 billion from more than $15 billion, leaving him with the largest single-day loss by a person according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. [32] Early in the morning of November 10, SBF took to Twitter to explain what happened, writing “I'm sorry. That's the biggest thing. I fucked up, and should have done better”, before making a specific note that “THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE. FTX US USERS ARE FINE!” [33]</p><h2>Chapter 11</h2><blockquote><p>“The administration [...] has consistently maintained that without proper oversight, cryptocurrencies risk harming everyday Americans…The most recent news further underscores these concerns and highlights why prudent regulation of cryptocurrencies is indeed needed.”<br></p><p>  - White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, November 10, 2022 [34]</p></blockquote><p>On the eleventh day of the eleventh month, FTX and Alameda Research officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and SBF stepped down as CEO. In addition, 130 affiliated companies connected or associated with FTX also commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11. [35] The tide had gone out, and nearly everyone involved got caught swimming naked, as a near-endless tidal wave of dollar-denominated liquidations made quick work of SBF’s Caribbean empire. </p><p>While the first trickles of a dollar CBDC may have started in the Bahamas, the monsoon of coming regulation and contagion of the Second Great Stablecoin War is far from over. The dollar, having fallen 10% off 35-year DXY highs since September, looks for new ways to innovate and further dollarize markets across the globe. </p><p>On November 15, just four days after the SBF tsunami crashed to shore, BNY Mellon, as well as a dozen or so other banking institutions, announced the start of a twelve-week digital dollar pilot program with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. [36] On the very same day, BlockFi announced plans for bankruptcy filings, only five months after taking a $250 million loan from FTX, and Circle announced users would now be able to settle payments by accepting Apple Pay. [37,38] With a significant 43% discount now showing on the highly-regulated Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, further community requests for proof of reserves are growing around Genesis and Grayscale, both owned by the Digital Currency Group, and even their custodian, Coinbase Custody. [39,40] As of this writing, these requests have so far been denied for security reasons. </p><p>While appearing to be riding the wave of the booming digital asset revolution, gathering celebrity endorsements and political allies alike, it turns out SBF was drowning in debt and capital misallocation amongst the loud, mainstream praise. Later that month, on November 30, SBF was set to appear in person at a New York Times event, sponsored by Accenture, alongside Secretary Yellen, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, former Vice President Michael Pence, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and others; tickets for the event were listed at $2,499 per attendee.[41] The interview between SBF and Andrew Ross Sorkin was streamed as advertised, albeit with both parties shooting remotely.</p><p>Bitcoin tends to be a ballast of truth, bringing all sorts of ballooning fraud rushing to the surface. FTX and Alameda Research will take their place amongst the seemingly too-big-to-sink players that ended up doing just that. They will certainly not be the last. However the following weeks, months, and years play out, it is clear that SBF was but a small fish in an ocean-sized, dollarized pond. And as he quickly found out, there is always a bigger fish.</p><blockquote><p>“At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak. But you know, glass houses. So for now, all I’ll say is: well played; you won.” [42]</p><p>  – Sam Bankman-Fried, November 10, 2022</p></blockquote><hr><h3>ENDNOTES:</h3><p>[1]<a

--><p>Kazakhstan is moving forward with regulation that will further stifle its bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>The country’s federal parliamentary body has completed secondary <a href="https://yandex.ru/video/preview/14309848359203792774">approval</a> of a bill "<a href="https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=38842072&amp;pos=5;-106#pos=5;-106">On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan</a>." With a third approval, the legislation will introduce new licensing requirements for bitcoin miners based on their facility ownership and operational structure. It would also require that miners purchase their electricity from the energy provider Korem at market rates. <br><br>Previously, specific reporting and tax <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/145103/kazakhstan-formalizes-reporting-regime-for-cryptocurrency-miners">requirements were implemented</a>, including registration of names, locations and quarterly reports to the government. These occurred as a result of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/is-kazakhstan-a-home-for-bitcoin-mining">major influx of mining</a> amidst <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/129152/following-energy-shortage-kazakhstan-is-reining-in-2021s-stampede-of-crypto-miners">energy shortages</a> and protests, all while bitcoin miners fled China as a response to the government’s banning of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/china-ban-bitcoin-is-a-good-thing">bitcoin</a>.<br><br>Kazakhstan’s close proximity to China and previously highly favorable energy access led to the large amounts of hash rate migrating to the country. Afterwards, Kazakhstan went as far as seizing up to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/137902/kazakhstan-has-confiscated-nearly-200-million-in-mining-equipment-from-unregistered-miners">$200 million in mining equipment</a>&nbsp;who did not comply with regulation, and the country continues to try and absorb the benefits of the influx in bitcoin mining using legislation like this most recently approved bill. <br><br>Bitcoin Magazine <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/kazakhstan-to-establish-legal-framework-for-bitcoin-crypto">previously reported</a> on regulation in Kazakhstan, citing a <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/16024131">report</a> from the Russian media outlet Tass. In the report, Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development of the Majilis (Kazakhstan’s federal parliamentary body) detailed the government’s intentions, describing how, "Kazakhstan was used as a raw material appendage of the blockchain industry. [Through] bills, we oblige miners to license in Kazakhstan, that is, to create legal entities and become full-fledged subjects of taxation.”&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4Mjc5NjUwMzkxMTcyMjE4/how-to-heat-your-home-with-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[These Six Charts Show How Bitcoin Mining Is Enduring The Bear Market]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bear market history never repeats, but it often rhymes and these six datasets show how the bitcoin mining industry is faring today.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/six-charts-on-the-bitcoin-mining-market</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/six-charts-on-the-bitcoin-mining-market</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[bear market]]></category><category><![CDATA[hash rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 17:35:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNjgwMTk1/bitcoin-bear-market.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bear market history never repeats, but it often rhymes and these six datasets show how the bitcoin mining industry is faring today.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin mining companies continue struggling to survive the ongoing bear market. Dreams of<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-price-hits-miner-profitability"> outperforming</a> bitcoin as a public mining company are long gone.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-warns-it-might-go-bankrupt-stock-plunges.html"> Bankruptcies</a> and<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/21/riot-blockchain-sues-northern-data-over-disclosures-related-to-texas-bitcoin-mine-acquisition/"> lawsuits</a> make routine headlines. And even Wall Street analysts that were<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/good-time-to-buy-crypto-mining-stocks-says-da-davidson-as-it-slashes-hashrate-forecasts/"> once bullish</a> on bitcoin mining investment opportunities now say they’re “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/wall-street-analyst-pulling-the-plug-on-bitcoin-miners-owing-to-bear-market-woes/">pulling the plug</a>” until the market improves. But exactly how bad is the current bear market?</p><p>It’s always darkest before dawn, as the adage says. And compared to previous bear markets, the mining industry looks much closer to the end of a turbulent market phase than the beginning of it. This article explores a bunch of data sets from the current and previous bear markets to contextualize the state of the industry and how the mining sector is faring. From hardware lifecycles and miner balances, to hash rate growth and hash price declines, all of these data tell a unique story about one of Bitcoin’s most important economic sectors.</p><h2>Mining Revenue Is Evaporating</h2><p>When bitcoin’s price drops, it’s not surprising that dollar-denominated mining revenue also drops. But it has – a lot. <a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-mined-per-day/">Roughly 900 BTC are still mined every day</a> and will be until the next halving in 2024. But the fiat price for those bitcoin has plummeted this year, meaning miners have far fewer dollars for expenses like electricity, maintenance and the servicing of loans.</p><p>As the chart below demonstrates, in November, the entire bitcoin mining industry earned less than $500 million from processing transactions and issuing new coins. The bar chart below shows this monthly revenue compared to the past five years. November mining revenue marks a two-year low for monthly earnings.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NjA3MzQ1/bitcoin-mining-monthly-revenue.png" height="395" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>This past month marked a two-year low for Bitcoin mining company revenue.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Potential Hash Rate Uptrend Reversal</h2><p>Comparing the current bear market to the previous one in 2018 offers some interesting insights into how the mining industry has changed and how it has remained the same. One such comparison is hash rate growth during downward price trends. It’s not uncommon to see hash rate grow during bear markets. The annotated line chart below shows normalized hash rate growth during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets from bitcoin’s price peak to the drawdowns’ history (or current) lows.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NzM4NDE3/bear-market-daily-hash-rate-growth.png" height="393" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>So far in this bear market, Bitcoin hash rate has only grown.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>But one thing that is obviously missing from the above chart is a correction in hash rate growth during the later period of the bearish phase. In 2018, for example, the growth trend clearly changed course and dropped as the market eventually found a low for bitcoin’s price. But in the current market, hash rate has only grown. Perhaps a slight drop in hash rate through late November signals a trend change, but the question is still open.</p><h2>Collapse Of Public Mining Companies</h2><p>Perhaps the most brutal bitcoin mining chart of all shows the drawdowns of publicly-traded mining companies this year. It’s no secret that the past year has been brutal for bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the global economy in general. But mining companies in particular have been clobbered. Over half of these companies have seen their share prices fall over 90% since January. Only two — CleanSpark and Riot Blockchain — have not dropped more than 80%.</p><p>Mining companies in general are often considered to be a high-beta investment in bitcoin, meaning when bitcoin goes up, mining stock prices go up more. But this market dynamic cuts both ways, and when bitcoin falls, the downside for mining stocks is even more brutal. The bar chart below shows the massacre these stocks have endured.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin mining stocks have been massacred.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>The Rise And Fall Of Bitcoin Mining’s ‘AK-47’</h2><p>An underappreciated hallmark of the current bitcoin bear market is the precipitous decline in hash rate contributed by Bitmain’s Antminer S9 machines. This model of mining machine is occasionally<a href="https://kaboomracks.com/learn/how-to-setup-a-antminer-s9/"> referred</a> to as the “AK-47” of mining because of its durability and reliable performance. And at one point in the 2018 bear market, the S9 was king. Nearly 80% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate came from this Bitmain model during the depths of the previous bear market.</p><p>But the current bear market tells a completely different story. Thanks to new, more efficient hardware and a vice-grip squeeze on mining profit margins, the percentage of hash rate from S9s dropped below 2% in early November. The annotated line chart below shows the rise and fall of this machine.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NTQxNjM3/antiminer-s9-bitcoin-hash-rate.png" height="416" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The Antminer S9 has seen a remarkable fall.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Miner Balance Retraces Its Sell Off</h2><p>The past few months have been disastrous for the “crypto” industry as exchange wars, insolvent custodians and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/crypto-contagion-intensifies-more-dominoes-fall">other forms of financial contagion swept the market</a>. Many bitcoin investors like to assume their segment of the industry is mostly insulated from the chaos of the rest of “crypto,” but this is usually false. In the case of miners, who are notoriously bad at timing the market, some panic was evident as address balances and miner outflows appeared to drop and spike, respectively.</p><p>But this activity was short lived. The line chart below shows that miner address balances have almost fully retraced their drop from late September through October. In short, miners appear to be back in HODL mode, impervious to exogenous market events. Whether the bear market is over or not is unknown. But miners seem to be accumulating more than selling.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1ODAzOTUz/bitcoin-miner-one-hop-address-balances.png" height="413" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Miners appear to be back in HODL mode.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Hash Price Drop Today Vs. 2018</h2><p>Hash price is one of the most popular economic metrics for miners to track, even though few people outside of the mining sector understand it. In short, this metric represents the dollar-denominated revenue expected to be earned per marginal unit of hash rate. And like everything else in the bear market, hash price has fallen significantly. But its decline is not unusual, especially when it's compared to the hash price decline in 2018.</p><p>Shown in the chart below are normalized hash price drawdowns from 2018 and 2022. Readers will notice the fairly similar slope and size of the drawdowns. 2018 was slightly steeper. 2022 to date has been shallower but longer. But both were and are brutal for fledgling mining operations.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>This 2022 hash price drawdown has been shallower but longer than its 2018 equivalent.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>The Next Phase Of Mining</h2><p>Boom and bust cycles are a natural series of events for any properly functioning market. The bitcoin mining sector is no exception. For the past year, mining has seen its weaker, unprepared operators weeded out as the excesses from the bull market are brought to account. Now, in the depths of a bearish period, the real builders can continue to expand their operations and build a solid foundation for the next phase of euphoric bullishness. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

Who to trust? How can one verify for themselves? It’s all very unclear. What does it bring for precoiners, casual bitcoiners and purists alike? Confusion, fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD). The state of bitcoin privacy is embarrassing with all this perpetual drama scaring away new users. Precious time is wasted by developers, educators and regular users who would probably be better off doing anything but trying to keep up with the drama. </p><p>It is obvious that no one agrees on “how to do CoinJoins right,” let alone, how CoinJoins should be implemented to optimize user privacy and block space efficiency on the Bitcoin network? What are the tradeoffs between different implementations? Are some implementations outright flawed? How do CoinJoins “cross the chasm” from early adopters to mainstream users when billions of people will turn to bitcoin in the coming years? </p><p>Let’s now take a look at CoinJoins by asking fundamental questions and raising some assumptions to build some sort of mental models, which will be useful in evaluating different implementations in future articles. </p><h2>Not All CoinJoins Are Made Equal </h2><p>Blockspace efficiency should be considered to make sure CoinJoin transactions scale as Bitcoin gets used by more people across the world. This is rarely discussed as a top priority. Any CoinJoin design that ignores blockspace scarcity is unnecessarily spamming the block chain while accumulating technical debt, which will be difficult to pay back as more users CoinJoin in the future. Having a minimal footprint on the block chain is one goal that seems very reasonable to aim for: a small number of transactions to get to an acceptable level of anonymity sounds ideal. </p><ul><li>What is an acceptable level of anonymity? </li><li>What does anonymity even mean in the context of bitcoin privacy?</li><li>How are particular CoinJoin designs dealing with blockspace scarcity?</li></ul><h2>Reclaim Your Privacy</h2><p>Anonymity in bitcoin would mean that there are no outstanding or unusual features that would make a given transaction remarkable from other transactions on the ledger. That, of course, is not by design on the Bitcoin network, which is a pseudonymous system where coins (UTXOs, which stands for Unspent Transaction Output in technical terms) are by default not fungible due to having unique transaction histories. </p><p>CoinJoins add a level of anonymity to the bitcoin network by breaking links between transaction inputs and outputs primarily making resulting UTXOs indistinguishable from each other. There are other heuristics that chain analysis companies use to watch the bitcoin network, such as common input ownership, self-spending, round amounts or timing analysis to name a few, which may or may not be obscured by CoinJoins. </p><p>CoinJoins help bitcoiners reclaim their privacy but are not the solution to everything. If privacy is understood as the choice to share information about oneself, great privacy can be achieved through CoinJoins but picking the right implementation is essential. </p><ul><li>What is my privacy goal using CoinJoins? </li><li>Which heuristics does a CoinJoin implementation protect me against?</li><li>What are the risks that I want to avoid?</li></ul><h2>Number Of Participants</h2><p>Existing CoinJoin implementations have very different ways of improving privacy. Irrespective of each CoinJoin implementation design, the anonymity set (one measure for the level of anonymity) seems to be the most traditional way to evaluate how much privacy one gets from a CoinJoin. There are other ways that will be discussed in other articles. The assumptions are that either a high anonymity set is achieved with a large CoinJoin transaction or that it is achieved over multiple smaller CoinJoin transactions. These two parameters are both important, but is there one that is more important than the other? </p><p>In terms of blockspace efficiency, the assumption would be that achieving a large anonymity set with a single very large transaction that has many participants is better than multiple very small transactions with a few participants. </p><ul><li>Is one single large CoinJoin or multiple small CoinJoins better for privacy?</li><li>How can that be verified truthfully and rigorously? How small is too small for a CoinJoin? </li><li>What is the right metric to evaluate how much privacy you can get from a CoinJoin? </li><li>What is the most blockspace efficient when it comes to the size and number of CoinJoins to reclaim your privacy?</li><li>Is it realistic to expect coins to participate in multiple CoinJoins over time as more people start using CoinJoins? How many CoinJoin rounds is enough or too much?</li></ul><p>In simple terms, CoinJoins allow bitcoiners to reclaim their privacy by giving them plausible deniability. Plausibility is a measure of probability. How likely is it that your bitcoins were spent or simply moved to another address you still control? How likely is it that one input is linked to a given output? </p><p>Obviously, the smaller the probabilities across many options, the better plausible deniability you get as a hodler. Plausible deniability is hard to preserve because errors are easy to make. Change outputs are often problematic for bitcoiners who care about privacy and are often a source of contentious discussions and criticism. Why is change output such a controversial topic in CoinJoins? </p><h2>Change Output</h2><p>It’s all about deterministic links. If bitcoin transactions had a spectrum of privacy, on one end would be a transaction with absolute plausible deniability, meaning 0% chance of knowing the link between inputs and outputs. This is also referred to as randomness or entropy in a CoinJoin. The assumption is that the more random or higher the entropy, the better. On the other end would be a transaction with 100% deterministic links between its only input and single output. </p><p>Unintuitively, a high entropy doesn’t necessarily mean that a transaction provides good privacy. A transaction with three inputs and three outputs of equal amounts technically has 100% entropy, meaning there is no way to distinguish each output from each other; and yet, there is a 33.33% chance that each input is linked to a particular output. High entropy does not necessarily mean good plausible deniability.</p><p>Change almost always has a very high deterministic link to its previous transaction. In other words, there is little doubt that a change output is not tied to the previous transaction that spent it. That can be a considerable privacy issue if a given change output were to be co-spent with other anonymous inputs following CoinJoins (though exceptions may apply in certain cases). This is usually referred to as UTXO consolidation and can be fatal to your privacy if done naïvely. </p><p>Change outputs can de-anonymize outputs that have gained some plausible deniability from CoinJoins if spent together. Errors are commonplace for bitcoiners and sometimes the realization comes too late, undoing years of diligent privacy enhancements in one single spend. How to get rid of this change output problem? </p><p>Existing CoinJoin implementations have three ways of dealing with change outputs: isolate the change into another wallet that is not CoinJoining, include the change output in the same wallet that is CoinJoining or get rid of the change output by not having change outputs at all. The latter seems to be the most advisable in terms of privacy and blockspace efficiency but further digging is required to validate or reject this assumption. </p><ul><li>Is a high entropy score enough to qualify a CoinJoin as good for your privacy?</li><li>Is it better to isolate change outputs in another wallet or should it be removed entirely?</li><li>Is a change output always bad for your privacy?</li></ul><h2>Coin Denominations</h2><p>Getting rid of change outputs in CoinJoins requires that coin denominations be variable in a CoinJoin. In other words, the inputs registered in a given CoinJoin cannot have a fixed size like 0.1 BTC, otherwise it becomes impossible (or at least very hard) to consume inputs without creating change outputs as most UTXOs don’t have round numbers (i.e. 0.19572394 BTC where 0.09572394 BTC would be the change in a 0.1 BTC fixed coin denomination CoinJoin). </p><p>Change outputs can be dangerous for your privacy, remember? Having multiple sizes for inputs and outputs in a CoinJoin seems to be a bad idea as it brings us closer to deterministic links between inputs and outputs, right? Well, yes and no. It depends. If a CoinJoin has a small number of participants (meaning few inputs and few outputs), then different denominations are a bad idea. But what if a large number of inputs and outputs are included in a given CoinJoin? </p><p>In a large CoinJoin, multiple denominations can bring a high level of plausible deniability to each resulting output without creating change outputs and requiring additional transactions, which is a highly efficient use of blockspace. It seems that many boxes could be ticked at this point. </p><ul><li>Is it better to have fixed or variable coin denominations in a CoinJoin?</li><li>How big should a CoinJoin be for variable denominations to make sense?</li><li>Are variable coin denominations the best way to get rid of change output in CoinJoins? </li></ul><p>It goes without saying that CoinJoin rounds interconnectivity should not be tolerable in any circumstances regardless of whether coin denominations are different or if the CoinJoin is a large or small transaction, right? Well, here again, there is an important nuance to understand. </p><h2>Coinjoin Rounds Interconnectivity </h2><p>It is claimed that registering inputs from past shared CoinJoins into new CoinJoins is ill-advised in all cases. Participants from mutually shared past CoinJoins do not seem to benefit from mixing together in other CoinJoins. It seems harmful to privacy, and is often criticized. </p><p>What if a CoinJoin is large and some registered inputs come from multiple other CoinJoins, each being also downstream from multiple other CoinJoins? In such a case, participants remixing together are still improving their privacy despite coming from a shared past CoinJoin. If each CoinJoin is large enough, the participants are not required to remix multiple times, though they can if they want to further increase their anonymity sets. </p><p>If many large intertwined CoinJoins are involved, the resulting anonymity set should provide plenty of plausible deniability, despite sharing past CoinJoins as origin of funds. </p><ul><li>Is CoinJoin rounds interconnectivity, which is sharing mutual past CoinJoins, a bad thing on its own?</li><li>How large should a CoinJoin be for remixing with other past inputs to be considered safe?</li></ul><h2>Personal Full Node</h2><p>Should you run your own bitcoin full node when participating in CoinJoins? On the surface, it seems like a great idea, and it usually is. Some CoinJoin implementations allow that, while others outright require it. Others won’t allow you to even use your own full node. Is that to condemn absolutely? If you’ve read until now, you should know that the answer is nuanced and opens up a deep rabbit hole to be explored later.</p><p>Running your own full node comes with usability tradeoffs, and may not add much privacy protection if not all users do it. Running your own node may even give you a false sense of security and privacy if few CoinJoin participants do it, which can be deeply harmful. If Tor is used as an anonymous way to CoinJoin (and we’ll leave it as that for now), then using a trusted full node to broadcast the CoinJoin transaction can be fine as the default. Lots of nuances, and of course, don’t trust, verify. </p><p>There are some essential questions to ask so as to not fall in the trap of privacy virtue signaling. </p><ul><li>Does the CoinJoin implementation allow to run full nodes, require them by default or don’t allow them? </li><li>If personal full nodes are not mandatory, what are the privacy shields in place? i.e. Tor, block filters, etc… </li><li>If I run my own full node, but expect most users to use a default trusted node to CoinJoin, how does that affect my privacy? Can the coordinator de-anonymize me?</li></ul><p>With privacy concerns, it is always important to understand what you’re trying to protect, and against whom. Running a full node and using it with your own wallet is the right way to use bitcoin as it allows you to verify your wallet balance and broadcast transactions to the network without trusting anyone. But when it comes to CoinJoins, there is usually a coordinator in charge. What does the coordinator do and how is it selected? Read on.</p><h2>The Coordinator</h2><p>The CoinJoin coordinator is in charge of having every participant register their inputs and outputs, and sign the collaborative transaction before broadcasting it. Most CoinJoin implementations default on a central coordinator, which is a single point of failure. Up until now, this has been an accepted tradeoff in most bitcoin communities. Can a central CoinJoin coordinator fail? Absolutely. Other implementations allow anyone to be a coordinator for each different CoinJoin, though there are other sets of trade offs here that will be discussed later. </p><p>Coinjoins being non-custodial, no loss of funds could occur if any coordinator would fail. The coordinator should never know more than what everyone knows publicly on the bitcoin network. Why? If a coordinator knows more than what is publicly available, a CoinJoin coordinator becomes a honeypot with highly sensitive data that can be exploited against bitcoiners trusting the service. </p><p>You should never trust a CoinJoin coordinator. If a CoinJoin coordinator cannot be evil, good. If it can be evil, it will be eventually, out of errors, omissions, coercion or outright dishonesty. </p><p>An example of sensitive user data would be XPUBs, which undeniably leak all the information about a wallet, its addresses, including past, current and future bitcoin transactions. Another example would be the ratio between users running their own full nodes and users trusting the coordinator’s full node to broadcast CoinJoins, as it could de-anonymize users running their own nodes, and therefore deterministically know the links between their inputs and outputs. This is yet another nuanced topic, which would require further investigation and discussion. </p><ul><li>Does the coordinator know more than what is publicly available on the bitcoin network? </li><li>Do users leak sensitive data to the coordinator, such as their XPUB or whether or not they run their own full nodes?</li><li>Does the coordinator claim that users should trust them using legal defense mechanisms? (i.e. warrant canaries, regulatory arbitrage, etc…)</li></ul><h2>Fees</h2><p>Bottom line, who pays for what in CoinJoins? These bitcoin transactions can be expensive and sometimes fee structures are unclear for bitcoiners. It’s hard to know how much good privacy will cost you or even if you are getting any privacy out of it. Some CoinJoin implementations allow a single input to buy its privacy from other inputs who only participate for free to increase their own anonymity set. Getting paid to CoinJoin? With patience, yes. </p><p>Some models rely on shared fees where only some UTXOs pay fees while others don’t. Other models rely on inviting an ever growing number of new clear inputs (not mixed yet) to fund the existing CoinJoins for remixing inputs that do not have high enough anonymity levels. Some models seem unsustainable over the long term while others are naïve, or way too expensive for most users. </p><p>And what fees are we talking about? Well usually, inputs participating in CoinJoins pay both a coordinator fee or taker fee, (the service fee to get some level of anonymity) and the bitcoin network fees. In particular CoinJoin models, these fees get waived in certain circumstances. The economics of CoinJoins is a deep rabbit hole which requires further investigation for a much deeper understanding. </p><ul><li>Who pays for what in a CoinJoin? What are all the fees? </li><li>What are the incentives of the CoinJoin coordinator? </li><li>Are all CoinJoin rounds paid for or is there any free remix?</li></ul><p>Having read thus far, the hope is that bitcoiners shopping around for CoinJoins would not necessarily have all of the answers, but the right questions to ask. A mental model or framework to evaluate different CoinJoin implementations can be quite helpful for anyone who is considering using CoinJoins to reclaim their privacy on bitcoin. Sorting through the noise of social media requires intellectual honesty and the right evaluation system rigorously applied. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thibaud Maréchal.

Only 0.5% of Nigerian citizens are estimated to be using the digital Naira, per a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-25/shunned-digital-currency-looks-for-street-credibility-in-nigeria">Bloomberg</a> report. Now, it seeks to increase the usage of it through regulations like this. <br><br></p><p>Bitcoiners have been outspoken opponents of CBDCs, describing various weaknesses that point to Bitcoin being the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/rise-fall-central-bank-digital-currency">superior</a> alternative. CBDCs, Bitcoiners <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/the-dangerous-implications-of-cbdcs">argue</a>, can lead to outsized surveillance of the population, total <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/digital-dollar-threat-civil-liberties">control</a> of people’s money and complete lack of sovereignty when it comes to the debasement of value of a currency. <br><br>Beyond that, Bitcoiners have argued that not only are CBDCs inherently bad, but their success is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/us-cbdc-narrative-is-a-fantasy">entirely improbable</a>, as the infrastructure necessary to implement them as envisioned simply doesn’t exist and is not going to be made by incapable governments. Some <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stablecoin-monster-cbdc-red-herring">have even pointed to stablecoins</a> as potential vehicles for carrying the attributes of CBDCs, while theorizing that CBDCs simply distract from the incentive perversion created by stablecoins. <br><br>Developments like these ATM limits point to the desperation of governments as they seek to hold their citizens within the boundaries of government monetary systems.

By looking at on-chain realized profit and loss data, we can see that this was true for many forced-sellers of bitcoin. Before any bitcoin price bottom, a hallmark sign that you want to see is extended periods of forced selling, capitulation and rise in realized losses. One way to view this is by looking at the sum of realized profit and loss for each month relative to bitcoin’s total market cap. We saw these bottom signals in November 2022, and similarly in the July 2022 Terra/LUNA crash, March 2020 COVID fear and December 2018 cycle bottom capitulation events.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Net realized profit/loss over market cap</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Looking at the 2018 cycle, the end was marked by excess realized losses, although this was much different with the forced liquidations and cascades of private balance sheet leverage and paper bitcoin unwinding that we saw this year.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>30-day cumulative net realized profit/loss</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We’ve talked about the current drawdown in bitcoin’s price and how that compares to previous cycles many times over the last few months. Another way to look at cyclical drawdowns is to focus on bitcoin’s realized market capitalization — the average cost basis of the network which tracks the latest price where each UTXO moved last. With price being more volatile, realized price is a more stable view of bitcoin’s growth and capital inflows. The realized market capitalization is now down 17.33% which is significantly higher than 2015 and 2018 cycles of 14.13% and 16.51%, respectively.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin realized cap drawdown</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As for duration, we’re 176 total days into the price being below bitcoin’s realized price. Those aren’t consecutive days as price can temporarily go above realized price, but price trends below realized price in bear market periods. For context, trends in 2018 were short-lived at around 134 days and the trends in 2014-15 lasted 384 days. </p><p>On one hand, bitcoin’s realized market capitalization has taken a significant hit in the previous round of capitulation. That’s a promising bottom-like sign. On the other hand, there’s a case to be made that price being below realized price could easily last another six months from historical cycles and the lack of capitulation in equity markets is still a major headwind and concern.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Net unrealized profit/loss</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As per the net-unrealized-profit/loss (NUPL) ratio, we are firmly in the capitulation phase. NUPL can be calculated by subtracting the realized cap from market cap and dividing the result by the market cap, as described in this <a href="https://medium.com/@adamant_capital/a-primer-on-bitcoin-investor-sentiment-and-changes-in-saving-behavior-a5fb70109d32">article</a> authored by By Tuur Demeester, Tamás Blummer and Michiel Lescrauwaet. </p><p>There is no denying it: For bitcoin-native cycles, we are firmly in the capitulation phase. Currently, only 56% of circulating supply was last moved on-chain in profit. On a two-week moving average basis, under 50% supply was last moved above the current exchange rate, which is something that has only ever happened in the depths of previous bear-market lows.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>When thinking of the bitcoin exchange rate, the numerator side of the equation is historically cheap. The Bitcoin network continues to produce a block approximately every 10 minutes in an unabated fashion, as hash rate ticks higher and as the ledger offers an immutable settlement layer for global value. The speculation, leverage and fraud of the previous cycle is washing to shore and bitcoin continues to exchange hands.</p><p>Bitcoin is objectively cheap relative to its all time history and adoption phases. The real question over the immediate future is the denominator. We have talked at length about the global liquidity cycle and its current track. Despite being historically cheap, bitcoin is not immune to a sudden strengthening in the dollar because nothing truly is. Exchange rates are relative and if the dollar is squeezing higher, then everything else will subsequently fall — at least momentarily. As always, position sizing and time preference is key for all. </p><p>As for the catalyst for a surge higher in the dollar denominator of the bitcoin exchange rate (BTC/USD), there are 80 trillion possible catalysts…</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/financialjuice/status/1599735857816240129"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><figure>

Bitcoin emerged as a response to this global crisis of legitimacy.</p><p>Now, more than a decade later, the economic damage created by the pandemic has triggered a further breakdown of the system. As the Federal Reserve’s infinite money printing creates high inflation, Bitcoin steadily increases its popularity as a safe haven. </p><p>At the same time, as the old economy is being destroyed, the leading global institutions have stepped forward to reboot the entire system. The key organization, the World Economic Forum (WEF), with the theme of “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">The Great Reset</a>,” <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_CBDC_Technology_Considerations_2021.pdf">prepares for</a> the rollout of the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><h2>CBDC Versus Bitcoin</h2><p>Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNnTuK5JJU"> explains</a> CBDCs as programmable money that gives issuers the power to control every transaction. Using these powers, issuers can restrict what ordinary people are allowed to spend money on.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/resist_05/status/1585028310748499969"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>In response to central banks creating their own digital currencies, the original cypherpunk and cryptographer, Adam Back tweeted:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1517843949091799042"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1517843949091799042"><em>Link to embedded Tweet here</em></a>. </p><p>Now, Bitcoin and CBDCs, two different types of digital currency with contrasting features, race toward a global adoption. The crux of this competition involves different visions of the world. The outcome of this race will determine the future of humanity.</p><h2>Shift Of Authority</h2><p>The crisis of legitimacy triggered by the financial panic of 2008 signaled the demise of the Western liberal democracy. This has begun to create a shift in the locus of authority in our society. </p><p>The idea of democracy that inspired the birth of the United States was based on a humanistic worldview. In the past, authority was placed in the gods, and the sacred text. People sought answers from the external. They turned to religion, the Bible and Popes for their decisions. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>A move towards democracy brought a shift in values. It placed authority in human hands, putting emphasis on the individual. People who were seeking behavioral norms outside of themselves began to rely on their personal experience.</p><h2>Threat To Democracy</h2><p>Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli public intellectual and historian,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> talks about</a> how, in this crisis of democracy, a threat to the humanistic worldview is now emerging from laboratories and research departments in places like Silicon Valley.</p><p>Harrai, who is<a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/yuval-noah-harari"> a lead advisor</a> to Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum (WEF),<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> points out</a> ways in which science is challenging the story of humanism. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs">explains</a> that scientists are saying there is no such thing as free will and that freedom is just another myth, an empty term that humans have invented. He defines feelings as biochemical processes of calculation and contends that there is no reason to consider them the highest authority in the world.</p><h2>Techno-Religion</h2><p>Harari, who has been<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-loves-sapiens-2019-2?op=1"> praised by</a> the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, and celebrated by tech workers in Silicon Valley, explains how in this twilight of democracy, authority is now once again moving away from humans. This time, he states it is not some gods above the clouds that control human destiny, but algorithms, and data in the clouds of the Amazon and big tech giants.</p><p>He<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGt5xklfmsU"> describes</a> a new revolution happening around this shift of authority. It is led by a “techno-religion”, the ideology that technology provides salvation. He<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3158&amp;v=g6BK5Q_Dblo&amp;feature=youtu.be"> explains</a> that this techno-religion is a data religion within which “data and information becomes a supreme source of authority and of meaning in the world.” It makes us believe that technology knows more about us than we do ourselves. It tells us, “Don’t listen to feeling or gut intuition. Just turn to data.” </p><p>Acting as a spokesperson for this new sect of techno religion, Harari<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> predicts</a> a coming of a future without humanity. He states that humans like you and I will disappear and that the earth will be dominated by very different kinds of beings or entities. Under the new authority of algorithms, Harari<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuL3wlodJC8"> describes</a> how human beings are viewed as no longer spiritual souls, but become “hackable animals.”</p><h2>Warning For Humanity</h2><p>Some saw what was coming and warned about the potential machine takeover of the world and the elimination of human beings.</p><figure>

The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto recognized that this system was not adequate by itself to secure the value of freedom and the place of individuals as supreme authority in the system.</p><p>Those who gained control over the production of money have created an economic system that works to their advantage. Concentration of economic power in a few hands turned democracy into a system of control. With sophisticated methods of persuasion, through use of propaganda and PR under the guise of democracy, the population was subjected to manipulation of their feelings.</p><p>By challenging the monopoly of money, Bitcoin — cypherpunks’ holy grail — has enabled economic liberty. With the principle of “don’t trust, verify,” this technology places the source of legitimacy with individuals, for the first time in history. </p><p>Rather than residing in the clouds of tech giants, authority is now descending into the human heart.</p><h2>Revival Of Humanism</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>The birth of Bitcoin has helped creativity and freedom of expression to flourish, creating the resurgence of the arts. It now inspires a new renaissance of humanism.</p><p>Before the Renaissance, history was seen as being shaped by divine forces. With the advent of the Renaissance, beginning in the 14th century in Italy, this view shifted.</p><p>The Renaissance placed human beings at the center of life. A man was regarded as a partner in the creation of Gods, to actively engage in shaping the course of their own lives.</p><p>Just as the Renaissance placed emphasis on the individual, now, the Bitcoin Renaissance 2.0 creates sovereign individuals, enabling human beings to truly come alive.</p><h2>A Path Of Salvation Via Proof-Of-Work</h2><p>People from all nations, with different backgrounds, started to align themselves with humanistic ideals that exist at the core of Bitcoin. Through meetups and <a href="http://b.tc/conference">conferences</a>, they are now finding one another. They begin to speak the same language and share values. </p><p>Transcending their cultural differences, they have become Bitcoiners. They are bearers of humanity, beginning to claim the source of authority in human imagination.</p><p>This is now creating a humanistic movement, generating a force strong enough to counter the techno revolution.</p><p>Between Bitcoin and CBDCs, we are now presented with a choice.</p><figure>

Through each individual voluntarily participating in a network of consensus, each of us can engage in validating our own truth.</p><p>While a path of technological salvation moves a society toward the post-human era, Bitcoin, pro-human technology inspires each individual to create a new world of humanism.</p><h2>El Salvador (“The Savior”)</h2><p>El Salvador, the country that first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">declared bitcoin legal tender</a>, has become a center of this Renaissance 2.0.

Direction: San Salvador. The Bitcoin community is about to gather here for Adopting Bitcoin, the final major Bitcoin conference of the year, but certainly not the least. Friends and Bitcoiners from around the world are flying into the country to work together and promote Bitcoin adoption. Who knows how many of them knew much about this country before the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-approves-bitcoin-legal-tender">“Ley Bitcoin” was implemented</a>?</p><p>Before returning to San Salvador, we made a pit stop in the village of Ataco — we were invited to participate in the handing out of a Bitcoin diploma, an actual qualification in Bitcoin and financial education that students in (currently) seven public schools in El Salvador receive after participating in a course offered by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/38-high-school-students-in-el-salvador-earned-a-bitcoin-diploma">My First Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>Less than a year ago, during our first trip to El Salvador living in Bitcoin only, we attended a meeting between the first principal to join the Bitcoin diploma project, government representatives and the project's founders.

Because of this, we decided to do something we had not yet done here in El Salvador and we went to Starbucks. Last year, we saw dozens of videos on Twitter of bitcoin transactions at this chain in the country and felt confident this coffee shop would our sats. </p><p>“Two cappuccinos and two chocolate muffins please,” we said. “We will pay in bitcoin!” </p><p>Silence. The waitress' lost look meant only one thing: she had never used Bitcoin before and had no idea how to do accept our proposed payment. Her colleague came to her aid but she could not remember the password to their Chivo wallet. No dice. So, we went to the McDonald's next door, with the same intent. </p><p><br>That is where the real surprise took place: Not even the McDonald's manager remembered the password for the Chivo app. Less than a year ago, the same establishment was studded with illuminated “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pkq91j/mcdonalds_el_salvador_now_mcdonalds_everywhere/">pay for your burger in bitcoin!</a>' signs. Unbelievable. <br><br></p><p>We remembered that the restaurant’s automated checkouts could create a bitcoin QR code without requiring any password and we asked the staff to try it. It worked! But what a struggle.</p><p>Education is everything. </p><p>The day before, we witnessed the final test of 16- and 17-year-olds who proved perfectly capable of creating and managing new, non-custodial bitcoin wallets, importing them into new devices, making on-chain transactions and monitoring them in a Bitcoin explorer. Less than 24 hours later, we found ourselves drinking watered-down coffee at a venue whose staff could not remember an application PIN.</p><section><figure>

It is good to see so many friendly faces again, from all over the world. The content was of a high standard and audience participation was good.</p><p>The panel I participated in was titled "<a href="https://pretalx.com/adopting-bitcoin-2022/schedule/">Orange Pilling The World’s Masses</a>" — as if that were easy. I spent the night taking notes:</p><ul><li>I don't like the term “orange pilling,” though I wish that teaching Bitcoin was as easy as swallowing a pill: You swallow it and boom, you're a Bitcoiner. I consider it a misleading term. Studying and understanding Bitcoin is a long, time-consuming process.</li><li>Bitcoin is the greatest human rights tool ever invented. It was so long before “have fun staying poor,” and its price does not even matter to me. Price is just a consequence of its technology and the social revolution it is bringing. In El Salvador, where a person understands that bitcoin is also fundamental to their own survival, they understand everything. That, for me, is the “orange pilling” moment.</li><li>What wallet do I recommend downloading for orange pilling? It depends on who I'm talking to. If it's someone completely new to the field, I go with Wallet Of Satoshi. The Lightning transactions there are amazing. True, it is completely custodial (not your keys, not your coin!), but the user experience is amazing. There are just two buttons and it's instant. It works like a charm. But if I talk to someone who already knows something about the technology, I go with Blue Wallet. In this application, you have two different wallets: the non-custodial bitcoin wallet (of which you then own the private key) and one for using the Lightning Network. I think it's very useful to make the difference between Layer 1 and Layer 2 clear. If you want to pay for a coffee with the Lightning Network, you literally have to move your bitcoin from Layer 1 to Layer 2. </li><li>In our work, we always have to keep in mind that it is really very early. As Bitcoiners, we would like to see this technology applied to the world as soon as possible. The truth is that history itself teaches us that this will not be possible. Think of credit cards: Frank McNamara invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diners_Club_International">Diners Club</a>, the world's first credit card, in 1950. It took a notable amount of time after this for credit cards to become truly relevant. Bitcoin, in addition to being a disruptive technology, is a philosophical achievement. That's why so many pre-coiners don't think they need it and that it doesn't solve any problems for them. We have to be patient and allow this creature more time to develop. </li><li>When will we reach hyperbitcoinization? I always wonder what is meant by this word. The diffusion of a technology to transmit value instantaneously and without boundaries? To me that is not hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin will allow us to vote in a distributed network, to certify in a distributed network. It will enable us sooner or later to disintermediate any trust process. Trust is obsolete.</li></ul><p>The notes worked and the panel went very well. There were roars of applause and lots of compliments.</p><section><figure>

All around us were tropical vegetation, incredible sunsets and exotic animals. People from dozens of different countries have gathered here. To sharpen your hearing was to perceive a Babel of different languages and accents. All of this happened solely because of the intuition of a pseudonymous scientist — someone who dared to dream so big as to come up with something capable of changing the world. </p><p>If this thing, in itself, is not incredible, I really don't know what is. </p><p>The truth is that Bitcoin has already changed our lives, irreversibly. And it has also already done so for so many people who are able to take this idea and embed it into their jobs or even to invent a new job from scratch. There are many such examples here. Sure, lots of technical people, like developers, journalists and entrepreneurs. But also many more creative people. The young man from India who decides to travel the world in Bitcoin, 40 countries in 400 days. The American couple who manages to teach while having fun. The journalist who, once he falls down the rabbit hole, devotes himself exclusively to Bitcoin. The driver who, thanks to Bitcoiners, sees his business scale like he never could have imagined. The small coffee producer who manages to export by getting paid in an instant and without onerous fees. </p><p>We could go on listing similar cases for hours. These are small things, let's be clear. And perhaps they are isolated examples. And it may take resourcefulness and a touch of madness to make your dreams into realities with Bitcoin. But it is already possible. Bitcoin works. It changes the lives of those who can seize opportunities and all that it takes is having that spark.</p><p>The nights in El Zonte were hot and humid at this time. The sun set quickly behind the horizon. We all met at a hotel called Palo Verde for a conference party organized by IBEX. All of our friends were there, those we love. We had something to eat, chatted for a while, and then the music started. There is nothing more liberating than dancing on the beach, feet in the sand. It was super hot, but the dance floor was still crowded. </p><p>At the entrance we were given tickets for a raffle and prizes were to be drawn. Someone in our group won a very good bottle of whiskey. That's the end. As the amber liquid trickled down our throats, we already anticipated the hangover headache. When the music ended, it was time for goodbyes.</p><p>The road home for us translates into a long walk on the shoreline, under an impressive starry sky, barefoot, with the waves placidly bathing our ankles.</p><p>Pura vida.</p><section><figure>

Bitcoin is the modern answer for international economics.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Ansel Lindner, a bitcoin and financial markets researcher and the host of the “Bitcoin &amp; Markets” and “Fed Watch” podcasts.</em></p><p>Two forces have dominated the globe economically and politically for the last 75 years: globalization and trust-based money. However, the time for both of these forces has passed, and their waning will bring about a great reset of the global order.</p><p>But this is not the global, Marxist kind of Great Reset promoted by <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">Klaus Schwab</a> and those who attend Davos. This is an emergent, market-driven reset characterized by a multipolar world and a new monetary system.</p><h2>Globalization Is Ending</h2><p>The first reaction I usually get to my claim that the age of hyper-globalization is ending is flippant disbelief. People have so completely integrated the environment of the dying global order into their economic understanding that they cannot fathom a world where the cost-to-benefit analysis of globalization is different. Even after COVID-19 exposed the fragility of complex supply chains, like when the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-were-running-out-of-masks-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/609757/">U.S. very nearly ran out of surgical masks and basic medications</a> or when the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/how-covid-19-caused-a-global-shortage-of-semiconductors-computer-chips.html">world struggled to source semiconductors</a>, people have yet to realize the shift that is happening. </p><p>Is it that hard to imagine that the businessmen who designed such fragile, overcomplicated production processes didn’t properly weigh the risks?</p><p>All that is needed to break globalization is for risk-adjusted costs to change a few percentage points and outweigh the benefits. The pennies saved by outsourcing numerous tasks to numerous jurisdictions will no longer outweigh the possibility of complete collapse of supply chains.</p><p>These concerns about fragile supply chains did not disappear as horrible COVID-19 policies ended. Now, they have shifted to concerns about trade wars and real wars. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/15/us-china-economic-financial-decoupling-controls-restrictions-sanctions/">U.S. trade sanctions against China</a>, the Russian conflict with NATO-proxy Ukraine and subsequent sanctions, the <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/07/18/why-u.s.-needs-to-say-less-and-do-more-on-taiwan-pub-87468">seemingly-erratic U.S. position on Taiwan</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJG04pElY7I">coronation of Xi Jinping and his Marxist revival</a>, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/traces-explosives-found-nord-stream-pipelines-sweden-says-2022-11-18/">Nord Stream sabotage</a>, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/countries-split-plastics-treaty-focus-un-talks-close-2022-12-03/">clear split of international consensus in the UN</a> and even the weaponization of these international institutions, and most recently, the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20221202-turkey-s-operation-against-kurds-in-syria-risks-reviving-is-group">Turkish ground offensive versus the Kurds</a> — all these things should be interpreted as a rise in costs.</p><p>Gone is the time when complex supply chains were robust against typical risks. The risks today are much more systemic. Sure, there were skirmishes around the world and disagreements among parliaments, but great powers did not openly threaten one another’s spheres of influence. Risk-adjusted costs and benefits to globalization have radically changed.</p><h2>Credit Doesn’t Like Conflict</h2><p>Very closely related to deglobalization of supply chains is deglobalization of credit markets. The same factors that affect business peoples’ physical, risk-adjusted costs and benefits are also felt by bankers. </p><p>Banks don’t want to be exposed to the risk of war or sanctions wrecking their borrowers. In the current environment of deglobalization and rising risks to international trade, banks will naturally pull back on lending to those associated activities. Instead, banks will fund safer projects, likely fully-domestic or friend-shoring opportunities. The natural reaction by banks to this risky global environment will be credit contraction.</p><p>The deglobalization of supply chains and credit will be as closely linked on the way down as they were on the way up. It will start slowly, but pick up speed. A feedback loop of rising risk leading to shorter supply chains and less credit creation. </p><h2>The Credit-Based U.S. Dollar</h2><p>The prevailing form of money in the world is the credit-based U.S. dollar. <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/learn-economy/learn-economy/what-is-money/">Every dollar is created through debt</a>, making every dollar someone else’s debt. Money is printed out of thin air in the process of making a loan. </p><p>This is different from pure fiat money. When fiat money is printed, the balance sheet of the printer adds assets alone. However, in a credit-based system, when money is printed in a loan, the printer creates an asset <em>and</em> a liability. The borrower’s balance sheet then has an offsetting liability and asset, respectively. Every dollar (or euro or yen, for that matter) is therefore an asset and a liability, and the loan that created that dollar is both an asset and a liability.</p><p>This system works extremely well if two factors are present. One, highly-productive uses of new credit are available, and two, a relative lack of exogenous shocks to the global economy. Change either of these things and a breakdown is bound to occur.</p><p>This dual nature of credit-based money is at the root of both the <a href="https://money.visualcapitalist.com/buying-power-us-dollar-century/">dollar’s spectacular rise in the 20th century</a>, and the coming monetary reset. As global trust and supply chains break down, the comingling of assets in banks becomes more risky. Russia found this out the hard way when the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153">West confiscated its reserves of dollars held in banks abroad</a>. How is trust possible in that sort of environment? When credit-based money’s creation is based on trust... Houston, we have a problem.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Role In The Future</h2><p>Luckily, we have experience with a world that doesn’t trust itself — i.e., the entire history of man prior to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">1945</a>. Back then, we were on a gold standard for reasons which included all those that bitcoiners are very familiar with (gold scores highly in the characteristics that make good money), but also because it minimized trust between great powers.</p><p>Gold lost its mantle for one reason — and you’ve probably never heard this anywhere before: because the global economic, political and innovation environment post-WWII created an extremely fertile soil for credit. Trust was easy, the major powers were humbled and all joined the new international institutions under the security umbrella of the U.S. The Iron Curtain provided a stark separation between zones of trust economically, but after it fell, there was a period of roughly 20 years where the world sang “kumbaya” because new credit was still extremely productive in the old Soviet block and China.</p><p>Today, we are facing the opposite sort of scenario: Global trust is eroding and credit has exploited all productive low-hanging fruit, forcing us into a period that demands neutral money. </p><p>The world will soon find itself split between regions/alliances of influence. A British bank will trust a U.S. bank, where a Chinese bank will not. To bridge this gap, we need money that everyone can hold and respect.</p><h2>Gold Vs. Bitcoin</h2><p>Gold would be the first choice here, if not for bitcoin. This is because gold has several drawbacks. First, gold is owned mainly by those groups who are losing trust in one another, namely the governments of the world. Much of the gold is held in the United States. Therefore, gold is unevenly distributed.</p><p>Second, gold’s physical nature, once a positive holding profligate governments in check, is now a weakness because it cannot be transported or assayed nearly as efficiently as bitcoin.</p><p>Lastly, gold is not programmable. Bitcoin is a neutral, decentralized protocol that can be tapped for any number of innovations. The Lightning Network and sidechains are just two examples of how Bitcoin can be programmed to increase its utility.</p><p>As globalization of both trade and credit is breaking down, the economic environment favors a return to a form of money that doesn’t depend on trust between major powers. Bitcoin is the modern answer.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ansel Lindner.

This comes in addition to an angel round led by Factor[e].</p><p>The investment is intended to support further expansion of bitcoin mines across Africa. In regards to this mission, the CEO of Gridless Erik Hersman said, “Africa needs affordable electricity. Our work in supporting renewable energy mini grid developers fills a gap, helping developers expand faster, be more sustainable, and serve thousands of households. This investment, and the high caliber of partners that are coming alongside us, means that we can accelerate our rollout knowing that we have both the capital and strategic support required.”<br><br>In its first year of operation, Gridless has entered five different project contract pilots in rural Kenya alongside HydroBox, an African hydroelectric energy company. Three of these pilots are now operational. Gridless finances the construction and managers the operation of the data centers in these rural communities. The company has now set its sights on expansion into other areas in East Africa. <br><br>In regards to their decision to lead this funding round alongside Block, Alyse Killeen, managing partner at Stillmark, stated, “Stillmark is focused on investing in companies that are helping to advance the Bitcoin ecosystem in ways that offer sustainable value and solutions to many. Gridless does this by bringing a socially and environmentally conscious approach to bitcoin mining, one that provides tangible benefits by way of access to electricity for communities in rural parts of East Africa.”</p><p>Thomas Templeton, lead for bitcoin mining and wallet at Block explained the company’s view too, adding that “Gridless represents a close strategic alignment with our vision of ensuring the bitcoin network increasingly leverages clean energy, in combination with bitcoin computational centers around the world.” <br></p><p>According to the press release, in 2020 more than 50% of Africans were without electricity. Gridless identifies bitcoin mining as playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing Africa’s access to cheap and reliable electricity. The release corroborates Gridless’ goal of increasing this access, as it explains, “The electricity generated from these sites is prioritized for community electrification and to support community uplift business such as containerized cold storage for local farmers, battery charging stations for electric motorcycles, and public WiFi points. After those needs are met, the remaining electricity capacity is used to power the bitcoin computational mining datacenter.” <br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Path To A Bitcoin Economy: Decentralized Bitcoin-Backed Credit]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin-backed credit built with DeFi represents a stronger and more practical vision of "bitcoin free banking" originally described in 2010 by Hal Finney.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/decentralized-bitcoin-backed-credit</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/decentralized-bitcoin-backed-credit</guid><category><![CDATA[sovryn]]></category><category><![CDATA[Credit]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Stablecoins]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[defi]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Seroy]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 02:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoin-backed credit built with DeFi represents a stronger and more practical vision of "bitcoin free banking" originally described in 2010 by Hal Finney.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by David Seroy, Founder and President of Old North Capital Fund.</em></p><p><em>It is the author's opinion that credit-based, bitcoin-backed dollars will act as the bridge connecting bitcoin, dollars, the Lightning Network, validity roll-ups, and elements of free banking in a hyperbitcoinized world.</em></p><hr><p>Bitcoin and the dollar are symbiotic. Like yin and yang, bitcoin and dollars provide balance. On the one hand, bitcoin acts as a counterparty-free, decentralized, scarce, digital bearer asset to hedge against excessive credit creation. On the other hand, the free market has an insatiable desire for issuing credit-based dollars which fill the role of both a 'stable" unit of account and an elastic monetary layer.</p><p>Thus the market has competing desires for both a fixed supply asset, as well as a monetary unit of account which is “stable" and can expand in response to economic demands. This reality leads us to believe the path to hyperbitcoinization will naturally be paved with an array of credit-based, bitcoin-backed dollars underpinned by bitcoin collateral. Nik Bhatia describes a similar vision in his book, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkW31xHP95o">Layered Money</a>.” Put simply, credit money will exist because the market demands it, but it will be backed by and therefore limited by bitcoin's fixed supply also because the market demands it. The net result is a synergistic fly-wheel will begin to form between the demand for bitcoin and bitcoin-backed dollars.</p><p>In 2010, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211">Hal Finney described such a vision</a> where bitcoin-backed banks could "issue their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins." This idea was based on George Selgin’s Free Banking research. Eric Yakes summarizes Free Banking in his article <a href="https://yakes.io/bitcoin-banking-systems-full-reserve-vs-free-banking/">"Bitcoin Banking Systems</a>":</p><p>“Imagine a world in which banks were allowed to competitively issue their own private monies and markets were allowed to sort out whether these monies were valuable. This system is built on the assumptions that (1) information transparency is high; (2) it exists within a competitive market environment; and (3) it is subject to minimal regulations. If such a system emerged and was predicated upon voluntary agreement and exchange amongst market actors, who's to say that it would not be just?”</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the three criteria can be met in the existing legacy system, and therefore we are unlikely to ever see a true bitcoin "free banking" revolution via the legacy system. Specifically:</p><ul><li>Information Transparency: Large financial institutions can and already do issue their own private dollars, but they exist on shadow ledgers outside the purview of regulators. The inability to regulate these shadow ledgers prevents any sort of broad information transparency from ever existing in the legacy banking system.</li></ul><ul><li>Competitiveness: Getting approval for a banking license is a tedious, lengthy, and highly costly endeavor. It is very much restricted to a select few and is therefore not competitive. </li></ul><ul><li>Regulation: Banks have never been more highly regulated, as a result of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (“GFC”). There is no reason to believe this will change. Even if it does, there is no assurance it would last.</li></ul><p>However, Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”) could circumvent these issues in a “<a href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2020/Oct-2020/How-Hayek-predicted-Bitcoin-and-the-rise-of-crypto">sly round-about way</a>" à la Friedrich Hayek. While much of DeFi is riddled with grift and gambling, a small subset of it is equipped to usher in the bitcoin free banking movement. </p><p>The exact mechanics could vary by protocol and would be defined by smart contracts. However, functionally it would operate as Finney originally described. Consider this excerpt from Finney's <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.0">original forum post</a> and swap in "protocol," “smart contract," and “stablecoin":</p><p>“Different banks (protocols) can have different policies (smart contracts), some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve, while others may be 100% Bitcoin-backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash (Stablecoins) from some banks (protocols) may trade at a discount to that from others.”</p><h2>Advantages Of DeFi Over Legacy Free Banking</h2><p>There are many advantages to building these "bitcoin free banks" aka protocols on DeFi over the legacy system:</p><ul><li>Transparent: Stablecoins issued via DeFi would exist on-chain, meaning on a transparent immutable ledger. Specifically, outstanding claims and underlying collateral would always be public and cryptographically auditable. Building on-chain is a superior form of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/proof-of-reserves-industry-standard">proof of reserves</a>. </li></ul><ul><li>Permissionless: DeFi removes gatekeepers just as free banking envisioned. For builders, anyone technically can create and launch a new protocol. Thus we could see a Cambrian explosion of bitcoin-backed credit experiments. For individual users no inherent restrictions such as KYC would prevent anyone around the world from interacting with the protocol.</li></ul><ul><li>Non-Custodial: With DeFi, users can maintain control of their own keys (subject to the terms of the smart contract) instead of entrusting them to centralized entities who may rehypothecate the assets—or even honest actors exposed to regulatory capture who may be coerced into giving up the keys. </li></ul><ul><li>Better Terms: By dis-intermediating banks, users can create superior terms for themselves. One such example is "Zero" (described below), which allows users to borrow stablecoins at a 0% interest rate against bitcoin collateral, with no set loan term and strong capital efficiency.</li></ul><h2>Examples In The Wild</h2><p>Active examples of bitcoin free banking would be <a href="https://fuji.money/">Fuji</a> built on the Liquid sidechain and Sovryn's <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/blog/if-bitcoin-is-magic-internet-money-zero-is-magic-internet-borrowing">Zero</a> protocol built on the RSK sidechain, both of which function as a <a href="https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/building-the-most-secure-permissionless-and-uncensorable-bitcoin-peg-b5dc7020e5ec">quasi-decentralized</a> borrowing and stablecoin services. Zero specifically allows users to provide collateral in the form of RBTC (a pegged version of bitcoin on the Rootstock "RSK" sidechain) into a smart contract and subsequently issue dollar-denominated stablecoins to themselves.</p><p>The stablecoins technically has]ve no cost to issue (Specifically, the protocol has no cost to mint tokens, but users are charged an origination fee to borrow, which normally sits at 0.5%), and thus zero interest, because the stablecoins are minted rather than diverted from another use. This is similar to the way free banks functioned when issuing private bank notes against their collateral, except the newly issued tokens have a value pegged to the dollar. Instead of banks issuing private money notes in the legacy system, protocols issue bitcoin-backed stablecoins. Instead of free banks controlling the collateral and allocation of credit, users individually interacting with the protocol control their own credit creation system. </p><p>The use of a permissionless, distributed credit creation system disempowers singular central entities from reaping privileged benefits from the Cantillon effect and controlling the allocation of new credit money.</p><h2>The Importance Of Bitcoin-Backed Credit And Stablecoins</h2><p>Outside of Bitcoin itself, stablecoins are unequivocally the "<a href="https://www.castleisland.vc/cryptodollars">killer app</a>" in crypto. Alex Gladstein argues that the importance of stablecoins as a humanitarian tool “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIjfsX6j958">is impossible to deny</a>.” The market capitalization of stablecoins strongly affirms the crucial place of stablecoins.</p><p>Some Bitcoiners struggle to acknowledge the importance of dollars, as it can seem antithetical to the Bitcoin ethos. However, bitcoin-backed credit makes these ideas compatible. When stablecoins are minted as claims against bitcoin collateral, this process is effectively a short against the dollar. Over a long time frame, we would expect the value of bitcoin to increase as the dollar decreases in purchasing power, thus making it easier to pay back the debt. This is the premise of Pierre Rochard's article “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/">speculative Attack."</a> </p><p>The key component of bitcoin-backed credit is the ability to create a synergy and fly-wheel between dollars and bitcoin. Specifically, as the market demand for censorship-resistant dollars increases, it consequently drives demand for more bitcoin collateral to be purchased and locked in smart contracts to mint stablecoins and meet that demand. Separately, as organic demand for issuing bitcoin backed increases (such as borrowing against it at 0% interest rate), it leads to the creation of more liquidity of censorship-resistant stablecoins. Both censorship-resistant stablecoins and loans against bitcoin collateral have proven to have significant demand. Tying these two high-demand products together creates a synergy between dollar and bitcoin advocates that mutually perpetuate growth of the other.</p><h2>The Tech Stack And The Circular Economy</h2><p>Due to Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities, projects such as Zero and Fuji currently must be built on Bitcoin sidechains that provide for smart contract functionality. The tradeoff is that users must lock their bitcoin in a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/federated-sidechains-bitcoin-original">federated</a> multisignature address and receive a bitcoin derivative known as RBTC or L-BTC.</p><p>In the interim, this is a trust limitation that is not perfectly aligned with the Bitcoin ethos. However, we can use these federated models to prove product-market fit while exploring research around trustless options such as <a href="https://www.drivechain.info/">drivechains</a> and validity rollups (aka "zk rollups"). <a href="https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1579856946781298688?s=20&amp;t=L1zD2qTNB6rSCOW97DiwLQ">Validity rollups</a> are particularly interesting as a way to create a trustless two-way peg that could one day replace the functionality of federations and circumvent the current trust assumptions of sidechains without altering the core tenets of the Bitcoin base layer. A detailed analysis of validity rollups on Bitcoin can be found <a href="https://bitcoinrollups.org/">here</a>. Alternatively, video's discussing ZK Roll-ups on Bitcoin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feODuDF2xv0&amp;t=1s">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qChILPxdOA4">here</a>:</p><p>An eventual future could include creating a trust-minimized bridge between stablecoins minted on a validity Rollup that are then subsequently used for payments on the Lightning Network. This could be enabled by the developments of <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taro">Taro</a> and <a href="https://www.rgbfaq.com/faq/what-is-rgb">RGB</a>, which allow the issuance of tokens (but have limited smart contracting functionality in part due to having no global state) onto the Lightning Network. Currently the vision for Taro and RGB is to bring well-established stablecoins like USDT and USDC onto Lightning. However, the ability to send bitcoin-backed stablecoins which are more censorship resistant, and drive demand to the underlying bitcoin collateral, instead of centralized fiat stablecoins across the Lightning Network is more consistent with the Bitcoin ethos and would be the next evolution of creating a more decentralized circular bitcoin economy. </p><p>The advent of bitcoin-backed stablecoins bridges these technologies together in a world which allows HODLing bitcoin forever, while getting the short- to medium-term benefit of a bitcoin backed dollar unit of account, with the superior payment rails of Lightning. Rather than working against the dollar and its ubiquitous acceptance as a unit of account, decentralized bitcoin-backed credit works with it to build a superior system with Bitcoin at its base.</p><p><strong>Read More &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-backed-loans">DeFi &amp; CeFi platforms offering Bitcoin backed loans</a></p><h2>Implications Of Bitcoin-Backed Credit</h2><p>On the surface, bitcoin-backed credit using DeFi allows Bitcoiners to get dollar denominated loans without having to sell their bitcoin, in a KYC-free and non-custodial manner. However, that would be hugely understating its importance.</p><p>On a deeper level, bitcoin-backed credit will be the incentivized bridge to hyperbitcoinization. It will facilitate a transition from dollars to bitcoin-backed dollars, to eventually completely new bitcoin-backed credit instruments, as the dollar fades into irrelevance. </p><p>By breaking down the barriers and opacity to credit creation using DeFi, we will disempower centralized authorities’ monopoly on money creation. Simply being able to have and to transfer bitcoin, the asset, is not sufficient. We must also decentralize the financial services and money-creation layers. If we ignore these monetary layers, then we relegate Bitcoin to a life of gold 2.0 in truly all the worst ways — a world in which central authorities use the ever-present demand for credit to hijack our monetary sovereignty through custody. </p><p>The transition to Bitcoin DeFi will shift the paradigm from top-down centralized money creation to distributed bottom-up. Specifically, individuals will have the option to become their own credit creators. The banks and central authorities will no longer be able to unilaterally dictate how credit is created and where it is allocated. This will create a distributed model of capital allocation with an infinite number of isolated experiments as opposed to a few centralized allocators, which more properly reflects the desires of the market.</p><p>The importance of decentralized bitcoin-backed stablecoin loans via DeFi cannot be understated.

According to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/12/05/2567462/0/en/Riot-Announces-November-2022-Production-and-Operations-Updates.html">the release</a>, the company produced 521 BTC, a 12% increase on its November 2021 production of 466 BTC. It sold 450 BTC, generating net proceeds of $8.1 million, and had a deployed fleet of 72,428 miners with a hash rate capacity of 7.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) on November 30.<br><br>Jason Les, CEO of Riot stated, “Riot again achieved a new record for total hash rate capacity during the month of November, resulting in our highest monthly bitcoin production figure to date.” He did caveat this positivity, saying, “Despite this new level of production, expected production was approximately 660 bitcoin given our operating hash rate over the month, assuming normalized performance of the mining pool we participate in. Variance in a mining pool can impact results and while this variance should balance out over time, can be volatile in the short term. This variance led to lower bitcoin production than expected in the month of November, relative to our hash rate.” <br><br>Bitcoin’s hash rate has been on a tear in recent months, <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc">achieving new all-time highs</a> and effectively making miners not using cutting-edge equipment unprofitable. This in turn has an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-hash-rate-increases-implications-for-equities">impact on the public companies exposed</a> to this market.</p><p>To better formulate an outlook on their production, Les stated in the release, “In order to ensure more predictable results going forward, Riot will be transitioning to another mining pool which offers a more consistent reward mechanism, so that Riot will fully benefit from our rapidly growing hash rate capacity as we work towards our goal of reaching 12.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023.”<br><br>The report did not specify which mining pool Riot will now point its miners towards.</p><p>Looking ahead, Riot seeks to achieve a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/s during Q1 2023, assuming full deployment of approximately 115,450 Antminer ASICs. <br><br>However, this does not include any potential incremental productivity gains from the company’s utilization of 200 MW of immersion-cooling infrastructure. The majority of Riot’s self-mining fleet will consist of the latest S19-series miners. In addition to its self-mining operations, the company hosts approximately 200 MW of institutional Bitcoin mining clients.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best Apps To Buy Bitcoin in 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[Discover the best mobile payment apps.

Apps are the quickest and most convenient way to buy or sell Bitcoin. Read our guide covering the top 10 payment apps.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Payment apps are the easiest and quickest way to buy or sell bitcoin and directly convert it into fiat currencies or vice versa.</p><p>Most payment apps are very similar in use and functionality; however, some are more aligned with the Bitcoin ecosystem and focused on applying certain standards — such as Strike using the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> for fast and secure payments, or Relai, offering a non-custodial wallet and a no-KYC policy. </p><p>A bitcoin payment app allows users to pay with bitcoin and businesses to accept bitcoin payments for goods and services. Bitcoin payments usually happen through gateways that automatically convert bitcoin into fiat currencies. </p><p>Payment apps are mostly like traditional digital payments with lower fees. If users also want to trade bitcoin, they’ll have to sign up for a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/best-bitcoin-only-exchanges">Bitcoin exchange</a> that offers a better range of trading services. </p><p>Note: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/best-bitcoin-only-exchanges">Bitcoin-only exchanges</a>, P2P bitcoin platforms and exchanges that publish their <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/proof-of-reserves-industry-standard">proof of reserves</a> are usually regarded as being safer to use. However, the best you can do to protect your bitcoin is to move it out of the exchanges as soon as your trade is executed and store it safely in your wallet with your private key.</p><h2>Best Apps To Buy Bitcoin</h2><p>1. <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> is a payment app similar to PayPal or Cash App, with the main difference being the payment network used. While the most popular apps use traditional systems like SWIFT, Strike uses Bitcoin and the Lightning Network to secure payments. Launched in 2020, the app is currently only available in the U.S. and El Salvador but will soon be rolled out in Europe with the aim to expand it to the rest of the world as a global transaction and remittance service that needs no intermediary to function.</p><p>2. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> is a peer-to-peer payment system that allows users to purchase and sell bitcoin and stocks. Unlike Robinhood, the platform enables investors to transfer bitcoin to their wallet, although withdrawals are limited to $2,000 daily or $5,000 within any seven days. Cash App sets a fee depending on price volatility and market trading volume, which is disclosed at the time of purchase.</p><p>3. <a href="https://bitpay.com/">BitPay</a>: As one of the first bitcoin payment systems launched in 2011, BitPay is still a popular option for merchants and customers. Users can download the app and have access to a crypto debit card, wallet and web browser extension. You can buy or sell bitcoin with the app and use it for online retailers through the Chrome extension. They have a 1% flat transaction fee applied to all businesses.</p><p>4. <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> is based in Switzerland and is Europe’s most accessible bitcoin-only investment app. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/relai-enables-instant-bitcoin-purchases">It enables instant bitcoin purchases</a> with no deposit, registration or strict KYC procedure. The Relai app only provides non-custodial wallets, meaning its customers maintain control of their private keys at all times.</p><p>5. <a href="https://peachbitcoin.com/">Peach</a> is a peer-to-peer mobile app that allows customers to buy and sell bitcoin. The service is still in beta mode, and there’s a waiting list to join it; however, it is one of the few Bitcoin P2P marketplaces on a mobile application for the European market.</p><p>6. <a href="https://river.com/">River</a> is a U.S.-based, bitcoin-only custodial exchange that claims to be very easy and secure to use while offering plenty of good educational material to understand Bitcoin.</p><p>River charges fees based on how much bitcoin you buy, starting from 1.20% but offers no fees for recurring buys. River stores all bitcoin offline in secure cold storage and also offers customers to buy bitcoin miners.</p><p>7. <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan</a>&nbsp;is River’s main competitor in the USA and claims to be the most secure platform to buy bitcoin. Swan provides similar services to River, with the main difference being the fees: Swan’s are 0.99% while River’s start at 1.2%. They offer recurring daily, weekly or monthly purchases, which they make enticing due to a very competitive USD/BTC conversion rate.</p><p>8. <a href="https://www.revolut.com/go-from-cash-to-crypto-instantly/">Revolut</a> was one of the first European fintech apps to offer cryptocurrency trading, although with a temporary license. In 2022 it won full authorization to provide its cryptocurrency services across Europe and the U.K. The app is straightforward to use and supports the trading of cryptocurrencies at competitive exchange rates, having access to the largest liquidity pool in Europe. Its metal customers in the U.K. can also transfer bitcoin to their private wallets.</p><p>9. <a href="http://pocketbitcoin.com/">Pocket</a> is a young company and so far available in some <a href="https://pocketbitcoin.com/faq/where-is-pocket-available">European countries</a>. It enables you to stack satoshis by setting up recurring payments from your bank account directly to your preferred wallet. Each payment will be automatically exchanged to bitcoin and paid out on the date you set. </p><p>10. <a href="https://amber.app/">Amber</a>&nbsp;enables multiple ways of automating your Bitcoin transactions, such as buying when Michael Saylor buys or when Peter Schiff tweets about Bitcoin. They offer a number of such clever solutions, affording customers the ability to create a plan and leave it to the app to execute. Amber charges basic members 0.99% fees on Bitcoin transactions, while holders of a premium account are not charged any fees. Bitcoin is stored in cold storage in a collaborative multi-signature set up with Unchained Capital for custodial wallets.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions: </h2><p><strong>Which is the safest app for Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>The safest Bitcoin app is a service that allows you to move your bitcoin off the platform to a private hardware wallet. Only you must have access to that wallet and hold the private key.</p><p><strong>What is the best Bitcoin app for beginners?</strong></p><p>General-purpose apps like Revolut or Cash App are usually good for onboarding beginners at their first experience with purchasing bitcoin. Relai, a bitcoin-only app, is also a very straightforward app with low fees.</p><p><strong>Where is the best place to buy Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin Magazine always recommends decentralized P2P exchanges or bitcoin-only exchanges, but ultimately the best you can do to secure your assets is to move them out of exchanges right after the purchase.</p><p><strong>Is Paypal a good option to buy Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>PayPal launched its crypto service in late 2020, offering customers the ability to buy, hold and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Although they provide the option to buy Bitcoin, there are far better options available to buy and then secure your BTC.</p><h2>Summary: </h2><p>We’ve come a long way from Mt. Gox being the only reputable exchange in the market. Today, we experience the creation of new exchanges on a regular basis, even though some are perhaps too large. </p><p>The dramatic events of 2022, with the collapse of giant crypto services like FTX and Celsius, will teach everyone the most important lesson of all: move your coins out of exchanges and always self-custody after purchase. </p><p>Especially for considerable amounts, bitcoin should only be stored in hardware wallets or multisig noncustodial wallets. Services with a single point of failure (centralized) are always at risk of losing your assets, as has happened multiple times in the short history of cryptocurrencies.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMzMzIzMzE5NDY5NTcz/best_bitcoin_payments_apps-01.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data Suggests Bitcoin Miners Have Capitulated, Bottom Is Close]]></title><description><![CDATA[The inflection point in every bitcoin bear market is capitulation, and the mining sector may have just reached its own trough of bearishness.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin price]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[bear market]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 16:27:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MjkyMDIwNzAyMjkwOTU4/bitcoin-price-and-bitcoin-mining-asic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The inflection point in every bitcoin bear market is capitulation, and the mining sector may have just reached its own trough of bearishness.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Zack Voell, a bitcoin mining and markets researcher.</em></p><p>Bitcoin miners often suffer the brunt of bear market woes thanks to some of the industry’s highest capital expenditures, smallest margins and most unreliable infrastructure. Although the current bearish phase has been one of Bitcoin’s<a href="https://twitter.com/zackvoell/status/1595614076834652162"> shallowest</a> drawdowns, miners have suffered more than ever.<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/compass-mining-retrenches-15-of-staff-execs-to-take-major-pay-cuts"> </a></p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/compass-mining-retrenches-15-of-staff-execs-to-take-major-pay-cuts">Layoffs</a>,<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/22/crypto-mining-data-center-provider-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/"> bankruptcies</a>,<a href="https://decrypt.co/114789/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-facing-lawsuit-improperly-disclosing-financials"> lawsuits</a> and other negative press have battered one of Bitcoin’s most prominent sectors. But every bear market eventually finds a bottom — the pain climaxes and things slowly begin to recover. A variety of data suggest mining has reached this point of its market cycle, which could offer a bit of optimism going into the new year.</p><p>This article is not intended to offer financial or investment advice of any kind. On the contrary, its intended purpose is data-driven analysis of the current state of the bitcoin mining sector in context of some exogenous and endogenous influences that could shape its near-term future.</p><h2>Understanding Capitulation</h2><p>Before diving into the data, it might help to understand what “capitulation” is. The term is commonly used in financial markets to reference an acute and often dramatic crescendo of fear or widespread surrender by investors or businesses during the throes of depressed market conditions. Basically, everyone says, “It’s over. We can’t take this anymore.” For mining, capitulation basically means the economics became so bad and operating margins are so thin that miners chose to quit or simply cannot operate anymore and are squeezed out of the market.</p><h2>Wall Street Analysts Turn Bearish</h2><p>One of the hallmark signs of miner capitulation (in this author’s opinion) at the current stage of the ongoing bear market is the full pivot from financial analysts who report on publicly-traded mining companies. For the past 12 months, these analysts have preached about the upside potential of bitcoin mining stocks. But now they are “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/wall-street-analyst-pulling-the-plug-on-bitcoin-miners-owing-to-bear-market-woes/">pulling the plug</a>.” This language was used by Chris Brendler of DA Davidson to describe his outlook on the mining sector. Since July, Brendler has said that the current market conditions were a good time to buy mining stocks, as<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/good-time-to-buy-crypto-mining-stocks-says-da-davidson-as-it-slashes-hashrate-forecasts/"> reported</a> by CoinDesk.</p><p>In December 2021, JPMorgan’s analyst Reginald Smith also<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/13/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-has-more-than-100-upside-jpmorgan-analyst-says/"> wrote</a> a memo that said one particular mining company — Iris Energy — has “more than 100% upside.” He also suggested the current stock price was at a “deep discount.” Shares of the company were trading around $14 at the time of the memo. No they’re trading below $2… an even deeper discount!</p><p>If Wall Street giving up on mining isn’t capitulation, then what is?</p><h2>Bitcoin Hash Rate Starts Dropping</h2><p>For the entirety of the bear market to date, the Bitcoin hash rate has steadily grown larger, forcing difficulty increase after increase on struggling miners. But that trend might be changing. In early December, the next adjustment is set to drop by<a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinkatee/status/1597246812943187970"> almost 11%</a> at the time of writing. This drop will be caused by hash rate falling, which is notably off its recent all-time highs and currently sitting near<a href="https://insights.braiins.com/en#bitcoin_mining_stats"> 240 exahashes per second (EH/s)</a>.</p><p>Normally a dip in hash rate and difficulty would not be too significant. But seven of the past nine difficulty adjustments have been<a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff"> positive</a>. And in context of the incessant hash rate growth and subsequent<a href="https://insights.braiins.com/en#mining_economics"> hash price collapse</a>, the apparent trend reversal for hash rate is notable. Some miners appear to be throwing in the metaphorical towel and taking their machines offline. Discussing the hash rate and difficulty on Twitter in context of whether miners were capitulating, Foundry Senior Vice President Kevin Zhang simply<a href="https://twitter.com/SinoCrypto/status/1597249569481687040"> replied</a>, “Yes.”</p><h2>Bitcoin Miners Are Re-Accumulating</h2><p>Generating fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) around on-chain movements of bitcoin from miner addresses is a popular pastime for Twitter influencers. And observing miner balances can be helpful. Current data shows notably larger balances compared to just a month ago. In short, net selling activity by miners appears to have subsided and their stockpiles of bitcoin are on the rise again.</p><p>Bitcoin mining address balances have seen small reductions over the past year. But the line chart below shows data that indicate a trend reversal is beginning. One-hop miner balances have increased by over 3%, or roughly 85,000 BTC since early October. Perhaps miners decided it’s time to HODL again.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin miners may have decided it’s time to HODL again.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Miner Outflows Spiked And Fell</h2><p>One other piece of on-chain data that fuels mining FUD is outflows — the activity of miner addresses moving coins from those addresses to some other location. In mid-November, these outflows<a href="https://twitter.com/BraiinsInsights/status/1592547604306747392"> spiked</a> to their highest level since June, which could indicate that fear and panic in the market has affected at least a few miners. Not surprisingly, the spike in outflows occurred at the same time as the collapse of FTX and its subsequent fallout were making headlines.</p><p>It should be noted that any inferences from on-chain data like outflows are informed guesstimates at best. Bitcoin network data is a useful tool for contextualizing certain market events, but it is far from infallible or un-manipulatable. But miners are notoriously bad at timing markets, and the timing of this sudden spike in coin movements could reasonably suggest some panicking miners. In the following week, however, outflows fell back to normal levels and have remained there as of the time of this writing. </p><p>Did miners panic near the market bottom? Very possibly.</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining In 2023</h2><p>Assuming the above analysis is correct and capitulation has occurred, the market will not immediately recover. As the dust settles and survivors emerge, the process of building and scaling more mining infrastructure will be as slow, expensive and tedious as ever. Winners are built in the bear market, and after some of the largest mining companies have sold bitcoin balances down to<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/22/bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-ended-october-with-32m-in-cash/"> nearly zero</a> and even<a href="https://argoblockchain.com/news-room/2022-october-strategic-actions"> sold significant amounts</a> of mining hardware in desperate attempts to stay operational, all that’s left is survival or bankruptcy. </p><p>Of course, things could always get worse overnight. But this article suggests the weak and panicked have been squeezed out, and the time for recovery is here. Now is the time to be optimistic, not bearish. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.
