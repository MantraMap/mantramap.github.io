<ul><li>The Manhattan federal court has sentenced EminiFX CEO Eddy Alexandre to nine years in prison.&nbsp;</li><li>Alexandre defrauded over 25,000 investors out of $248 million through his crypto and forex platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The sentence came more than four months after the crypto fraudster pled guilty to commodities fraud.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Manhattan federal court has handed EminiFX founder and CEO Eddy Alexandre a nine-year sentence for perpetrating a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-leaders-ripple-xrp-sec-judgement/">crypto</a> ponzi scheme and netting hundreds of millions of dollars from thousands of investors. The sentence came more than four months after Alexandre pled guilty to commodities fraud earlier this year. </p>



<h2><strong>Over 25,000 Investors Defrauded Through Crypto &amp; Forex Platform</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/crypto-fund-fraudster-gets-nine-years-for-249-million-scheme" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, U.S. District Judge John Cronan sentenced Eddy Alexandre to nine years in prison for perpetrating a ponzi scheme and defrauding over 25,000 investors out of more than $248 million through his crypto and forex platform. The EminiFX CEO previously agreed to forfeit $248.8 million as part of his plea deal. </p>



<p>Alexandre managed to net over $248 million between September 2021 and May 2022. He lured more than 25,000 investors by offering attractive returns of 5% per week. However, the crypto and forex platform was operated as a multilevel marketing scheme, where old investors were encouraged to get new users for the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Most egregiously, Alexandre recruited many of his investors by exploiting his position of trust within his church and the Haitian community, even going so far as to enlist members of the church to help recruit EminiFX investors.” </p><cite>Damian Williams, the U.S Attorney for the Southern District of New York</cite></blockquote>



<p>As per a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/ceo-cryptocurrency-and-forex-trading-platform-sentenced-nine-years-prison-240-million" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> by the United States Department of Justice, Eddy Alexandre invested a fraction of the money entrusted to him. However, the limited investments blew up, leading to millions of dollars in losses. He also diverted approximately $14.7 million to his personal bank account and splurged over $155,000 of customer funds to buy a BMW for himself. His lavish spending also included a $13,000 payment to Mercedes Benz. </p>

<ul><li>A Nevada court has ordered crypto custodian Prime Trust to be put into receivership.&nbsp;</li><li>The former CEO of the Bank of Nevada has been appointed as the troubled custodian’s receiver.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto custodian currently owes more than $85 million in fiat and digital assets to its clients.&nbsp;</li><li>The receivership comes amid a cash shortage and allegations of misappropriation of customer funds.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Crypto custody firm Prime Trust has been placed into receivership by a Nevada court less than a month after a state regulator ordered the troubled firm to suspend operations. The latest development comes over a year and a half after the firm reportedly lost access to some of the wallets that stored crypto assets belonging to its clients. State regulators have accused the custodian of misappropriating customer funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Former Bank of Nevada CEO Appointed As Prime Trust’s Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/troubled-crypto-firm-prime-trust-put-into-receivership-in-nevada#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada ordered Las Vegas-based Prime Trust into receivership after the Nevada Financial Institutions Division requested the appointment of a receiver citing insufficient funds to meet customer withdrawal demands. Former Bank of Nevada CEO John Guedry was appointed as the receiver of the embattled crypto custodian. </p>



<p>Guedry will oversee the day-to-day operations of Prime Trust and make decisions in the best interest of its clients. As the receiver, the former Bank of Nevada executive is not authorized to approve any expenses over $500,000 without getting the court’s approval. The next hearing for this matter has been scheduled for August 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Court, having reviewed the points and authorities along with relevant exhibits filed in support of the Petition, including the consent of Respondent, finds good cause to grant the Petition.” </p><cite>Nevada court on the petition for receivership</cite></blockquote>



<p>The receivership of Prime Trust comes less than one month after an acquisition deal with rival crypto custodian BitGo fell apart. This was followed by an <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prime-trust-suspend-withdrawal-bitgo-deal/">order</a> from the Nevada Financial Institution Division, directing the troubled custodian to shut down operations. The crypto custodian currently owes its clients more than $85 million in fiat and digital assets. Court filings showed that the firm had less than $3 million left. </p>

<ul><li>Celsius has won court approval to settle the bankruptcy fight with its preferred shareholders.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender will pay $25 million instead of prolonging the lawsuit potentially costing it $600 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Preferred shareholders had sued the lender last year over repayment priorities following clawbacks and asset sales.&nbsp;</li><li>The settlement comes a week after Celsius settled with two large preferred shareholders over mining asset claims.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-celsius-claims-live-on-open-exchange/">Celsius</a> Network has received the bankruptcy court’s nod to proceed with a deal that will put an end to one of its longest-running legal battles in its Chapter 11 proceedings. The bankrupt crypto lender is set to settle a lawsuit filed by its preferred shareholders amid its bankruptcy case. The shareholders had sued the lender in September last year to stake their claim in its bankruptcy payouts. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius’ CEL Token Jumps 14% After Settlement News</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/celsius-approved-to-pay-shareholders-25-million-in-bankruptcy?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Judge Martin Glen of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved Celsius’ deal to settle the case by paying $25 million to the owners of its preferred stock. Company attorney Christopher S. Koenig revealed in the court hearing earlier today that prolonging the legal battle would have added to the bankrupt crypto lender’s legal bills. He added that the lender could’ve owed as much as $600 million to the preferred shareholders in the event of a defeat. </p>



<p>The settlement deal comes more than nine months after the preferred shareholders initially sued the bankrupt crypto lender to ensure the clawbacks of their investments as well as lay claim to the proceeds of asset sales. At the time, the shareholders expressed their concerns about the Chapter 11 proceedings being heavily focused on retail customers rather than the initial investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the settlement deal, equity investors who wish to extract further funds from the Celsius Network are free to pursue litigation in the bankruptcy court. The $25 million payment will reportedly be made using the proceeds of one of Celsius’ crypto service businesses. The bankrupt platform’s native token CEL jumped over 14% following the news of the settlement deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Valkyrie is one of several financial juggernauts like BlackRock in the race to offer U.S. customers access to a fund that invests directly in Bitcoin. The company&#8217;s ETF named the Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund under the proposed ticker &#8216;BRRR&#8217; &#8211; a nod to a meme about mimicking the sound of money printing &#8211; was added to the SEC&#8217;s docket on July 17.</p>



<p>According to the SEC&#8217;s review procedure, a 21-day comment period has opened for Valkyrie&#8217;s application. During this time, other institutions and the public are welcome to submit opinions on how Valkyrie&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF might impact financial markets, the fund&#8217;s risk to investors, and other possible outcomes should the SEC approve the application. </p>



<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Marathon</h2>



<p>Valkyrie&#8217;s resubmission was an update to its original ETF filed in 2021. The amended application filed on July 21 named Coinbase as its partner for a contentious market surveillance agreement shortly after wall street titan BlackRock opened the floodgate with its own spot Bitcoin ETF filing on June 15. </p>



<p>Since BlackRock&#8217;s move, other would-be ETF issuers like WisdomTree, Fidelity, and Invesco have made a punt with their own respective applications.

<ul><li>Tesla and Elon Musk have gone on the offensive against the lawyer representing the Dogecoin plaintiffs.&nbsp;</li><li>A new filing by Musk claimed that the plaintiff’s lawyer knew that his premise of the case was false.&nbsp;</li><li>Musk and Tesla stated in the filing that the wallets associated with the DOGE sales did not belong to them.&nbsp;</li><li>Dogecoin tanked more than 7% on the day that Musk and Tesla submitted their filing.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Elon Musk and Tesla Inc. have gone on the offensive against the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed by Dogecoin investors. In a recent filing with the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the tech billionaire, and his electronic vehicle giant sought Rule 11 sanctions against Evan Spencer of Even Spencer Law. Spencer represents a prospective class of Dogecoin who sued Musk and his EV firm for manipulating the price of the memecoin for personal giants.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Dogecoin Tanked 7% Following Elon Musk’s Latest Court Filing</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/column-musk-tesla-go-attack-against-dogecoin-plaintiffs-lawyer-2023-07-17/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Elon Musk and Tesla filed a motion for Rule 11 sanctions against Evan Spencer, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the Dogecoin lawsuit. They claimed in the latest filing that Spencer was aware of his case being based on a false premise before he lodged his claims. The latest claims marked a new offensive from Musk and his legal team. </p>



<p>The latest court filing by Elon Musk and Tesla came more than a month after Spencer <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dogecoin-accuse-elon-musk-insider-trading/">filed</a> an amended complaint on behalf of the plaintiffs. The complaint accused the tech billionaire of netting billions of dollars by dumping DOGE after hyping up the memecoin on Twitter, which Musk recently acquired. However, the new filing by Musk’s attorneys argued that the wallets cited in the amended complaint were not owned by Tesla or its owner. </p>



<p>The filing further stated that Spencer was aware of the same before he submitted the amended complaint, which included accusations of insider trading. Elon Musk and Tesla urged the overseeing judge to dismiss the amended complaint and sanction Evan Spencer. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener">DOGE</a> lost more than 7% of its value following the filing of the motion for sanctions. At the time of writing, the meme token was trading at $0.0699. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img src="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena.png" alt="Arthur Hayes&#039;s &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Stablecoin DeFi Project Ethena Raises $6M 12" class="wp-image-583131" width="845" height="473" srcset="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena.png 593w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena-300x168.png 300w, https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ethena-269x151.png 269w" sizes="(max-width: 845px) 100vw, 845px" title="Arthur Hayes&#039;s &quot;Holy Grail&quot; Stablecoin DeFi Project Ethena Raises $6M 16"></figure>



<p>According to Guy Young, the Founder and CEO of Ethena their platform aims to address the immediate need within the crypto space: DeFi endeavors to create a parallel financial system; however stablecoins, which are vital financial instruments in this sector remain completely reliant, on traditional banking infrastructure.<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We strongly believe that individuals worldwide should have access, to a financial tool, a dollar based savings instrument to securely store their wealth. With our stablecoin we are bringing to life our vision of a native stablecoin that does not rely on traditional banking systems. This enables the creation of an permissionless internet bond.</p></blockquote>



<h2><strong>A breakdown of what Ethena does:</strong></h2>



<p><br><strong>Stablecoin:</strong> The Ethena stablecoin will be backed by derivatives holding equal amounts of staked ETH and perpetual swaps shorting Ethereum. This unique approach allows it to maintain its peg to the US dollar without depending on the infrastructure. This improvement addresses some of the limitations found in existing stablecoins which are often susceptible to manipulation and volatility.</p>



<p><strong><br>Savings bond</strong>: The Ethena savings bond will be a token that function similarly to a US treasury bond. However it distinguishes itself by being permissionless and accessible to individuals around the world. This means that anyone, regardless of their location or financial standing will have the opportunity to invest in the Ethena savings bond.</p>



<p><strong><br>Decentralized:</strong> Ethenas stablecoin and savings bond will be built on the Ethereum blockchain ensuring decentralization and transparency. This means that there won&#8217;t be a single point of failure and people will have control over their funds.</p>



<p><strong>Accessible:</strong> Everyone around the world, regardless of their location or financial status, will have access to Ethenas stablecoin and savings bonds. This accessibility is made possible because they will be built on the Ethereum blockchain, a platform that&#8217;s source and permissionless.</p>



<h2><strong>This Isn&#8217;t The First Time Stablecoins Backed By Derivatives Have Been Created</strong></h2>



<p>You heard it right! In the past there has been attempts to create stablecoins backed by derivatives. One example is Basis Cash, which launched in 2020. Basis Cash tried to maintain its value by relying on a mix of derivatives linked to the US dollar, gold and oil. Unfortunately it failed to maintain its peg and therefore had to shut down in 2021.</p>



<p>Another failed attempt was IRON Finance, which was launched in 2021. IRON Finance used derivatives tied to the US dollar and Ethereum as its backing. IRON Finance was also shut down in 2021 after it  even tually lost $150 million due to a hack.</p>



<p>The failures of Basis Cash and IRON Finance highlight the challenges in creating a stablecoin backed by derivatives that are both secure and dependable. Ethena presents an approach to leveraging derivatives for stabilizing a coin, which holds the potential, for success.</p>



<p>In the past there have been challenges, in understanding the complexities of derivatives. This has made it difficult for issuers to effectively manage the risks involved in using derivatives to support a stablecoin.</p>



<p>The trading costs associated with derivatives can be quite high. This poses a challenge for issuers who need to generate revenue to cover the expenses of maintaining the stablecoins value.</p>



<p>Derivatives are subject to regulations in jurisdictions. This adds another layer of difficulty for issuers as they strive to comply with the rules and regulations.</p>



<p>Despite these obstacles there are advantages in using derivatives as collateral for a stablecoin such as enhanced security, increased reliability and improved efficiency.</p>



<p><strong>“Ethena is building the holy grail of stablecoins: a coin that is truly stable, decentralized, and capital-efficient,” </strong>said Tom Schmidt, General Partner at Dragonfly. “Stablecoins have grown massively in popularity over the past few years by providing access to USD-denominated savings and remittances for people around the world, but they&#8217;ve always been handicapped by one of these three issues. Ethena has a breakthrough design that remedies these issues while also benefiting a broad user-base. We&#8217;re thrilled to be partnering with them to bring their vision to life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ethena plans to utilize the initial investment to get ready for the release of their stablecoin and bond asset in the third quarter of 2023. This includes successfully finishing the testnet phase in Q3 of this year, establishing partnerships with prominent players in the industry and conducting thorough smart contract audits to guarantee the security and efficiency of the protocol.</p>

<ul><li>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has expressed disappointment with the recent summary judgment in SEC v Ripple.&nbsp;</li><li>A judge recently handed a partial victory to Ripple after ruling that XRP’s retail sales didn’t constitute an investment contract.</li><li>Gensler has stated that his agency is assessing the judge’s opinion on XRP’s retail sales.&nbsp;</li><li>Meanwhile, the federal judge has referred the lawsuit to a magistrate judge who sided with Ripple on the controversial Hinman docs.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Gary Gensler, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has expressed his disappointment with the recent summary judgment in the securities regulator’s lawsuit against Ripple. Gensler was referring to the ruling by New York Federal Judge Analisa Torres, who handed a partial victory to Ripple after ruling that retail sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Federal Judge Refers SEC v Ripple Case To Magistrate Judge</strong></h2>



<p>Gary Gensler’s latest comments came during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR4l5F8fLRU" rel="nofollow noopener">event</a> hosted by the National Press Club in Washington D.C. During his speech, the SEC Chair stated that despite being disappointed about the ruling regarding retail sales, he was pleased with the Judge’s decision regarding the institutional sales of XRP. The summary judgment came more than two years after the securities regulator sued <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-leaders-ripple-xrp-sec-judgement/">Ripple</a> and its executives for illegally raising $1.3 billion by selling XRP, which it described as an unregistered securities offering. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We’re pleased from that decision recognizing the importance of protecting investors on the institutional investors. While disappointed on what they said about retail investors, we’re still looking at it and assessing that opinion.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>In related news, Federal Judge Analisa Torres referred the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn. Judge Netburn made headlines earlier this year after ordering the SEC to hand over the controversial Hinman documents to Ripple. The documents are internal communications and speeches related to William Hinman, the SEC’s former Director of Corporation Finance, who stated in 2018 that Ethereum is not a security. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Judge Netburn has historically been critical of the securities regulator’s assertions in the lawsuit. Earlier today, the magistrate judge ordered both parties to agree on three mutually convenient dates in order to schedule a settlement meeting, provided they believe it would be a productive venture.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A report by the Wall Street Journal stated that Binance slashed employee benefits last month.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange cited declining profits for cutting back benefits including work-from-home expenses.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed in a meeting last week that the company was still profitable.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange reportedly laid off more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks.</li></ul>



<p>Binance reportedly slashed employee benefits last month due to dwindling profits amid legal and regulatory trouble. The reduced benefits took effect on June 19, 2023, when the world’s largest crypto exchange cut back on several benefits, including fitness reimbursement. The crypto giant also indicated that more cost-cutting measures could be adopted in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao Says Company Is Still Profitable</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-cuts-back-employee-benefits-citing-decline-in-profit-51d51cf7" rel="noopener">report</a> by The Wall Street Journal, Binance used its internal messenger to inform its employees about the slashing of benefits, which affected mobile-phone reimbursements and work-from-home expenses, among other benefits. The crypto exchange cited declining profits for cutting back employee benefits. A <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-lab-invest-15-million-xterio-game/">Binance</a> spokesperson stated that the company was reevaluating certain products, business units, and staff benefits to ensure that the company’s resources were being deployed properly. </p>



<p>During a company meeting on July 14, 2023, co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao told his employees that the company was still profitable. He added that the lawsuit filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had no impact on the company’s operations. As for the employee benefits, Zhao stated that he wasn’t sure when they would be reinstated.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Considering the current market environment and regulatory climate that has unfortunately led to a decline in profit, we have to be more prudent with our spending.”</p><cite>Binance&#8217;s internal message to employees</cite></blockquote>



<p>News of the slashing of employee benefits comes just days after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" rel="noopener">WSJ</a> reported that Binance had fired more than 1,000 employees in recent weeks. Former employees told the Journal that several hundred additional customer-service personnel were laid off by the crypto exchange last week. Changpeng Zhao revealed in the company meeting that there could be additional layoffs every three to six months.  </p>

<p>Uniswap Labs, the decentralized finance startup behind the world’s largest decentralized crypto exchange, has launched a permissionless, open-source, and auction-based protocol called UniswapX. The new blockchain protocol will allow trading across automated market makers and other liquidity sources.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams Unveils UniswapX at EthCC Paris</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswapx-protocol" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Uniswap, Chief Executive Hayden Adams unveiled the new blockchain protocol earlier today at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris. The DeFi exchange rolled out an opt-in beta for the protocol on the Uniswap Labs interface. Given that the protocol is still in beta, the majority of the orders will go through classic routing. UniswapX is currently available for Ethereum Mainnet and will be expanded to other chains as well as the Uniswap Wallet later. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-v3-deployment-on-fantom/">Uniswap</a> Labs stated that UniswapX will offer “next-level aggregation” by outsourcing the complexity of routing to an open network of fillers who compete to fill swaps in a cost-effective manner. The competitive filler forms will benefit the protocol’s users by offering maximum extractable value (MEV) protection, better prices, gas-free swapping, and zero cost for failed transactions. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With UniswapX, swappers will be able to use the Uniswap interface without worrying whether they&#8217;re getting the best price, and transactions will always be transparently recorded and settled on-chain.”</p></blockquote>



<p>The DeFi protocol stated that it would launch a cross-chain UniswapX that would combine swapping and bridging under one roof. This would include native asset swaps that would reduce the need for bridged tokens. Uniswap’s governance token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/" rel="nofollow noopener">UNI</a> surged by more than 3% following the announcement of the new blockchain protocol. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $5.97. </p>
