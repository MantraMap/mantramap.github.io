<p>A newly filed lawsuit alleges that crypto exchange Coinbase improperly collected, stored, and distributed customers&rsquo; biometric data. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has been slapped with a lawsuit filed with a District Court in California on May 1 for violating Illinois&rsquo; Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA). The suit alleges the exchange collected and improperly used its customers&rsquo; fingerprint and facial recognition data.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports plaintiff Michael Massel is seeking relief in the form of $5,000 in damages for each &ldquo;intentional and reckless violation&rdquo; of BIPA and an additional $1,000 for every violation Massel&rsquo;s legal representation can find.</p>
<p>According to Decrypt, the lawsuit accuses Coinbase of collecting biometric information through its KYC procedures and that this data was illegally obtained, used, stored, and disseminated. BIPA regulations require a company seeking to collect biometric data to inform a person in writing that it obtains such data and must specify the purpose and duration of the data&rsquo;s storage.</p>
<p>BIPA further requires written consent from a customer, and the company seeking to obtain such data must publish &ldquo;publicly‚Äêavailable written retention schedules and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric identifiers and biometric information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Massel&rsquo;s legal team argues Coinbase does not comply with the regulations when it collects customers&rsquo; data before and after creating new accounts.</p>
<p>The suit alleges Coinbase&rsquo;s &ldquo;collection, obtainment, storage, and use&rdquo; of customers&rsquo; biometric data is &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; and opens clients up &ldquo;to serious and irreversible privacy risks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The legal document asserts:</p>

<p>If Coinbase&rsquo;s database containing facial geometry scans or other sensitive, proprietary biometric data is hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed, Coinbase users have no means by which to prevent identity theft.</p>

<p>The lawsuit further states that the exchange should have &ldquo;permanently destroyed&rdquo; such data after a customer created a Coinbase account, as the information was obtained solely to create an account.</p>
