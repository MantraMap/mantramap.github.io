<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/from-crypto-savior-to-being-up-against-the-ropes-how-it-turned-around-for-ftxs-sam-bankman-fried/">implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX empire</a> is easily one of the most gruesome incidents in the crypto industry’s history. The FTX case underscores the risks of participating in the cryptocurrency market. In particular, it brings to the forefront the prevalence of counterparty risk in crypto.</p>



<p>The world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, Binance, has come up with a potential solution to offset this risk, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-30/binance-may-let-some-clients-keep-trading-collateral-in-bank-accounts?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. Binance wants to let select professional customers keep their trading collateral funds at a bank rather than on crypto platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-looks-to-eliminate-counterparty-risk"><strong>Binance Looks To Eliminate Counterparty Risk</strong></h2>



<p>Binance could soon move forward with a strategy to allow some of its traders to store their collateral in banks, thus eliminating counterparty risk.</p>



<p>For those unaware, counterparty risk is the measure of how likely one of the parties involved in a transaction is to default on their end of the bargain and how huge the damage is if they do.</p>



<p>Anonymous sources familiar with the matter told <em>Bloomberg </em>that Binance has engaged in talks with some institutional clients regarding the prospective plan that would enable them to employ bank deposits as collateral for margin trading.</p>



<p>Per the news publication, one possible arrangement would involve locking clients’ cash at a bank through a tri-party agreement while the exchange lends the customers stablecoins that would then serve as collateral for margin trading in both spot and derivatives markets. These collateral funds deposited in banks could be invested in money market funds, allowing clients to accumulate interest and offset the expense of borrowing crypto assets from Binance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance Explores Collaboration With Banks</strong></h2>



<p>Two banks — Europe-based Bank Frick and FlowBank — have been floated in conversations about the project, although details of any potential partnership remain confidential. Moreover, Binance is yet to finalize the plan, and the arrangement is still subject to modification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the move comes as Binance and other crypto trading firms face immense pressure to guarantee safety in the event of unprecedented failure following the spectacular collapse of FTX last November, which brought about substantial permanent losses for institutional and retail traders.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1mKwAxwAJ0&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=Bankless">interview</a>, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao revealed that the exchange had briefly considered purchasing a bank and making it crypto-friendly, but ultimately decided against it due to strict regulations, the risks involved, and underwhelming profit expectations. Zhao noted:</p>



<p><em>“Banks are not cheap. Banks are very expensive for very little business revenue. […] The amount of capital required is quite high, and the regulatory approval for buying a bank is the same or more as setting up a new bank, which is very onerous If the banking regulators say, ‘Look, you can’t work with crypto’ then they can take your license away if you do. So buying a bank doesn’t prevent regulators from telling you, “No, you can’t touch crypto.” Even then, we would need corresponding banks all over the world.”</em></p>

<p>XRP holders’ counsel John E Deaton, known for his commentary on Ripple’s pending lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has predicted that FOMO will set in when the XRP price taps $2.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deaton-is-mega-bullish-on-xrp-price"><strong>Deaton Is Mega Bullish On XRP Price</strong></h2>



<p>Looking to mainline the XRP community with a healthy dose of hopium is CryptoLaw founder John Deaton. Amid the plethora of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ex-ripple-exec-on-why-sec-might-still-defeat-ripple-in-xrp-lawsuit-amid-unmasking-of-hinman-docs/">bearish opinions</a> as the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit rages on, Deaton came out bullish as ever, highlighting XRP’s prospects.</p>



<p>He alluded that it is crazy to think that many people will not buy XRP at its current $0.48 price tag. However, he is confident that these same people will buy the token when it will be worth over $1. Even more interesting is that Deaton expects many investors to FOMO into XRP once its price surges above the impressive $2 mark.</p>



<p>There’s an old saying on Wall Street that financial markets are propelled by two emotions, fear and greed. In the cryptocurrency markets, the driver is usually a combination of the two: fear of missing out ( FOMO).</p>



<p>XRP is trading 1.3% higher intraday, pushing the sixth-largest cryptocurrency’s market cap beyond $25 billion. Currently trading hands at $0.499, XRP has every reason to reclaim the $2 level as the crypto traded at a historical high of around $3.40 over five years ago, as per CoinGecko.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>XRP Gearing Up For A Comeback</strong></h2>



<p>Most pundits in the crypto market who have closely followed the price performance of XRP in recent years have noted that the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC has caused considerable damage to the token.</p>



<p>Part of the lawsuit has centered around whether Ripple sold XRP tokens as unregistered securities. Most prospective investors and Ripple partners have stayed on the sidelines since the lawsuit was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">initiated </a>in December 2020 amid regulatory confusion in the United States. This has greatly affected the price of XRP over the years.</p>



<p>The current consensus in the crypto community is that XRP will soon recoup all its losses and dart higher after the lawsuit reaches its conclusion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dan Berkovitz, a former CFTC Commissioner, says Ethereum lies within the regulatory purview of both the SEC and the CFTC as the debate grows.&nbsp;</li>



<li>He asserts that digital assets can be categorized as a security and a commodity because of the existing legal framework. </li>



<li>Crypto executives and users continue to criticise the SEC, calling their regulatory approach “<em>stifling” </em>and harsh. </li>
</ul>



<p>The debate on the agency with regulatory powers over Ethereum (ETH) in the United States continues with a former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commissioner dividing the cake into two halves.</p>



<p>Dan Berkovitz, a former CFTC  Commissioner and ex-general counsel to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stated that ETH can be categorized as a commodity as well as a security based on the details of specific transactions.</p>



<p>Speaking on the Unchained podcast, he claims the digital asset is under the jurisdiction of both Federal agencies suggesting that synergy may be required to effectively regulate digital assets.</p>



<p>“<em>The law is clear. Something can be both a commodity and a security,” </em>he said.</p>



<p>Throwing more light on the topic, Berkovitz noted that ETH not being a physical commodity like “<em>wheat” and “oat” </em>is the genesis of the confusion because anything that is under a “<em>futures contract” </em>can be grouped as a commodity. He explained further that the word “futures” is part of the CFTC’s jurisdiction.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the Securities Act defined securities to include investment contracts stretching it to a “futures contract.” He concluded that since the SEC regulates securities and the CFTC jurisdiction covers futures trading and swaps, both agencies can regulate ETH. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-receives-knocks-maintains-position"><strong>SEC receives knocks, maintains position</strong></h2>



<p>The last six months have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-and-stablecoins-are-commodities-cftc-clashes-with-the-sec/">revealed</a> regulatory confusion in the digital asset market with both the CFTC and the SEC making contradictory claims. The CFTC has called Ethereum alongside other cryptocurrencies commodities.</p>



<p>Gary Gensler-led SEC has stated that cryptocurrencies, except Bitcoin, should be categorized as securities. Gensler’s view has been criticized from all quarters, including in Congress, but the once pro-crypto administrator remains firm on his position.</p>



<p>Criticizing the SEC, Collin Lloyd a partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell said at the podcast that no case law suggests ETH on the blockchain can natively be a Security rather, the question should be if it was part of a Security transaction.</p>



<p><em>”It’s kind of a weird question to be asking, ‘Is this digital asset a security or not?’ I think you should be asking, ‘Is this digital asset being sold as part of a securities transaction?’ That depends on the facts and circumstances,” </em>he added.</p>

<p>Despite the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, long-term Bitcoin holders have consistently demonstrated their unwavering belief in the asset&#8217;s potential. Their conviction is showcased by the increasing accumulation of Bitcoin, as indicated by the rising <a href="https://zycrypto.com/retail-investors-bitcoin-ownership-hits-all-time-high-with-17-of-total-supply/">total amount held</a>. This trend reflects a strong commitment to the digital currency, even in the face of market uncertainty and short-term price fluctuations.</p>



<p>Market uncertainties often serve as a litmus test for the resolve of long-term holders. Various factors influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements, including macroeconomic events, regulatory developments, and market sentiment. During periods of turbulence, short-term traders may be tempted to sell their holdings, driven by fear or a desire to secure quick profits. In contrast, long-term holders exhibit resilience, viewing market fluctuations as an opportunity to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-michael-novogratz-advises-buying-bitcoin-amid-market-uncertainty/">strengthen</a> their positions and reap the rewards in the long run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Significance of Accumulation &#8211; Sign of Future Growth?</strong></h2>



<p>The accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders carries several implications. Firstly, it reflects a long-term investment strategy, where holders believe in the asset&#8217;s potential for substantial future growth. This confidence is often grounded in understanding Bitcoin&#8217;s scarcity, its position as a store of value, and its increasing adoption across various industries.</p>



<p>Secondly, the growing accumulation by long-term holders reduces the available supply of Bitcoin in circulation, potentially exerting upward pressure on its price. As the scarcity of an asset increases, its perceived value rises, attracting new investors and further bolstering the market.</p>



<p>The conviction and accumulation of Bitcoin by long-term holders set the stage for the asset&#8217;s continued <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-bitcoin-indicator-hints-at-explosive-btc-price-growth/">growth</a>. Their belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin as a decentralized digital currency is a testament to its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the increasing adoption of Bitcoin by institutional investors and corporations adds credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This institutional interest aligns with the long-term vision of Bitcoin and paves the way for broader acceptance and integration within mainstream financial markets.</p>



<p>The recent surge in the total amount of Bitcoin held by long-term holders showcases their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-doubles-down-on-bitcoin-vows-to-keep-accumulating-btc-despite-market-volatility/">unwavering conviction</a> in the asset&#8217;s potential. As market uncertainties persist, these holders stand strong, accumulating Bitcoin and setting the stage for further growth. This development highlights the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as a long-term investment and underscores its role as a cornerstone of the evolving digital economy. With increasing institutional adoption and growing global recognition, Bitcoin&#8217;s journey towards mainstream acceptance seems more promising than ever before.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ordinals is drawing top talents across web3, including ETH developers, to build on the Bitcoin Network.</li>



<li>OrdinalSafe, a wallet designed for Bitcoin Ordinals, emerged in second place in Bitcoin 2023’s pitch day event.</li>



<li>The great Ordinal debate takes center stage as some BTC maxis continue to oppose the development of Ordinals, citing security concerns. </li>
</ul>



<p>The buzz around Bitcoin Ordinals continues to grow, with inscriptions surpassing 9 million barely six months after its launch, drawing the attention of top investors.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin Conference 2023 held last week in Miami left memorable experiences and introduced investors to new products around the Bitcoin Network. Notable attendees included Ethereum developers who are glued to Bitcoin in recent weeks thanks to Ordinals.</p>



<p>Developers drawn by the wave of experimentation and innovation participated in an infrastructural pitch category with OrdinalSafe, a wallet created for Ordinals emerging second place. Asad Yusuf Atik OrdinalSafe’s CEO, lauded the remarkable event as a boost for young developers.</p>



<p>“<em>It&#8217;s your first time on that stage, and you&#8217;re trying to sell the vision of your product to other people, so you want to do a good job. I was nervous, but going to the stage for the prize, it felt great,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The 22-year-old developer first broke into the scene in 2020 after his team created a Proof of Innocence protocol. The product was built for Ethereum’s coin mixer Tornado Cash and helped users prove that they did not use a sanctioned address to carry out transactions.</p>



<p>Atik explained that he learned about Ordinals on Twitter in February and got attracted by the buzz around it alongside other Ethereum developers.</p>



<p><em>“Even though we came from an Ethereum background, it felt like home,” Atik said. “If you&#8217;re developing on Bitcoin, you&#8217;re part of the community, right?”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-community-moves-with-ordinals"><strong>BTC community moves with Ordinals</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin Ordinals have come with positives for the network, but it has also sparked controversy in community spaces. While igniting bulls in anticipation of a run temporarily pushing BTC above $28,000, Ordinals also led to the congestion of the network, driving up transaction fees.</p>



<p>Ordinals hit 3 million inscriptions shooting up Bitcoin’s daily transaction <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">volume</a> to an all-time high, leading to congestion of the mempool. Transaction fees got so high, causing users to pay a “<em>premium” </em>on it. The situation got more complex with the world’s leading digital asset exchange Binance halting BTC withdrawals twice due to the surge in transactions.</p>



<p>Currently, a vast majority of BTC faithful have backed Ordinals despite dissenting voices claiming it poses a security threat to the network. MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor expressed his support for Ordinals, noting the key role it can play in the mass adoption of the asset.</p>

<p>While crypto trading is still legal in Indonesia, local authorities in Bali have warned that international tourists who use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to make payments will be “dealt with firmly”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bali-forbids-crypto-payments"><strong>Bali Forbids Crypto Payments</strong></h2>



<p>On May 28, Bali Governor Wayan Koster <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/bali-crack-down-foreign-tourists-using-crypto-payment-3521321">said </a>during a tourism development press conference that visitors who pay with crypto will be subject to punishments such as deportation, criminal penalties, and administrative sanctions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Foreign tourists who behave inappropriately, do activities that are not allowed in their visa permit, use crypto as a means of payment and violate other provisions will be dealt with firmly,” the leader of the popular island vacation destination in the Indonesian archipelago stated.</p>



<p>Additionally, businesses caught accepting cryptocurrency payments will also be punished and forced to shut down.</p>



<p>Koster stressed that all transactions carried out in Bali must be settled in Indonesia’s currency — the rupiah. The use of other currencies for payments carries a maximum potential sentence of one year behind bars and a fine of as much as 200 million rupiah (equivalent to $13,000 USD).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Indonesia’s Upcoming National Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>Trisno Nugroho, the head of the Bali Representative Office for Bank Indonesia — the nation’s central bank — reiterated during the Sunday meeting that crypto trading is allowed in the country, but its use as a means of payment is illegal.</p>



<p>The announcement is the latest in a slew of efforts to clamp down on unacceptable tourist behaviour on the island. Notably, tourism is a major contributor to Bali’s economy. Research indicates that tourism accounts for nearly 28% of Bali’s income. The island suffered a big blow from COVID-19 travel restrictions. Yet, banning crypto payments for goods and services by tourists will likely lead to a drop in income as some are already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13uezao/comment/jm0cyri/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">reconsidering </a>their plans to visit Bali.</p>



<p>Despite the staunch stance from Bali’s governor and Indonesia, the country is on the path to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/indonesia-set-to-become-asias-crypto-capital-with-state-backed-crypto-exchange/">launching a national crypto stock exchange</a> by next month. The Indonesian government initially planned to roll out the crypto bourse by 2021-end but encountered multiple delays.</p>

<p>Cardano, one of the major blockchain platforms, is gearing up for an exciting summer. In a recent YouTube video, its founder, Charles Hoskinson, explains his vision for the project&#8217;s future. Hoskinson&#8217;s objectives for Cardano set high standards for its expansion and advancement while emphasising the importance of regulatory certainty to the project&#8217;s long-term success.</p>



<p>Hoskinson has a wide-ranging plan for the upcoming summer. By forming strategic alliances, he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/hoskinson-cardano-to-achieve-unrivaled-decentralization-in-crypto-after-major-project-developments/">hopes to decentralize</a> the Cardano network further. This should improve its smart contract functionality and broaden the project&#8217;s ecosystem. Cardano hopes to establish itself as a scalable, safe, and long-lasting blockchain platform by meeting these goals.</p>



<p>Besides these ambitious objectives, Hoskinson highlights the need for regulatory stability in the cryptocurrency industry. Hoskinson stated that he is aware of how important it is to operate in compliance with legal requirements to support innovation, protect consumers, and ensure the long-term viability of cryptocurrencies. Governments may foster a climate that encourages the growth and use of cryptocurrencies while upholding the required safeguards by establishing clear rules and regulations.</p>



<p>The need for regulatory clarification is even more important as institutional investors start to take an interest in cryptocurrencies. Hoskinson&#8217;s focus on regulatory clarity is considered a strategy to provide stakeholders in Cardano certainty and to foster an atmosphere that will promote ADA, the platform&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, to be adopted more widely.</p>



<p>The recent successes of Cardano have also strengthened its position in the market. Total Value Locked (TVL) for the project <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-staking-value-surpasses-400-million-ada-reaching-161-million-in-tvl/">has increased</a> to a new level, demonstrating growing trust among investors and users in Cardano&#8217;s potential. This milestone further enhances the project&#8217;s appeal inside the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>In his latest YouTube video, the seasoned crypto pundit touched on many changes and ideas that would be unveiled in the coming weeks. He did not want to reveal any spoilers but stated these improvements might help the blockchain&#8217;s native token, ADA, outperform Bitcoin, Ethereum, and all other cryptocurrencies. The significant Vasil update has already improved the blockchain&#8217;s adaptability and scalability. The previously disclosed CIP-1694 idea was among the video&#8217;s standout points.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency community is eagerly awaiting Hoskinson&#8217;s ideas for Cardano to come to fruition as the summer progresses. The project&#8217;s long-term viability and place in the blockchain sector will largely depend on its capacity to meet its developmental goals while managing regulatory obstacles.</p>

<p>Despite the Bitcoin 2023 Conference kicking off in Miami, the price of Bitcoin remained relatively stagnant, prompting concerns among experts about the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>To be precise, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation has been fluctuating between $27,400 and $26,500 for the past ten days, with this lacklustre volatility mirroring on Ethereum and other top cryptocurrencies. On that note, traders and analysts have closely monitored Bitcoin&#8217;s movements, with fears growing that the price may <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-price-faces-bleak-outlook-as-selling-pressure-from-miners-surge/">drop lower</a> this coming week.</p>



<p>On Sunday, May 21, “Rekt Capital”, a renowned crypto pundit, highlighted the significance of Bitcoin&#8217;s failure to reclaim the $27,600 level. According to him, a weekly close below approximately $27,600 by price would confirm a breakdown and potentially lead to further downside momentum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Price needs to reclaim $27600 to have a chance at bullish momentum,”</em> he <a href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1660305007344771073">tweeted</a>.</p>



<p>Another expert named Ali “@Alicharts” echoed similar sentiments on Twitter, emphasising the importance of the $27,640 resistance and $26,340 support levels. According to Ali&#8217;s analysis, using the TD Sequential indicator, Bitcoin is currently in a no-trade zone on the 4-hour chart. A TD sequential is a technical analysis indicator primarily used to identify potential trend reversals and exhaustion points in financial markets. According to the pundit, a sustained close outside this area will determine the direction of Bitcoin&#8217;s trend.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the price stagnation, some fundamental indicators for Bitcoin have been turning green of late, signalling a bottom may be nearby. On Saturday, onchain analytics firm Santiment highlighted that both Bitcoin and Ethereum are experiencing an increase in their existing supplies and moving into self-custody. While not a foolproof indicator for a reversal, a decline in coins on exchanges often indicates potential future bull runs “given enough time”.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="629" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-32-1024x629.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81528" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-32-1024x629.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-32-300x184.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-32-768x472.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-32-356x220.png 356w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-32.png 1429w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In an earlier post, the firm also highlighted the surge in fear among traders, as indicated by an increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s social dominance this week. Its analysis noted that this typically suggests a higher probability of a market recovery.</p>



<p>“<em>With Bitcoin revisiting the $26k level, traders are showing increased worries of prices falling back to the $20k to $25k range. BTC social dominance has jumped high again, typically a sign of fear. Fear signals increase the probability of a rebound,”</em> Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1659311133877227520">tweeted</a> Friday, May 19.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, while it’s too early to predict where the price of Bitcoin will head next, it’s safe to say that the market&#8217;s future direction hangs in the balance if the $27,600 is not regained. While some indicators point towards a potential bullish trend for Bitcoin, it is important to stay patient and recognize that only time will reveal the true trajectory of the market. </p>



<p>Bitcoin was trading at $27,904 at press time, up 2.80% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Despite a sluggish start to the week, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-eyes-monster-move-as-new-lawsuit-outcomes-set-ripple-on-path-to-gigantic-win-against-the-sec/">XRP</a>, the native cryptocurrency of the Ripple network, showed signs of recovery towards the weekend, suggesting potential resilience and strength as the year unfolds.</p>



<p>Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and most cryptocurrencies, XRP has remained relatively strong this month, with price gaining roughly 13% in the past two weeks. This strength has been pointed towards Ripple’s improving fundamentals fueling XRP’s accumulation.</p>



<p>On Saturday, May 27, crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted XRP, noting that crypto whales continue to accumulate the crypto asset. According to Martinez, whales have acquired over 52 million XRP in the past three weeks, totalling approximately $22.9 million.</p>



<p><em>“Whales appear bullish on Ripple! They&#8217;ve purchased over 52 million XRP in the past 3 weeks, worth around $22.9 million,” </em>tweeted Martinez.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="477" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-1024x477.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81499" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-1024x477.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-300x140.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-768x358.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29-1536x715.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-29.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The recent whale activity coincides with the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As ZyCrypto has previously reported, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-boss-confident-groundbreaking-verdict-is-coming-in-weeks-after-hinman-speech-docs-win/">the resolution</a> of this high-profile case is eagerly anticipated by the XRP Army and the wider crypto community, especially after the recent ruling by Judge Analisa Torres to unseal the controversial Hinman documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pro-Ripple lawyer Jeremy Hogan recently shared his prediction on the Ripple vs SEC case timeline. Responding to Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse&#8217;s recent mention that the case would be resolved &#8216;in weeks&#8217;, Hogan suggested that the final resolution would likely occur by July 2023.</p>



<p><em>“The Judge in the Ripple case has been making major rulings about every 9 weeks (Sept. 29, Dec.19, March 6, May 16). And the only major ruling left is on Summary Judgment. That comes out to mid-July. NOT a prediction. JUST a pattern,” </em>said<em> </em>Hogan.</p>



<p>In addition to the legal battle, Ripple has been actively acquiring companies globally, significantly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-mulls-making-key-acquisitions-in-crypto-friendly-countries-can-it-boost-xrp-to-1/">boosting XRP&#8217;s liquidity</a>. A notable acquisition has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">Metaco</a>, a Swiss crypto custody provider, in a bid to grow its global footprint. Recently, Ripple also purchased Pantera Capital&#8217;s stake in the centralized exchange Bitstamp, resulting in the blockchain firm <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-buys-shares-in-european-crypto-exchange-bitstamp-massive-xrp-growth-ahead/">obtaining a controlling stake</a>. Last week, Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, revealed that the company has over $1 billion reserved for global acquisitions as part of its ambitious business development plan.</p>



<p>That said, amid these positive developments, analysts predict the cryptocurrency will likely continue exhibiting strength for the next few weeks. On Saturday, crypto analyst &#8220;Dark Defender&#8221; predicted a surge for XRP to $0.50 in the next few days after the price surpassed the $0.4696 resistance level. And while reaching $0.50 may trigger a sell-off, the analyst-maintained confidence in XRP&#8217;s potential to exceed this level and reach $1.3 by August.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP trading is trading at $0.47, up roughly 2% in the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>On May 25th, Checkmate, Lead On-chain Analyst at Glassnode, stated that Bitcoin is at a crucial point that could lead to a significant correction, as several indicators suggest.</p>



<p>Checkmate explained to his Twitter followers that to assess the potential correction, it is important to analyze the behaviour of Short-Term Holders, as they are mostly responsible for significant price movements in BTC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-several-metrics-indicate-a-potential-correction-in-bitcoin-s-price">Several metrics indicate a potential correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price</h2>



<p>The Glassnode analyst pointed out that one of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/key-bitcoin-metric-reaches-crucial-support-level-can-price-pull-a-2021-like-rally/">most important metrics</a> to consider is the Short-Term Holder Realized Price, which is currently being tested around the $26,500 zone. This level should provide strong <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-price-outlook-uncertain-as-key-support-level-faces-crucial-test/">psychological support</a>, as losing it could result in a higher drop.</p>



<p>Similarly, Checkmate explained that the STH-SOPR, which indicates the Dominance of Losses of Short-Term Holders, is below 1.0. This means that the losses of Short-Term Holders are mainly generated by local top buyers, which is uncommon and generally creates a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/prepare-this-crypto-analyst-says-the-next-explosive-bitcoin-rally-is-right-around-the-corner/">bullish reaction</a> driven by the fear of missing out on an upward movement (FOMO).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="590" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-1024x590.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81510" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-1024x590.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-300x173.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30-768x442.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-30.png 1495w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Regarding the Short-Term Holder Profit/Loss Ratio, the metric has reached a state of balance, indicating a possible healthy short-term market cleansing. However, the analyst warned that losing the current values could generate negative sentiment in the short term.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s price could be on the brink of a significant correction</strong></h2>



<p>Lastly, Checkmate highlighted that the STH Profit/Loss momentum tool, designed to detect rapid changes in market trends, is currently at a neutral level. Nevertheless, if it starts to show deterioration, it could be a clear signal of a deeper correction, as has happened on other occasions.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We must observe these marginal buyers and sellers. On-chain analysis of Short-Term Holders provides precisely this, a view into the most economically active participants right now.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that most of the charts the analyst presents use daily timeframes, so it is normal to expect substantial movements of up to $10,000.</p>



<p>Although the indicators provide valuable information to understand the current <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-exchange-inflows-tap-6-year-low-as-investors-take-flight-to-self-custody/">Bitcoin</a> and cryptocurrency landscape, they are not entirely infallible when it comes to trading crypto. Therefore, closely observing key levels and market reactions and conducting thorough research before investing in these assets is essential.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hong Kong is looking to position itself as the Asian crypto hub this year, with plans to permit retail trading.</li>



<li>Experts predict that the PRC will follow suit after Hong Kong sets the ball rolling due to the relationship between both jurisdictions.</li>



<li>The Hong Kong digital asset guideline includes minimum entry level, market caps, and disclosures to ensure transparency and prevent market manipulation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Hong Kong is on its way to regaining its lost status as the crypto hub of South East Asia with a detailed strategy that will potentially spin into China.</p>



<p>As Hong Kong reopens trading to retail investors in June, experts have weighed in on the ripple effect of a successful implementation. The new rules may find their way back into mainland China according to Anne Sophie Cissey, Flowdesk’s Head of Compliance.</p>



<p>China began its <a href="https://zycrypto.com/does-the-market-really-care-about-chinas-anti-crypto-crackdown/">crackdown</a> on cryptocurrencies in 2017, declaring them illegal before specifically attacking firms and shutting down mining operations, citing climate concerns. The country floated its digital currency to rival private digital assets, which it termed “<em>risky and dangerous” </em>to people and the economy.</p>



<p>With Hong Kong being a special administrative jurisdiction controlled by China, this move could be a test bed to introduce digital assets considering its previous harsh stance gradually.</p>



<p>“<em>This has been the city’s traditional role for most of the time after 1997, Hong Kong’s handover to the People’s Republic of China. It is a major development in Chinese thinking since the country’s long-standing ban on digital assets and the start of the ‘one country, two systems’ model</em>,” Ciccey noted.</p>



<p>She also added that China is tactical on the issue due to its authoritarian regime.</p>



<p><em>“Hence allowing Hong Kong to embrace a more crypto-friendly stance towards crypto, from the outside, suggests that Beijing wants to use the territory as a testing ground.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hong-kong-set-to-attract-the-big-players">Hong Kong set&nbsp; to attract the big players&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Top web3 firms are looking to make a return to the region and have shown positive feedback following the rollout of new regulations. The new regulations take effect in June and will include a rigorous new licensing system to protect investors. </p>



<p>Firms are also expected to file periodic disclosures to prevent money laundering and market manipulations. Digital asset exchanges are given the green light to operate, but investors with a portfolio below HK$8 million will have certain restrictions. </p>



<p>Lennix Lai, OKX’s  Chief Compliance Officer, lauded the stance of the government, saying that this is an important milestone in web3 development across the region. </p>



<p>“<em>We welcome SFC&#8217;s official stance and commitment to allowing virtual assets trading by retail investors in Hong Kong. This is an important milestone for Hong Kong&#8217;s virtual assets industry as it continues to grow and develop.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>As Ethereum continues to waver amid a broader downturn in the crypto market, one pundit has ignited a fervent debate with a bold prediction regarding the second-largest crypto asset.</p>



<p>Adam Cochran, a partner at activist venture capital firm CEHV, took to Twitter on Saturday to present a compelling case for the possibility of Ethereum&#8217;s price surging to over $450,000 within the next two decades.</p>



<p>Cochran&#8217;s argument began by urging individuals to view <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-mints-more-sharks-and-whales-amid-discounted-prices/">Ethereum</a> not as a typical company but as an innovative blockchain-based infrastructure surpassing traditional models&#8217; constraints. To counter those who expressed skepticism regarding the feasibility of a 20-fold increase in ETH, he drew comparisons between Ethereum&#8217;s market value and that of technology giants such as Apple and Amazon.</p>



<p>At the core of Cochran&#8217;s analysis was the immense volume of securities processed, an astonishing $2.5 quadrillion in the previous year alone. The pundit noted that if these securities were handled on the Ethereum blockchain, accompanied by a minimal 0.05% gas fee, it would result in the annual burning of ETH worth $1.25 trillion. He noted that this amount is 5.7 times greater than the current market capitalization. Accordingly, based on that, Cochran envisioned Ethereum&#8217;s potential value soaring to an extraordinary $35 trillion.</p>



<p>However, he went even further by introducing the concept of a compound burning rate. According to him, assuming an annual compound burning rate of 2% or higher over the course of 20 years, each ETH token could reach an astonishing value of $457,081.</p>



<p>“<em>If you assumed it took 20 years to get there and we burn at a compounding rate of 2%+ annual, you get to around $457,081 per ETH. Add in the fact its a yielding asset and you&#8217;re over $500k,”</em> he tweeted.</p>



<p>Notably, while Cochran acknowledged that achieving 100% adoption of Ethereum for global securities settlement within two decades might be unlikely, he expressed belief in the realistic possibility of settling 10% of global securities within the next ten years.</p>



<p><em>“Do I think 10% of global securities can be settled on ETH in the next 10 years? Sure…Do I think Ethereum can also have value markets other than current global securities that would uplift that? Sure,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>That said, Despite Cochran&#8217;s bold projections, they reveal the boundless possibilities within the realm of Ethereum. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s role as a blockchain infrastructure fosters innovation, a trend that is likely to keep the network and, ultimately, price growing.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, regarding recent market movements, Ethereum&#8217;s price exhibited lacklustre movements, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ether-falls-silent-as-ethereum-suffers-2-network-disruptions-within-24-hours/">dropping</a> around 1.17% over the past week. Since May 13, the second largest cryptocurrency has been seesawing between $1,700 and $1,830, a range that needs to be breached for the price to give a definitive direction. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,841, up 0.65% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>In an unexpected twist of events, hardware wallet maker <a href="https://zycrypto.com/amid-underwhelming-cardano-price-hoskinson-predicts-huge-tvl-boost-as-trezor-suite-adds-support-for-ada/">Trezor</a> has seen an incredible 900% increase in sales, while rival Ledger suffers a serious setback. The increase in Trezor purchases coincides with a major debate over Ledger&#8217;s seed phrase recovery feature.</p>



<p>Users of Ledger, a top producer of hardware wallets, are concerned about the security of their money in light of the recent controversy surrounding the company. Concerns regarding seed phrase storage and the admittance by Ledger that the software can be pushed to release crucial information have raised red flags in the crypto community. Ledger has put a hold on the feature&#8217;s rollout to focus on enhancing transparency and code verifiability in response to these worries. Still, Ledger users appear to have lost faith in the company, which has hurt sales.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Trezor, a reputable rival in the hardware wallet market, has seen a startling 1000% increase in sales. Trezor has attracted a large following of cryptocurrency fans and investors looking for a safer solution to increase the security of their digital assets. Trezor&#8217;s recent sales success has been greatly influenced by its solid reputation for prioritizing customer privacy and security.</p>



<p>The increase in Trezor sales suggests a rising need for secure storage options among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Investors are becoming increasingly conscious of how crucial it is to protect their digital assets, particularly in light of constant cyber threats and hacking attempts. Trezor&#8217;s popularity among users for its top-notch security measures and easy-to-use interface has boosted its sales figures.</p>



<p>Additionally, the effects of the temporary closure of the FTX cryptocurrency exchange coincided with the most recent spike in Trezor sales. Many traders turned to hardware wallets to escape from FTX&#8217;s technical issues to independently secure their assets.</p>



<p>Trezor&#8217;s increasing sales and Ledger&#8217;s difficulties serve as a reminder of how important security and trust are to the cryptocurrency sector. Users prioritize platforms and products that prioritize the protection of their funds. Hardware wallet producers must uphold the highest levels of security as the market continues to develop if they want to inspire user confidence.</p>



<p>The rise in Trezor sales and the difficulties Ledger is currently experiencing may have far-reaching effects in the future. Trezor&#8217;s success is probably going to push it to the head of the hardware wallet pack, which will raise industry rivalry and spur innovation. Ledger must work hard to repair its reputation and win back its users&#8217; trust.</p>



<p>The value of secure storage options cannot be overstated as cryptocurrency adoption rises. Hardware wallets are essential for protecting digital assets; thus, users should be careful to choose a reliable provider.</p>

<p>In a surprising case that caught the crypto community&#8217;s attention, Sarita, a New York housewife, uncovered her husband&#8217;s hidden <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-70000-arthur-hayes-reveals-why-this-price-level-is-unlikely-to-happen-till-2024/">Bitcoin</a> assets during her divorce proceedings.</p>



<p>According to a Saturday report by CNBC, Sarita, who chose to use a pseudonym for her safety, disclosed that she tracked down 12 bitcoins, currently worth close to half a million dollars, in a previously undisclosed crypto wallet owned by her husband after months of investigation and the assistance of a forensic accountant.</p>



<p>As per the report, Sarita, now seeking divorce after a decade in marriage, expressed her shock and feeling of being blindsided by her husband&#8217;s cryptocurrency investment. She admitted that although she had heard of Bitcoin, she had little knowledge about it since they had never discussed it or made investments together.</p>



<p><em>“I know of bitcoin and things like that. I just didn’t know much about it,”</em> she said, adding, “<em>it was never even a thought in my mind, because it’s not like we were discussing it or making investments together…It was definitely a shock.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cryptocurrency-tracking-in-divorce-a-nightmare"><strong>Cryptocurrency Tracking in Divorce: A Nightmare</strong></h2>



<p>As more and more people get involved with cryptocurrencies, cases of financial infidelity related to digital assets are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Moreover, experts in divorce law concur that the legal system is struggling to keep pace with the complexities of cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Notably, tracking down hidden cryptocurrency assets <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cryptocurrency-effect-marriage/">during divorces</a> has led to the emergence of forensic investigators specializing in studying and tracking cryptocurrencies owned by spouses.</p>



<p>In a note to CNBC, divorce attorney Kelly Burris explained that due to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, obtaining information through traditional means, such as subpoenas, is often impossible. Instead, forensic analysis of computers or phones is necessary to identify wallet addresses and conduct blockchain analysis.</p>



<p><em>“The thing with cryptocurrency is it’s not regulated by any kind of centralized bank, so usually you can’t subpoena somebody and get documents and information related to somebody’s cryptocurrency holdings,”</em> said Burris.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In divorce cases involving cryptocurrencies, investigators pay close attention to hardware wallets, cold storage methods, and the movement of tokens across various blockchains. However, the increasing practice of &#8220;chain hopping&#8221;, where individuals quickly switch between different blockchains, complicates asset tracking.</p>



<p>Further, the rapid expansion of the cryptocurrency market, and the introduction of privacy tokens, such as Zcash, Dash and Monero, have also made it challenging to conduct forensic investigations since they offer anonymity when conducting transactions. Additionally, some divorcees may also choose to use crypto mixers such as the now-defunct Tornado Cash, making it harder to trace their assets.</p>



<p>That said, as the popularity and complexity of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, it has become clear that the legal system will need to adapt to handle cases involving digital assets effectively. Still, first, clear crypto regulations are needed.</p>
