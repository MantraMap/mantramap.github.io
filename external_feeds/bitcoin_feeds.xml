<h2>Massive Incentive to Move Money Out of Bank Accounts</h2>
<p>Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk shared Monday a &#8220;massive incentive&#8221; for people to move money out of bank accounts in the U.S. His statement was in response to Twitter user &#8220;unusual_whales&#8221; who quoted Hugh Hendry, founder of Eclectica Asset Management who ran the hedge fund for 15 years, predicting that the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve may have to step in and “restrict your right as a U.S. citizen to pull money out of the U.S. banking sector, due to capital flight from the U.S. banking system.”</p>
<p>Musk explained that the U.S. Treasury and the Fed have created a massive gap between money market accounts (Treasury Bills) with interest rates of about 4.5% and bank accounts with interest rates of less than 1%. “That’s a massive incentive to move money out of bank accounts,” he emphasized.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-586900 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/musk-and-unusual_whales-tweets.jpg" alt="" width="913" height="559" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/musk-and-unusual_whales-tweets-300x184.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/musk-and-unusual_whales-tweets-768x470.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/musk-and-unusual_whales-tweets.jpg 913w" sizes="(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px" /></p>
<p>This was not the first time Musk has warned about this problem. On May 2, the Tesla boss replied to a tweet about a &#8220;liquidity crisis&#8221; and &#8220;cash being sucked&#8221; into Treasury money market accounts with 4.5% interest, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a massive problem. Doesn’t make sense to keep money in a &lt;1% interest bank account instead of a 4.5% money market (Treasury Bill) account. As more people &amp; companies realize this, bank depositor flight will accelerate to extreme levels, even for banks that are ‘too big to fail.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk also agreed with former money manager Genevieve Roch-Decter who tweeted Monday that &#8220;Banks have successfully fooled depositors into accepting 0.4% interest on savings while the bank makes +5% on treasuries.&#8221; She stressed: &#8220;The biggest risk for banks is the consumer figuring out they can move their money out of banks and buy treasuries or money market funds themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many people have voiced concerns about the U.S. banking crisis. First Republic Bank was seized by regulators last week and most of its assets were sold to JPMorgan Chase. It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history since 2008. In March, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed. However, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell insisted that the banking system is “sound and resilient” as Fed officials raised interest rates by 25 basis points last week.</p>
<p>A Swedbank strategist has cautioned that the U.S. banking crisis is spreading, warning of more bank failures in a &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/swedbank-strategist-says-us-banking-crisis-is-spreading-warns-of-more-banks-failing-in-vicious-spiral/">vicious spiral</a>.&#8221; Billionaire Bill Ackman warned that we are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-bill-ackman-on-us-banking-crisis-we-are-running-out-of-time-to-fix-this-problem/">running out of time</a> to fix the banking problem. In addition, the Fed recently revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-reveals-722-banks-reported-unrealized-losses-over-50-of-capital-as-concerns-over-us-banking-crisis-grow/">722 banks</a> reported unrealized losses exceeding 50% of capital in the third quarter of last year.</p>
<p>In an interview with Bloomberg Thursday, Hendry described the situation of the U.S. banking system as “real bad.” The former hedge fund manager elaborated: “The panacea of the Treasury announcing that all deposits are federally insured does not solve this problem. There is capital flight — deposit flight — from the banking sector seeking yield.” He further warned: “I can actually conceive of a federal or Treasury rule coming in and saying &#8216;for the next 180 days, you can&#8217;t pull your money out of the banking sector.'&#8221;</p>

The exchange reportedly has over 100,000 creditors and liabilities ranging from $500 million to $1 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>Bittrex Bankruptcy Filing Reveals Over 100,000 Creditors and $1 Billion in Liabilities</h2>
<p>Bittrex Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on Monday, while its parent company Bittrex Global will continue to operate outside the United States. This development comes after the exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-bittrex-shuts-down-us-operations-due-to-regulatory-uncertainty/">announced</a> its decision to sunset U.S. operations in early April. By mid-month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bittrex-receives-wells-notice-from-sec-for-alleged-investor-protection-law-violations/">sent</a> the company a Wells notice.</p>
<p>On April 17, 2023, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-crypto-exchange-bittrex-with-operating-unregistered-exchange-broker-and-clearing-agency/">took action</a> against the exchange by charging it for operating an unregistered exchange, clearing agency, and broker. The lawsuit also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-deems-dash-algo-and-omg-unregistered-securities-in-bittrex-lawsuit/">classified</a> OMG, ALGO, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" 312026  target="_blank">DASH</a> as &#x201C;unregistered securities.&#x201D; Recently, Randall Reese from Chapter 11 Dockets <a href="https://twitter.com/Chapter11Cases/status/1655682757647818752?s=20">revealed</a> that the crypto platform has 100,000 creditors. To keep them informed, the company has enlisted the help of Omni Agent Solutions to provide regular email and website updates.</p>

<p>&#x200B;&#x200B;The Bittrex Chapter 11 filing reveals assets and liabilities ranging from $500 million to $1 billion. Additionally, Bittrex Global&#x2019;s two other subsidiaries, Bittrex Malta Holdings Ltd. and Bittrex Malta Ltd., have also filed for bankruptcy protection. U.S. customers who used the crypto exchange were instructed to withdraw their funds by the end of April. Currently, it remains unclear who the company&#x2019;s largest creditors are and how long the case will last. In response to the situation, Bittrex Inc., based in Seattle, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230508005751/en/Bittrex-Inc.-Statement-on-Chapter-11-Bankruptcy">released a statement</a> at 6:30 p.m. (ET).</p>
<p>&#x201C;Having previously announced that Bittrex, Inc. would be ceasing all operations in the U.S. effective April 30th, we have now made the decision to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy in federal court in Delaware,&#x201D; Bittrex disclosed. &#x201C;This announcement does not impact Bittrex Global, which will continue operations as normal for its customers outside the U.S. For those customers who did not withdraw their funds from the platform prior to the end of April, your funds remain safe and secure, and our main priority is to ensure that our customers are made whole.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Ripple&#x2019;s CEO Shares New Info on SEC Lawsuit Over <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>The CEO of Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, has provided some new information regarding his company&#x2019;s ongoing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>During a fireside chat with CNBC at the Dubai Fintech Summit on Monday, Garlinghouse revealed that when the lawsuit is concluded, Ripple would have spent $200 million in total to defend itself against the securities regulator. The executive shared:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the SEC, we will spend &#x2014; this is the first time I&#x2019;ve shared this publicly &#x2014; by the time all&#x2019;s said and done, we will have spent $200 million defending ourselves against a lawsuit, which from its very beginning, people were like, well, this doesn&#x2019;t make a lot of sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>The securities watchdog sued him, Ripple, and co-founder Chris Larsen in December 2020 alleging that they raised over $1.3 billion through an unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering. Ripple, Garlinghouse, and Larsen have maintained that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security.</p>
<p>Commenting on U.S. crypto regulations, Garlinghouse stated that as a U.S. citizen and CEO of a company that started in the U.S.: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s sad. I have sadness about this.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The Ripple executive explained that other countries, such as Dubai, Singapore, and Switzerland, are getting ahead of the U.S. and will emerge as global financial capitals due to their regulatory clarity. &#x201C;The U.S. is getting passed, not just a little bit, but by a lot &#x2026; The tough thing about this is you have a country that, I think, put politics ahead of policies. That&#x2019;s not a good decision if you&#x2019;re trying to invest in the economy,&#x201D; he stressed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>You have video footage of the chair of the SEC, as a professor at MIT, saying 75% of these digital assets are commodities. And now he says they&#x2019;re all securities because he&#x2019;s the head of the SEC and he&#x2019;s seeking power and he&#x2019;s putting power ahead of sound policy to grow an economy in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has been accused of taking an enforcement-centric approach to regulating the crypto industry. There have also been widespread complaints that the SEC does not provide clear regulatory guidelines, making it difficult for companies in the crypto space to ensure compliance. In addition, Gensler has said several times that most crypto tokens other than bitcoin are securities.</p>

<p>In an interview with The National, published Monday, Garlinghouse <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/money/2023/05/08/crypto-company-ripple-expects-sec-verdict-in-six-months/">opined</a>: &#x201C;But even after the lawsuit, the U.S. needs to provide clear rules of the road and regulatory clarity. The lawsuit will help. Other countries around the world will be ahead of where the U.S. is in adopting blockchain technologies.&#x201D; The Ripple executive noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we win the lawsuit, it&#x2019;ll be clear what <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is, but the rest of the industry is still going to be unclear. And the whole crypto industry needs regulatory clarity in the U.S. to really thrive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding Ripple&#x2019;s legal battle with the SEC, Garlinghouse said: &#x201C;One of the silver linings for Ripple is we&#x2019;re at the end of our journey &#x2026; We&#x2019;re two and a half years into this lawsuit. We should have a decision pretty soon.&#x201D; According to Garlinghouse, a decision on the lawsuit could come in three to six months.</p>
<p>The Ripple CEO also shared at the summit that Ripple is expanding in Dubai. &#x201C;With 20% of our customers based in MENA [Middle East and North Africa] and clear regulatory regimes being developed, it&#x2019;s no surprise that Dubai is emerging as a key global financial hub for crypto innovation to thrive,&#x201D; he tweeted.</p>

However, he warned about the dangers that printing too much money could bring to the strength of the currency in the future.</strong></p>
<h2>Warren Buffett&#8217;s Only Valid Option for Reserve Currency Is the U.S. Dollar</h2>
<p>Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, also known as the &#8216;Oracle of Omaha&#8217; due to his city of origin, gave his opinion about the status of the dollar as a reserve currency and how this could change in the future.</p>
<p>During the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting, the legendary investor was asked about his thoughts about the process of de-dollarization that world markets are experiencing, with countries like India and Brazil seeking to reduce dollar dependence, and its relation with the U.S. Federal Reserve money printing processes and rising <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-raises-interest-rate-by-25bps-insists-us-banking-system-is-sound-and-resilient/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interest rates</a> to control inflation.</p>
<p>Buffet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShmFzkUvF1k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that, in his opinion, the dollar was the only candidate to be considered the world&#8217;s reserve currency at the moment, but also raised concerns about how much the U.S. Federal Reserve could print without putting this reserve currency status in jeopardy.</p>

<h2>The Dangers of Printing Money Indefinitely</h2>
<p>Buffett explained that nobody knew the situation better than Jerome Powell, the President of the U.S. Federal Reserve, but added he was not in charge of the fiscal policy of the country.</p>
<p>The Oracle of Omaha warned about the actions of the U.S. regarding printing, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nobody knows how far you can go with a paper currency before it gets out of control, and particularly if you’re the world’s reserve currency. You don’t want to try and pick out the point where it does become a problem because then it’s all over.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buffett remarked that when people lose faith in the currency, they behave in an entirely different manner than they do when they put some money in the bank or have a pension plan that will give them something with equal purchasing power. This can create other problems for the economy that Buffett concedes he cannot predict fully.</p>
<p>He concluded his answer reiterating his warning about money printing. He declared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>America is an incredible society, rich; you know, we got everything going for us, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can just print money indefinitely.</p>
</blockquote>

A fresh study from Coingecko reveals that a significant portion of meme coin fascination originates from the United States, India, and the U.K., encompassing over half of the top ten countries&#8217; interest driving the meme coin phenomenon. </strong></p>
<h2>Report Unveils Global Meme Coin Fever</h2>
<p>On May 3, 2023, crypto market aggregator coingecko.com unveiled a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/top-meme-coin-countries">report</a> detailing the leading ten countries propelling the meme token trend. As of this writing, the meme coin economy boasts a value of $18.25 billion, with dogecoin (DOGE), shiba inu (SHIB), and pepe (PEPE) as the top three meme coins. This week, PEPE has emerged as the frontrunner in terms of seven-day gains, skyrocketing 216% against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>The Coingecko analysis establishes that the U.S. spearheads the meme coin movement accounting for 23.6% of interest in 2023. Researcher Lim Yu Qian explains that two million views stem from top meme coin pages in the United States. In America, shiba inu (SHIB) is the most sought-after meme coin, followed by pepe (PEPE), bonk (BONK), and volt inu (VOLT).</p>
<p>India holds second place in contributing to the meme coin frenzy with 20.3% of interest. SHIB also earns its position as India&#8217;s most popular meme token followed by baby doge coin (BABYDOGE). In the Philippines, floki inu (FLOKI) tops their list of preferred tokens while Nigeria&#8217;s favorites are floki and arbdoge ai. According to Coingecko’s report, lesser-known meme coins also gain traction in both countries.</p>
<p>“People are by far most interested in shiba inu, which drove 46.7% of interest among the top meme coins in 2023,” the analysis notes. “Baby doge coin generated 12.3% of meme coin interest, followed by more recent meme coins pepe (9.4%), floki (8.6%) and bonk (8.2%).”</p>
<p>The research indicates that PEPE dominates the Canadian market with 26.9% of attention, while dogecoin (DOGE) claims the top spot in Morocco. As for methodology, the study utilized the total page views for the highest-ranking 15 meme coins by market capitalization in May 2023.</p>

The global crypto market cap fell by over 3% to start the week, which comes days ahead of the upcoming U.S. inflation report. Solana also declined, hitting a multi-week low.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Xrp, formerly known as ripple, fell by as much as 5% on Monday, with the global market cap slipping by over 3% in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4333 to start the week, less than 24 hours after hitting a high of $0.4606.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this decline, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> moved to its lowest point since March 25, breaking out of a floor at $0.4360 in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, the slippage came as the relative strength index (RSI), broke out of a floor at 39.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 36.04, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> at a level of $0.4365.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Overall, the token is down 5.11% as of writing.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Solana (SOL) remained in the red, as the token extended its own recent declines to a third session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $22.74 on Sunday, SOL/USD fell to a low of $21.01 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Monday&#x2019;s drop in price has sent SOL to its long-term support point at $21.00, resulting in its lowest level since April 26.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The token has rebounded from earlier lows, as the RSI found a floor of its own at the 44.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, price strength is tracking at 44.57, with a ceiling at 49.00 a potential target for bulls.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
If momentum does rise, and more bulls reenter the market, that could lead to SOL climbing back above $22.00.&#13;<br />

The increase in fees can be linked to a backlog of transactions trapped in the mempool, as over 440,000 unconfirmed transactions are currently awaiting confirmation.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Block Reward Dethroned: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Surpass Mining Subsidy for the First Time Since 2017</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
On Sunday, May 7, 2023, bitcoin transaction fees exceeded the block reward for the first time since December 2017 at block height 788,695. Subsequent block heights 788,700 and 788,702 also witnessed fees surpassing the subsidy.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At present, over <a href="https://mempool.space/">440,000 bitcoin transactions</a> are pending confirmation with 193 blocks left to mine for clearing them all. Fees soared past the $25 mark per transaction on Sunday, and current data displays an average fee of 0.00069 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3y">$19.20 per transaction</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to bitinfocharts.com data, the median-sized fee is 0.0004 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-median_transaction_fee.html#3y">$11.05 per transfer</a>. High-priority transactions are paying upwards of $22.90 per transaction and individuals are paying $19.95 for medium-priority transactions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Block intervals or mining times have been exceeding the ten-minute average lately. The most recent block time was approximately ten minutes and 34 seconds. Slower block times may result in another decline in difficulty &#x2014; an estimated drop of <a href="https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/">around 5.3%</a> is anticipated to occur on May 18, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The average hashrate over the past 2,016 blocks is roughly 338 exahash per second (EH/s). The network&#x2019;s hashrate has dipped below the 300 EH/s range on some instances and is presently running at <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">385 EH/s</a> at the time of writing.&#13;<br />

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved lower to start the week, as cryptocurrency markets continued to react to the latest nonfarm payrolls report.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The number of jobs added to the U.S. economy came in higher than expected, in many&#x2019;s eyes justifying the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s decision to hike interest rates by 0.25%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $27,691.26 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, following a peak of $29,119.38 the day prior.&#13;</p>

&#13;<br />
Overall, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has now fallen for a third straight session, with this latest drop sending prices to a one-week low.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the catalysts for the decline was a breakout which took place on the relative strength index (RSI), which fell below a floor at 47.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 44.32, with a floor of 42.00 a potential target for bears.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was also in the red on Monday, with prices plunging below $1,900.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $1,934.00 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped by almost $100, hitting a low of $1,839.89 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similar to bitcoin, today&#x2019;s decline saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency fall for its third consecutive day.&#13;</p>

From the chart, it appears that ethereum bears are now attempting to take the RSI to its own point of support at 45.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Currently, the index is at the 47.02 level, having recently moved below a higher support point at 49.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should price strength hit the target of 45.00, there is a possibility that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will be trading under $1,800.&#13;<br />

Following their arrest, the kidnappers, who were demanding a ransom of over $1.1 million, were found in possession of weapons and fake identity documents. </strong></p>
<h2>Syrian Crypto Dealer&#8217;s Captors Were His Party Friends</h2>
<p>Spanish law enforcement recently freed a Syrian cryptocurrency dealer from three kidnappers that were demanding a ransom of $1.12 million (or €1 million). According to a <a href="https://www.niusdiario.es/espana/andalucia/20230505/caso-empresario-criptomonedas-benalmadena-secuestrado-liberado-expres-companeros-juerga-secuestradores_18_09439119.html">report</a> by a Spanish-language publication, the captured trio was set to appear in court on May 6 where they were expected to face kidnapping as well as illegal possession of weapons charges.</p>
<p>As revealed in the report, the unnamed Syrian crypto dealer had partied with the trio before the kidnapping. However, when they four met on May 3, the Hungary-based crypto dealer’s party friends pounced and started demanding the ransom money. According to the report, the crypto dealer whose company is based in Dubai, was told to access applications that he uses to manage his crypto business and to contact the intended recipient of the ransom money.</p>
<p>However, whilst in captivity, the Syrian crypto dealer is said to have taken a picture through the window and sent this over to a colleague who was negotiating his release. The colleague, in turn, then sent this to the victim’s other acquaintance who then forwarded this to law enforcement.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the information, Spanish law enforcement launched an investigation which eventually led to the raid on a luxury villa located in Benalmádena. In addition to finding weapons and gardening tools, law enforcement agents also found one of the kidnappers in possession of several fake identity documents. In addition, two of the Syrian crypto dealer’s captors had fake Greek Passports.</p>

In this issue, Bolivia passes a law to sell gold for dollars, the Central Bank of Argentina bans fintech companies from using crypto, and Fitch improves El Salvador&#8217;s credit rating.</strong></p>
<h2>Bolivia Passes Law to Sell Gold for Dollars</h2>
<p>Bolivia recently passed a law that will allow the government to sell up to 50% of its gold reserves in dollars, easing the internal scarcity of dollars. The law gives faculties to the government to negotiate the sale of 22 tons of gold out of the almost 44 available in the local reserves.</p>
<p>The initiative had been presented back in 2021, but it was only recently rescued and passed by the Congress, which is dominated by the party of Bolivian president Luis Arce. Jorge Richter, a presidential spokesperson, explained the objective of the swift approval of the law. He <a href="https://abi.bo/index.php/noticias/gobierno/36787-ley-habilita-al-bcb-a-comprar-oro-en-moneda-nacional-y-crea-herramienta-para-enfrentar-bache-de-iliquidez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The country has a tool so that these events and situations of the past days that we have known are not repeated, difficulties in the production of North American currency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost all Bolivian banks had <a href="https://www.elmundo.es/internacional/2023/05/06/645598a121efa03e398b457a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously</a> established a $300 daily withdrawal limit for their users, and the Central Bank of Bolivia had to organize direct sales to satisfy the local demand for foreign currency.</p>
<h2>Central Bank of Argentina Bans Fintech Companies From Using Crypto</h2>
<p>On May 4, the Central Bank of Argentina issued a communication <a href="https://bcra.gob.ar/Noticias/proveedores-servicio-pago-no-pueden-operar-criptoactivos.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banning</a> certain fintech providers from using cryptocurrency assets or offering services linked to digital assets or other assets &#8220;not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic.&#8221; to their customers.</p>
<p>The measure would only affect fintech companies that provide direct payments accounts, including <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Ualá, </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">MercadoPago, </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Personal Pay, </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">DolarApp, </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Nubi, and </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">MODO, among <a href="https://www.bcra.gob.ar/SistemasFinancierosYdePagos/Proveedores-servicios-de-pago-ofrecen-cuentas-de-pago.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">others</a>. Bitcoin Argentina, a national NGO, rejected this measure, <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinAR/status/1654229334138277891?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that it &#8220;is surprising and unconsulted. It is not understood what objective the central bank is seeking by prohibiting an activity that today is entirely satisfactory and useful for the clients of the local exchanges.&#8221;</span></p>

<h2>Fitch Ratings Improves El Salvador&#8217;s Credit Rating</h2>
<p>Fitch Ratings, one of the big three credit rating agencies, upgraded the credit rating of El Salvador, even with the adoption of bitcoin as a legal tender. Fitch upgraded El Salvador&#8217;s rating from CC to CCC+, <a href="https://forbescentroamerica.com/2023/05/05/fitch-ratings-mejora-calificacion-de-el-salvador-gracias-liquidez-fiscal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that this was the consequence of &#8220;successful completion of the exchange and payment of significant global bond write-downs early in the year, and reflects Fitch&#8217;s view that another event of default no longer appears likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654609855557038082?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> the change, explaining he could not wait for Fitch wait to &#8220;upgrade it even more, once we announce our budget surplus for 2024.&#8221;</p>
