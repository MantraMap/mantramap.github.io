There are fungible normal tokens, such as <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a></strong>. In other words, they are identical to one another. Then, there are <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">non-fungible tokens (NFTs)</a></strong>, such as the Bored Ape collection, which cannot simply be exchanged for one another. Finally comes<strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-semi-fungible-crypto-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> semi-fungible tokens (SFTs)</a></strong>, which bridge these two worlds, then appear. The idea of SFTs is still very new compared to <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrencies</a></strong> and NFTs. The token changes from a fungible asset to an NFT, making it distinctive.</p>
<h3><b>What is a Semi-Fungible Token?</b></h3>
<p>SFTs, or semi-fungible tokens, can be exchanged as fungible or non-fungible. It may contain a fungible value that can be exchanged for another SFT with a similar value. The token loses value and is no longer fungible once it is traded or &#8220;redeemed.&#8221; Using a concert ticket as an illustration, this can be explained. It is possible to exchange two tickets with the same price, concert date, seat, etc., but after the exchange, the tickets become collectibles and thus NFTs. Its name is a result of this transformation from fungible to non-fungible.</p>
<p><iframe title="Semi-Fungible Vs  Non-Fungible Tokens  &#x1f4b0;" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HtnBwfIEFg0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><b>How to create an SFT?</b></h3>
<p>It is possible to create SFTs using ETH 1155 tokens. The standard was developed in 2017 by the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/play-to-earn-p2e/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain game</a></strong> developers Enjin, The <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/sandbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandbox</a></strong>, and Horizon Games using <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/erc-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH 20</a></strong> and ETH 721 tokens. This enables the creation and management of the token with a single smart contract. This is not the case with an NFT, where each new transaction requires a unique arrangement. Since transactions in the gaming industry frequently involve fungible tokens, the creation of this token is ideal.</p>

<h3><b>Advantages of SFTs</b></h3>
<p>The following advantages of SFTs may aid in their gradual buying of the digital sphere:</p>
<ol>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Fractionalization</li>
<li>Liquidity</li>
<li>Utility</li>
<li>Unique Selling Proposition</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>What is NFT?</b></h3>
<p>Non-fungible Tokens, or NFTs, are typically produced using the same coding as digital tokens. These <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/digital-assets-outlook-for-2023-what-will-be-the-biggest-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptographic assets</a></strong> are based on blockchain technology, to put it simply. Unlike other cryptographic assets, they cannot be traded or exchanged on an equal basis.</p>
<p>The term &#8220;Non-Transferable&#8221; (NFT) clearly denotes that due to its distinctive properties, it cannot be changed or substituted. Both fiat money and digital tokens can be traded or exchanged for one another because they are both fungible.</p>
<h3><b>How to create an NFT?</b></h3>
<p>A cryptocurrency exchange or market that supports NFT minting can be used to create an NFT. To build an NFT from scratch, follow these six steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1: Determine what you want to create</li>
<li>Step 2: Choose a Blockchain</li>
<li>Step 3: Establish an NFT wallet</li>
<li>Step 4: Choose an NFT Platform</li>
<li>Step 5: Create the NFT</li>
<li>Step 6: List the NFT for Sale</li>
</ol>
<h3>Advantages of Investing in NFTs</h3>
<p>Assets that have been tokenized into NFTs are appealing to investors for a variety of reasons. Investing in NFTs offers a number of advantages, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>NFTs are open to all investors.</li>
<li>A blockchain is used to protect NFT ownership.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s a chance to gain more knowledge about blockchain technology.</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Semi- Fungible Vs Non-Fungible Token: Differences</b></h2>
<p>The main advantage of semi-fungible tokens is that they can maintain their &#8220;fungibility&#8221; until switching to NFT or vice versa, as was previously stated. It can &#8220;remember&#8221; the past or characteristics when in NFT form. In a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/my-neighbor-alice-an-introduction-to-the-play-to-earn-crypto-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video game</a></strong>, it might recall that the DJ console you bought must function as a level 89 item and be once owned by these three other players.</p>
<p>An SFT in NFT form could still offer the verifiability, indivisibility, and indestructibility benefits of NFTs. The benefits of bundles of tokens, using a single smart contract for a fungible token and NFT token and faster transaction times persuade app developers to give the technology a chance. Developers, content producers, and project sponsors currently have many opportunities thanks to the flexibility of semi-fungible tokens. Regular users and investors must wait, though, as publicly accessible marketplaces, DApps, and metaverse environments have not yet let the SFT floodgates open.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Semi-Fungible Vs Non-Fungible Token: Although it will take some time for semi-fungible tokens to replace NFTs, the trend is undoubtedly growing in popularity. However, particularly within the gaming industry due to its adaptability as a fungible token that can later become a non-fungible token.</p>

<p>The BSC is also expanding as a smart contract network because of its cheap fees and quick transactions. Choosing the most appropriate BSC token to buy may also be successful. However, as a disclaimer we&#8217;d encourage you to do deep research on projects before making any investment decision.</p>
<h4>Mobox</h4>
<p>Catering to fans of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/play-to-earn-p2e/">play-to-earn games</a> and non-fungible tokens, Mobox is a popular GameFi platform. The platform combines DeFi, gaming, and community to create an immersive ecosystem of products known as the &#8216;MOMOverse&#8217; — which is the name of Mobox&#8217;s metaverse. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://bitcoinwisdom.com/mobox-mbox-price-prediction/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Wisdom’s projections</a>, MBOX will be green in 2025. The MBOX is expected to reach and surpass its all-time high of $15.68 in 2025.</p>
<h4>BinaryX</h4>
<p>BinaryX is behind CyberDragon, one of the best crypto games on the BSC network. The project has done well to build up an active user base and attract a lot of attention from investors looking for the next Axie Infinity.</p>

<h4>Baby Dogecoin</h4>
<p>Inspired by the largest meme coin by market cap, Baby Dogecoin is a crypto token that is a native of the Binance Smart Chain that has a unique reward and fee structures to benefit holders. The minimum value of Baby DogeCoin in 2030 can be around $0.0000051. According to several market predictions, Baby DogeCoin can reach a maximum price level of $0.0000075 in 2023.</p>
<h4>BSCPad</h4>
<p>BSCPad was one of the first launchpads to primarily focus on the BNB Chain ecosystem and helped to crowdfund and incubate some of 2021’s most profitable projects — including the likes of AIOZ, GameZone, and MetaVPad.</p>
<h4>CoinWind</h4>
<p>CoinWind (COW) is a platform aiming to reshape the current <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">Defi</a> mining landscape by automatically matching the token a user pledges to a relevant pair (e.g. BSC/BUSD) in order to eliminate the problem of low single-asset yields.</p>

<p>DCG&#8217;s own media publication has potentially hired advisors at the Lazard Group for a potential sale. This move would mean CoinDesk&#8217;s exit from Barry Silbert&#8217;s Digital Currency Group.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news of CoinDesk hiring the bankers at Lazard. Furthermore, in an email statement, CEO Kevin Worth <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-media-outlet-coindesk-taps-bankers-for-potential-sale-11674076000?reflink=share_mobilewebshare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Over the last few months, we have received numerous inbound indications of interest in CoinDesk&#8221;. He further added that Lizard will help CoinDesk “explore various options to attract growth capital to the CoinDesk business, which may include a partial or full sale.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>FTX Contagion Spreads to CoinDesk</h3>
<p>Launched back in 2013, crypto media publication CoinDesk was among the first to report the balance sheet troubles at Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Alameda Research. That report spiraled further into exposing a deeper hole at FTX and eventually led to the bankruptcy of both firms.</p>
<p>However, the contagion of the FTX collapse has come to hit CoinDesk and its parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG&#8217;s subsidiary and crypto lender Genesis filed for bankruptcy last month putting crypto exchange Gemini into greater trouble.</p>
<p>Many market analysts have been warning that the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX is likely to spread further in the market and impact several crypto firms this year. However, any major trouble at Digital Currency Group (DCG) could put the crypto market in greater trouble considering that it controls the world&#8217;s largest digital asset management firm Grayscale.</p>
<p>While DCG has been claiming no trouble at Grayscale, investors should watch the developments. This year of 2023 has started with a much-needed relief for crypto investors as Bitcoin and the broader crypto space have registered a strong bounce back.</p>

According to a recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week" rel="nofollow">report</a>, it has issued a warning that the firm may need to file for bankruptcy if it is unable to raise further funding.</p>
<h2>Genesis Prepares For Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Reports suggest that creditors like the Winklevoss twins would be willing to agree to a remission period between one and two years under the prepackaged <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a> plan. This forbearance period would apply to the majority of the payments. Furthermore, creditors would receive cash payments in addition to shares in the parent business of Genesis, the Digital Currency Group, which is headed by Barry Silbert.</p>

<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cameron-winklevoss/">Cameron Winklevoss</a>, the co-founder of Gemini, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/barry-silbert/">Barry Silbert</a> have been engaged in a Twitter fight where the former has accused Silbert of intermixing finances at the crypto conglomerate and of negotiating in bad faith. In his most recent open letter, he demanded the <a href="https://coingape.com/winklevoss-vs-silbert-gemini-founder-dcg-ceo-removal/">DCG chief stand down from his position</a> as he failed to keep his end of the promise of returning customer funds worth $900 million.</p>
<h2>Genesis Faces Growing Tension</h2>
<p>Further proving Genesis&#8217; weak financials, DCG sent a letter to the shareholders on January 17,  where the company informed that it will <a href="https://coingape.com/digital-currency-group-halts-dividends/">stop paying quarterly dividends</a> in an attempt to preserve capital. The creditors, Genesis, and DCG have compared several different approaches but have not been able to come to an agreement as of yet. Both Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Proskauer Rose have been serving as advisors to various creditors&#8217; groups.</p>
<p>After the failure of the hedge fund <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, financial pressure started to build up at Barry Silbert&#8217;s DCG. In November, shortly after the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>&#8211;where Genesis had some of its cash stored&#8211;filed for bankruptcy, Genesis ceased processing withdrawals. The crypto exchange Gemini Trust, which is run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has been affected by these developments as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> Earn, a program that allows users of the platform to earn interest on their coins by lending them out through Genesis, also had to cease processing redemption requests.</p>
<p>Genesis Global is currently preparing the groundwork for the bankruptcy petition, which may take place as soon as this week.</p>

Amid this recovery, the coin price rebounded from the 0.33 support, breached the local resistance of $0.374, and rallied 23% higher to make a swing high at the $0.4 mark. However, can the XRP price maintain a sustained recovery in the coming weeks?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price resonating between the 0.41 and 0.33 mark for the past 2 months indicates a range Bond Trend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $0.41 could set the XRP price for a 7.6% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.4 Billion, indicating a 39% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YqqsEo7Y.png" alt="XRP Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market has stalled its recovery in the last few days, to which the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-update-ripple-ceo-at-davos-clears-air-over-settlement-odds-with-sec/">XRP price</a> went sideways and wobbled between the $0.37 and $0.41 barriers. Between this range, the daily chart candles showed several Doji candles with long higher and lower price rejection wicks, indicating uncertainty in the XRP price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the lateral walk above the $0.37 mark would allow the buyers to retest the recently reclaimed support. Moreover, a prolonged consolidation above the aforementioned support will validate whether the coin price is well supported by this level and can be used to climb higher. </span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, investors believing the XRL price could rise in the near future can use this support as an entry opportunity. Meanwhile, those looking for a safer entry can consider buying after the breakout of the $0.4 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the overhead resistance could drive the exact price 7.6% higher to hit the $0.44 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a country note, a breakdown below the $0.37 support will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the flattish crucial are (20 50,100, and 200). highlights a sideways friend in XRP. However, a potential bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA near the 0.37 mark increases the support power of this level.                                                                                            </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index</strong>: the delay RSI slope moving above the midline indicates the market sentiment is positive for a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.387</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.41 and $0.44</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.37 and 0.33</span></li>

The value of cryptocurrencies fell after it was disclosed that the United States government would take legal action against a relatively obscure <a href="https://coingape.com/doj-takes-enforcement-action-against-this-crypto-exchange/">Russian crypto exchange known as Bitzlato</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Dips On Bitzlato News</h2>
<p>The DOJ&#8217;s news alarmed the crypto markets, causing the top <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> by market cap to drop by about $1,000 and Ethereum (ETH) to retrace back to the $1,500 level. Other major cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, XRP, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano</a> also saw a dip in price after the announcement was widely covered by media outlets.</p>

<p>The majority of investors anticipate that the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> and global regulators will eventually place a heavy regulatory burden on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a> and other businesses connected to the cryptocurrency sector; as a result of the high number of crypto-related scams and the proliferation of black swan events that occurred in 2022.</p>

<h2>Layoffs &amp; Economic Worries</h2>
<p>The gloomy forecast for the U.S. and global economy in 2023 that was made by banks visiting Davos and the rising tendency of large technology businesses laying off personnel could both be contributing factors to the additional pressure that is being placed on crypto assets. recently, Ethereum development company <a href="https://coingape.com/metamask-creator-consensys-layoffs-workforce-due-reason/">ConsenSys announced its decision to axe 11% of its workforce</a> globally. Earlier, Coinbase, Amazon and even Microsoft issued similar notices to their employees.</p>
<p>Enjin coin, Lido, Frax and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/chiliz/">Chiliz</a> were a few of the digital currencies which witnessed larger drops of more than 5% in value; however, have now recovered slightly after the steep decline. The total <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/">value</a> of all cryptocurrencies on the market is currently $975.95 billion which represents a decline of 3% over the course of the previous day.</p>
<p>As things stand, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">price of  Bitcoin (BTC)</a> is currently being traded at $20,849. This represents a decrease of 2.7% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 21.07% during the week as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="793" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/14205856/enjin-coin-enj-editorial-illustrative-260nw-2153901365.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the majority of major cryptocurrencies, the Enjin coin price witnessed a sustained recovery in the first two weeks of 2023. The coin price has rallied 72.5% since January 1 and currently trades at the $0.39 mark. Furthermore, the U-shaped recovery in the daily chart reveals the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a>. Here’s how this bullish reversal could influence the ENJ coin’s future price.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A higher price rejection at $0.4 resistance indicates a potential pullback in the ENJ price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20 and 50 DMA would increase the buying pressure on the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in ENJ price is $164.4 Million, indicating a 372% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/hl8SQmnv.png" alt="Enjin Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rounding bottom pattern is one of the famous trend reversal patterns that offer steady recovery in any asset. Earlier today, the Enju coin witnessed a significant inflow that surged its market value by 20% and breached the local resistance of  $0.4.  However, a sudden downfall in the crypto market in the last few hours has evaporated these gains considerably and formed a higher price rejection at mentioned resistance.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rejection indicates high supply pressure, and If the daily candle closes below $0.4 resistance, the ENJ price would likely witness a minor pullback. This potential correction could tumble the price by 17.5% and revisit the $0.35 support. If this local support recuperates bullish momentum, and Enjin coin will resume the prevailing trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, under the influence of the rounding bottom pattern, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> should eventually ride a steady recovery to hit the $0.49-$0.5 neckline resistance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vortex indicator</strong>: the enlarged gap between the VI+ and VI- slope projects a sustained buying of the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>DMAs</strong>: In case of a possible retracement, the reclaimed DMAs(20, 50, and 100) could offer additional support to the rising prices. Conversely, the 200 DMA wavering around the $0.44 mark suppresses the bullish growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjin Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.39</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.4 and $0.49</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.325 and $0.275</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Terra Classic community has burned over 16 million LUNC tokens in a week amid the push to increase the burn rate. In order to raise the burn rate, Terra Classic validators and projects aim to burn billions of Terra Classic (LUNC) in 2023.

In order to raise the burn rate, Terra Classic validators and projects aim to burn billions of Terra Classic (LUNC) in 2023. Until now, the Terra Classic community has burned 37.717 billion LUNC tokens.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Shifts Focus on LUNC Burns</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic community has shifted its focus to burning more amounts of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens to compensate for fewer burns in December and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> reducing LUNC burn contributions to 50%.</p>
<p>The community burned over 16 million LUNC tokens in a week, increasing the burn rate as compared to the last week&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-burns-over-12-million-lunc-price-jumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million LUNC tokens</a>. Most of the LUNC burned came from validators, with LUNC DAO <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finder.terra.money/columbus-5/address/terra13s4gwzxv6dycfctvddfuy6r3zm7d6zklynzzj5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burning</a> 2.63 million LUNC and Luna Station 88 burning 4.78 million LUNC.</p>
<p>Luna Station 88 postponed its regular burn of one-third of collected commissions for a week as the community favored passing Proposal 11242. It reduces the re-minting of LUNC after burn and set the seigniorage reward policy to zero.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Terra Rebels developer Duncan burned 6 million LUNC tokens in two transactions. Core developers Edward Kim, Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson, and Duncan were among the members of the developer group Terra Rebels that left due to funding disputes with the team.</p>
<p>The Terra Classic community recently <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-community-passes-two-crucial-proposals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed two crucial proposals</a> to increase the LUNC burn rate. While Proposal 11242 and Proposal 11243 effectively increased the burn rate, they reduced contributions to the community pool.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-increase-with-this-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TFL&#8217;s interchain Station</a> added support for LUNC. The Station currently supports LUNA, LUNC, Osmosis, Juno, Kujira, Carbon, HuaHua, and Cresent chains.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Price Fails to Build Momentum</h2>
<p>Terra Classic witnessed a massive rally in the starting week of January. However, it failed to hold on to the rally and fell below $0.00015.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the LUNC price is trading at $0.000165. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000158 and $0.000179, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 50% in the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest among traders.</p>

The Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency trading platform known as Bitzlato is the subject of this investigation. The announcement comes at a time when the cryptocurrency industry is experiencing significant upheaval, particularly in relation to the demise of the formerly dominant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>.</p>
<h2>DOJ Seizes Bitzlato Exchange</h2>
<p>According to Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, the Hong Kong-based platform Bitzlato has been disrupted by U.S. authorities, and the platform&#8217;s founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, has been arrested. This brings an end to the platform&#8217;s persistent catering to known criminal activity linked to Russia. Monaco was outlining coordinated enforcement actions that also included the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Treasury Department. Monaco characterized the operation as the most significant one taken to date against a crypto criminal network.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To anyone who still believes that they can hide from the law by using cryptocurrency, this prosecution should put that illusion to rest.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/"><em>Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</em></a></p>
<p>The government claimed that BitZlato provided power to darknet marketplaces and assisted in the process of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> assaults, which amounted to over 700 million dollars in unlawful transactions, both directly and indirectly, between the years 2018 &amp; 2022. Similar to the case with the majority of larger exchanges, the fact that the platform accepted very little in the way of personally identifying information from its users made it appealing to criminals.</p>
<h2>AML Laws Violated</h2>
<p>Anatoly Legkodymov, the Russian kingpin was taken into custody on Tuesday evening in Miami on allegations that he ran a money transmission company which did not comply with <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">anti-money laundering laws</a> and transported illegal funds. On Wednesday afternoon, the 40-year-old crypto mogul, who currently resides in China will be brought before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to face the criminal charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you break our laws from China or Europe, or abuse our financial system from a tropical island, you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom&#8221;, said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.justice.gov/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> came on Wednesday noon, led by the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Lisa Monaco, who presided over a press conference along with the Associate Deputy Director of the FBI Brian Turner, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-department-of-justice/">Department of Justice&#8217;s</a> criminal division, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Ripple XRP Lawsuit News: Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse came out heavily in criticism against the SEC yet again on Wednesday.

While it is still not clear as to when the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/">XRP vs SEC lawsuit</a> judgement will be out, Garlinghouse criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) behavior in the lawsuit. Speaking on the occasion of the World Economic Forum annual meeting, the Ripple CEO touched about the timeline for the lawsuit closure. He said the judgement could be out in the space of a few months.</p>

<p>Earlier, Garlinghouse said there was zero chance that both parties could reach a settlement due to fundamental differences. Any settlement would depend on whether the SEC recognizes XRP as not a security, he added. The XRP case is revolved around the SEC&#8217;s allegation that Ripple sale of XRP represented sales of unregistered securities. However, Ripple always contested that view and kept fighting the argument.</p>
<h2>&#8216;SEC Behavior Embarassing&#8217;</h2>
<p>Speaking to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppMKgcJ_vY8" rel="nofollow">CNBC</a>, the Ripple CEO described SEC&#8217;s behavior while handling the XRP case as embarrassing as a U.S. citizen. Garlinghouse said he was expecting that the judge overseeing the XRP lawsuit would come out with the judgement in 2023 itself. In fact, he is optimistic of the judgement to be out in the space of months. The case is now fully filed and fully briefed in front of the judge, and we expect a decision certainly in 2023, he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s behavior while handling the XRP case was embarrassing as a U.S. citizen. There are some of the things you have seen happen and you are like you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The XRP price recovered significantly in 2023. As of writing, the XRP price stands at $0.37543, down 3.48% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>

On Wednesday, the company&#8217;s founder, Joseph Lubin, announced on his blog that 97 employees would be let off, which represents 11% of the total human resources.</p>
<h2>Consensys Layoffs Support Staff</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/18/ethereum-builder-consensys-axes-100-staff-founder-lubin-says-balance-sheet-very-solid/" rel="nofollow">reports</a>, the layoffs are not targeting any employees who work directly on the products themselves; rather, they are focusing on those who are employed in support roles &#8212; whose workloads have decreased as a result of the recent market slowdown. The official announcement further states that departing workers of ConsenSys would be offered substantial severance compensation based on their length of service; as well as an extended option exercise window that will range from 12 to 36 months. In addition to this, tailored assistance from an outside placement agency and the extension of healthcare coverage in applicable jurisdictions will be provided, according to the official announcement.</p>
<p>Lubin was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we need to make the extremely difficult decision to streamline some of ConsenSys’ teams to adjust to challenging and uncertain market conditions. This decision will impact a total of 97 employees, which represents 11% of ConsenSys’ total workforce.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Lubin Puts Blame On CeFi</h2>
<p>Lubin said that the struggles of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> industry are the result of the end of a hype cycle and, in particular, so-called <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cefi/">&#8220;CeFi&#8221;</a> (centralized finance) companies. Furthermore, Lubin opines that the companies operating under the veil of cryptocurrency, in reality, lack the core ethos of decentralization and its operations. While speaking about the recent failures of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a>, Lubin claims that organizations such as Voyager and Celsius pursued profits in an irresponsible manner, often burning their customers in the process &#8212; which finally led to their demise.</p>

<p>ConsenSys, which is currently headquartered in New York City and has approximately 900 employees, is just one of the many crypto businesses that have been forced to lay off staff as a result of the grinding <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a> that has been affecting the industry since April. Till now, an estimated 27,000 jobs have been lost across the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

This rejection hints at the exhausted bullish momentum, which could encourage a minor pullback in the near term. Here’s what you can expect if Ethereum starts falling in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential correction could tumble the ETH price by 5-10%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rounding bottom pattern may eventually lead the ETH price to $1660</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $7.4 Billion, indicating a 5.5% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/R1dKjIng.png" alt="Ethereum Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a> and the ongoing recovery in the crypto market, the Ethereum price witnessed a parabolic rally within the last three weeks. This bull run surged the ETH price 35.6% since January 1st, where it currently trades at $1597.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the increasing volume activity and breakout from multiple resistance levels indicate a high momentum recovery. The last resistance the Ethereum price breached was the $1500 psychological level, offering buyers suitable support to boost further growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the altcoin hovers above the breached resistances, the daily candle shows multiple higher price rejections suggesting the exhausted bullish momentum. These rejection signs hint the altcoin could witness a minor correction before resuming the prevailing uptrend. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, this potential correction will be healthy for the Ethereum coin as it experienced a sharp rally in a relatively short period. Moreover, a minor correction to retest the breached levels will determine whether the ETH price can sustain higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential pullback could revisit the $1500 or $1420 support to replenish the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, in response to the rounding bottom pattern, the  Ethereum coin price is expected to drive a sustained rally to the $1660 neckline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line maintain a significant gap between them, indicating the sustaining buying pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the recently breached 200-day EMA wavering around the $1500 mark increase the support strength on this level. Moreover, the 20-day EMA at $1400 does the same job.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1598</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1660  and $1800</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1500 and $1420</span></li>

In spite of the fact that some market participants may still be skeptical, there is a chance that ETH may surge significantly based on the technical factors currently favoring the second-largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> by market cap.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Key Price Levels</h2>
<p>The ETH price has delivered nine consecutive days of green daily candles, demonstrating significant market vigor. Since ETH had its most recent halt at around $1,197, the newly discovered uptrend has recovered 25% of the market value that investors had lost. However, according to a well-known crypto analyst Crypto Tony, the price range of $2,250 &#8211; $2,500 determines a key level for ETH. Breaching these price levels will validate a price bottom for further uptrend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135916 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18201035/FmwS7OOaUAIUsl_-1.jpeg" alt="Ethereum (ETH) price" width="2284" height="1052" /></p>
<p>He goes on to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTony__/status/1615692355234840577" rel="nofollow">say</a> that the decline in the price of Ethereum will greatly depend on the state of the stock market and global economics for the remainder of this year. Additionally, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a>, an indicator that is used to evaluate the underlying power of market participants, demonstrates that the price of ETH is in severely overbought conditions near the level of 90. In January 2021, when Ethereum momentarily marked $1,300 and established a new all-time high, the RSI read 90 for the last time.</p>
<h2>Factors Driving ETH Price</h2>
<p>On Monday, the number of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> addresses that have a balance greater than zero reached a new all-time high of 92.5 million, breaking the previous record set on Friday. It does not appear that the bear market of 2022, which ended in the closure of one of the world&#8217;s formerly largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> in November, had any effect on the growth in the number of addresses that have a balance greater than zero.</p>

<p>In addition, according to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/AlchemyPlatform/status/1615351175179808769" rel="nofollow">report</a> recently published by the blockchain software development firm Alchemy, the number of smart contracts implemented on the Ethereum mainnet increased by an astounding 300% in 2022. And, in spite of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a> of 2022, smart contract deployment growth essentially matched the rate of growth experienced in 2021. At the end of Q4 2022, 4.6 million smart contracts were active on the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>, according to the research.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135918 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18204524/Screenshot-2023-01-18-204505.png" alt="Ethereum (ETH) price" width="1266" height="706" /></p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,598. This represents an increase of 0.96% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 19.76% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape&#8217;s crypto market tracker.</p>

<p>Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam of Singapore and Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the Governing Council of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ecb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Central Bank</a>, both stressed the necessity of crypto regulation during a panel discussion on the difficulties facing banks. UBS Group AG Chairman Colm Kelleher echoed their points.</p>
<p>Regulators had &#8220;taken their eye off the ball with respect to the non-banking industry,&#8221; according to Kelleher. He started the discussion on digital assets.</p>
<h2>Demand for regulating non-banking sector</h2>
<p>Villeroy reacted, citing recent instances of financial instability such as the performance of money market funds, UK pension funds affected by liability-driven investments, and the demise of Sam&#8217;s Club, saying that the banks are the most challenging in today’s times.</p>
<p>Villeroy siad that they all share the trait of being connected to institutions other than banks and they fall short in this aspect. He added the changing landscape as the reason and called for a quick action to enact non-bank regulation, starting with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Some things were extremely evident to Tharman, for example, whether it&#8217;s regular finance or cryptocurrency, needs to regulated for things like money laundering.</p>

<h2>Kelleher claims blockchain as “unstoppable”</h2>
<p>Kelleher reaffirmed a sentiment that has been expressed frequently by executives of both traditional banking institutions and cryptocurrency businesses. Regarding certain UBS clients&#8217; desire to invest in digital tokens, he added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are searching for a regulatory structure that will allow us to accommodate it for our clients.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While sounding a note of caution about the current challenge of assuring compliance with laws and policies surrounding KYC (know-your-customer) standards and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/aml-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AML (anti-money laundering)</a> rules, he was bullish about the underlying technology of the blockchain and characterised it as unstoppable.</p>
<p>CEO of Citigroup, Jane Fraser interrupted saying that it was critical to take a step back. He said rather than discussing cryptocurrency they should discuss on other issues, claiming it as something that is potentially less new and shiny. Thus, the discussion for crypto ended.</p>

However, ethereum stakers won&#8217;t be able to withdraw right away. There will be a long complicated process for stakers before they can withdraw their stakes. <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-ethereum-staking-how-does-it-work-pros-and-cons-of-ethereum-staking/">Ethereum staking</a> requires a validator to put up 32 ETH in order to begin validating transactions.</p>
<p>A reseracher <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WestieCapital/status/1613645213792366595?s=20&amp;t=5J2_JTS2O_mzrodiPelz1g" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that Ethereum is dynamic when it comes to withdrawals of staking, unlike other PoS networks like Cosmos, where the period of stakers is fixed at 21.</p>
<h2>Withdrawal process for validators</h2>
<p>Validators in Ethereum must go through two stages, i.e., the exit queue and the withdrawal period.</p>
<p>The exit queue is defined by a few variables. As the total number of validators set the minimum churn limit at 4, and the churn limit quotient at 2^16 (65,536).</p>
<p>Thereafter, we need to use the variables to calculate the churn limit. The number of validators able to exit the set every epoch (32 blocks).</p>
<p>The churn limit is then calculated as the total number of validators divided by the churn limit quotient. Then round down to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>Remember that as the number of validators increases, it increases the churn limit as well.</p>
<h2>Ethereum crosses 500,000 validators</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dune.com/hildobby/ETH2-Deposits" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dune.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ethereum recently hits 500,000 validators before the completion of its scheduled Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade. Ethereum validator secures a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain to validate network transactions and prevent double-spending errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use validator software in Ethereum, one should be able to stake an initial investment, which is 32ETH, approx. $50,000, as per its current value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This validator milestone comes just before the launch of the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade scheduled for March 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, around 70% of the Ethereum stakers are at a loss ETH inaccessible. The development of Shanghai Upgrade will allow ETH stakes to access their ETH, and they can decide whether to hold the coin until it is back to profit or should sell it at a loss.</span></p>
