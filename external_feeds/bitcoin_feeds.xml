Bankrate&#8217;s survey of economists firmly indicates that the chances of a recession taking place in the U.S. are greater than the chances of it not happening.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bankrate Survey: 3-in-5 Chance of U.S. Recession in Next Year</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to economists <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/economic-indicator-survey-recession-risks-july-2023/#:~:text=Experts%20put%20the%20odds%20of%20a%20recession%20by%20July%202024,by%20the%20end%20of%202023">surveyed</a> by Bankrate, the probability of a recession occurring in the U.S. is significant. The survey, published on July 12, 2023, reveals that Bankrate&#8217;s experts estimate a 59% chance of a recession taking place by July 2024. Bankrate states that the expert forecasts “suggest a downturn is more probable than not.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Illustrating those odds even more, most respondents (78 percent) indicated that the percentage chance of a recession was greater than 1-in-2, while 28 percent said the odds were 70 percent or higher,” Bankrate’s Sarah Foster writes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bankrate&#8217;s most recent poll is not the sole survey indicating experts&#8217; belief in an impending recession in the United States. ITR Economics <a href="https://blog.itreconomics.com/blog/how-bad-will-2024-recession-be">forecasts</a> a macroeconomic recession commencing in late 2023 and extending throughout 2024. HSBC Asset Management <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/27/hsbc-global-economies-are-out-of-sync-2024-will-be-a-year-of-contraction.html">predicts</a> a downturn for the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2023, followed by a &#8220;year of contraction and a European recession in 2024&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Bankrate survey underscores numerous factors that contribute to the prediction of an impending recession. These factors include a substantial increase in interest rates, strict monetary policy, bank failures, inverted bond yields, and other vulnerabilities in the global economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">“Given the aggressive tightening by the Fed, the most likely outcome is a recession,” stated Abbey Omodunbi, senior economist at PNC Financial Services, in an interview with Bankrate.</p>

<p>Alongside Bankrate&#8217;s poll, Statista&#8217;s <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1239080/us-monthly-projected-recession-probability/">projections</a> reveal a forecasted probability of 70.85% that the United States will experience another economic recession by May 2024. Scott Anderson, the chief economist and executive vice president at Bank of the West, believes that a downturn is probable this year.</p>
<p>“We are still on the path toward at least a mild downturn in the U.S. economy around the end of the year,” Anderson told Bankrate.</p>

Ripple case. Emphasizing that the landmark ruling is &#x201C;a huge win&#x201D; for the crypto firm, he stressed that &#x201C;as a matter of law &#x2013; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security.&#x201D; In addition, he noted that crypto sales on exchanges are also not securities.</strong></p>
<h2>Ripple Lawyer on SEC v Ripple Case Ruling</h2>
<p>Ripple Labs&#x2019; chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, explained the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruling</a> in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case in a series of tweets on Thursday. The lawyer wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>A huge win today &#x2014; as a matter of law &#x2014; <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security. Also a matter of law &#x2014; sales on exchanges are not securities. Sales by executives are not securities. Other <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> distributions &#x2014; to developers, to charities, to employees are not securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;The only thing the court found constitutes an investment contract is past direct <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> sales to institutional clients. There will be further court proceedings only on these institutional sales per the court&#x2019;s order,&#x201D; Alderoty added. The Ripple chief legal officer stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>The judge&#x2019;s decision affirms so much of what this industry is fighting for, and shows that the SEC does not have unbounded jurisdiction over crypto &#x2026; Maybe we can now start a rational conversation about crypto regulation in this country.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement to Fox Business regarding the ruling, the SEC <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1679562215999918081">wrote</a>: &#x201C;We are pleased that the court found that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> tokens were offered and sold by Ripple as investment contracts in violation of the securities laws in certain circumstances. The court agreed with the SEC that the Howey test governs the securities analysis of crypto transactions and rejected Ripple&#x2019;s made-up test as to what constitutes an investment contract, instead emphasizing that Howey and subsequent cases have held that a variety of tangible and intangible assets can serve as the subject of an investment contract. Further, the court rejected Ripple&#x2019;s fair notice argument, noting that the Howey test is clear and that claiming ignorance is not a defense to violating the securities laws. We&#x2019;ll continue to review the decision.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Many people slammed the statement by the SEC regarding the ruling. Paradigm&#x2019;s chief legal officer, Katie Biber, tweeted: &#x201C;SEC statement on Ripple has vibes of young campaign hack spinning on bad facts, vs powerful government agency expected to tell the truth. Do better.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Alderoty concurred with Biber, tweeting in response: &#x201C;Could not agree more with Katie Biber. Pathetic &#x2018;statement&#x2019; coming from the SEC today. Take the loss. You earned it.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Congressman <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPMajorityWhip/status/1679525171479150592">Tom Emmer</a> (R-MN), who has been a vocal advocate for clear crypto regulations, tweeted Thursday following the ruling:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ripple case is a monumental development in establishing that a token is separate and distinct from an investment contract it may or may not be part of. Now, let&#x2019;s make it law.</p></blockquote>

Along with providing a projected price list of 40 crypto assets, Claude also detailed the reasoning behind the forecasts.</strong></p>
<h2>An AI Chatbot&#x2019;s Comprehensive Crypto Predictions for 2024</h2>
<p>The AI firm Anthropic recently unveiled its second iteration of <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/index/introducing-claude">Claude</a>, rivaling the likes of Google&#x2019;s Bard and Openai&#x2019;s Chatgpt 4. Claude can handle substantial data, consuming nearly 75,000 words via Anthropic&#x2019;s large language model. Therefore, our news desk put Claude to the test, supplying it with the top 40 cryptocurrency assets by market capitalization, along with the assets&#x2019; one-hour, 24-hour, and seven-day performance and daily volumes in a single prompt.</p>
<p>Before supplying Claude with the information, we prompted the chatbot with a statement: &#x201C;I am going to provide you data on the top 40 cryptocurrency assets. I want you to act as a cryptocurrency expert and also use all the historical data you know to predict the prices of all 40 cryptocurrency assets by Jan. 1, 2024. Do you understand?&#x201D; Claude confirmed its understanding, and we proceeded to feed it the aforementioned data. For the top 40 coins, Claude&#x2019;s predictions are as follows:</p>

<h2>&#x2018;A Brief Rationale&#x2019; for Why Claude Projected Price Increases</h2>
<p>We subsequently requested Claude explain why it predicted an increase in all the coins&#x2019; value by Jan. 1, 2024. &#x201C;Here is a brief rationale for why I projected price increases for almost all the cryptocurrencies,&#x201D; Claude replied. &#x201C;Bitcoin/Ethereum: The continued institutional adoption and scarcity should drive prices upward. Altcoins: Continuous innovation and development in blockchain technology and decentralized finance will boost utility and demand. Memecoins: Speculation and community sentiment can eclipse fundamentals.&#x201D; The chatbot added:</p>
<blockquote><p>In summary, cryptocurrency prices tend to be speculative and follow cycles of hype and growth in underlying blockchain technologies/applications. This can justify longer-term price rises.</p></blockquote>
<p>Moreover, we expanded the test, inquiring about Claude&#x2019;s thoughts on its predictions for the top six crypto assets in the list, excluding stablecoins. &#x201C;Here is a brief explanation for the price predictions of the top six cryptocurrencies, apart from stablecoins,&#x201D; Claude stated. &#x201C;I predicted that bitcoin would reach $45,000 by January 2024 due to its ongoing adoption as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. As the first and most prominent cryptocurrency, bitcoin maintains advantages in widespread name recognition and liquidity. Its deflationary issuance schedule also lends support.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Claude continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>For ether, I estimated a price of $3,500 driven by Ethereum&#x2019;s dominance in blockchain applications like decentralized finance and NFTs. Upgrades like the merge to proof-of-stake also boosted <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s utility. While competition is mounting, the Ethereum network enjoys first mover advantage and one of the largest developer communities in crypto. The prices for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> derive from my expectation that innovation on those platforms will lead to increased utility and demand growth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Like our <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/30k-to-50k-6-ai-powered-chatbots-attempt-to-predict-bitcoins-price-by-the-years-end/">previous AI tests</a>, Claude did caution that &#x201C;predicting specifics is nearly impossible,&#x201D; citing multiple reasons why the crypto economy could be volatile and not increase in value by next year. The chatbot stated that government regulations &#x201C;could significantly affect prices&#x201D; both negatively and positively. Claude also pointed out that &#x201C;macroeconomic trends like inflation, interest rates, and equity markets can influence investor appetite for cryptocurrency.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Crypto prices tend to be volatile and follow cycles of boom and bust. After a prolonged downturn in 2022, a price recovery could occur &#x2013; but the timing and magnitude are uncertain,&#x201D; Claude concluded.</p>

Ripple Labs case. Several other crypto exchanges have also resumed trading of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>. </strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchanges Bring Back <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> Trading</h2>
<p>Following the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">landmark ruling</a> in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple Labs case regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, multiple cryptocurrency exchanges have relisted the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase tweeted Thursday afternoon:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our XRP-USD trading pair is now in full-trading mode on Coinbase Exchange, Coinbase Pro, and Advanced Trade. Limit, market, and stop orders are all now available.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coinbase explained earlier: &#x201C;Once sufficient supply of this asset is established trading on our XRP-USD, XRP-<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>, and XRP-EUR trading pairs will launch in phases. Support for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Crypto exchange <a href="https://blog.kraken.com/trading-for-ripple-xrp-starts-now-for-the-usa">Kraken</a> has also made <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> trading available for U.S. customers. Meanwhile, Gemini is considering making <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> available on its trading platform. The crypto exchange tweeted Thursday: &#x201C;Given today&#x2019;s ruling that the sale of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> on exchanges is not a security, Gemini is exploring the listing of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> for both spot and derivatives trading.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Bitstamp has already relisted <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>, tweeting: &#x201C;Welcome back <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a>! <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> trading is available in the U.S. now for our U.S. customers. You can once again buy, sell, or trade <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> on Bitstamp USA.&#x201D; The trading platform wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Good news for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> traders &#x2014; we have resumed trading for the digital asset for our U.S. customers! Bitstamp was one of the first exchanges to list <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> in 2017, and we are now one of the first exchanges to resume trading in the U.S.</p></blockquote>

<p>Several other crypto trading platforms have either relisted <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> or are in the process of doing so, including Trust Capital and Bybit.</p>
<p>Lawyer Jake Chervinsky tweeted earlier Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>My sense is U.S. crypto exchanges should feel good about relisting <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> skyrocketed after the ruling. At the time of writing, the crypto is trading at $0.81, up more than 72% over the past few hours. With a market capitalization of $43 billion, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> is now the fourth largest cryptocurrency, trailing only behind bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>), ether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>), and tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>).</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you think all crypto exchanges will relist <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank">XRP</a> for U.S. customers? Let us know in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

<h2>FTC’s Settlement to Be ‘Suspended to Permit Celsius to Return Its Remaining Assets to Consumers in Bankruptcy Proceedings’</h2>
<p>The now-defunct crypto lender Celsius has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/07/ftc-reaches-settlement-crypto-platform-celsius-network-charges-former-executives-duping-consumers">incurred a fine</a> from the FTC for allegedly hoodwinking investors and “squandering billions in user deposits.” The company contended that it possessed &#8220;more than enough&#8221; assets to safeguard customer deposits, but according to the FTC, this was a spurious claim. The platform and its affiliated entities are indefinitely barred from managing customer assets, and three executives have been charged.</p>
<p>Per the FTC, the case against Alexander Mashinsky, former CEO and co-founder of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/token-sale-ahead-celsius-to-convert-customer-altcoins-to-btc-and-eth/">Celsius</a>, along with his fellow co-founders Shlomi Daniel Leon and Hanoch &#8220;Nuke&#8221; Goldstein, will advance in federal court since they haven&#8217;t reached a settlement. The FTC disclosed that these individuals, who held pivotal positions in the company, have opted not to settle the matter extrajudicially.</p>
<p>“Celsius touted a new business model but engaged in an old-fashioned swindle,” Samuel Levine, the director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection stated. “Today’s action banning Celsius from handling people’s money and holding its executives accountable should make clear that emerging technologies are not above the law.”</p>

<p>The FTC&#8217;s complaint against Celsius succeeds the SEC lawsuit lodged against the bankrupt crypto lender. “Defendants made numerous false and misleading statements to induce investors to purchase CEL and invest in the Earn Interest Program,” the SEC lawsuit issued an hour before the FTC press release states. In this specific litigation with the U.S. securities watchdog, Celsius is named alongside former CEO Mashinsky.</p>

The suit, filed Thursday, also names former CEO Alexander &#8220;Alex&#8221; Mashinsky as a defendant. Both he and the company stand accused of falsely promising investors a safe investment with high returns.</strong></p>
<h2>Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius Accused by SEC of Misleading Investors</h2>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has targeted the bankrupt cryptocurrency lender, Celsius, in a lawsuit filed in New York. The SEC accuses Celsius and its former CEO of making fraudulent promises through its &#8220;Earn Interest Program.&#8221; According to the SEC, Celsius “misled investors about the financial success of Celsius’s business.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597603 size-full" title="SEC Sues Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius, Alleges Misrepresentation of Customer Count and Risky Practices" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/celssd34.jpg" alt="SEC Sues Bankrupt Crypto Lender Celsius, Alleges Misrepresentation of Customer Count and Risky Practices" width="1280" height="550" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/celssd34-300x129.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/celssd34-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/celssd34-768x330.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/celssd34.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The SEC contends that in June 2022, the defendants&#8217; complex scheme began to collapse, leaving investors unable to withdraw billions of dollars in cryptocurrency assets from Celsius&#8217;s online platform. “Defendants made numerous false and misleading statements to induce investors to purchase CEL and invest in the Earn Interest Program,” the SEC lawsuit reveals.</p>

<p>The lawsuit against Celsius follows similar actions targeting Binance and Coinbase. The SEC also disclosed that it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-132">settled charges</a> against RSE Markets Inc. on July 12 for operating as an unregistered exchange. The court filing alleges that Celsius engaged in risky trading practices and made uncollateralized loans in an attempt to generate the necessary revenue, thereby putting the entire Celsius enterprise at significant risk. The SEC complaint states:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Celsius executives] misrepresented Celsius’s financial success to make the company appear more profitable and stable than it was.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC lawsuit arrives as Celsius <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-lender-celsius-to-be-acquired-by-novawulf-exiting-chapter-11/">nears</a> the conclusion of its Chapter 11 process. The company&#8217;s mining division is undergoing restructuring, and liquidators have disclosed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/token-sale-ahead-celsius-to-convert-customer-altcoins-to-btc-and-eth/">plans to sell</a> specific altcoins on the open market. The SEC also alleges that Celsius misrepresented its customer count, claiming to have 1 million clients when, in fact, the firm had 500,000 registered customers, many of whom were inactive.</p>

The order states that the court cannot conclude that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is a security under the law insofar as &#x201C;programmatic sales&#x201D; are concerned. However, institutional sales are a different matter.</strong></p>
<h2>Uncertainty Remains: Judge Grants Partial Summary Judgment in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> Security Case</h2>
<p>The judge presiding over the SEC lawsuit against Ripple Labs and executives Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse has <a href="https://www.crypto-law.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023.07.13-Order.pdf">detailed</a> that the court cannot classify <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> as a security.</p>
<p>The order details that the plain words of the Howey test make it clear, but as for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> the &#x201C;subject of a contract, transaction, or scheme is not necessarily a security on its face.&#x201D; The judge also granted in part and denied in part the SEC and Ripple Labs&#x2019; summary judgments.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Accordingly, the SEC&#x2019;s motion for summary judgment on the aiding and abetting claim against Larsen and Garlinghouse is denied,&#x201D; the order from judge Torres details. The order states that the court cannot conclude that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is a security as a matter of law, and that there are genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is a security.</p>
<p>The court also noted that the Howey test must be applied to the specific context of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> transactions, and that the parties have presented conflicting evidence on the relevant factors. The judge acknowledged the distinction between programmatic sales and institutional sales. The judge&#x2019;s ruling stated that while institutional sales could be deemed security transactions, programmatic sales and distributions to employees fell outside that classification.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Since 2017, Ripple&#x2019;s Programmatic Sales represented less than 1% of the global <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> trading volume,&#x201D; the order states. &#x201C;Therefore, the vast majority of individuals who purchased <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> from digital asset exchanges did not invest their money in Ripple at all. An Institutional Buyer knowingly purchased <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> directly from Ripple pursuant to a contract, but the economic reality is that a Programmatic Buyer stood in the same shoes as a secondary market purchaser who did not know to whom or what it was paying its money.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Torres&#x2019;s order added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore, having considered the economic reality and totality of circumstances, the court concludes that Ripple&#x2019;s Programmatic Sales of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> did not constitute the offer and sale of investment contracts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Following the court&#x2019;s judgement, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> supporters <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&src=trend_click&vertical=trends">celebrated</a> the decision and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s price jumped nearly <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP/">30% higher</a> against the U.S. dollar after the announcement. While Torres judgement was celebrated, the court granted and denied the parties&#x2019; cross-motions for summary judgment because there were genuine disputes of material fact regarding whether <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is a security.</p>
<p>The court announced that it will issue a separate order at a later date to set a trial date and related pre-trial deadlines. While <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> supporters celebrate, this case is likely to continue.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts on the judge&#x2019;s ruling regarding <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>&#x2019;s security classification?

If approved, MATIC will be replaced with the new token that will function on all Polygon networks. Litecoin also rallied, hitting a one-month high.</strong></p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) jumped to a multi-week high on Thursday, as traders reacted to the news that some of the project&#x2019;s founders have proposed replacing the network&#x2019;s MATIC token.</p>
<p>If successful, POL will be the new official token of Polygon, and this news has been boosting the price of MATIC/USD to a peak of $0.7668 today.</p>
<p>As a result of this, MATIC moved to its highest point since June 9, when price reached a high at $0.7890.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the surge in price came after the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 60.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 62.34, with the next visible point of resistance at the 70.00 level.</p>
<p>In the event this ceiling is hit, MATIC will likely be trading above $0.8000.</p>

<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) also surged higher in today&#x2019;s session, as traders pushed price above the $100.00 mark.</p>
<p>Following a low of $94.79 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak at $101.45 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Overall, this is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $105.95.</p>

<p>The jump comes after bulls rebounded following a breakout below a support point at $95.00, with the RSI hitting a floor of its own at 53.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is at a reading of 57.88, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> continuing to record higher highs as the day progresses.</p>
<p>A ceiling of $102.00 is now the obvious target, and should the price push past this point, there is a good chance <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> hits $105.00 in the coming days.</p>

<h2>BIS Report: ‘Crypto Has So Far Failed to Harness Innovation to the Benefit of Society’</h2>
<p>In its latest report, the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) claims that cryptocurrencies in their present form are not suited to work with the global economy. BIS researchers stress that while the industry “operates under the banner of decentralization,” in practice “centralized intermediaries have played a key role in channeling funds into the crypto universe and intermediating within it.”</p>
<p>The BIS report details that the splintered landscape of the crypto sector sharply counters the unifying, ripple-like impact observed in conventional networks. The crypto industry, leaning heavily on decentralized validation methods, fosters a fragmentation that nullifies the function of money as a synchronizing tool, thus rendering crypto an ill-fit for a monetary system, BIS researchers argue. The BIS report adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto proponents argue that decentralisation guarantees the safety of the system. However, there is often a de facto concentration of decision-making power. While centralisation is not a structural flaw per se, it introduces new risks and invalidates arguments made by proponents of crypto and defi that stress its purportedly decentralised nature.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a brisk span of little more than a decade, crypto has vaulted from a peripheral interest to an influential player in the mainstream financial arena, the report notes. The industry has drawn the attention of millions of everyday consumers and an escalating number of institutional investors, who&#8217;ve gravitated towards the crypto sector in recent years. The report does assert that crypto assets do offer bona fide innovation, such as programmability and composability.</p>

<p>The banking organization acknowledges that the capabilities of cryptocurrencies offer a level of automation in financial transaction sequences and facilitate their fluid integration. Paired with the concept of tokenization, these attributes could potentially minimize the requirement for manual oversight that presently hampers transaction speed and amplifies costs, the BIS report submitted to the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors explains.</p>
<p>“That said, crypto has so far failed to harness innovation to the benefit of society,” the BIS report concludes. “Crypto remains largely self-referential and does not finance real economic activity. It suffers from inherent shortcomings related to stability and efficiency, as well as accountability and integrity. These structural flaws result from the underlying economics of incentives rather than technological limitations.”</p>

Market volatility has risen following yesterday&#x2019;s U.S. inflation report, which dropped to a two-year low. Ethereum was marginally lower, slipping below $1,900.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) consolidated below the $31,000 level in today&#x2019;s session, as traders continued to digest the latest inflation report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $30,228.84 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, a day after peaking at $30,959.97.</p>
<p>The drop came as bulls were unable to sustain a breakout above a key resistance level at the $30,800 zone.</p>

<p>From the chart, this coincided with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failing to break out of its own ceiling at 61.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 59.30, with a floor of 55.00 a possible target should momentum continue to slip.</p>
<p>Should this occur, there is a good chance that bitcoin will move below $30,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>After a brief stint above $1,900, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved lower on Thursday, with a moving average crossover close to occurring.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,901.15 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom at $1,864.50 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, this drop came as ethereum fell below a recent resistance level of $1,890, and towards a floor at $1,850.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this was due to the RSI failing to move past a ceiling at 53.00. It is currently hovering at 52.56.</p>
<p>Overall, momentum seems to be bearish, with the 10-day (red) moving average likely to race past the 25-day (blue) trend line momentarily.</p>
<p>In the event this takes place, bears could target exits at $1,795.</p>
