			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The EU Parliament approved a new crypto licensing regime (MiCA) and a separate set of rules governing the transfer of funds. </p>
<p>Lawmakers in the European Union (EU) recently voted in favour of the region&rsquo;s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets regulation (MiCA), making it the first major jurisdiction to introduce a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework. The latest vote clears the way for MiCA to take effect in 2024.</p>
<p>MiCA will be enacted to reduce the risks for consumers purchasing crypto assets. The rules mean crypto asset providers may become liable should they lose investors&rsquo; funds.</p>
<p>The EU Parliament said in a statement that MiCA would impose several requirements on crypto platforms, token issuers and traders around the transparency, disclosure, authorization and supervision of crypto transactions.</p>
<p>MiCA also introduces rules regarding stablecoins. For instance, Tether (USDT) and Circle&rsquo;s USDC will be required to maintain a sufficient reserve should a mass withdrawal occur.</p>
<p>The regulation further grants powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to ban and restrict crypto platforms they deem not adequately protecting investors or threatening financial stability or market integrity. MiCA finally addresses crypto&rsquo;s environmental concerns by compelling firms to disclose their energy consumption. &nbsp;</p>
EU Parliament Votes in Favour of &lsquo;Transfer of Funds&rsquo; Regulation
<p>In the same session, lawmakers also approved a separate law known as the Transfer of Funds regulation to reduce the anonymity involved in transferring cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The Transfer of Funds regulation requires crypto operators to screen, record, and communicate information on the sender and recipient to help the fight against money laundering, CNBC reports.</p>
<p>The rule also governs transfers between exchanges and &ldquo;self-hosted&rdquo; wallets. Any self-hosted wallet owned by individuals must be reported if the amount exceeds the 1,000-euro threshold.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the world of crypto continues to evolve, investors are faced with increasing options when selecting which protocols to invest in. Investors need to pick top protocols for top-tier returns. Avalanche (AVAX), Tron (TRX), and Uwerx all offer unique advantages and have the potential to provide investors with market-leading returns in 2023.</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX)Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the original alternative Layer-1 blockchains. Avalanche (AVAX) launched in 2020 and quickly established itself as a competitor to Ethereum (ETH). Avalanche (AVAX) provides a unique solution to scalability through its subnets which allow the creation of limitless blockchains all housed within the Avalanche (AVAX) ecosystem. Analysts expect businesses and private enterprises to utilize Avalanche (AVAX) subnets, which will drive increased demand for the Avalanche (AVAX) token in 2023. Popular DeFi trading protocol GMX (GMX) deployed on Avalanche (AVAX) and Arbitrum, choosing only chains with the fastest transaction finality showing the high-grade performance of Avalanche (AVAX).Tron (TRX)Tron (TRX) is another layer one blockchain, and Tron (TRX) has massively outgrown its original use case. Tron (TRX) intended to connect content creators and consumers without the middleman. But Tron&rsquo;s (TRX) designated proof of stake consensus mechanism makes Tron (TRX) one of the fastest and cheapest blockchains in the space. As a result, users, particularly in developing nations, adopted Tron (TRX) and used Tron (TRX) to access stablecoins pegged to the dollar, allowing them to preserve their wealth and avoid inflation. Tron (TRX) has proven a lifeline to millions globally, and analysts expect the Tron (TRX) adoption curve to continue in 2023. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX)Uwerx represents a hidden crypto gem and offers investors a tantalizing opportunity for growth and disruption within the freelancing economy. Uwerx will launch a decentralized platform for the gig economy, the first of its kind, and will disrupt the entire modus operandi currently employed by traditional and conservative freelance marketplaces. Uwerx will leverage smart contracts that will release funds immediately after the pre-agreed conditions are reached. Removing the need for lengthy and expensive escrow services; Uwerx delivers this saving directly to platform users, reducing service fees down to just 1%. Uwerx employs the natural immutability of blockchain technology to provide a superior service that will be more secure and faster, allowing for more natural connections between freelancers and employers. Audited by InterFi Network and SolidProof and with a 25-year liquidity lock after prelaunch, Uwerx signals a long-term commitment to growth and development. Analysts predict that Uwerx could easily become a blue chip in 2023 and experience an enormous rally, with the WERX token appreciating more than 6,300% by the end of the year. </p>
<p>The Best Of The Best: Uwerx (WERX) Presale Experts in the field have consistently pointed to Uwerx's technological edge over the incumbents and Uwerx&rsquo;s possibility to absorb market share at an astounding rate. Uwerx&rsquo;s growth potential is undeniable&mdash;it is tied to the high growth freelance industry, which has seen stability in the greatest volatility and adversity global markets have ever seen. We recommend you get in on the presale action whilst you can to enjoy a 25% purchase bonus and a chance to win $5,000.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Navigating the volatility of the crypto market is a skill that comes with experience. Such experience can be found among seasoned investors who have honed their skills and can spot a gem in the dirt.</p>
<p class="s6">While Sparklo might be dirt when compared to Binance Coin (BNB), investors believe the token has what it takes to hold its own in the bull run. As a result, investors are queuing to get their share of the presale token.</p>
<p class="s8">Binance Coin (BNB) Recent Burn Fails at Providing a Rally</p>
<p class="s6">Binance Coin (BNB) is the native token of the Binance exchange, the world&rsquo;s largest. The exchange&rsquo;s crypto influence means its native token would be one of the largest in the world, ranking 4th, only behind Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT). Binance Coin's (BNB) utility is tied to its being a trading tool on the exchange and being accepted as a payment option by large corporations.</p>
<p class="s6">A notable event that happened with the token in the previous week was the disposal of part of its supply. The exchange completed its 23rd quarterly Binance Coin (BNB) burn, which should play a great part in its bullish run. The total amount of burned Binance Coin (BNB) was over 2 million, worth over $676 million based on its value then.</p>
<p class="s6">However, the Binance Coin (BNB) is yet to have an upward trend, even with the total supply burn, as the token currently trades at $316 at the time of writing. Instead of a pump, the token has rather taken a downtrend, down 2.3% in the last 7 days and 2.6% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="s6">It leaves room to wonder if such an event couldn't positively affect the price, what would? With options available to investors, they are particularly interested in the presale token, Sparklo.</p>
<p class="s6">What is Sparklo? How will it play against the Binance Coin (BNB)</p>
<p class="s6">There has been incessant chatter about Sparklo in the crypto community. The discussion primarily centered around the token&rsquo;s presale, its functionality, and the hype it is generating. After some research, we have reason to believe that investors should be excited about Sparklo&rsquo;spresale after all.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo is currently a presale token worth only $0.015, which is a steal if you ask me, considering the hype and use cases. The token&rsquo;s unique protocol makes it an instant favorite, as it is an investment platform that deals in precious metals like platinum, gold, and silver. Investors can fractionally invest in these physical assets, which they will receive in the form of an NFT. However, the purchase of the complete asset, or NFT, means the precious metal will be physically delivered to the investor.</p>
<p class="s6">In addition, the team recently audited its smart contract successfully, has an ongoing KYC audit, and completely locked the token&rsquo;s liquidity. These are all bullish signs, and as early adopters, investors can see the token&rsquo;s price go as high as 1,000% in the next year.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin looks to be starting the 4th bull run of its short 14 year history. However, will the altcoins follow as they always did in the past?</p>
Bitcoin starts its bull run
<p>After a huge move from a probable bottom, bitcoin topped at just under $31,000 just over a week ago. Since then, it has come down to rest above $27,000. Below are very strong supports, with the strongest of all being at around $25,000 with $20,000 and a rising 200-day daily moving average below that.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s 12% correction so far is really nothing in the grand scheme of things. Bitcoin bull markets are notorious for their 30 to 40% drawdowns, and whether we get one now or later, it will not likely affect the general move to the upside.</p>
Regulation to stunt altcoin growth
<p>However, will the altcoins follow the general upward trend along with bitcoin?</p>
<p>In the past this has always been the case, and those speculating on certain altcoins have done very much better than if they had just held bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very different barrier to this happening this time round might be the extremely negative treatment of cryptocurrencies by the Biden administration and the regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>One could say that bitcoin might also suffer from this, but thus far the SEC has not labelled bitcoin as a security, and it still remains to be seen if the US government can get together with enough overseas governments to perhaps exert sufficient pressure on bitcoin mining so as to slow general adoption.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, given the weakness of the banks and the potential for more failures as the US enters recession, trying to slow bitcoin just might not work as investors flee to an asset that is outside of the economy and unable to be manipulated by governments.</p>
A small band of altcoins could flourish
<p>Altcoins on the other hand are certainly being more openly attacked by the SEC in the US, and by regulatory agencies in several other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t help that the vast majority of altcoins have failed to prove their use cases, although there are certainly some from which incredibly innovative technologies have sprung forth.</p>
<p>When bitcoin moves higher altcoins will normally always follow, although with far stricter and repressive regulations coming into force in different global jurisdictions, it remains to be seen whether more than a small and select group of altcoins will be able to outpace bitcoin this time around.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cosmose AI is partnering with Near to build a payment system that allows users to shop with crypto at low transaction fees.</p>
The KaiKai app
<p>Cosmose AI is a nine-year-old company that uses AI analytics to track in-store foot traffic and engage with shoppers online. Its KaiKai app enables customers to discover retail stores in their vicinity and also includes an online targeting platform.</p>
<p>The KaiKai app will settle payments in its native stablecoin Kai-Ching. Users of the app will be able to use their fiat currencies to purchase Kai-Ching. The app makers hope that they will be able to introduce Kai-Ching back to fiat at a future date.</p>
Vastly reduced fees
<p>Taken from a TechCrunch article, an example of reducing fees with its Near-powered blockchain payment system is given. KaiKai claims to reduce the transaction costs of a user&rsquo;s annual coffee consumption compared to buying it with Stripe or PayPal. The significant reduction in transaction fees could save a coffee drinker as much as $200 a year.</p>
<p>Fees can sometimes be a problem with crypto, and this is particularly apparent on layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum. Transactions on Ethereum can be extremely expensive at times of heavy usage, so cheaper alternative layer 1 blockchains such as Cardano, Pokadot, and Near have emerged.</p>
Mostly Gen-Z use the app
<p>Cosmose and Near are also working on a system that allows users to see how they are being tracked, which includes data like their location, the products they look at, and the length of time they spend in store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kai-Ching has processed over 1 million transactions in the form of payments, refunds, and rewards. According to the founder of Cosmose, Miron Mironiuk, more than 50% of the app&rsquo;s users are Gen-Z, and they are &ldquo;super comfortable&rdquo; with using crypto because they know they &ldquo;own it''.</p>

<p>The KaiKai app will settle payments in its native stablecoin Kai-Ching. Users of the app will be able to use their fiat currencies to purchase Kai-Ching. The app makers hope that they will be able to introduce Kai-Ching back to fiat at a future date.</p>
Vastly reduced fees
<p>Taken from a TechCrunch article, an example of reducing fees with its Near-powered blockchain payment system is given. KaiKai claims to reduce the transaction costs of a user&rsquo;s annual coffee consumption compared to buying it with Stripe or PayPal. The significant reduction in transaction fees could save a coffee drinker as much as $200 a year.</p>
<p>Fees can sometimes be a problem with crypto, and this is particularly apparent on layer 1 blockchains like Ethereum. Transactions on Ethereum can be extremely expensive at times of heavy usage, so cheaper alternative layer 1 blockchains such as Cardano, Pokadot, and Near have emerged.</p>
Mostly Gen-Z use the app
<p>Cosmose and Near are also working on a system that allows users to see how they are being tracked, which includes data like their location, the products they look at, and the length of time they spend in store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kai-Ching has processed over 1 million transactions in the form of payments, refunds, and rewards. According to the founder of Cosmose, Miron Mironiuk, more than 50% of the app&rsquo;s users are Gen-Z, and they are &ldquo;super comfortable&rdquo; with using crypto because they know they &ldquo;own it''.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Terraform Labs co-founder, Kwon Do-hyeong, will appear in a court in Montenegro in connection with charges of attempting to travel using a fake passport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news was broken by the court website in Podgorica, the country&rsquo;s capital.&nbsp;</p>
Do Kwon In Custody&nbsp;
<p>Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon was arrested at the airport in Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, on the 23rd of March. Do Kwon was arrested along with Han Chang-Joon, the chief financial officer of Terraform Labs. Both have been placed under custody in the country. Terraform founder Do Kwon is the subject of a red corner notice from Interpol which requests that authorities apprehend him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Montenegrin police have detained a person suspected of being one of the most wanted fugitives, South Korean citizen Do Kwon, co-founder, and CEO of Singapore-based Terraform Labs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the authorities in Montenegro, Do Kwon and Chang-joon were attempting to travel to Dubai. Both individuals held several identification papers and travel documents under different names and nationalities. Both Do Kwon and Chang-Joon are South Korean nationals.&nbsp;</p>
Do Kwon Deemed A Flight Risk&nbsp;
<p>Following the arrest of Do Kwon, the Montenegrin court announced their indictment on the 21st of April, extending their detention. The court did so because it deemed Do Kwon and Chang-Joon as flight risks. Do Kwon now faces a court hearing scheduled for the 11th of May, facing changes of traveling using a false passport.&nbsp;</p>
The Case Against Do Kwon&nbsp;
<p>Do Kwon is wanted by authorities in the United States of America and South Korea, where he stands accused of a litany of charges, including fraud. All of the charges are related to the collapse of the $40 billion Terra Luna stablecoin and cryptocurrency project. The project suffered a spectacular collapse, dealing a significant blow to the larger crypto ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On his part, Do Kwon has denied all charges against him. Terraform Labs has also stated that the investigation into the collapse of Terra Luna has become incredibly politicized and called the allegations against it baseless. In another development, lawyers representing Do Kwon in the United States of America have petitioned a court in the Southern District of New York to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accusing Do Kwon of fraud involving &ldquo;crypto asset securities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers have asserted that the Terra stablecoin is a currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s assertion of imposing securities regulations over digital assets is illegal.&nbsp;</p>
US And South Korea Both Seek Extradition
<p>Meanwhile, the United States of America, along with South Korea, are both seeking the extradition of Do Kwon. Do Kwon faces multiple charges in both countries. Authorities in South Korea charged Do Kwon with violating its Capital Markets Act. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors in the United States have charged Kwon with two counts each of wire fraud, securities fraud, commodities fraud, and conspiracy.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance Minister of India, said that global consensus is necessary for crypto regulation to be effective. </p>
<p>The Finance Minister of India on Sunday emphasized the need for global consensus regarding regulating cryptocurrencies. FM Sitharaman said collaboration would be necessary to create a global framework for crypto regulation to be effective. She stated:</p>

<p>No one country individually, in a matter of technology-driven, a crypto asset, can effectively control it, because technology doesn&rsquo;t have any borders, it can just pass through.</p>
<p>So the very character of it being technology driven requires all countries to be on board, or else it will not be effective.</p>

<p>However, Minister Sitharaman said this did not mean controlling &ldquo;distributed ledger technology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Economic Times reports Sitharaman said:</p>

<p>The G20, of which India is currently holding the Presidency, it was India&rsquo;s proposal, and it has been taken on board. I&rsquo;m glad that the G20 has kept it in its agenda for this year, the IMF has given a paper on cryptocurrency and the way it can affect macroeconomic stability.</p>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB), which was set up by G20, has agreed to give a report that will also focus on financial stability.</p>

<p>The FM said that India had submitted its proposal on crypto regulation in the G20 agenda and will host a summit of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Group of 20 (G20) in September.</p>
<p>She added:</p>

<p>Their (FSB) report and IMF&rsquo;s report are going to be discussed in July when Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors will meet under the G20, and post that in September, there will be a summit of Prime Ministers and Presidents of G20 nations that will be held in India.</p>

<p>Speaking about the importance of a global approach to the regulation of cryptocurrencies, Sitharaman commented:</p>

<p>The underlying principle is, because the digital currencies are completely digitalized and technology-driven, the technology which is very distributed, and sometimes identity is very difficult to be established, but which has potential, it will therefore have to be acted upon only with all countries coming on board.</p>

India Maintains a Global Approach to Crypto is Necessary
<p>Sitharaman previously commented on the need for a global stance on cryptocurrencies. Sitharaman said in a post-budget meeting with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that the Indian government is discussing a unified global approach to regulating cryptocurrencies with fellow G20 members.</p>
<p>She commented at the time that if a technology-driven asset such as crypto is to be regulated, &ldquo;one country alone cannot do anything.</p>
<p>The FM said on another previous occasion when speaking about India&rsquo;s desire to ban crypto:</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are, by definition, borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage.</p>
<p>Therefore, any legislation for&nbsp;regulation&nbsp;or for banning can be effective only after significant international collaboration on the evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The global healthcare market was valued at almost 5 trillion dollars in 2022, and expected to reach over 7.6 trillion dollars by 2030 (based on Precedence research). Inside this market, the sector including virtual health, telehealth, in-home and wearable devices, and other AI-enabled services is growing at a high rate too, ranging from 5 to 24% annually and expected to increase at 893 billion dollars by 2032. Telehealth is a great approach to reduce costs of time and care while delivering more equitable and efficient services to a larger part of the population.</p>
<p>BlockAI.Care as an innovative platform is set to revolutionize the telehealth industry. BlockAI.Care utilizes both two emerging technologies that are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain to provide many health monitoring and management services while improving data privacy, security, and decentralization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A marketplace and a low-code platform
<p>At heart, BlockAI.Care is a low-code platform that AI developers can easily implement a workflow to deliver their AI services to end-users. The platform implements common modules to process data, connect AI services, render the results and then build user accounts and profiles that monitor all of their wellness aspects to make recommendations. Each AI service can be thought of as an application inside BlockAI.Care, which is the superapp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the standout features of BlockAI.Care is its AI Marketplace, which plays an essential role in bridging AI services from many providers to the platform so that BlockAI.Care is not the only one, but many other can easily participate and deliver their services to application developers and end-users. Consequently, users can access a greater set of services and be able to monitor larger sets of health aspects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another promising module, called Care Bot, is being developed to BlockAI.Care. As an AI assistant, Care Bot is a chatbot for the healthcare domain that can answer general healthcare-related questions and process services via dialog-type of queries. With this module, BlockAI.Care will reach a next level of low-code platform for developers and deliver a better experience to end-users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Holistic telehealth
<p>This groundbreaking platform offers a user-centered approach that monitors and tracks multiple aspects of health to build a customized wellness profile for each user. Unlike other healthcare applications that use only one or a few aspects of health indicators, BlockAI.Care plans to aggregate the results of many AI micro-services to provide the most comprehensive and personalized healthcare monitoring experience available. This holistic approach, using many aspects of health indicators, is unprecedented, providing users with a more comprehensive and personalized healthcare experience.</p>
<p>At the current stage, the platform has unveiled seven initial core AI models that cater to fundamental health aspects regarding physical and mental health with many more to come. By combining the output of several AI APIs, each monitoring one aspect of wellness, BlockAI.Care builds a holistic profile for each user. This user-centered approach is truly revolutionary and sets the platform apart from any other healthcare application available. The platform's approach is affordable, reducing the cost of time, money, and travel for individuals seeking personalized healthcare information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Data privacy and security
<p>BlockAI.Care also prioritizes the privacy and security of its users' data. User data is encrypted by default and stored in a decentralized network EUENO. Only the owners of data can access and authenticate permissions to the data. Additionally, AI models process input data in an anonymous manner, without having any knowledge of the owners of the data. The platform&rsquo;s decentralized AI marketplace, data storage and by-default data encryption set it apart from other healthcare applications in the industry. It provides users with access to a wide range of healthcare services, giving them control of their private healthcare data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, BlockAI.Care also provides incentive mechanisms for the data owners to earn from their data. We acknowledge that data is too valuable to leave unused and not contributed to AI-makers. Buying and selling data is then enabled but following a strict set of rules and royalty protocol. We believe only the data owner and Science deserve the values of data.</p>
<p></p>
Try out BlockAI.Care
<p>BlockAI.Care is now available for download on both Apple Store and Google Play Store as an AI wellness mobile application. With the Oraichain ecosystem's growing and matured infrastructure and modules, BlockAI.Care can expand its services and offer affordable and convenient healthcare solutions to everyone.

</p>
Maxpread Technologies Allegedly Used AI to Generate a Fake CEO
<p>Both Maxpread Technologies and Harvest Keeper have been accused of misrepresenting their CEOs. Maxpread allegedly created a computer-generated avatar named &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; to represent their CEO, and Harvest Keeper allegedly used an actor to represent their CEO.</p>
<p>The DFPI suggests Maxpread Technologies promoted its &ldquo;profitability&rdquo; using a promotional YouTube video featuring an avatar built on Synthesia.io, which was programmed to read a screenplay.</p>
<p>Synthesia.io&rsquo;s AI technology utilizes deep learning algorithms to create life-like animations and speech, enabling users to generate high-quality content. A YouTube video was published on April 8 featuring CEO &ldquo;Michael Vanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The DFPI, however, indicates that such a person does not exist, and Maxpread&rsquo;s previous chief marketing officer and corporate brand manager, Jan Gregory, is the company&rsquo;s actual CEO.</p>
<p>Forbes reports Elizabeth Smith, a representative from DFPI, explained in an email that the agency had traced the avatar to Synthesio.io, where it had been named &ldquo;Gary.&rdquo;</p>
Harvest Keeper Employed an Actor to Perform as CEO
<p>Harvest Keeper took a slightly different approach. The agency alleges that it employed a human actor to perform the role of the company&rsquo;s CEO. The company also claimed to use AI to boost its trading profitability, but instead, it appears to rely on humans.</p>
<p>Neither organization has responded to the accusations.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 27119 Target:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 23 April 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained near recent multi-session lows early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 27283.59 area, a downside price objective associated with selling pressure that intensified around the 29102.69 area.&nbsp; Traders recently pushed BTC/USD as low as the 27133 area, a move that represented a test of the 27119.69 level that became technically significant when selling pressure strengthened around the 30012.14 area.&nbsp; Downside price objectives related to recent depreciating ranges and levels include the 27119, 26533, 26085, 25604, and 24103 levels.&nbsp; Following recent price activity, retracement levels and areas of potential technical resistance include the 29159, 29383, 29408, 29657, 29701, 29965, 30012, 30413, and 30472 levels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28492.91 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 27895.21.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;27119.16/ 26533.04/ 25604.51 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Those who bought in early on NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and Litecoin (LTC) are now generating profits, but do not feel discouraged if you did not - meet Sparklo! Some experts even believe this presale star could yield the same or more earnings than the coins above. Let&rsquo;s find out why! </p>
<p class="s7">NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Integrates With Mailchain</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR) recently announced its partnership with Mailchain, the Web3 communication layer. The Multichain SDK will enable NEAR Protocol (NEAR) developers to provide confidential connectivity to decentralized applications (dApps) built on its network. </p>
<p>However, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has not been performing well on the value charts recently, as it currently trades at $2.18, falling 0.86% in the past 24 hours. Not only that, the trading volume for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) also decreased by 13% in that same time, sinking to $134,378,615. </p>
<p>And with the moving averages for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) all in the red, many investors are sidestepping it for other projects with more room for growth. </p>
<p class="s7">Litecoin (LTC) Now Supported By Nabox</p>
<p>In recent news, the Nabox wallet has added support for Litecoin (LTC). With this development, the adoption of Litecoin (LTC) continues growing steadily - but its value leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has a value of $91.14, which is a drop of 4.68% overnight. Moreover, the technical analysis for Litecoin (LTC) shows that bears still have it in their palm, with its moving averages and technical indicators showing sell signals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of these charts in mind, experts predict that Litecoin (LTC) may continue this downtrend as it falls to its support level of $90 soon. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Become A Future Market Leader </p>
<p>Are you looking to invest in rare and precious metals such as platinum, silver, and gold? Sparklo, an upcoming decentralized alternative-investment platform, may be the perfect one for you as it brings advantages its rivals lack. </p>
<p>On this Ethereum-based platform, users may purchase or trade fractionalized NFTs backed by real-world exquisite silver, gold, or platinum bars! Not only that, if you buy a full NFT, you may also receive the asset underpinning it delivered to an address of your choice! </p>
<p>Since Sparklo is currently in Level One of its public presale, the token value is very affordable - only $0.015. We believe this is an excellent opportunity to purchase a potential blue-chip token for a meager price since some analysts have even hinted it could rise to $0.50 by October 2023!</p>
<p>Sparklo has also focused on security, with an audit by InterFi Network already complete and a KYC audit in its final stages. Moreover, liquidity will be locked for 100 years while team tokens for 1,000 days - eliminating any rug-pulls! </p>
<p>Sign up for the presale now to become an early investor in this project expected to boom by 3,200% soon!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The blockchain space is ever-evolving, and new projects are popping up consistently, aiming to provide a solution to some specific issue that has been a part of the traditional investment space.</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is one such project that will be the go-to platform where investors can easily begin making investments in fractionalized NFTS that represent precious metals.</p>
<p class="s5">With the decrease in the value of competing projects such as Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL), investors and traders aiming to get the most out of the space will typically diversify at these times.</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) To Participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace</p>
<p class="s5">The official Polygon (MATIC) Twitter page made an announcement that on April 21, 2023, Jordi Baylina and Bobbin Threadbare will participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Polygon (MATIC) will also hold a Polygon (MATIC) zkEVM Mainnet Beta AMA where they will provide updates on security, performance metrics, and the roadmap.</p>
<p class="s5">On April 20, 2023, the Polygon (MATIC) cryptocurrency traded at $1.09. In the last 24 hours, Polygon (MATIC) decreased by 1.3%, and its overall decrease in the last two weeks has been at 4.3%.</p>
<p class="s7">Helium Network Migrates To Solana (SOL), but it's Coin Still Loses Value</p>
<p class="s5">Solana (SOL) made a huge announcement on April 19, 2023, noting that Helium Network completed its upgrade and finished its migration to the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Helium Network will now run on top of Solana (SOL), and the global IoT and Cellular data will be powered by the network.</p>
<p class="s5">When we go over the value of Solana (SOL), on April 20, 2023, the cryptocurrency traded at $22.75. In the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) dipped by 1.6%, and in the last seven days, it has been down by a total of 4.7%. Based on this, it is clear why investors are beginning to diversify away from Solana (SOL) into presale-stage projects.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Bring Fractional NFT Ownerships in Gold, Silver, and Platinum</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be the go-to investment platform that will enable anyone on a global scale an opportunity to begin making investments in silver, gold, and platinum through fractional ownership of non-fungible tokens (NTs). This means that on top of Sparklo, every time an investment is made, an NFT is minted. </p>
<p class="s5">Investors can buy a specific percentage of an NFT, a fraction, or they can buy the entire NFT. Upon gaining ownership of an NFT fully that is a representation of a gold bar, for example, they can have it delivered at a location of their choosing. As for its price, the Level One presale has placed the SPRK token at a value of $0.015. Analysts predict that its value will jump 40x in the upcoming months.</p>
<p class="s5">The team is also processing a KYC application, but the network has already been audited by InterFi network and will have its liquidity locked for 100 years.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The blockchain space is ever-evolving, and new projects are popping up consistently, aiming to provide a solution to some specific issue that has been a part of the traditional investment space.</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is one such project that will be the go-to platform where investors can easily begin making investments in fractionalized NFTS that represent precious metals.</p>
<p class="s5">With the decrease in the value of competing projects such as Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL), investors and traders aiming to get the most out of the space will typically diversify at these times.</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) To Participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace</p>
<p class="s5">The official Polygon (MATIC) Twitter page made an announcement that on April 21, 2023, Jordi Baylina and Bobbin Threadbare will participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Polygon (MATIC) will also hold a Polygon (MATIC) zkEVM Mainnet Beta AMA where they will provide updates on security, performance metrics, and the roadmap.</p>
<p class="s5">On April 20, 2023, the Polygon (MATIC) cryptocurrency traded at $1.09. In the last 24 hours, Polygon (MATIC) decreased by 1.3%, and its overall decrease in the last two weeks has been at 4.3%.</p>
<p class="s7">Helium Network Migrates To Solana (SOL), but it's Coin Still Loses Value</p>
<p class="s5">Solana (SOL) made a huge announcement on April 19, 2023, noting that Helium Network completed its upgrade and finished its migration to the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Helium Network will now run on top of Solana (SOL), and the global IoT and Cellular data will be powered by the network.</p>
<p class="s5">When we go over the value of Solana (SOL), on April 20, 2023, the cryptocurrency traded at $22.75. In the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) dipped by 1.6%, and in the last seven days, it has been down by a total of 4.7%. Based on this, it is clear why investors are beginning to diversify away from Solana (SOL) into presale-stage projects.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Bring Fractional NFT Ownerships in Gold, Silver, and Platinum</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be the go-to investment platform that will enable anyone on a global scale an opportunity to begin making investments in silver, gold, and platinum through fractional ownership of non-fungible tokens (NTs).

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) are two crypto projects that have made it big in the crypto industry due to their unique design. While Polkadot (DOT) focuses on efficient cross-chain transfer, Decentraland (MANA) aims to benefit creators by monetizing content and applications.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is another unique upcoming project focusing on providing freelancers and investors with various benefits. While Uwerx has a positive projection for 2023 and beyond, Polkadot(DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) are not that fortunate. Here is a detailed take on the three popular crypto projects.</p>
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) Posts Small Gains</p>
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) is an open-source protocol that can work on multiple blockchains and connect them for cross-chain transfer. It is popular for its Web3 connection and enables users to create new apps, services, and institutions.</p>
<p class="s6">Priced at $5.92, Polkadot (DOT) has a 24-hour trading volume of $178,662,274. From its initial price of $0.30, Polkadot (DOT) increased to its all-time high of $47 in May 2021 but later started declining and is yet to recover. The future outlook for Polkadot is positive but experts predict that the gains will not be substantial.</p>
<p class="s6">Decentraland (MANA) Not Showing Recovery Signs</p>
<p class="s6">Decentraland (MANA) is a virtual reality platform that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create, enjoy, and monetize applications and content. Decentraland (MANA) grew in popularity due to the various experiences that users have created on the virtual land they purchase via the platform.</p>
<p class="s6">Priced at $0.562 now, Decentraland (MANA) has a 24-hour trading volume of $77,611,210. When it was launched in 2017, Decentraland (MANA) was valued at around $0.024. It has since increased in value and reached its all-time high of $5.90 in November 2022 after which it started declining and is now at $0.5. The price prediction for Decentraland (MANA) is not positive with the digital currency declining in value drastically.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx (WERX) Assures Efficiency and Affordability</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is a freelance-based crypto project in its presale stage. The upcoming platform assures important advantages such as a 1% flat fee, improved transparency in the storage of records, and intellectual property rights protection.</p>
<p class="s6">Valued at $0.0065, Uwerx is in Stage 1. With its liquidity fixed to be locked at the end of the presale and subsequently for 25 years, Uwerx is drawing investor attention. As per crypto experts, Uwerx has a high probability of becoming a potent force in the freelancing segment due to its basic structure that allows improved efficiency and affordable fees.</p>
<p class="s6">Why Investors Rely on Uwerx (WERX)</p>
<p class="s6">While Polkadot (DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) show vague signs of recovery, the future outlook for Uwerx looks excellent. As per industry experts, the project can turn into a popular blue-chip crypto that can be held at a very good price.</p>
<p class="s6">Seasoned crypto investors are aware that investing in early projects provides an opportunity to hold crypto at an affordable price and make substantial gains. We believe that Uwerx has the structural makeup required to provide a lucrative investment chance.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx (WERX) Will Lead the Crypto Market</p>
<p class="s6">Big investors have become wary of the high volatility of established cryptos like Decentraland (MANA) and Polkadot (DOT). Amidst the present turmoil that the industry faces, investing in a new crypto like Uwerx presents a lucrative opportunity that users should not miss out on.</p>
<p class="s6">The fact that it has undergone a full audit by InterFi Network and SolidProof is another reason for investors relying on it. Its inherent benefits position it as a main investment option in the resilient gig economy. The team's declaration will be upheld when they abandon the ownership of smart contracts when the project is ready to be listed on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="s6">With the Uwerx presale in progress, it poses a wonderful investment opportunity you should grab onto, before the price increase later on today.. Visit the Uwerx presale now to earn a 25% purchase bonus and stand a chance to win $5,000 in a competition!</p>
