			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Aave community has started voting on three crucial proposals that could help significantly reduce the protocol&rsquo;s exposure to Curve Finance&rsquo;s CRV token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two out of the three proposals in question opened for voting on the 10th of August.&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Proposals
<p>The move by the Aave community comes as it attempts to limit the risk posed to the protocol by the large borrowing position held by Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance. On-chain risk management platform Chaos Lab put forward the proposals. According to the platform, volatility in Curve markets had considerably increased after the recent exploit suffered by Curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CRV token is the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance. Curve founder Egorov had used as much as 30% of CRV&rsquo;s total market capitalization to take out nearly $60 million in loans on Aave. However, the Curve Finance hack significantly impacted the price of CRV, sending it plummeting. This made Egorov&rsquo;s position vulnerable, potentially exposing Aave to a liquidation risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voting on the proposals is set to continue until the 12th of August. The first proposal seeks to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave v2. This could lead to user accounts becoming subject to liquidation upon approval. The second proposal disables borrowing of CRV tokens on Polygon v3 and Ethereum. This would make it impossible to short CRV through the Aave protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two proposals to limit Aave&rsquo;s exposure have found overwhelming support in the community. So far, over 571,000 votes have been cast, with 100% of the votes in favor of limiting Aave&rsquo;s exposure to CRV.&nbsp;</p>
The Third Proposal&nbsp;
<p>With fears surrounding Egorov&rsquo;s loans, Aave&rsquo;s community is also voting on a third proposal, voting for which ends on the 11th of August. The proposal, put forward by Aave Chan founder Marc Zeller, calls on the Aave treasury to purchase $2 million worth of CRV tokens from Curve Finance. Zeller&rsquo;s reasoning for such a move is that it would signal that major DeFi players support Curve and the health of the larger DeFi ecosystem. However, this proposal has not gained as much support in the community, although a majority do support it. Currently, around 62% of votes favor the proposal, while 37% have voted against it.&nbsp;</p>
The Curve Finance Exploit&nbsp;
<p>Curve Finance suffered a major exploit at the beginning of the month, with hackers managing to siphon off millions worth of crypto. As a result of the hack, the protocol&rsquo;s CRV token saw a significant price drop, casting a long shadow on the DeFi ecosystem. The decline in CRV&rsquo;s value also put a $168 million lending position taken by Curve founder Michael Egorov at risk. If this position was liquidated, it could have disastrous consequences for the larger DeFi ecosystem, putting major protocols at risk. Following the exploit, crypto exchanges moved to suspend withdrawals, with Upbit among the first to act, suspending deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Curve and Egorov found support from prominent players in the crypto space. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Jeffrey Huang, and Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV from Egorov, resulting in the principal value of Egorov&rsquo;s loans dropping to $54 million. Justin Sun posted a message in support of Curve, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance!&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The MakerDAO founder, Rune Christensen, has announced an airdrop for the Spark Protocol&rsquo;s native SPK token.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the proposal, the tokens will be released gradually, with the proposal outlining the distribution of two billion SPK tokens over the next ten years.&nbsp;</p>
The SPK Token Airdrop&nbsp;
<p>The proposal is aimed at promoting long-term engagement with the platform and outlines the eventual distribution of two billion SPK tokens over ten years in an effort to incentivize the continued usage of the Spark Protocol. The SPK token will also act as a governance token for SparkDAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goal of the SPK pre-farming airdrop is to give users and borrow-arbers a reason to keep using Spark Protocol if the EDSR proposal to increase stability fees to 5% goes through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Rune, the proposal would be an avenue for the community to secure SPK tokens before the launch of the SubDAO, with Rune stating on X,</p>

<p>&ldquo;I posted an overview of the potential SparkDAO SPK pre-farming airdrop for early users of http://sparkprotocol.io borrowing: This would be a way to secure early SPK tokens before the SubDAOs launch (Farming not available to US and VPN users)&rdquo;</p>

Spark Expected To Become SubDAO&nbsp;
<p>Spark Protocol is a lending protocol that has been introduced by MakerDAO. The protocol provides DeFi loans, sourcing liquidity directly from Maker. As collateral, the protocol accepts several assets, such as DAI, ETH, and Staked ETH. Spark Protocol eventually aims to become a SubDAO, which marks a significant step in Maker&rsquo;s Endgame Plan. As a subDAO, Spark will be an entirely independent, decentralized autonomous organization within MakerDAO. The Endgame plan envisions the creation of several subDAOs similar to Spark, each governed by its own distinct community and token.&nbsp;</p>
A Way To Incentivize Usage&nbsp;
<p>The SubDAO tokens will be allocated to Spark borrowers and will utilize several assets as collateral, distributed proportionately towards the amount and duration of borrowing. According to Christensen, the aim is to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants whose goals are aligned with SparkDAO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants that are aligned with the mission and potential of SparkDAO.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The eventual goal is to incentivize the Spark token&rsquo;s active usage, despite it offering a 5% yield on DAI deposits, also called Enhanced DAI Savings Rate. The EDSR on Spark climbed to 8% earlier in the week, resulting in a significant inflow of capital as users rushed to leverage borrowing arbitrage opportunities. This saw users borrow DAI at lower rates and then deploy it for higher yields in EDSR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maker&rsquo;s new Spark Protocol has courted controversy following its launch after it emerged that the protocol&rsquo;s terms of service actively prevented users from accessing the platform through virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, MakerDAO appeared to be restricting US-based users from accessing the platform.&nbsp;</p>
Maker&rsquo;s Endgame Plan&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO&rsquo;s Endgame is a significant update planned to enhance the protocol&rsquo;s efficiency, resilience, and participation. It aims to do this by creating a strong governance equilibrium that would act as the bedrock for SubDAOs, helping parallelize growth and innovation in a community-driven ecosystem. In the short term, Endgame hopes to enhance the supply of DAI to over 100 billion within three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also aims to ensure that the Maker ecosystem is anchored in a vibrant and independent DAO economy that could grow at an accelerating rate. At the same time, it would also maintain governance equilibrium, ensuring it could scale to any size.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto exchange Bittrex has agreed to a $24 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), bringing to a close allegations of offering unregistered securities to American investors.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement, made on Thursday, comes within two months of Bittrex's bankruptcy filing and follows the trend of regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
Bittrex's Position and SEC's Allegations
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bittrex, which filed for bankruptcy in May, was sued by the SEC earlier this year. The regulator's charges revolved around the simultaneous operation of the company as a securities exchange, broker, and clearinghouse without appropriate registration, allegations that have also been leveledd at Coinbase and Binance.US.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the settlement agreement, Bittrex neither admits nor denies the allegations. The terms also stipulate that Bittrex will have 90 days after its liquidation plan is effective to pay the SEC, and any delays may prompt the regulator to seek court judgment.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the following in an official statement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today&rsquo;s settlement makes clear that you cannot escape liability by simply changing labels or altering descriptions, because what matters is the economic realities of those offerings [as such]."</p>

Context and Details of the Settlement
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The case against Bittrex is rooted in its alleged role as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agency in providing services to U.S. investors in connection with crypto assets. Part of the charges includes an accusation that Bittrex worked closely with token issuers to edit online statements to circumvent federal securities laws.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The settlement, subject to court approval, includes financial components: disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, culminating in a total monetary payment of $24 million.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement, noted in his remarks that:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;[For years], Bittrex worked with token issuers to 'scrub' their online statements of any indicia that they were investment contracts&mdash;all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The settlement underscores the broader regulatory landscape and the SEC's vigilant stance against non-compliance in the crypto industry. The outcome serves as a reminder to other crypto exchanges of the necessity to adhere to existing regulations, in a market that continues to draw significant attention from both investors and regulators.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Bittrex's settlement with the SEC, centering on unregistered operationbs as a broker, exchange, and clearing agency, brings further focus to the compliance measures (and, by extension, frameworks designed to adapt specifically for crypto) necessary in the space. The detailed legal agreements and financial components of the settlement highlight the regulatory challenges and ongoing efforts to bring clarity to the industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a sophisticated phishing scam after its social media account on X, previously known as Twitter, was hijacked.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The perpetrators posted a series of fraudulent messages on August 9, promising a giveaway of &ldquo;BCAP&rdquo; tokens. They provided a link to a fake website closely resembling Blockchain Capital's original site, intending to deceive users into linking their cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The fraudulent website had a minor alteration in its URL, adding an extra 'n', a detail easily missed by unsuspecting users. The scam strategy also involved a sense of urgency by stating the giveaway would only be available for a day, aiming to exploit the fear of missing out. Notably, to prevent potential exposure, the comments section was deactivated, inhibiting users from flagging the scam.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prompt action from informed members of the blockchain community led to the swift identification of the deceit. Blockchain Capital reestablished control over its account within hours, removing the misleading posts. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This cyber intrusion follows a broader pattern of scams in the crypto space, as highlighted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently. The agency issued a warning about the increasing instances of criminals posing as non-fungible token (NFT) developers. These fraudsters hack into high-profile social media accounts, falsely advertising new NFT releases. Victims are directed to counterfeit websites where, once their crypto wallets are linmked, funds are syphoned using malicious smart contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the FBI, stolen tokens are then laundered through multiple cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges, obfuscating their tracks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Blockchain Capital breach echoes a similar incident from April involving the crypto exchange platform, KuCoin. Its social media account was compromised, leading to a fake giveaway scam resulting in a loss of over $22.6K in cryptocurrency. In response, KuCoin assured full compensation to the impacted customers and emphasized the continued security of assets on its platform.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, fell victim to a sophisticated phishing scam after its social media account on X, previously known as Twitter, was hijacked.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The perpetrators posted a series of fraudulent messages on August 9, promising a giveaway of &ldquo;BCAP&rdquo; tokens. They provided a link to a fake website closely resembling Blockchain Capital's original site, intending to deceive users into linking their cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The fraudulent website had a minor alteration in its URL, adding an extra 'n', a detail easily missed by unsuspecting users. The scam strategy also involved a sense of urgency by stating the giveaway would only be available for a day, aiming to exploit the fear of missing out. Notably, to prevent potential exposure, the comments section was deactivated, inhibiting users from flagging the scam.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prompt action from informed members of the blockchain community led to the swift identification of the deceit. Blockchain Capital reestablished control over its account within hours, removing the misleading posts. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This cyber intrusion follows a broader pattern of scams in the crypto space, as highlighted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recently. The agency issued a warning about the increasing instances of criminals posing as non-fungible token (NFT) developers. These fraudsters hack into high-profile social media accounts, falsely advertising new NFT releases. Victims are directed to counterfeit websites where, once their crypto wallets are linmked, funds are syphoned using malicious smart contracts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the FBI, stolen tokens are then laundered through multiple cryptocurrency mixers and exchanges, obfuscating their tracks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Blockchain Capital breach echoes a similar incident from April involving the crypto exchange platform, KuCoin. Its social media account was compromised, leading to a fake giveaway scam resulting in a loss of over $22.6K in cryptocurrency. In response, KuCoin assured full compensation to the impacted customers and emphasized the continued security of assets on its platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao, CEO of Binance, a global cryptocurrency exchange, recently warned of the uptick in such phishing attacks and advised the community against using text message-based two-factor authentication.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO, a decentralized finance (DeFi) stalwart, is facing heightened scrutiny after the introduction of its new platform, Spark Protocol.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The controversy arises from Spark Protocol's terms of service, which actively prevent users from accessing the platform via virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, it appears MakerDAO is attempting to restrict U.S. users from the platform, causing a ripple effect on global user rights and igniting concerns over privacy in the DeFi sector.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decision to restrict VPN access follows closely on the heels of Rune Christensen, MakerDAO's founder, announcing the potential for DAI stablecoin holders to earn up to 8% returns via the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) on Spark Protocol. The appeal of these high yields comes from a system adjustment: when DSR adoption is sparse, the rate increases to attract users. Despite only 9% of DAI holders currently participating in DSR, the platform's mechanism automatically optimizes rates based on user engagement.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite these prospective states, behind this innovative yield mechanism lies a broader issue. The DeFi space, characterized by its decentralized ethos and user autonomy, is now confronting questions about the balance between regulatory compliance and individual privacy rights.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Chris Blec, a DeFi analyst, voiced strong concerns over Spark Protocol's VPN restrictions. Blec's stance is that MakerDAO's decision could compromise global user privacy, potentially prioritizing profit motives over decentralized principles. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This contention around user rights and access isn't isolated. Over the past year, DAI's market trajectory experienced turbulence. Its market cap plummeted by 43%, from $7B to $4B, after a destabilizing event in March when both DAI and USDC stablecoins momentarily dropped below their usual peg. Concerns arose about the solvency of USDC's banking partners, and since DAI's collateral heavily comprised USDC, both tokens suffered.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO's strategy, introducing high DSR yields through Spark Protocol, aims to bolster its position in the volatile stablecoin ecosystem. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On the contrary, by blocking VPN access, MakerDAO has placed itself in the crosshairs of a larger debate around the intersection of regulatory compliance, decentralized operations, and user rights in the crypto domain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While it remains that there is a need to evaluate the implications of MakerDAO's recent decisions, the line between user privacy and platform governance is set to be a defining conversation in the industry's DeFi sector.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The French financial regulator announced amendments to its registration requirements for digital asset service providers as it prepares for MiCA&rsquo;s implementation. </p>
<p>France&rsquo;s Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) announced it would introduce &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements for crypto firms as it prepared for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.</p>
Amendments to Align with MiCA
<p>The AMF has amended its registration requirements for digital asset service providers (DASPs) to better align with the EU&rsquo;s upcoming regulatory framework. The regulator said its &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements will take effect on January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the AMF said the changes have two objectives:</p>

<p>&ldquo;to incorporate into the General Regulation and its policy the provisions applicable to DASPs subject to &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; registration. This regime will become mandatory from January 1, 2024, for new players wishing to provide the four services subject to mandatory registration;&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;align the requirements for DASPs licence with those for European authorisation for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under the MiCA Regulation, and allow a fast track procedure to be implemented towards CASP authorisation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>France already has a relatively comprehensive licensing regime for crypto firms and is implementing changes to its regulation to comply with MiCA which will take effect within the next 12 &ndash; 18 months.</p>
EU Signs MiCA Into Law
<p>The European Union announced in May that it formally signed MiCA into law. MiCA has been in the works for a long time and will introduce a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulating crypto businesses operating within the EU.</p>
<p>France has been one of the most welcoming countries for regulating the crypto sector. The governor of the Bank of France called for a stricter and more comprehensive licensing regime for crypto companies after 2022&rsquo;s market turmoil.</p>
<p>Recognising the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny, the French National Assembly voted on new measures for crypto regulation, including a new set of compliance frameworks for new crypto firms seeking registration in France.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong&rsquo;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a warning addressing investors against crypto platforms &ldquo;engaging in improper practices.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On Monday, Hong Kong regulators issued a warning to unlicensed crypto platforms &ldquo;engaging in improper practices.&rdquo; The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) said some platforms are falsely claiming to have applied for registration. HashKey and OSL are the only two licensed exchanges in the city. &nbsp;</p>
SFC Takes a &ldquo;Dim View&rdquo; of Non-Compliance
<p>The SFC warned the unlicensed crypto platform advising investors to beware of these operations trading without the necessary registration. In a press release, the regulator said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has observed some unlicensed virtual asset trading platforms (VATPs) engaging in improper practices. This statement warns VATPs of the potential legal and regulatory consequences of these improper practices and reminds investors to be wary of the risks of trading virtual assets on unregulated VATPs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator said it became aware of exchanges conducting business after falsely claiming to have applied to it for registration. The SFC noted such false claims aim to &ldquo;give the public a false sense of assurance&rdquo; with the goal of &ldquo;inducing another person to trade in virtual assets&rdquo; and are an offence under Hong Kong&rsquo;s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is doing everything possible to regulate the industry and introduce a new licensing regime for virtual asset service providers. On 1 June, the SFC introduced a new regulatory framework for platforms engaging in trading activities. Under the regulations, such providers can apply to the SFC for licenses to legitimise their operations. Hong Kong&rsquo;s approach to regulation aims to provide a structured environment for investors and traders. The Hashkey Exchange recently announced it obtained a license from the SFC, making it the first cryptocurrency platform allowed to offer services to retail users.</p>
<p>The SFC further warned the public that some unlicensed platforms continue to launch new products and services under existing entities that do not comply with its regulatory requirements. The Commission explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, they may, under new or existing entities, launch certain virtual assets for trading by retail clients, trading services in virtual asset derivatives, or arrangements involving virtual assets such as virtual asset &lsquo;deposits,&rsquo; &lsquo;savings&rsquo; or &lsquo;earnings&rsquo; which are not allowed under the new regime.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The regulator advised investors trading on unregulated exchanges that they could risk &ldquo;losing their entire investment&rdquo; held on that exchange should they discontinue their operations, collapse, or are hacked.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve of the U.S. issued new guidelines regarding the use of stablecoins and other digital assets by the national banks.</p>
Fed Tightens the Regulation of Stablecoins
<p>Just a day after PayPal had announced the launch of its U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin PYUSD, the Federal Reserve of the U.S. published new guidelines clarifying the ways state member banks can interact with dollar-denominated digital currencies.</p>
<p>Basically, national banks are now required to seek permission of the Federal Reserve to engage in any sorts of activities related to the U.S. dollar-pegged digital assets, referred to as &ldquo;dollar tokens&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the statement, state member banks need to notify the Federal Reserve about the activities they mean to perform with the use of dollar tokens, whether it is issuing, holding, transacting, or even testing digital assets. The Federal Reserve might ask for additional information regarding the proposed activity. To proceed with the use of stablecoins in any way, the bank needs to receive a &ldquo;a written notification of supervisory nonobjection from the Federal Reserve&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A state member bank seeking to engage in such dollar token activities, including for the purpose of testing, must notify its lead supervisory point of contact at the Federal Reserve of the bank&rsquo;s intention to engage in the proposed activity and should include a description of the proposed activity. Federal Reserve supervisory staff may follow up with the bank to seek additional information in order to better understand the proposal and the control framework that the state member bank has put in place. After receiving a written notification of supervisory nonobjection, state member banks will continue to be subject to supervisory review and heightened monitoring of these activities,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

Mitigating Risks Related to the Use of &ldquo;Dollar Tokens&rdquo;
<p>To acquire the notification of nonobjection from the Federal Reserve, the bank needs to showcase an effective system of risk management and the ability to measure and control the risks of the proposed stablecoin activities on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve outlines five major types of risks linked to the use of dollar tokens:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">operational risks: associated with the governance and the management of the network;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">cybersecurity risks: related to the stablecoin&rsquo;s network, smart contracts, and any use of open source code;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">liquidity risks, such as high redemptions of the token in a short period of time;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">illicit finance risks: customer identity verification, due diligence, monitoring suspicious activities, etc;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">consumer compliance risks: related to identifying and ensuring compliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Federal Reserve has also reported that it would evaluate the banks&rsquo; comprehension of the relevant laws and their commitment to them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In its press release of August 9, 2023, the Indian Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) announced the launch of the Indian Web Browser Development Challenge (IWBDC).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The IWBDC is an Open Challenge Competition that seeks to inspire and empower technology enthusiasts, innovators, and developers from all corners of the country to create an indigenous web browser with its own trust store with an inbuilt CCA India root certificate, cutting edge functionalities and enhanced security &amp; data privacy protection features,&rdquo; reads the statement.</p>

<p>One of the key features that&rsquo;s expected to be supported by the browser is the digital signing of documents through a crypto token, with the aim to enhance the security of transactions and digital engagements.</p>
<p>The release of the India&rsquo;s native multifunctional web browser will mark a significant step towards &ldquo;Aatmanirbhar Bharat&rdquo; (translates to &ldquo;self-reliant India&rdquo;), Prime Minister Modi&rsquo;s plan to make the country more independent, technologically and economically .</p>

<p>&ldquo;Digital India has revolutionized how our nation functions, empowering citizens, boosting the economy and enhancing overall governance. As we move forward, embracing technology and promoting indigenous innovation will be pivotal in realizing the vision of a self-reliant, digitally empowered India,&rdquo; said Smt Sunita Verma, Scientist G &amp; GC (R&amp;D in Electronics &amp; IT).</p>

<p>The Indian Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA), Shri Arvind Kumar, strives to ensure the security of digital certificates issued within the country and contributes to developing a robust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) framework that would enable secure electronic transactions throughout the nation.</p>
<p>However, India has been reliant on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates issued by foreign entities&rsquo; roots. Now, the challenge is to integrate India Root Certificate into the upcoming national browser, thus addressing the issue and making the country more &ldquo;Internet Resilient&rdquo;.</p>
Who Can Participate in the Challenge?
<p>All of the country&rsquo;s creative minds, including academia, industry, start-ups, or individuals, are encouraged to take part in the challenge and submit an idea for the innovative Indian web browser that could cater to a global audience.</p>
<p>The challenge will consist of three rounds: 18 participants will be selected in the first round, shortlisted to 8 in the second one, with only 3 coming to the final round. The winner will be granted 34 million Indian rupees (around $411,000) and will receive additional support in further development of the new browser.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The waitlist for the integration of a self-custody wallet TON Space within Telegram Messenger is now available for developers.</p>
Merging Web2 and Web3
<p>On Wednesday, August 9, the TON, a blockchain system originally created by Telegram, announced the launch of its self-custodial crypto wallet TON Space that would be integrated in the prominent messaging app. The product is now in its beta phase and available for developers only.</p>
<p>By applying for the beta version of TON Space, developers will have a chance to integrate the wallet into their apps before everyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TON Space aims at facilitating the Web3 adoption by offering the whole user experience entirely within Telegram Messenger. Developers will be able to build their apps, integrate the blockchain, and unboard their users without leaving the platform.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The developers&rsquo; beta is a critical moment in launching the first self-custodial wallet built into a thriving Web2 platform,&rdquo; said Jordan Dunne, Head of DeFi at Wallet. &ldquo;The introduction of TON Space will allow blockchain developers to build Web3 services that feel like the intuitive mobile app experiences users have every day. Easy-to-use and all without ever leaving Telegram, with 800 million users every month, this opens up a staggering growth opportunity for builders.&rdquo;</p>

Main Features of TON Space
<p>As a self-custody wallet, TON Space will provide its users with full control over their assets, allowing them to store, trade, and manage crypto within Telegram. One of the unique advantages of TON Space is that it can be seamlessly linked to any app built on Telegram, all integrated within a single ecosystem. According to the press release, TON Space is the most highly anticipated feature among the users who wish to have full access to the TON network within Telegram Messenger.</p>
<p>The custodial wallet is expected to open for consumer use by the end of Q3 2023. The team also plans to integrate NFT collectables and swapping services into the product by that time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The launch of TON Space is a significant milestone that establishes a new infrastructure layer for the TON ecosystem,&rdquo; commented Justin Hyun, Director of Growth at TON Foundation. &ldquo;The power to build decentralized applications and bots fully integrated inside of Telegram cannot be underestimated. These services, and their users, will now enjoy the infinite possibilities that come with the power to store, manage, and trade assets within Telegram.&rdquo;</p>

Telegram vs Twitter?
<p>By integrating the crypto wallet, Telegram, which has always had an unwavering emphasis on privacy and security, is now officially entering the Web3 space. The move makes the global messenger a key player in the industry, which could potentially compete with such giants as X (previously known as Twitter), recently bought and rebranded by Elon Musk.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The new collaboration between Microsoft and Aptos Labs will use the best of AI and blockchain technologies to drive Web3 into the masses.</p>
Why Does Aptos Need AI?
<p>On Wednesday, August 9, Aptos Labs, a crypto project founded by Facebook ex-employees, announced its new partnership with tech giant Microsoft. The Layer 1 blockchain will use Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to help onboard new users to Web3.</p>
<p>Even though both blockchain and AI are being developed at astonishing speed, their adoption by the global population can be challenging due to user skepticism around the technologies. To facilitate and speed up the onboarding process, Aptos Labs joins forces with Microsoft to introduce Aptos Assistant, an AI-driven chatbot, similar to the distinguished ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aptos Assistant will help everyday Internet users bridge seamlessly from Web2 to Web3. The AI tool will be able to answer any questions regarding the Aptos blockchain ecosystem, and will guide developers through the creation of smart contracts and decentralized apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Artificial Intelligence and blockchain technologies are quickly converging for one important reason: they are both generational breakthroughs that profoundly impact the evolution of the internet and shape society," commented Mo Shaikh, CEO of Aptos Labs. "Together with Microsoft, our shared vision is to ensure that this technology is accessible to more people and organizations than ever before."</p>
<p>"The intersection of AI and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies and can generate transformational use cases," said Rashmi Misra, General Manager, AI &amp; Emerging Technologies, Microsoft. "By fusing Aptos Labs' technology with the Microsoft Azure Open AI Service capabilities, we aim to democratize the use of blockchain enabling users to seamlessly onboard to Web3 and innovators to develop new exciting decentralized applications using AI."</p>

Why Does Microsoft Need Blockchain?
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why the tech giant wants to infuse its AI model into Aptos Web3 solutions. Microsoft explains that blockchain technology can provide more transparency to the AI-generated content, making it more credible and trustworthy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For example, how do we know that LLM-generated outputs are authentic [and] trustworthy? How do we know that the training data is bias free in the first place? Blockchain-based solutions can help with verifying, time-stamping and attributing content to its source, thereby improving credibility in a distributed digital economy,&rdquo; said Daniel An, global director of business development for AI and Web3 at Microsoft.</p>

<p>The choice of the Aptos network can be explained by its phenomenal speed &ndash; the blockchain can support up to 160,000 transactions per second.</p>
Digital Payments and CBDCs
<p>According to the press release, Microsoft and Aptos have also agreed to collaborate upon innovative solutions, such as asset tokenization, payments, and Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This will also be part of the effort towards Web3 adoption. Additionally, Aptos will operate validator nodes on Azure to make its blockchain more secure and reliable.</p>
<p>Following the news, the Aptos token jumped by around 17% and is hovering at $7.36 at the moment of writing.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Central Bank of Brazil reveals the official brand name of the upcoming government-backed &ldquo;digital real&rdquo; &ndash; DREX.</p>
What Does DREX Stand For?
<p>On Monday, August 7, the Central Bank of Brazil broadcasted a live conversation on the topic &ldquo;What will change for me with the Digital Real?&rdquo; on the institution&rsquo;s official YouTube account. F&aacute;bio Ara&uacute;jo, coordinator of the digital real, Aristides Cavalcante, deputy head of the Central Bank's technology and information department, and Gustavo Igreja, communications specialist at the Central Bank of Brazil, discussed the main features of the anticipated CBDC (central bank digital currency).</p>
<p>As it was revealed during the broadcast, the official name of the digital real will be the acronym &ldquo;DREX&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DREX combines several elements of innovation: the D for digital, R for real, E for electronic, and X for transaction, taking a step further in this family of Pix that we created and was a success,&rdquo; Ara&uacute;jo explained.</p>

<p>* Pix is the instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil and widely used across the country. Pix is a way to transfer money from one account to another instantly and free of charge by using a QR code or an ID such as phone number, email, or CPF (the taxpayer registry number) via any bank&rsquo;s application.</p>
The Meaning Behind DREX&rsquo; Logo
<p>The official logo of DREX also represents the evolution of Brazil&rsquo;s currency in the digital environment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alluding to a transaction, the two arrows that lean into the 'D' relate to the evolution of the real to the digital environment, reinforcing the attribute of agility, and the use of colors, in a transition from blue to light green, conveys the message of 'transaction completed,'&rdquo; the Central Bank of Brazil stated.</p>

How Will the Digital Real Work?
<p>The authorized entities will mint the digital real with the help of a similar-to-blockchain distributed ledger technology. DREX will support the trading of public treasury bonds, transactions backed by Web3 infrastructure for token burning, creation, and registration. Thus, the tokenized real will be the representation of the digital real and will be managed exclusively by authorized financial institutions.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil claimed that DREX will make the life of Brazilians easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The solution, previously referred to as the Digital Real, will provide citizens and entrepreneurs with a safe and regulated environment for the creation of new businesses and a more democratic access to the benefits of the economic digitization&rdquo;, highlighted the agency.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Brazilian CBDC project has been in works since at least the beginning of this year. The Central Bank of Brazil plans to start the digital real pilot testing in September 2023. However, DREX is expected to be widely available to the population no earlier than the end of 2024.</p>

<p>On Monday, August 7, the Central Bank of Brazil broadcasted a live conversation on the topic &ldquo;What will change for me with the Digital Real?&rdquo; on the institution&rsquo;s official YouTube account. F&aacute;bio Ara&uacute;jo, coordinator of the digital real, Aristides Cavalcante, deputy head of the Central Bank's technology and information department, and Gustavo Igreja, communications specialist at the Central Bank of Brazil, discussed the main features of the anticipated CBDC (central bank digital currency).</p>
<p>As it was revealed during the broadcast, the official name of the digital real will be the acronym &ldquo;DREX&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&ldquo;DREX combines several elements of innovation: the D for digital, R for real, E for electronic, and X for transaction, taking a step further in this family of Pix that we created and was a success,&rdquo; Ara&uacute;jo explained.</p>

<p>* Pix is the instant payment system developed by the Central Bank of Brazil and widely used across the country. Pix is a way to transfer money from one account to another instantly and free of charge by using a QR code or an ID such as phone number, email, or CPF (the taxpayer registry number) via any bank&rsquo;s application.</p>
The Meaning Behind DREX&rsquo; Logo
<p>The official logo of DREX also represents the evolution of Brazil&rsquo;s currency in the digital environment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alluding to a transaction, the two arrows that lean into the 'D' relate to the evolution of the real to the digital environment, reinforcing the attribute of agility, and the use of colors, in a transition from blue to light green, conveys the message of 'transaction completed,'&rdquo; the Central Bank of Brazil stated.</p>

How Will the Digital Real Work?
<p>The authorized entities will mint the digital real with the help of a similar-to-blockchain distributed ledger technology. DREX will support the trading of public treasury bonds, transactions backed by Web3 infrastructure for token burning, creation, and registration. Thus, the tokenized real will be the representation of the digital real and will be managed exclusively by authorized financial institutions.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Brazil claimed that DREX will make the life of Brazilians easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The solution, previously referred to as the Digital Real, will provide citizens and entrepreneurs with a safe and regulated environment for the creation of new businesses and a more democratic access to the benefits of the economic digitization&rdquo;, highlighted the agency.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Brazilian CBDC project has been in works since at least the beginning of this year. The Central Bank of Brazil plans to start the digital real pilot testing in September 2023. However, DREX is expected to be widely available to the population no earlier than the end of 2024.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Prominent stablecoin issuer Circle announces the launch of its Web3 Programmable Wallets public beta version for developers on three blockchains.</p>
The First Product of Circle&rsquo;s Web3 Services Line
<p>On Tuesday, August 8, 2023, global fintech company Circle, known for its USDC stablecoin, announced the launch of Programmable Wallets, the first product of the platform&rsquo;s Web3 Services product line. The public beta version of Programmable Wallets is now available for businesses, developers, and builders. The product currently supports Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche networks, with other chains coming soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programmable Wallets allows developers to seamlessly integrate secure crypto wallets into any application, thus expediting the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technologies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;​​Programmable Wallets bridge the gap between today&rsquo;s internet and blockchain networks by abstracting complexities such as private key security, blockchain node operations, transaction management, interoperability across blockchains, and many others to enable developers to iterate on applications faster,&rdquo; reads the statement on the Circle&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>One of Programmable Wallets&rsquo; key features is that it gives developers the freedom to customize the crypto wallet experience to best fit their use case. This helps greatly increase customer satisfaction because different types of apps (DeFi, games, e-commerce, etc.) will use their crypto wallet in different ways.</p>
<p>Programmable Wallets offers a self-service, end-to-end solution, enabling developers to register, build, and implement their first wallets and transactions within minutes. The developer console provides all the necessary tools for debugging, launching, and scaling Web3 applications.</p>
<p>According to the company&rsquo;s press release, these are the core features of Programmable Wallets:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">User-controlled wallets: gives end-users full control of their assets;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Developer-controlled wallets: allows developers manage assets on behalf of users;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">REST APIs manage both user-controlled and developer-controlled wallets;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">iOS and Android SDKs speed up development processes and facilitate wallet UI customization;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Webhooks keep users updated on their incoming or outgoing transactions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wallet operations dashboard enables developers to monitor transactions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Multiparty computation (MPC) is a built-in cryptographic security configuration;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Blockchains Agnostic allows to build a wallet once and use it across different blockchains;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pay-as-you-grow provides a rebate on USDC usage, starting at $0.05/Monthly Active Wallet.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>Other features such as Gas Abstraction and Smart Contract Wallets should be rolled out shortly.</p>
Circle Expands the Range of Its Web3 Solutions
<p>Earlier this year, Circle launched a Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) to allow permissionless transfers of USDC natively across supported blockchains. A couple of months later, the platform announced the operationalization of its CCTP on Arbitrum, a Layer 2 scaling solution for the Ethereum network, with the aim to make the USDC transfers faster and more secure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With USDC, CCTP, Programmable Wallets, and our broader Web3 Services offering, our goal is to make it easy for developers to rapidly build, deploy, and scale blockchain-powered apps for a variety of use cases, regardless of the blockchain network they choose to build on,&rdquo; the Senior Director of Product Management at Circle, Gagan Mac, wrote in the statement. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Global interest in non-fungible tokens has sharply plummeted as the base prices of prominent NFT collections have declined since 2022. Peaking at $5.8 billion in January 2022, NFT trading volume dropped to $707.70 million in June 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robert Quartly-Janeiro, CSO of Bitrue, a Tier 1 crypto exchange, says:</p>

<p>"FOMO fueled the massive surge in the NFT market, but the decline in trading volume by 90% from the last year&rsquo;s peak shows the dynamics has shifted. Barriers such as skepticism towards NFTs as potential scams, lack of sustained interest, scalability challenges, and lack of clear use cases are hindering the wide adoption of non-fungibles."</p>

<p>As fundamental elements of Web3, NFTs, and metaverse projects have a lot of scope and opportunity. In this shifting environment, mainstream digital media is poised to play a significant role, given its power to amplify trends or foster skepticism.&nbsp;</p>
NFT Plazas: All the Latest NFT and Metaverse News
<p>Founded in 2018, NFT Plazas offers daily insights into the multifaceted spheres of non-fungible tokens and the broader metaverse. Over its years of operation, the independent NFT news platform has methodically carved out a reputation as a leader in NFT and metaverse coverage.</p>
<p>It delivers timely industry news, feature articles with thorough educational content, insightful data analyses, and performs due diligence and analysis on new NFT projects. This blend of content makes the often convoluted world of Web3 technologies more accessible to laypeople.</p>
<p>The outlet concentrates on quality over hype, aiming to demystify the space and reduce barriers of entry. In a field where misinformation is rampant, NFT Plazas helps to ensure that accurate, unbiased information is always at the reader&rsquo;s fingertips.</p>
Media and NFTs: The symbiotic catalysts for adoption
<p>With its expansive reach and influence, the media has been instrumental in narrating the story of non-fungibles, delineating their value, and encouraging their adoption. As NFTs enter mainstream consciousness, it serves as passive observer and an active participant, crafting narratives that influence perception, drive interest, and foster understanding.</p>
<p>Social media platforms have also metamorphosed into bustling marketplaces where buyers, sellers, and mediators intersect, while platforms like Twitter and Discord continue to serve as critical nodes of discovery and discussion. The synergy between NFTs and social media hints at a future where the line between digital assets and traditional online interactions further blurs.</p>
<p>"The role of media is not just to report on the world of crypto, metaverses, and NFTs," commented Mary Pedler, Founder of Input PR communications agency for cutting-edge crypto and tech projects. "It actively shapes perceptions, demystifies complexities, and lowers the entry threshold for the average user."</p>
<p>NFT Plazas, acutely aware of the challenges of NFT adoption, harnesses the power of media to bridge knowledge gaps. They employ a multi-pronged approach, where comprehensive educational content aids the uninitiated, while data-driven insights offer value to veterans. While their educational efforts have garnered praise, more aggressive marketing techniques might find lesser traction among a discerning audience wary of hype.</p>
<p>The media's role in Web3 and the broader digital asset landscape is pivotal. As gatekeepers of information, platforms like NFT Plazas can influence the trajectory of NFT adoption, ensuring that the metamorphosis of the digital realm is rooted in knowledge, transparency, and trust.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ratings agency Moody&rsquo;s downgraded 10 US banks on Monday, with negative ratings actions on many more. Bitcoin has broken higher.</p>
27 Banks suffer negative ratings actions
<p>Following on from the Fitch ratings agency downgrade of the US from triple A to double A+, the Moody&rsquo;s rating agency has followed up with downgrades of 10 small and midsize US banks, and put such august banking giants as New York Mellon and US Bancorp under review for possible downgrades.</p>
<p>In all, 27 banks received negative ratings actions from Moody&rsquo;s which is likely to put them under further pressure and scrutiny at a time when the whole banking sector is struggling to keep itself above water after the Federal Reserve felt it had to buy all the bad bond debts, and as the commercial real estate time bomb gets ever closer to exploding.</p>
<p>Moody&rsquo;s included the following in its report on Monday:</p>

<p>"To date, stress on US banks has been reflected almost exclusively in funding and interest rate risk related to monetary policy tightening, but a worsening in asset quality will likely come,"&nbsp;</p>

<p>The report added:</p>

<p>"We continue to expect a mild recession in early 2024, and given the funding strains on the US banking sector, there will likely be a tightening of credit conditions and rising loan losses for US banks."</p>

Bitcoin impervious to banking woes
<p>As the noose around the US banking sector continues tightening, an asset class completely outside of the entire traditional financial system has just broken higher. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are perhaps being seen as a tech asset class that has already seen its bear market bottom, and is now ripe for investment.</p>
<p>Bitcoin ripped higher on Monday and into Tuesday, climbing from a $28,700 low to as high as $30,200. The price has since returned to confirm the top of a bull flag, and should it hold above, higher prices can certainly follow.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has remained trapped in a downward channel since the latter part of June. With the last couple of days of positive price action, is bitcoin now ready to go higher?</p>
A bull flag breakout?
<p>Bitcoin has been in an accumulation phase for the past seven weeks. Following a spike higher from a mid-June low of $24,800, the price almost reached $32,000 before rolling over and following the downwards channel it is currently trying to free itself from.</p>
<p>Positive price action since Monday saw bitcoin emerge from its bull flag. However, Wednesday sees price trying to hold the top of the flag. Whether it is successful or not will signal the next phase of price action. If the breakout of the bull flag does get confirmed, bitcoin has the possibility to go much higher, with a measured move out of the flag taking it to $35,000, which would potentially turn $30,000 into new support.</p>
<p>However, failure to break out of the flag can bring bitcoin ever closer to its major support of the uptrend which is underpinned by the 200-day moving average. A bounce here would be even more likely.</p>
Bears and bulls evenly balanced
<p>In fact the chart and fundamentals for bitcoin do look ridiculously bullish. It therefore has to be wondered why there is still so much bearish sentiment around the number one crypto asset?</p>
<p>The Fear and Greed Index has been oscillating around the Neutral 50 value since the beginning of the year, signalling that bitcoin is balanced on a 50/50 market sentiment for higher or lower prices.</p>
<p>It appears that something is needed to tip bitcoin one way or the other, and despite regulatory overhang of the crypto industry and the extremely negative pursuit of the foremost crypto exchanges of Binance and Coinbase by the SEC, there is still enough positive sentiment to balance things up.</p>
Why keep currency in the bank?
<p>In bitcoin&rsquo;s favour, it does have to be wondered why people would choose to keep their fiat currency in banks. On the one hand there is the resulting reduction in purchasing power of fiat currency as central banks print more of it in order to pay debts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are the banks themselves. Only propped up by the printing out of thin air of their own central banks. As exposure to commercial real estate and other bad debts become due, the central banks are going to have to hammer further on the keyboard digits in order to inflate even further.</p>
<p>If one is to add all this negativity to the fact that we are living in an age where banks are becoming obsolescent, then all the currency being poured into propping them up would just appear to lead to much more pain for the average citizen, who must bear this cost through inflation and an accelerating loss in purchasing power.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a major decision taken on the 8th of August, Bitstamp has announced that it would suspend trading for several cryptocurrencies identified as securities by the SEC in cases against Binance and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The impacted tokens will no longer be available to trade by the end of August.&nbsp;</p>
Bitstamp Moves To Suspend Tokens&nbsp;
<p>According to the announcement, several prominent cryptocurrencies will soon be blocked, rendering US-based users unable to trade them. These include Axie Infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), Chiliz (CHZ), Near Protocol (NEAR), Polygon (MATIC), The Sandbox (SAND), and Solana (SOL). As per the company&rsquo;s announcement, after delisting the above-mentioned cryptocurrencies, the platform will offer only 30 listed cryptocurrencies. The cryptocurrency exchange urged users to execute all trades involving these tokens by the 29th of August, following which they will become unavailable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Update for our US users Starting the 29th of August: AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL trading will be halted after evaluating recent market developments. Execute any open trades. Holding and withdrawing tokens afterwards will be unaffected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the exchange, US trading of the tokens will be permanently disabled after the 29th of August. However, customers can still withdraw and hold the tokens after the date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We kindly request our users to promptly execute any desired buy or sell orders involving the affected assets before the 29th of August, 2023. After this deadline, trading activities related to AXS, CHZ, MANA, MATIC, NEAR, SAND, and SOL will be permanently disabled on the Bitstamp platform.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Recent Developments&rdquo; Led To Decision&nbsp;
<p>The announcement pointed at recent market developments as the reason behind the suspension of trading of the cryptocurrencies mentioned. While the firm did not provide a concrete reason, all of the tokens mentioned in the announcement have been alleged to be unregistered securities by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Securities and Exchange Commission identified the cryptocurrencies in question as unregistered securities in separate complaints against Binance and Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Bitstamp has not delisted other assets mentioned in the cases against Binance and Coinbase. These assets include Nexo (NEXO), Algorand (ALGO), and Cardano (ADA).&nbsp;</p>
Other Platforms Have Also Delisted Assets&nbsp;
<p>The allegations against the tokens made by the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to be proven in a court of law. However, other platforms have voluntarily delisted specific assets mentioned by the SEC in the cases. In recent months, several platforms, including Bakkt, Robinhood, and Revolut, have delisted Polygon (MATIC), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The platforms seem to have delisted these three cryptocurrencies because they are among the largest assets which the SEC targets. Following the developments, projects such as The Sandbox have also started mandating Know Your Customer (KYC) verification for SAND staking. According to the SEC, a total of 68 cryptocurrencies are unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Projects Reject Claims&nbsp;
<p>However, cryptocurrency projects have repeatedly rejected the claims made by the Securities and Exchange Commission, either directly or indirectly. The Solana Foundation, in a statement, has said that it categorically disagrees with the SEC&rsquo;s observations. Cardano&rsquo;s parent company IOHK has also denied ADA&rsquo;s security status. Meanwhile, Polygon Labs has said its operations were focused outside the US, beyond the reach and jurisdiction of the SEC. From the looks of things, it appears that actions taken around the assets in question are precautionary, and it remains to be seen if the SEC will take any action against the tokens or platforms in the future.&nbsp;</p>
SEC Action Against Binance&nbsp;And Coinbase
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s suits against Coinbase and Binance have led to an uncertain future for major listed tokens. The regulatory body&rsquo;s two lawsuits against the crypto exchanges in question have cast a long shadow on the 19 tokens mentioned in both filings. The SEC has accused Binance and Coinbase of offering unregistered securities to the public through their respective platforms. The suit once again brings into focus lingering questions about whether cryptos are a security, commodity, or otherwise.</p>
