The service will provide dedicated wallets to qualified accounts to maximize protection of customers&#x2019; funds on the platform. The exchange also recently released the latest snapshot of its Merkle tree Proof of Reserves to reassure users that their assets are held in 1:1 reserves.</p>
<p>To be qualified for the Fund Custody service, users will have to store more than or equal to 100,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> worth of combined assets (including spot, futures, Bitget Earn, fiat currency, and leverage) on the platform. Once the application is approved, the user will then be assigned a separate custodial wallet, with its own dedicated address to check and withdraw funds separated from the main reserve.</p>
<p>Storing the asset in a separate wallet prevents users&#x2019; funds from being affected in case of emergencies such as an exchange run, or other cybersecurity threats. The wallet assets will be rounded on a daily basis to make sure the user still meets the required conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, Bitget has recently updated its Merkle tree snapshot as of December 31, 2022, and the latest reserve ratio of the most popular tokens are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> reserves are held at 650%</li>
<li><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> reserves are held at 185%</li>
<li><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> reserves are held at 237%</li>
</ul>
<p>The exchange is committed to be fully reserved holding customers&#x2019; assets on the platform at least on a 1:1 reserves ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Gracy Chen, Managing Director of Bitget</strong>, remarks, &#x201C;Protecting our customers&#x2019; assets is, and always will be, our top priority at Bitget. Ever since the collapse of some bad actors in the industry, we have taken a series of initiatives for heightened protection. In addition to the security offered with our US$300 million Bitget Protection Fund and Merkle tree Proof of Reserves, we are proud to announce our Fund Custody service. The new service, equipped with industry-grade security systems and dedicated wallet addresses for qualified users, shall further foster transparency and elevate safety for our users and their funds.&#x201D;</p>

According to the report, 2023 growth forecasts have been cut across the board, with the global economy projected to grow by 1.7% in 2023 and 2.7% in 2024. The World Bank also cited a number of adverse developments that could push the world&#8217;s economy into a deep recession.</strong></p>
<h2>World Bank Report Urges Action on Climate Change, Increased Investment to Offset Adverse Economic Shocks</h2>
<p>The World Bank, the financial organization with 174 member countries, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2023/01/10/global-economic-prospects">released</a> its Global Economic Prospects report on Tuesday. The report envisions a &#8220;sharp, long-lasting slowdown to hit developing countries hard.&#8221; The World Bank cites <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/top-three-macroeconomic-events-to-watch-in-2023-amid-volatile-market-conditions/">numerous issues</a> plaguing the global economy, including the Covid-19 pandemic and &#8220;escalating geopolitical tensions,&#8221; as reasons why the world&#8217;s economy could spiral into a recession. The report also mentions <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uncertainty-surrounds-federal-reserves-future-plans-for-rate-hikes/">interest rate hikes</a> by central banks and &#8220;higher-than-expected inflation&#8221; as contributing factors to the &#8220;adverse developments.&#8221;</p>

<p>The World Bank&#8217;s <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/38030/GEP-January-2023.pdf">report</a> further detailed that inflation has dropped to some degree at the end of 2022. It also noted that skyrocketing commodity and energy prices have subsided for the time being. The World Bank warns, however, that global economies will likely still see inflation persist, and supply disruptions could stem from adversities such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war in Europe. If inflation persists, the World Bank warns that benchmark bank rates could continue to climb in order to curb inflationary pressures.</p>

<p>“Growth in advanced economies is projected to slow from 2.5% in 2022 to 0.5% in 2023. Over the past two decades, slowdowns of this scale have foreshadowed a global recession,” the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report details. “In the United States, growth is forecast to fall to 0.5% in 2023—1.9 percentage points below previous forecasts and the weakest performance outside of official recessions since 1970. In 2023, euro-area growth is expected at zero percent—a downward revision of 1.9 percentage points. In China, growth is projected at 4.3% in 2023—0.9 percentage point below previous forecasts.”</p>

<p>The report&#8217;s summary concludes that one thing that can help the global economy is by improving &#8220;long-term growth prospects by bolstering resilience to climate change.&#8221; The World Bank insists that policymakers need to &#8220;address climate change and support people affected by crises and hunger.&#8221; In order to &#8220;offset the long-term damage from the adverse shocks of the past three years,&#8221; emerging markets and developing economies will need to &#8220;substantially increase investment,&#8221; according to the World Bank&#8217;s report.</p>

<h2>DOJ Takes Action Against NFT Rug Pull Scheme</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced Thursday that Aurelien Michel has been charged with &#8220;defrauding purchasers of &#8216;Mutant Ape Planet&#8217; NFTs, a type of digital asset, of more than $2.9 million in cryptocurrency.&#8221;</p>
<p>The defendant is a French national residing in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). He was arrested Wednesday at John F. Kennedy International Airport.</p>
<p>The Mutant Ape Planet (MAP) NFTs were marketed and sold with false promises of numerous rewards and benefits, including exclusive opportunities for additional investments, giveaways, merchandise, and other rewards, the DOJ detailed, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>After selling out of the NFTs, the purchasers were &#8216;rug pulled&#8217; … Millions worth of the NFT purchasers&#8217; cryptocurrency was diverted for Michel&#8217;s personal benefit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mutant Ape Planet is a collection of 6,799 unique mutant apes that has no relationship with the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club, a different set of monkey-themed NFTs.</p>
<p>Ivan J. Arvelo, special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) in New York, described: &#8220;Aurelien Michel perpetrated a &#8216;rug pull&#8217; scheme &#8211; stealing nearly $3 million from investors for his own personal use.&#8221;</p>

<p>The DOJ noted that &#8220;in a social media chat with current and prospective purchasers, Michel admitted to the fraudulent &#8216;rug pull,&#8217; but blamed the community of NFT purchasers for his actions, stating, &#8216;We never intended to rug but the community went way too toxic.'&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Mutant Ape Planet NFT developers &#8220;promised to fund a community wallet for marketing, and would offer purchasers raffles, giveaways, airdrops, and tokens with staking features,&#8221; the DOJ said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The purchasers of the Mutant Ape Planet NFTs did not receive any of the promised benefits set out above.</p></blockquote>

Four days ago, the stablecoin dropped to $0.972 per unit and on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, USDD slipped to $0.977 per unit. At the time of writing, the Tron-issued stablecoin is trading at 98 cents per coin.</strong></p>
<h2>USDD Stablecoin Dips Down to 97 Cents per Token</h2>
<p>There have been some slight fluctuations in <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdd">USDD&#x2019;s price</a> at the start of the new year, as the stablecoin has dipped to the 97-cent range on a few occasions in 2023. After Terra&#x2019;s stablecoin depegging event in May 2022, USDD <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trons-usdd-remains-below-the-1-parity-for-24-hours-token-hits-a-low-at-0-95-per-unit/">started</a> to slip slightly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/usdd-continues-to-trade-for-under-1-tron-dao-reserve-insists-stablecoin-has-not-depegged/">below the $1 peg</a>, causing anxiety in the crypto industry. A number of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/defi-protocol-abracadabras-stablecoin-mim-briefly-slides-to-0-91-during-the-crypto-market-rout/">other stablecoins</a> saw similar <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-usdn-trades-below-1-parity-for-14-days-in-a-row-token-taps-0-91-low-this-week/">deviations</a>. On June 19, 2022, USDD reached a low of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/trons-usdd-regains-stability-after-tapping-an-all-time-low-at-0-92/">92.8 cents per unit</a>, but the stablecoin managed to regain the $1 peg, trading between 98 cents and 99 cents per unit.</p>

<p>In mid-Dec. 2022, USDD deviated from the $1 parity, and Tron&#x2019;s Justin Sun said that the team deployed more capital. USDD has seen fluctuations in value since Dec. 11, 2022, and it reached a low of $0.971 on Dec. 13, 2022, according to coingecko.com statistics. Last week, a similar instance occurred as the USDD price dipped to $0.972 per unit on Jan. 6, 2023. Charts show that USDD&#x2019;s action four days later on Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2023, indicates that the stablecoin slid to a low of $0.977 per unit during the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>According to the project&#x2019;s <a href="https://tdr.org/#/">Tron DAO Reserve page</a>, USDD is over-collateralized by 202.41% compared to projects like DAI, which is 120%, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC at 100%. USDD is currently the eighth-largest stablecoin by market capitalization, which is $710.03 million at the time of writing on Tuesday 4 p.m. Eastern Time. The number of USDD in circulation is higher at 725,332,035.</p>

<p>Currently, there is roughly $33.44 million in global USDD trade volume during the past 24 hours. With USDD trading at 97 cents at times, it means that someone who owns 1,000 USDD can only get around $970 in U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, the rest of the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">top ten stablecoins</a> on Jan. 10, 2023, are trading for USD values between $0.997 to $1. Statistics further show that USDD&#x2019;s coins in circulation grew by 0.8% over the last 30 days.</p>

<h2>Examination of Overseas Remittances to China Uncovers Strong Correlation with South Korea&#x2019;s &#x2018;Kimchi Premium&#x2019;</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1544612322004056?via%3Dihub">study</a> conducted by Jangyoun Lee, an assistant professor at Incheon National University, and Taehee Oh of the Bank of Korea, South Korea&#x2019;s kimchi premium appears to be significantly correlated with an influx of overseas remittances to China. The researchers note that the first instance of the kimchi premium in South Korea occurred in 2016, when there was high demand for bitcoin among Korean investors but a limited supply of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Essentially, the kimchi premium refers to the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets being significantly higher in South Korea than on Western exchanges.</p>
<p>The researchers detailed that the team analyzed financial data concerning overseas remittances to China from approximately 1,211 foreign exchange businesses between Jan. 2016 and May 2021. Prior to Jan. 2018, during the bitcoin bull run of 2017, the researchers stated that the premium peaked at close to 55% before subsiding. However, the kimchi premium reemerged during the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/south-koreas-kimchi-premium-returns-btc-prices-up-8-higher-than-global-average/">first quarter of 2021</a>, and the study&#x2019;s authors noted that on May 19, 2021, the premium jumped by more than 20% higher than the price on Western cryptocurrency trading platforms. The research paper&#x2019;s authors add:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our findings imply that Chinese arbitrageurs use Korean financial institutions as bitcoin-cashing outlets, converting virtual currencies into fiat ones when the kimchi premium was persistently high.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors of the study suggest that a significant portion of the premiums and increase in foreign arbitrageurs were related to events in China. For example, the paper details that while China banned cryptocurrencies, South Korea and countries like the U.S. decided to regulate the industry. &#x201C;Therefore, Chinese arbitrageurs could only cash out their cryptocurrencies outside of the country,&#x201D; according to the producers of the &#x201C;kimchi premium&#x201D; research paper.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This paper shows that the kimchi premium was positively related to the upsurge of remittances to China after controlling for the important drivers that directly impact it, such as equities, bonds, foreign exchanges, and the real economy,&#x201D; the writers of the paper contend. The authors further posit that the findings illustrate the complexities of the global cryptocurrency market and that international standards and common regulations are necessary to protect investors. South Korea has been a &#x201C;target of cryptocurrency arbitrage traders exploiting excess demand,&#x201D; the paper insists.</p>
<h2>South Korean Bitcoin Premiums in 2023</h2>
<p>The kimchi premium persists to this day, and at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Jan. 9, 2023, the price of Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) on Upbit and Bithumb, two of South Korea&#x2019;s top cryptocurrency exchanges, was around $17,427 to $17,437 per unit. However, at the same exact time, using the global average on coinmarketcap.com, the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> on Western exchanges was $17,205 per coin. This means that arbitrage traders swapping <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> can fetch a premium of around 1.35% on South Korean exchanges, and there is also a difference in the prices of ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) on Western exchanges compared to its value on South Korean exchanges.</p>

<p>High premiums for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> have also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-blazes-past-2400-and-higher-in-japan-india-and-south-korea/">occurred</a> periodically on the Japanese cryptocurrency exchange market. Premiums on bitcoin have further been observed in countries such as Thailand, Hong Kong, Brazil, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Chile. Furthermore, before in-person trades were banned on the trading platform Localbitcoins, arbitrage opportunities were readily available. While the trend has decreased depending on the country and the liquidity of bitcoin in the region, foreign arbitrageurs can still profit from exchanging funds between two locations.</p>

Another report, published on Jan. 10, 2023, details that Singh met with federal prosecutors at an alleged proffer session held at the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office for the Southern District of New York. Furthermore, federal prosecutors have disclosed that the investigation into alleged fraud at FTX and involving Sam Bankman-Fried is so expansive that the prosecutor&#8217;s office in the Southern District of New York could exhaust all of its resources.</strong></p>
<h2>Former FTX Director Nishad Singh Under Investigation by SDNY Prosecutors, Possible Cooperation Could Leave SBF Isolated</h2>
<p>Five days ago, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-05/us-closing-in-on-bankman-fried-s-inner-circle-with-singh-probe?sref=zNmRQ0gk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">report</a> detailed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/3-ftx-execs-have-snitched-on-sbf-now-scrutiny-is-aimed-at-nishad-singh-and-ramnik-arora/">Nishad Singh</a>, the former director of engineering at FTX, was on the radar of U.S. law enforcement officials from the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The information was disclosed by &#8220;people familiar with the matter&#8221; and Singh&#8217;s activities in recent times have been unknown.</p>
<p>What is known about the former FTX director of engineering is that he donated $9.3 million to Democratic political candidates since 2020. Singh allegedly contributed code to the FTX platform and bankruptcy documents detail Singh borrowed $543 million from Alameda Research before the businesses collapsed.</p>

<p>&mdash; zerohedge (@zerohedge) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1612602890178400257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>On Tuesday, another <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/third-bankman-fried-associate-nishad-singh-met-with-prosecutors?utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">report</a> published by Bloomberg detailed that Singh has been seen in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) region and has held proffer sessions with local law enforcement. Oftentimes, proffer sessions are meant to allow defendants or suspects to reduce or absolve their criminal exposure.</p>
<p>However, they don&#8217;t always work out for the individual and after a proffer session is all said and done, a participant can still be charged with the same criminal offenses. Singh&#8217;s alleged meetings were also documented and disclosed by &#8220;people familiar with the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s Ava Benny-Morrison detailed that if Singh is cooperating in the same fashion as FTX co-founder Gary Wang and ex-Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison, it could leave SBF&#8217;s Sam Bankman-Fried &#8220;increasingly isolated.&#8221; Benny-Morrison reached out to the prosecutor&#8217;s office in the Southern District of New York and Singh&#8217;s lawyer, Andrew D. Goldstein, and both offices &#8220;declined to comment.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to the alleged proffer sessions with Singh and SDNY prosecutors, Fox Business Network&#8217;s Charles Gasparino detailed this week that prosecutors complained that resources may be exhausted in the fraud investigation involving FTX and SBF.</p>
<p>“Prosecutors are telling lawyers connected to [the Sam Bankman-Fried] fraud investigation the case is so sprawling that it could exhaust resources of the Southern District since it includes potential bribery, campaign contribution violations, market manipulation on top of theft [and] fraud,” Gasparino <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1612449174225551361?s=20&amp;t=Pr_5jRv8H_RiwcDUwykiqA">wrote</a> on Monday. Quite a few individuals joked about the government’s situation and others mocked SBF. “Exhausting resources is what SBF seems to be best at,” one individual jokingly <a href="https://twitter.com/theklineventure/status/1612669727025025025?s=20&amp;t=Pr_5jRv8H_RiwcDUwykiqA">remarked</a>.</p>

Winklevoss is demanding that the DCG board remove Silbert from his role as CEO, as Gemini believes &#8220;there is no path forward&#8221; with Silbert in charge.</strong></p>
<h2>Gemini and Digital Currency Group Dispute Continues With Another Open Letter</h2>
<p>About a week ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/geminis-cameron-winklevoss-insists-digital-currency-group-needs-to-resolve-liquidity-issues-in-open-letter-to-ceo-barry-silbert/">reported</a> on an open letter from Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder of the Gemini crypto exchange, to Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert. In the letter, Winklevoss called on Silbert to address <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-owes-gemini-customers-900-million-exchange-is-attempting-to-recoup-assets/">liquidity issues</a> between Gemini and DCG subsidiary firm Genesis Global Capital. Winklevoss, the Gemini executive, alleged that DCG owes $1.675 billion to Genesis&#8217; lending arm. However, Silbert strongly disputed Winklevoss&#8217;s statements after the letter was made public.</p>
<p>&#8220;DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis,&#8221; Silbert <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1609926715454771200?s=20&amp;t=qp5z-mpdg1MtNfCYzlBHGA">tweeted</a> at the time. &#8220;DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; the next loan maturity is May 2023.&#8221; After Silbert&#8217;s statement, Winklevoss continued to call on Silbert and DCG to take action, and set a deadline for DCG to respond by Jan. 8, 2023. It&#8217;s unclear whether DCG or Silbert made any attempts to resolve the issue with Gemini, but the open letter sent to DCG&#8217;s board suggests that no agreements were reached during that time frame.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Earn Update: An Open Letter to the Board of <a href="https://twitter.com/DCGco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DCGco</a> <a href="https://t.co/eakuFjDZR2">pic.twitter.com/eakuFjDZR2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1612806661508567042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the <a href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1612806661508567042?s=20&amp;t=Z1P8VKQHHWs4U1Jk3Np9PA">open letter</a> to the board members of DCG, Winklevoss alleges that Genesis loaned $2.36 billion to the now-bankrupt crypto hedge fund <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/three-arrows-capital-founders-served-subpoenas-via-twitter-in-bankruptcy-process/">Three Arrows Capital</a> (3AC). According to Winklevoss, after the funds were reportedly liquidated, &#8220;Genesis was left with a loss of at least $1.2 billion.&#8221; &#8220;At this point, Barry Silbert had two legitimate options: restructure the Genesis loan book (inside or outside of bankruptcy court) or fill the $1.2 billion hole,&#8221; Winklevoss opined. &#8220;He did neither.&#8221; The Gemini co-founder claims that DCG and Genesis actively made &#8220;false statements and misrepresentations&#8221; regarding the supposed hole and financial situation of Genesis.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>Winklevoss’s open letter insists:</p>
<blockquote><p>They did so in an effort to mislead lenders into believing that DCG had absorbed massive losses that Genesis incurred from the Three Arrows Capital (3AC) collapse and induce lenders to continue making loans to Genesis. By lying, they hoped to buy time to dig themselves out of the hole they created.</p></blockquote>
<p>The open letter from the Gemini co-founder generated a significant response after it was made public on Twitter. As of the time of writing, however, Silbert, an executive with DCG, has not responded to Winklevoss&#8217;s allegations as he did the previous week. &#8220;It&#8217;s never a good sign when a CEO writes an open letter to a [third] party with whom they are transacting at this level,&#8221; one individual <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyCom/status/1612807383012773888?s=20&amp;t=Z1P8VKQHHWs4U1Jk3Np9PA">commented</a> on Winklevoss&#8217;s letter to the DCG board members. &#8220;Good luck to the everyday investors caught up in this. Hopefully, every high-paid person accountable takes responsibility [and] it&#8217;s not a finger-pointing contest,&#8221; the individual added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know that there are courts these days? Just file a lawsuit instead of these stupid letters on Twitter,&#8221; another person <a href="https://twitter.com/yeg0rpetrov/status/1612822663352963072?s=20&amp;t=Z1P8VKQHHWs4U1Jk3Np9PA">tweeted</a>.</p>

As of writing, the global crypto market cap is trading 0.20% lower, however the meme coin is up by nearly 5%. Apecoin also surged in today’s session, as it rose to its strongest point since November.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) was one of Tuesday’s notable gainers, as prices of the token rose for a sixth straight session.</p>
<p>SHIB/USD surged to an high of $0.000009593 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.000008603.</p>
<p>As a result of this latest surge in price, shiba inu climbed to its highest point since December 5.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears as though today’s rally came following an upwards crossover of the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen above a recent ceiling at 65.50.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 67.50, with the next visible ceiling at the 73.00 zone.</p>

<h2>Apecoin (APE)</h2>
<p>Apecoin (APE) was another big mover in today’s session, extending recent gains to a fifth consecutive day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $4.50 to start the week, APE/USD raced to an intraday peak of $4.98 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move pushed apecoin to its highest level since November 5, and came following a breakout of a price ceiling at $4.60.</p>

<p>As a result of today’s surge, the RSI on the APE chart is now at its strongest point on record, with a reading of 79.09.</p>
<p>This means that prices are now deep in overbought territory, which could mean that bears are preparing for reentry.</p>
<p>Despite this potential reversal, bulls are seemingly still targeting a ceiling at $5.30, which hasn’t been hit since October 11.</p>

Ethereum&#x2019;s core developers emphasized that staked withdrawals are a priority and code related to EVM Object Format changes, or EOF, was removed from Shanghai to ensure that the focus remains on staked withdrawals.</strong></p>
<h2>Staked Withdrawal Priority: Shanghai Public Testnet Deployment Scheduled for February, Hard Fork Tentatively Set for March</h2>
<p>During the first week of December 2022, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereums-shanghai-hard-fork-could-happen-in-march-2023-eth-dev-says-staking-withdrawals-is-the-highest-priority/">reported</a> on the 151st Ethereum developers meeting, and the programmers recently finished the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmcMwdHZqg8">152nd meeting</a> on Jan. 5, 2023. The meeting mostly focused on the removal of EOF implementation from Shanghai, and developers decided not to review any Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) related to EOF until the Shanghai hard fork has completed.</p>
<p>Both Galaxy Digital&#x2019;s research associate Christine Kim and Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1611042386611929089?s=20&t=7p-zJiIE61yjeiW32eEaDQ">summarized</a> the ACD meeting. &#x201C;On the Shanghai front, a first devnet was set up with all client combinations right before Christmas,&#x201D; Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1611042694142492673?s=20&t=zOh39Tk2CVpAOpqBsJUBtw">said</a> after the meeting. &#x201C;While they are all running, some pairs have more issues than others.&#x201D;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-567949 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ov.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="300" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ov-300x70.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ov-1024x240.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ov-768x180.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ov.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>Galaxy&#x2019;s research associate <a href="https://www.galaxy.com/research/insights/ethereum-all-core-developers-execution-call-152/">explained</a> that Devops programmer Barnabus Busa updated the team on the testing of staked <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> withdrawals. &#x201C;He said that the current developer test network for Shanghai, which was launched just before Christmas, has already progressed to block 4,000,&#x201D; Kim said. &#x201C;All EL and CL client combinations are currently running on this testnet. A few client combinations such as Teku-Erigon and Lighthouse-Erigon are experiencing issues.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Withdrawing staked ether has been a major concern for the community, and many want to know when it will happen. The Ethereum developers suggested that a new testnet will be deployed next month, with the Shanghai hard fork tentatively scheduled to go live by March.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, there is <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa">15.96 million</a> ether locked into the Beacon deposit contract. Additionally, the network is just days away from reaching <a href="https://beaconcha.in/charts/validators">500,000 validators</a>. The Shanghai fork will be the next major upgrade for the Ethereum development team since The Merge.</p>

Following a move to a three-week peak to start the week, markets maintained bullish sentiment, earlier in the day. Bitcoin also upheld recent momentum, with the coin remaining near its ceiling at $17,400.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) continued to trade close to the $17,200 level in today&#x2019;s session, as traders moved to secure Monday&#x2019;s gains.</p>
<p>Following a low of $17,162.99 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit a high of $17,389.96 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>However, earlier gains have since diminished, with the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency currently trading at $17,271.27.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s price consolidation came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) continued to hover close to a key resistance at the 60.00 mark.</p>
<p>Despite the index currently tracking above this point at 60.89, price uncertainty has heightened, leading to previous bulls abandoning positions.</p>
<p>Traders may once again attempt to move beyond a price ceiling at $17,400, however this may come later in the week following the release of U.S. inflation data.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved into consolidation on Tuesday, as prices failed to break out of a key resistance point of $1,350 on Monday.</p>
<p>Earlier in today&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD moved to a peak of $1,342.14, before then dropping to a bottom at $1,317.24.</p>
<p>Like with bitcoin, today&#x2019;s consolidation in ethereum comes as traders opted to take profits, after the coin rallied to a multi-week high yesterday.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, yesterday&#x2019;s gain pushed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> into overbought territory, leading to a slowing down of upward momentum.</p>
<p>Currently, the RSI is tracking at 68.08, which is its strongest point since late October, and close to a ceiling of 70.00</p>
<p>In order for bullish momentum to extend recent gains, this ceiling will first need to be overcome.</p>
