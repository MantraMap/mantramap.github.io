<p>The oft-bullish Tom Lee of Fundstrat Global Advisors has shared a prediction for the price of Bitcoin. Lee believes the approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States could steer the classic crypto’s price to over $150,000.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-at-180-000"><strong>Bitcoin At $180,000</strong></h2>



<p>Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is once again singing Bitcoin’s tune and this time proclaiming that the OG cryptocurrency is likely to hit over $150,000 by the end of 2024.</p>



<p>Speaking during an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s&amp;ab_channel=CNBCTelevision">interview </a>with <em>CNBC’s Squawk Box</em>, Lee suggested that a string of Bitcoin spot ETF approvals would shift Bitcoin’s supply-demand dynamics towards substantial price appreciation. He believes the SEC’s nod on these sought-after investment vehicles has no other choice but to catapult Bitcoin to $150,000, even reaching the $180,000 mark.</p>



<p>&#8220;If the spot Bitcoin [ETF] gets approved, I think the demand will be greater than the daily supply of bitcoin,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ir8jYyrBY5s">said</a>, explaining: &#8220;So the clearing price — this is done by our crypto digital strategist — is over $150,000. It could even be like $180,000.&#8221;</p>



<p>Traditional finance bigwigs <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity</a>,<a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/"> Invesco, Wisdom Tree</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">ARK Invest</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-craze-valkyrie-becomes-the-latest-firm-to-apply-for-sec-approval/">Valkyrie </a>followed the world’s biggest asset manager <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-primed-for-trillion-dollar-boost-as-blackrock-expects-landmark-bitcoin-etf-approval/">BlackRock </a>in filing for a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF with the SEC in June. Just last week, the commission pumped the brakes on Cathie Wood’s ARK 21Shares application.</p>



<p>According to Lee, Bitcoin ETFs have gained traction globally, but an endorsement by U.S. regulators would undoubtedly be a huge milestone for the cryptocurrency sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-bitcoin-will-still-surge-without-spot-etf"><strong>Why Bitcoin Will Still Surge Without Spot ETF</strong></h2>



<p>Lee further pointed out the connection between crypto assets and the wider economic backdrop. He affirmed that the stabilization of interest rates could usher in more relaxed financial conditions. That could bring upside volatility in risky assets, including cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>But even if a spot Bitcoin ETF does not get greenlighted, Lee still thinks that the flagship crypto still has upside potential due to the upcoming halving event.</p>



<p><em>“You will have a drop in supply again, so the clearing price has to increase. But it won’t be six figures.”</em></p>



<p>Roughly every four years, the Bitcoin rewards awarded to miners for successfully mining a block are slashed by 50% as a way of regulating the blockchain&#8217;s supply economics. The next halving, scheduled for Apr. 26, 2024, will reduce the reward to 3.125 BTC per block from the current 6.25 BTC.</p>



<p>In fact, other pundits have predicted that a $100K BTC price tag could come much sooner than many expect, with Blockstream boss <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pundits-100000-bitcoin-price-target-by-next-halving-sparks-exciting-bet/">Adam Back </a>recently betting that the top crypto will achieve the lofty new high the month before the halving.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs has defended itself against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for years in a case that could define the crypto industry just like the often-cited Howey case—the SEC alleged that Ripple and its executives Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen had sold <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-claps-back-at-secs-request-to-challenge-ruling-that-xrp-isnt-a-security/">XRP as an unregistered security</a>. Now it seems Ripple has to fight not only the SEC but also media misinformation, as many big news outlets reported that the SEC was appealing the ruling that XRP is not a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-judge-torres-ruling-mean"><strong>What Does Judge Torres’ Ruling Mean?</strong></h2>



<p>Judge Analisa Torres of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York said in her July ruling that XRP in and of itself was not necessarily a security. She also granted the SEC request pertaining to sales of XRP qualifying as securities transactions, namely to institutional investors. Judge Torres stated that approximately $728.9 million of those XRP sold meet the criteria of securities, citing the <em>‘presence of a common enterprise and an expectation of profit’.</em></p>



<p>Both Judge Torres in the SEC vs Ripple case and Judge Rakoff in the Terra-Luna case agreed that the mere existence of an asset does not make it a security by itself, but rather the promise to grow and share profits from an asset turns it into a security. Rakoff also agreed with Torres that an agreement between parties is essential for an investment contract.</p>



<p>During the case, the SEC stated that all XRP sales are securities since the XRP coin itself &#8220;embodies&#8221; all of Ripple&#8217;s promises ever made to any buyer, even if it was just one single buyer. This differentiation was one of the key battles in this case.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-latest-sec-filing-is-and-what-it-isn-t"><strong>What the Latest SEC Filing is And What it isn’t</strong></h2>



<p>Now, even the SEC itself is changing its language, no longer calling cryptocurrencies digital asset securities, as the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/judge-in-ripple-court-fight-grants-secs-appeal-bid-bad-omen-for-xrp/">recent filing</a> states: <em>“The SEC did not argue here or in Terraform that the asset underlying those investment contracts were necessarily a security (and the SEC does not seek appellate review of any holding relating to the fact that the underlying assets here are nothing but computer code with no inherent value).”</em></p>



<p>Regarding the current filing the SEC has made, this is entirely regarding the SEC asking for an expedited appeal about the defendant&#8217;s programmatic and other sales and not about the token XRP itself. The SEC is asking Judge Torres to allow the SEC to make an early appeal with the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, also called an interlocutory appeal.</p>



<p>Notably, the filing is not an appeal and Judge Torres has not granted this motion. It will, however, allow her to explain in detail her reasoning while addressing what Judge Rakoff said.</p>



<p>In legal cases, the losing party can usually appeal unfavourable decisions after the case ends. The SEC says an early appeal is needed because the Ripple case is relevant to other pending cases. Usually, appeals wait till the case ceases to avoid delays. Ripple disagrees with the SEC saying no exception is needed, while Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen say that even if an appeal is granted, the case and appeal can run together.</p>



<p>The ‘case’ refers to whether Garlinghouse and Larsen ‘aided and abetted’ Ripple’s violation of securities laws. This issue is scheduled to go before a jury in 2024.</p>

<p>At the 5th Blockchain Futurist Conference held in Toronto, Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous lead developer of the Shiba Ecosystem, delivered a rousing keynote speech titled &#8220;Dear Humanity.&#8221; The event, which took place from August 15 to 16, saw Kusama addressing the crowd about his bold vision for the cryptocurrency industry and the world.</p>



<p>Kusama&#8217;s speech began by acknowledging the pressing need for change, underscoring the challenges humanity faces due to man-made issues like inflation, rumours of war, and natural disasters. He expressed discontent with the concentration of power among a select few who possess secret knowledge, suggesting that harnessing the collective power of the masses could lead to a brighter future. Central to Kusama&#8217;s vision is the Shiba Inu community, affectionately known as the Shib Army. He emphasized that the strength of this community sets Shiba Inu apart, empowering it to enact lasting change on the global stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-memecoin-at-the-edge-of-tomorrow"><strong>A Memecoin at The Edge of Tomorrow</strong></h2>



<p>Challenging the audience to consider the potential impact of a simple meme, Kusama posed the question: <em>Can a joke born as an experiment create a lasting transformation on a worldwide scale?</em> He assured the audience that Shiba Ecosystem would offer cutting-edge technology like other blockchain projects, but the Shib Army&#8217;s commitment to a decentralized future is the true differentiator.</p>



<p>Despite criticism from detractors who spread fears, uncertainties, and doubts (FUD) about the Shiba Ecosystem, Kusama remained steadfast in his vision. While the lead developer refrained from making any Shibarium-related announcements during his brief five-minute speech, he indicated that an announcement might be imminent. Responding to queries about Shibarium&#8217;s launch date, Kusama cryptically stated, <em>&#8220;GOOD question! Let&#8217;s see what we say about that tomorrow,&#8221;</em> leaving the audience in anticipation.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-token-falls-11-following-shibarium-deployment-heres-reason-why/">Shibarium</a>, the eagerly anticipated layer-2 scalability solution within the Shiba Ecosystem, took center stage in discussions at the conference.</p>



<p>The Blockchain Futurist Conference, known for its commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology, partnered with Bad Idea AI to ensure that Kusama&#8217;s keynote speech could be delivered without compromising his pseudonymous identity. The event showcased the convergence of cutting-edge technology and visionary ideas, setting the stage for potential transformative developments within the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>It has been over two years since Elon Musk announced on what was then Twitter that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/spacex-and-dogecoin-an-uncommon-alliance-to-create-dogestronauts/">Dogecoin would be going to the moon literally</a>. His tweet read: <em>“SpaceX launching satellite Doge-1 to the moon next year – Mission paid for in Doge – 1st crypto in space – 1st meme in space. To the mooooonnn!!” </em></p>



<p>The mission, which would be the first commercial journey to the moon fully paid for in Dogecoin, has since been postponed a few times by SpaceX. The Musk company is the launch provider for the mission, which is a joint task between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Geometric Energy Corporation (GEC), and Intuitive Machines.</p>



<p>The mission named Nova-C/IM-1 is now scheduled for November 15, 2023, with a six-day launch window depending on local conditions, with another window in December. The mission will use a SpaceX Falcon 9 Block 5 to launch the DOGE-1 &amp; IM-1/Nova-C payloads taking off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida.</p>



<p>The CubeSat mission, entirely funded by Dogecoin, will see small satellites circling the moon and collect data via sensors and cameras. Images are going to be broadcast to Earth and will be streamed to Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-doge-co-founder-irritated"><strong>DOGE co-founder irritated</strong></h2>



<p>The founder of Dogecoin was not amused with Musk’s plans for DOGE to become a space-faring coin saying in an interview with Business Insider, &#8220;It all annoyed me because it was this thing that had my name tied to it. I don&#8217;t think people realize it, but I wish that when something happened with Dogecoin and Elon Musk and my Dogecoin co-founder Billy [Markus] that I didn&#8217;t get dragged back into it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer founded Dogecoin as a joke in 2013, and much to their surprise has continued to gain popularity since then. The meme coin, now the 8th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has had support from celebrities like Snoop Dog and Elon Musk. The owner of X and CEO of SpaceX has often been criticized for posting hype about Dogecoin sending the price upwards.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, DOGE was down with the overall market by about 5%, selling at $0.063, according to CoinMarketCap. This is a long way from the all-time high the popular meme coin was traded for in 2021 when it reached 65 Cents in May of that year. Many in the community may be hoping the launch of DOGE-1 will also send the price of DOGE to the moon.</p>

<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is poised to approve the first-ever exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on Ethereum futures, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, citing unnamed sources.</p>



<p>This move will mark a huge win for multiple financial companies that have been advocating for the introduction of ETFs involving derivatives of the second-largest cryptocurrency for a long time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-said-to-be-ready-to-approve-etfs-based-on-ethereum-futures"><strong>SEC Said To Be Ready To Approve ETFs Based On Ethereum Futures</strong></h2>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is not likely to block the debut of ether futures trading in the U.S., according to sources.</p>



<p>Nearly a dozen companies, including ProShares, Volatility Shares, Bitwise, and Valkyrie, have recently applied to list Ethereum futures ETFs. But they need the SEC’s greenlight — something <em>Bloomberg </em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/sec-said-to-be-poised-to-allow-us-debut-of-ether-futures-etfs-eth#xj4y7vzkg">said </a>might be coming soon. Such an ETF would track the price of Ethereum futures that are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, rather than ether itself.</p>



<p>Officials have reportedly indicated that some of the applications could receive approval as early as October, with Valkyrie’s dual Bitcoin and Ether Strategy ETF being first in the line for a possible launch around Oct. 3 or Oct. 4.</p>



<p>Valkyrie also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1877493/000138713123009893/valkyrie-485apos_081523.htm">filed </a>for its Ethereum Strategy ETF earlier this week. However, the first exclusive ether futures ETF listed by Volatility Shares could go live around October 12.</p>



<p>Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he wasn&#8217;t surprised by the SEC&#8217;s expected move to approve Ethereum futures ETFs, adding that the decision indicates how the regulatory agency’s views on myriad products, such as a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/imminent-approval-of-first-u-s-spot-bitcoin-etf-grayscale-beefs-up-team-as-sec-lawsuit-ruling-looms/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> can evolve over time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This not surprising to us, we had said they would approve Ether Futures early on in race. Nice to be validated. Now what does it mean for spot? Hard to say beyond it shows that their views/policy/tolerance can change. <a href="https://t.co/JXCxNUpj2U">https://t.co/JXCxNUpj2U</a></p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1692314639235735836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The SEC has thus far refused to give its regulatory blessing to any spot bitcoin or ether ETFs. The regulator has also not yet clarified whether it considers ether a security — although it has indicated that most crypto tokens qualify as securities.</p>



<p>The approval of an ether futures ETF by the SEC brings huge implications for the crypto sector. As <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1692322452586553714">suggested </a>by crypto strategist Adam Cochran, this imminent move essentially implies that the agency does not categorize Ethereum as a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ether-dumps-amid-market-wide-sell-off"><strong>Ether Dumps Amid Market-Wide Sell-Off</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the upbeat news of the potential launch of ether futures ETFs, the industry’s second-biggest cryptocurrency suffered a massive price plunge to its lowest levels since mid-June.</p>



<p>Amid the latest market downturn, which also <a href="https://zycrypto.com/did-spacex-news-trigger-bitcoins-soul-crashing-flash-crash-to-sub-26000/">saw Bitcoin (BTC) crash below the $26,000 region</a>, ETH tumbled to as low as $1,576.13 before rebounding slightly to $1,683.54 at publication time.</p>



<p>Despite recouping some of the losses, Ethereum remains down 5.8% on the day, according to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum">CoinGecko data</a>.</p>

<p>The price of Bitcoin slipped by circa 8% in a span of 20 minutes on Aug. 17, causing the classic crypto to tumble below $26,000 — a level not seen since June 20. And as Bitcoin took the deep dive, so too did other leading crypto assets, including Ethereum.</p>



<p>The bloodbath triggered over $1 billion in liquidations, according to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData">data </a>from CoinGlass. That included over $472 million of Bitcoin liquidations and $302 million of ether liquidations. The majority of positions affected were long positions during the rush to the exits.</p>



<p>But the question on everyone’s mind is, did Elon Musk’s SpaceX have anything to do with the unexpected major sell-off in the crypto markets?</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-spacex-wrote-down-bitcoin-holdings-by-373-million"><strong>SpaceX Wrote Down Bitcoin Holdings By $373 Million</strong></h2>



<p>Initial reactions from the Crypto Twitter (X) community have attributed the steep price fall to an unsubstantiated claim that Elon Musk’s aerospace technology company SpaceX supposedly sold all of its $373 million worth of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>However, as per a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/behind-the-curtain-of-elon-musks-secretive-spacex-revenue-growth-and-rising-costs-2c828e2b">report</a>, SpaceX merely wrote down the value of its BTC stash. In accounting, this is the reduction in the book value of an asset when its fair market value has dropped below the book value. The practice is very common among businesses as it downsizes the value of any holdings for tax purposes.</p>



<p>Others attributed Bitcoin’s Thursday dive to China’s property developer Evergrande Group filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in New York.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-real-reason-behind-btc-flash-crash"><strong>Real Reason Behind BTC Flash Crash</strong></h2>



<p>While the misinformation about SpaceX&#8217;s Bitcoin sale might have played a role in the flash crash, other indicators show that a pullback was already brewing.</p>



<p>On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1692378221894160617">pointed out</a> multiple factors that were suggesting a potential price drop. CryptoQuant analysts first noted that the Bitcoin Open Interest was seeing a buildup of short positions since mid-July.</p>



<p>Secondly, the firm observed that the Bitcoin wipe-out was preceded by a period of low demand in the United States. An increase in whale spending activity before the sell-off was also noted as another potential signal. Lastly, CryptoQuant cited the prevailing negative sentiment among traders as a harbinger of the sudden move down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1024x641.png" alt="BTCUSD Chart by TradingView" class="wp-image-83770" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1024x641.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-300x188.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-768x481.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1536x962.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-2048x1283.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bitcoin has slightly recovered to $26,504.02 at the time of publication, possibly buoyed by news the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/sec-said-to-be-poised-to-allow-us-debut-of-ether-futures-etfs-eth">set to approve the first Ethereum Futures ETF product</a> as soon as October.</p>

<p>Major institutional traders may have potentially concluded their Bitcoin (BTC) accumulation phase, paving the way for a bullish trend in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>MAC D, an analyst from onchain metrics firm Santiment recently shared insights into this intriguing development in an August 12 post, noting that this could be rooted in the tumultuous events of the previous year. According to him, the significant crashes experienced in 2022, notably the LUNA and FTX crises, might have provided these institutions with opportunities to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-load-up-their-bags-as-price-teases-crucial-31000-resistance-a-breakout-incoming/">amass BTC</a> at lower prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He particularly noted that the watershed moment that triggered this speculation dates back to June 15, 2023, when BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, surprised the crypto community by announcing the filing of a Spot BTC Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). </p>



<p>This unexpected announcement departed from BlackRock&#8217;s previous stance on cryptocurrencies, leaving many market participants pondering the motives behind this strategic move. Subsequently, these institutions appear to have shifted their focus to releasing positive news and driving sentiment upward during the current year.</p>



<p><em>“It is possible that traditional financial institutions and major institutions had already completed their accumulation of BTC during the two crashes in 2022 (LUNA and FTX) and concentrated on releasing positive news in the middle of this year,”</em> wrote MAC D.</p>



<p>The pundit further highlighted two pivotal points to support his theory. The first involves the analysis of BTC transfers. Historically, major accumulations of Bitcoin through over-the-counter (OTC) transactions have coincided with market bottoms. However, this year, despite BTC&#8217;s 100% surge from its October 2022 lows, there has been a conspicuous absence of large-scale OTC transactions. According to MAC D, this absence suggests that institutional investors might have already completed their BTC accumulation, negating the need for further trades. Notably, significant <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mike-novogratz-reveals-two-catalysts-for-bitcoin-to-surge-back-to-all-time-highs/">Bitcoin</a> transactions surged during the LUNA and FTX crises last year, reinforcing the theory.</p>



<p>The second indicator revolves around changes in Bitcoin’s velocity patterns. Observing historical data, it&#8217;s evident that Bitcoin’s velocity typically accelerates with substantial trading activity around the same time last year, the pundit explained. However, this time around, the absence of substantial trading could be attributed to institutional investors finalizing their accumulation earlier, making even small trades capable of influencing prices due to limited liquidity.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, speculation is rife that the low point of $15,700, believed to be the result of institutional accumulation, might signal the trough of this market cycle. According to got MAC D, if the observed trends of increased token transfers and accelerated velocity continue to align with price upticks in the coming months, it could very well foretell the onset of a bullish rally.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,485 after a 9.1% decrease in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data. According to popular crypto <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1691111332999843844">analyst</a> Ali Martinez, the price is, however likely to face key resistance between $29,660 and $30,540 where 2.09 million addresses bought 874,570 BTC.</p>

<p>Mastercard has just made a very interesting<a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2023/cbdcs-trust-and-the-evolution-of-money/"> announcement</a>, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/Ripple">Ripple</a>, Fireblocks, Consensys, and four others in a new CBDC Partner Program. The program aims to “bring a greater understanding of the benefits and limitations of CBDCs and how to implement them in a way that is safe, seamless, and useful,” according to Mastercard.</p>



<p>While not detailing what the goals of the group exactly are beyond these commonly used buzzwords, the importance of CBDC research seems clear. According to the Bank of International Settlement (BIS), many central banks worldwide are working on central bank digital currencies (CBDC) and more than half are as advanced as working on a pilot program. With retail CBDC development being more advanced, the BIS suggests that by 2030 there could be up to 15 retail CBDCs and 9 wholesale CBDCs in circulation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-foundation-building"><strong>Ripple’s Foundation Building</strong></h2>



<p>It appears Ripple is joining the group for its efforts in working with<a href="https://zycrypto.com/palau-stablecoin-advances-to-next-phase-on-xrpl-transitioning-from-island-paradise-to-blockchain-frontier/"> Palau</a> on its Dollar-backed stablecoin and CBDC developments in Montenegro, Bhutan, Colombia, and Hong Kong. Ripple recently launched its CBDC platform, positioning itself at the forefront of digital currency innovation and solutions for central banks&#8217; digital currency initiatives. The platform utilizes technology based on the XRP Ledger, the underlying distributed ledger technology network the cryptocurrency XRP uses.</p>



<p>It aims to provide a stable, secure, resilient network while maintaining sustainability and interoperability. <em>“With Ripple’s groundbreaking technology, we can experiment with CBDCs within our existing payments infrastructure while ensuring efficient and cost-effective cross-border transfers,”</em> said Yangchen Tshogyel, deputy governor of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan.</p>



<p>Software company Consensys, multi-CBDC, asset technology provider Fluency, and digital asset platform Fireblocks have worked to various degrees on CBDC projects. At the same time, German Giesecke+Devrient has a 170-year history in public currency management and currently focuses on safeguarding physical and digital assets. G+D Filia, their CBDC solution, enables safe offline payments, which is critical for wider CBDC adoption and accessibility during connection or power outages. Filia accepts online and offline payments using a ‘variety of wallets and IoT devices’.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-privacy-concerns-remain"><strong>Privacy Concerns Remain</strong></h2>



<p>While the technology continues to evolve, privacy concerns are a top priority. Jerome Ajdenbaum from identity and payments company Idemia said, “Privacy is extremely important to users. It’s really the No. 1 topic,” adding that it is important to actually protect people’s privacy and live up to that promise.</p>



<p>Idemia has teamed up with the Bank of England to walk the tightrope of safeguarding privacy while ensuring that fraudulent activity is prevented. Idema aims to do this with a secure offline CBDC wallet which facilitates secure digital cash transactions for Central Bank Digital Currency. This will enable users to make consecutive offline payments through various channels and terminals, using tamper-resistant certified hardware chips for balance management, authentication, key storage, and potentially integrating biometric authentication for added security.</p>



<p>Rounding off the group is Consult Hyperion which also works with central banks on offline payment solutions and face-to-face and remote retail environments.</p>



<p>While the collaboration raises promising prospects for innovation and growth, only time will tell if users accept a retail CBDC. Trials in China have shown that over 250 million Chinese have used the digital yuan in the country; other countries where a CBDC is in action are Nigeria and the Bahamas. According to blockchain research platform Guardtime, 64% of people worldwide would use a CBDC.</p>

<p>Grayscale Investments revealed on Thursday that its ETF team is expanding as it nears the tail end of its lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The new hires have sent an optimistic signal about a potential spot Bitcoin ETF landing in the U.S. markets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grayscale-prepping-for-etf-approval"><strong>Grayscale Prepping For ETF Approval?</strong></h2>



<p>Grayscale highlighted that it’s hiring for its ETF team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our ETF team is hiring,” Grayscale said on X (formerly Twitter), accompanied by a set of eyes emoji.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our ETF team is hiring. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/FtM1VM0AcW">https://t.co/FtM1VM0AcW</a></p>&mdash; Grayscale (@Grayscale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1692163372241056254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The two positions, a product specialist and senior associate to assist its ETF team, have jointly accumulated more than 50 applications since being posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=3658437380&amp;f_C=9242845&amp;geoId=92000000&amp;originToLandingJobPostings=3663770148%2C3644394640%2C3655966673%2C3687035969%2C3635007085%2C3658437380%2C3677214100%2C3677213133">LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>As per the <a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/grayscaleinvestments/jobs/5643892003">job post</a>, Grayscale’s senior associate would “contribute to investment product development ideas and work with the ETF team towards their realization.”</p>



<p>The crypto asset manager is seeking a product specialist who will “work closely with the sales, operations, marketing, and product teams to optimize the investor experience,” with a particular focus on ETFs.</p>



<p>Some crypto community members are pondering the significance of the job postings as the widely anticipated decision in Grayscale’s lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission could be reached as early as tomorrow. Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1692178295637594363">posited</a>:</p>



<p>“Is this bullish spot approval? No idea, but I do know ETFs are and will be a huge growth area and so fyi for anyone looking for a job.”</p>



<p>Grayscale <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">sued </a>SEC last June for violation of the Administrative Procedures Act., following the regulatory agency’s denial to convert its flagship trust (GBTC) into a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-nbsp"><strong>Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While some industry commentators like former SEC official John Reed Stark have claimed that<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnReedStark/status/1690707913789112320"> chances are very slim</a> the American financial watchdog gives a regulatory green light to the creation of a physically-backed Bitcoin ETF, the verdict in Grayscale’s suit could leave the commission with no choice.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Bloomberg’s Balchunas previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">suggested </a>that the odds of the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF have gone up. The agency, however, seems hell-bent on postponing any decision related to this crypto investment vehicle until next year — but a surprise should not be ruled out.</p>



<p>Grayscale recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-asks-sec-to-green-light-all-spot-bitcoin-etfs-simultaneously-to-promote-fair-competition/">urged the SEC to approve all Bitcoin spot ETF applications simultaneously</a> if it approves any to prevent companies from having an unfair advantage over other applicants.</p>

<p>In what will undoubtedly be disappointing to XRP fans, a New York district court judge has accepted the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) request to file an interlocutory appeal of the verdict in its suit against Ripple Labs, which ended in a partial victory for Ripple in July.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-s-request-granted"><strong>SEC’s Request Granted</strong></h2>



<p>Last month, the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">declared </a>that while Ripple&#8217;s XRP token institutional sales violated federal securities laws, sales to investors via exchanges did not constitute investment contracts. The ruling was a catalyst that sparked an upward trend for XRP and other crypto tokens that were alleged to be securities by the SEC.</p>



<p>The legal skirmish between Ripple and the SEC has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">ongoing since December 2020 </a>when the U.S. securities regulator took legal action against Ripple and its top figureheads, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, over allegations they raised over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP, an alleged unregistered security.</p>



<p>Now, the SEC’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-hanging-by-a-thread-as-sec-finally-moves-for-appeal-against-ripple-what-to-expect-next/">request</a> to submit a motion for leave to file an interlocutory appeal in the ongoing dispute with Ripple has been granted by Judge Analisa Torres, according to a court document filed on Thursday. The agency can file its motion by August 18, 2023,&nbsp; Judge Analisa Torres postulated, and Ripple has until September 1, 2023, to file their opposition to the appeal.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar, an interlocutory appeal happens when a ruling by a trial court is appealed while other elements of the case are still in motion. The federal judge’s determination enables the SEC to build and introduce a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision comes only hours after Ripple made it known that it was opposed to the SEC’s move toward an interlocutory appeal. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-claps-back-at-secs-request-to-challenge-ruling-that-xrp-isnt-a-security/">reported </a>earlier, Ripple’s legal team laid out several key arguments in opposition to the regulator’s request.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-on-xrp"><strong>Implications On XRP</strong></h2>



<p>It should be noted that the latest decision by Judge Torres does not mean the SEC can now appeal the XRP ruling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Because this isn&#39;t very clear, the court has not granted leave to appeal &#8211; meaning SEC can appeal now.<br><br>It granted leave to file a motion for leave to appeal.  The court just decided &quot;ya we can deal with this issue&quot;.<br><br>So, the issue itself &#8211; whether an appeal will go forward now -… <a href="https://t.co/vBbgr4CaYK">https://t.co/vBbgr4CaYK</a></p>&mdash; Bill Hughes : wchughes.eth <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f98a.png" alt="🦊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@BillHughesDC) <a href="https://twitter.com/BillHughesDC/status/1692230785699316207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>As aforementioned, the appeal process itself won&#8217;t halt the rest of the case. Moreover, the SEC will still need permission from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to file the actual appeal of the ruling. So even if Judge Torres does grant the SEC’s motion, then it will have another precipitous mountain to climb — getting the Second Circuit&#8217;s approval.</p>



<p>XRP fans hoping for a parabolic value hike might have to wait a little longer as the project’s future as a whole could be in jeopardy amid SEC’s appeal efforts.</p>

<p>In a recent<a href="https://stellar.org/blog/sdfs-investment-in-moneygram-international"> post</a> on the Stellar website, Denelle Dixon, CEO and Executive Director of the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF), announced that Stellar had made a financial investment into MoneyGram (MGI). Stellar and MGI have worked together since 2021 and as early as 2019 on projects like stablecoins and money settlement in USDC on the Stellar blockchain.</p>



<p>The move makes Stellar a minority <a href="https://zycrypto.com/top-ripple-competitor-stellar-reportedly-in-talks-to-purchase-moneygram-xlm-soars-by-an-impressive-18/">investor in MoneyGram</a> and it will have a seat on the Board of Directors, in which Dixon will now represent SDF. It is unknown how much money changed hands but in a statement, Stellar said the funds came out of SDF’s cash treasury rather than its fund used to finance start-ups.</p>



<p>According to Dixon, the move focuses on expanding MGI’s “digital business, exploring blockchain technology, and contributing to the many other ways this financial technology company enables consumers and businesses to move and manage money in nearly every country around the world.” She added the investment would cement MGI’s role in the global payments market helping it to become “a digital-forward leader in fintech”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-and-moneygram-a-complicated-relationship"><strong>Ripple and MoneyGram – a Complicated Relationship</strong></h2>



<p>Interestingly, Stellar was founded by Jed McCaleb, who also co-founded rival Ripple and served as its Chief Technology Officer before leaving the company. Ripple also had a partnership with MoneyGram, which involved a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-completes-50-million-equity-investment-in-moneygram-bolstering-cross-border-payments-with-xrp/">$50 million investment in MGI</a> and allowed it to use Ripple’s cross-border payments network.</p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Ripple in late 2020 for the alleged sale of $1.3 billion in unregistered securities. While the court has decided that in and of itself, XRP is not a security, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-claps-back-at-secs-request-to-challenge-ruling-that-xrp-isnt-a-security/">the case is still ongoing</a>, with a pending trial regarding the roles of CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chairman and co-founder Chris Larsen in the sales of XRP and a pending interlocutory appeal by the SEC.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/moneygram-officially-ends-partnership-with-ripple/">MoneyGram ended the cooperation</a> shortly after the SEC filed the lawsuit, with MGI’s Chief Financial Officer Larry Angelilli hinting at future cooperation “If there’s a resolution to the case, especially if Ripple prevails, then I would say there would be no problem,” adding that this could be a long way off.</p>



<p>MoneyGram used Ripple’s platform and XRP for its FX business for the euro, Philippine pesos, Australian dollar, and Mexican pesos. U.S. exchanges stopped XRP trading shortly after the lawsuit.</p>



<p>During a panel discussion, Angelilli said that the move of the SEC made it impossible to use Ripple and XRP, highlighting that Stellar and XLM worked differently and that they could use both systems. However, there has been no announcement if MGI would revisit its relationship with Ripple post the court decision.</p>



<p>The news has not immediately resulted in an increased demand for XLM, the native coin of the Stellar blockchain. XLM is experiencing a sell-off with the broader market, currently trading at $0.12, down 4% in 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>German-born programmer and Coil CEO Stefan Thomas has continued to find himself at a crossroads, with only two attempts left to crack a code that holds the potential to unlock a fortune of staggering proportions after he forgot his password.</p>



<p>Thomas owned an IronKey, a small hard drive that housed the private keys to a digital wallet containing an astonishing 7,002 Bitcoin (approximately 198M today), which he purchased back when the cryptocurrency traded at around $5.</p>



<p>The story began when Thomas misplaced a paper containing his password to the IronKey wallet. With only ten guesses available before the IronKey&#8217;s contents were encrypted forever, Thomas&#8217;s urgency to retrieve his lost wealth was solid. He tried eight combinations, each attempt yielding nothing but frustration and desperation.</p>



<p><em>“I would just lay in bed and think about it,”</em> Thomas confessed in a 2021 interview. <em>“Then I would go to the computer with some new strategy, and it wouldn’t work, and I would be desperate again.”</em></p>



<p>In an interview last month, Stefan further spoke about his relentless efforts to unlock the Bitcoin trapped in his hardware wallet. Talking on the “Thinking Crypto” YouTube channel, the pundit acknowledged that the recovery process was far from simple.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;The process is still ongoing, so we&#8217;re still working on it,&#8221;</em> he <a href="https://youtu.be/eB24Z_ITM78?t=3435">stated</a>. He shed light on the intricate challenges faced due to the substantial sum at stake. &#8220;<em>When you&#8217;re dealing with so much money, everything takes forever,&#8221; he emphasized.</em></p>



<p>Stefan detailed the thorough approaches required for both physical and software attacks. &#8220;<em>Before you can do some physical attack, you first have to try it lots of times. Before you do a software attack, you first wanna try every angle,&#8221;</em> he explained. He further expressed his desire for closure, stating, <em>&#8220;Honestly, at this point, after 10 years, I don&#8217;t care. Just get it over with.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Stefan Thomas&#8217;s plight is not an isolated incident. In 2013, a computer engineer named James Howells accidentally discarded a driver, which held <a href="https://zycrypto.com/man-offers-72-million-to-search-for-hard-drive-with-7500-btc/">7,500 bitcoins</a>, during an office cleaning session. This event convinced him that the valuable item was resting in a landfill in Newport, south Wales. Despite James Howells&#8217; persistent appeals, the local council consistently denied his requests to search the landfill, citing environmental concerns. </p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature, while empowering users, has also led to numerous stories of forgotten passwords and inaccessible fortunes. Around 20 per cent of 18.5 million Bitcoins, valued at approximately $93 billion, are believed to be trapped in lost or stranded wallets.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s (SHIB) price slipped double-digits in the past 24 hours, contrary to community expectations of a strong upward trend brewing after the launch of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-in-view-amid-shib-exploding-ecosystem-activity-as-shibarium-debut-beckons/">much-hyped Ethereum layer-2 solution, Shibarium</a>, on Wednesday.</p>



<p>SHIB’s decline is attributed to certain Shibarium bridging issues encountered just a day after its rollout.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-botched-shibarium-sees-1-7m-stuck-between-networks"><strong>Botched Shibarium Sees $1.7M Stuck Between Networks</strong></h2>



<p>Shiba Inu’s Shibarium is off to a rocky start after going live late Wednesday.</p>



<p>A look at the network&#8217;s bridge contract, which moves funds from Ethereum to the layer-2 network, shows that roughly $1.7 million worth of ether is currently stuck between the two networks.</p>



<p>Blockchain security firm Beosin confirmed that the funds are indeed locked. They have recommended users briefly stop utilizing Shibarium as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama (a pseudonym) Shytoshi reportedly revealed that the assets stuck in the bridge could not be recovered, as per a screenshot that supposedly captures an internal conversation on Telegram between Shibarium devs.</p>



<p>Users swiftly voiced their concerns on the Shibarium Discord server, which led to admins temporarily “restricting access to certain channels due to the spread of misinformation and fake websites”.</p>



<p>The apparent sloppy launch for Shibarium impedes what was supposed to be the doorway to a fast and low-cost ecosystem. The bridge is part of a broader strategy to position Shiba Inu as a serious decentralized finance (DeFi) contender and subsequently increase its chances of leaving the meme coin category behind. Initially launched in August 2020, SHIB quickly joined the likes of Dogecoin (DOGE) as yet another meme coin to the annals of cryptocurrency comedy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shytoshi-publicly-denies-any-shibarium-technical-hiccups"><strong>Shytoshi Publicly Denies Any Shibarium Technical Hiccups</strong></h2>



<p>Shytoshi has ardently refuted claims that Shibarium has any inherent issues while assuring users about the security of their funds. Kusama <a href="https://blog.shib.io/shibarium-insane-influx/?ref=shiba-inu-ecosystem-newsletter">said </a>in a newsletter today that the “technical difficulty is not an issue of Shibarium, but instead, from the MASSIVE influx of transactions and users that happened at the same time when we announced that the Shibarium is live.&#8221;</p>



<p>“There is no bridge issue, any screenshot you see of me saying any issue is false and your funds are safu,” he continued.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the price of SHIB has slumped to a weekly low of $0.00000857 at press time, or down 11.2% in the last 24 hours, while governance token <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap">BONE </a>has slipped more than 13.7% during the same timeframe as community sentiment sours. The ecosystems’ <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/doge-killer">LEASH </a>token fared far worse plunging 19.3% on the day.</p>

<p>On August 15th, cryptocurrency trader and analyst Michaël van de Poppe conducted a daily price analysis for Shiba Inu (SHIB), a meme-inspired cryptocurrency. He looked at the key price levels it needs to hold in order to sustain its bullish momentum in the coming months.</p>



<p>According to van de Poppe, as long as SHIB manages to stay above the critical support of around $0.00000941, there&#8217;s a high likelihood that it will continue to rise to $0.00000287.</p>



<p>If SHIB achieves van de Poppe&#8217;s bullish prediction, it would mark a significant increase of 29.98% from current levels for the second-largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shib-s-support-and-resistance-on-daily-timeframes"><strong>SHIB&#8217;s Support and Resistance on Daily Timeframes</strong></h2>



<p>Since June 10th, the price of SHIB has steadily increased after dropping to a low of $0.00000543. On daily timeframes, it&#8217;s noticeable that the meme coin has formed a strong support zone within the range of $0.00000749 and $0.00000800.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/NbNVW33sP15cvFw7Ra8k4qz6vm6uViruF7RJycvhfA1cqfwYb2L-0wE9nkqZandsAo9VBOyIKPcZ6xQgMgrXe9MuC-4rNBGXWwEAtpfFGujIsjedYkhcKBV16uojH1z-yJGdTPMT72uwUaNfVEdny7o" alt=""/></figure>



<p>However, on August 13th, SHIB&#8217;s price fell below the $0.000001080 level, which is closest to its 55-period moving average (MA) and the nearest resistance it needs to break to sustain its bullish momentum.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is priced at $0.000008574, experiencing a 10.8% setback in the past 24 hours due to the ongoing price decline in Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-s-crypto-market-leadership"><strong>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Crypto Market Leadership</strong></h2>



<p>Currently, SHIB holds the 15th position among cryptocurrencies, with the highest market capitalization, having a market cap of $5.05 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. It is outranked in the meme coin category by the larger and pioneering Dogecoin (DOGE), which boasts a market capitalization of approximately $9.3 billion, securing the 9th spot in the top cryptocurrencies list.</p>



<p>Hence, a 29.98% surge would propel SHIB into the top 10 cryptocurrencies and solidify its standing as one of the leading meme coins after DOGE. Additionally, as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-sees-shibarium-outshining-x-worldcoin-shib-price-at-0-001-looking-likely/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, SHIB&#8217;s developers have been working diligently to expand the project&#8217;s reach and shed its reputation as a simple or useless meme coin.</p>



<p>Ultimately, considering SHIB&#8217;s massive following and community, achieving van de Poppe&#8217;s projected target might not be as far-fetched as it seems. Who knows, it could even ignite more enthusiasm for meme coins that capture the attention of non-crypto individuals, especially after the price surge seen in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pepe-outshines-shiba-inu-and-doge-with-23-surge-amid-big-whale-purchases/">PEPE</a>, a coin based on the Pepe the Frog meme.</p>
