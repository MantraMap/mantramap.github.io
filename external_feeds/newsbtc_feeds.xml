					<description><![CDATA[After over 11 years of inactivity, a dormant Bitcoin address containing $31 million in BTC suddenly came to life recently. On July 22, 2023, the address transferred its entire balance to a new address. Early BTC Address Comes Back To Life Bitcoin has been around since 2009, so there are dormant addresses that have been inactive for years that contain large amounts of BTC. Some of the early adopters of this cryptocurrency were able to buy in very cheap but the private keys to many of these addresses have been lost, locking them forever. Every now and then, however, some of these addresses suddenly come back to life as the owner regains asses to the funds.

According to on-chain data, it received its first transaction of 1,037 BTC in November 2012. At the time, the price of each BTC sold for only $12.41.

					<description><![CDATA[Prominent Pro-XRP lawyer John E. Deaton has downplayed the potential effects of an appeal by the United States Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) in its ongoing case against Ripple on the sale of the XRP token as an unregistered security.  Related Reading: Why Ripple’s Victory Against The SEC May Be Short-Lived: Legal Expert SEC Nudges At Possible Appeal Against Ripple Ruling On July 13, U.S. Judge Analisa Torres of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the programmatic sales of XRP did not violate U.S. securities law as the SEC cannot prove retail investors had expected profits from this investment based on the “entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others.”  The decision was based on the Howey Test, which states that a contract, transaction, or scheme is an “investment contract” and, therefore, a security if it is (1) an investment of money, (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profit (4) to be gained from the effort of others.  For the first time since the ruling, the SEC hinted on July 21 it might appeal this judgment in one of its petitions in another ongoing case against Terraform Labs and its co-founder, Do Kwon. The lawyers of these defendants had earlier filed a motion to dismiss the charges against their clients based on the recent Ripple ruling. However, the SEC responded by saying that the ruling which favored Ripple was “wrongly decided,” and the commission could soon explore ways to review this judgment.  The filing read: Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, much of the Ripple ruling supports the SEC’s claims in this case and rejects arguments Defendants have raised here. However, with respect to the Programmatic and other sales, the SEC respectfully avers that Ripple conflicts with and adds baseless requirements to Howey and its progeny. Respectfully, those portions of Ripple were wrongly decided, and this Court should not follow them. SEC staff is considering the various available avenues for further review and intends to recommend that the SEC seek such review.  Related Reading: How Did Shiba Inu Price React To 3 Trillion SHIB Investor Accumulation? SEC’s Potential Appeal To Be Likely Insignificant &#8211; John Deaton In response to if an appeal by the SEC in its case against Ripple would represent a setback for XRP, popular crypto lawyer and XRP supporter Deaton has provided a positive outlook implying that was far from being the case.  According to a tweet on July 22, Deaton backed up this claim stating that an appeal by the SEC would first take two years to get a decision from the second circuit. In the U.S. legal system, the courts for the second circuit represent one of the 13 U.S. Courts of Appeal. Furthermore, the lawyer stated that assuming the second circuit did determine that application of the third Howey factor was wrong, U.S. Judge Torres would still apply the first two Howey factors and arrive at the same decision.  Deaton also stated that Torres’s decision was obviously not final within the Southern District Court of New York, and there is the possibility of another district judge having another conclusion. However, he expressed that was unlikely, especially as Judge Torres had made this judgment citing the ruling in the popular SEC v. Telegram case in which the commission won an injunction to prevent Telegram from distributing GRAMS tokens on the allegations of it being unregistered security. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.7404, with a 3.58% gain in the last day based on data from Tradingview.

<p>Despite the lack of significant developments since the ruling&#8217;s delivery a week ago, the market sentiment remains optimistic, with widespread speculation that Ripple is on the verge of announcing its initial public offering, further boosting optimism and interest in the cryptocurrency.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin&#8217;s six-year range inside a rising channel has drawn the attention of a curious but optimistic analyst. Previewing the price chart shows that the coin has been in range over the years, capturing all of its volatility. Despite occasional dumps and pumps, the structure is yet to be broken.  By the time the screenshot was shared on July 21, Bitcoin was trading in the lower part of the rising channel, skirting the support trend line, an indicator that prices have been generally lower in recent months. The rejection of lower lows and bounce from the support trend line, the analyst says, is bullish and squarely puts back bulls in contention. Bitcoin To $175,000? According to the trader&#8217;s assessment, a breakout above the upper resistance level at around $32,000 could potentially trigger a new bull run that may see the world&#8217;s most valuable cryptocurrency retest highs of the rising channel at $175,000, a level that upbeat HODLers can mark as a feasible target.  Related Reading: Maker (MKR) Surges 26% In A Week As Token Buyback Program Goes Live Still, considering the volatility in crypto, this bullish forecast cannot be dismissed. To illustrate, the last bull run drove Bitcoin prices from sub-$10,000 to peaks of $69,000 in less than two years. Therefore, if Bitcoin bulls push above $32,000, a price level that the analyst claim is important, it could be a bullish signal that may be the beginning of another leg up in the resumption of the bullish formation set in motion between 2020 and 2021.  Bitcoin is trading below the $30,000 level at spot rates with resistance at $31,800. Despite the general optimism across the board, bulls are yet to breach July 2023 highs as prices consolidate. Halving And ETF Approval As Tailwinds? Specific triggers for the next run are unknown for now. Even so, considering past cycles, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event may provide the impetus for a leg up toward 2021 highs at $69,000. Besides, traders are closely monitoring how the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications in the United States progresses.  The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected several spot Bitcoin ETF applications in the past. However, the involvement of BlackRock has been received positively, lifting prices in the past few weeks. BlackRock is the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, managing trillions.  Related Reading: From Polygon NFT Wins To MATIC Gains: Understanding The Connection The approval of a Bitcoin ETF would ease institutional investors&#8217; involvement in the sphere, potentially driving demand and lifting prices.

					<description><![CDATA[Polygon has recently witnessed a remarkable surge in its non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sales volume and the influx of sellers participating in this burgeoning market. This growth in the NFT sector has sparked considerable interest and speculation among investors, prompting many to ponder the potential impact it may have on the price of MATIC, the native cryptocurrency of the Polygon network.  However, despite the impressive surge in NFT sales volume and seller participation, a closer examination reveals that not everything works in Polygon&#8217;s favor.  While the NFT market on the platform may be flourishing, other factors could impact the overall sentiment and performance of MATIC. Polygon NFT sales are trending up.

Market reactions can be delayed, and sustained growth in NFT activity may be required to affect the token&#8217;s value significantly. Rising Competition Poses Challenge For Polygon  A recent report also highlights the increasing competition that Polygon, a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is facing within its market niche. Polygon has been known for its ability to enhance Ethereum&#8217;s performance, making it faster, cheaper, and more efficient. MATIC market cap currently at $7.11 billion.

However, the current market dynamics indicate that this advantage has diminished. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong With 19% Rally – More Gains In The Pipeline?

					<description><![CDATA[In the past week, Maker (MKR) token has captured significant attention in the crypto market, surging an impressive 26%. This remarkable price action coincides with the introduction of a groundbreaking token buyback program by the leading decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform, MakerDAO. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, Maker (MKR) stands out as one of the largest and oldest DeFi lending protocols, gaining popularity for its issuance of the widely used DAI stablecoin with a market value of $4.6 billion. MKR Token Buyback Program Triggers Surge The recent surge in Maker (MKR), the governance token of the $5.3 billion decentralized finance (DeFi) lender MakerDAO, can be attributed to the implementation of a token buyback program. The token buyback scheme, named the Smart Burn Engine, is designed to remove MKR tokens from the market. The mechanism involves allocating excess DAI stablecoins from Maker&#8217;s surplus buffer to purchase MKR tokens from a UniSwap pool. The governance proposal behind this initiative aims to strengthen the token&#8217;s value and governance while actively engaging MKR holders in voting on crucial proposals. Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap According to blockchain data, the lending platform is poised to remove approximately $7 million worth of MKR governance tokens from the market over the next month through this buyback initiative. With the token&#8217;s total market capitalization standing at around $1 billion, the buyback represents a 0.7% reduction in the token&#8217;s supply per month, potentially enhancing MKR&#8217;s scarcity and value proposition. This strategic move is likely to attract further interest and investment from the crypto community. The token buyback program has already shown promising results, with MakerDAO purchasing approximately $230,000 worth of MKR tokens within the last 24 hours. This early success indicates positive momentum and investor interest in the buyback initiative.  Maker: Significant Developments In 2023 In addition to the token buyback program, MakerDAO has been proactively diversifying its revenue streams by investing its DAI reserve assets into traditional financial products, such as bank loans and government bonds. This strategic decision has proven to be fruitful, as it enables the platform to generate sustainable revenue from yields, providing a solid basis for potential growth and long-term value. Unlike meme coins lacking tangible business prospects, Maker&#8217;s diversified revenue streams instill confidence in investors and the broader DeFi community, making it an attractive investment option. Related Reading: Bitfinex Hackers Surrender: Couple Agrees to Forfeit 120,000 Bitcoin in Plea Deal Beyond the token buyback and DAI reserve investments, MakerDAO is also undergoing a significant overhaul that includes upgrades for both the DAI and MKR tokens. Furthermore, the platform is transitioning into smaller autonomous organizations known as SubDAOs, which have the potential to issue their own tokens. These developments signal a dynamic future for MakerDAO and highlight the platform&#8217;s commitment to continuous innovation and progress. Over the past 24 hours, there has been a 9.98% decrease in the price. However, in the last hour alone, the price has shown a modest increase of 0.28%. As of now, the current price of MKR stands at $1,094.53. It&#8217;s important to note that Maker is currently 82.73% below its all-time high, which was recorded at $6,339.02.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past week, Ethereum (ETH) registered the highest inflows into centralized exchanges (CEX) in the past two months. These significant asset movements have suggested a potential price dip for ETH. CoinGecko data shows that the second-largest cryptocurrency has been experiencing a slight price decline, losing 2.5% of its value in the past week. As of this writing, the Ether token changes hand at $1,892.65, with a negligible 0.2% gain in the last 24 hours.

The data analytics platform found that at least $383 million worth of ETH was deposited into these exchanges. IntoTheBlock also revealed that a significant percentage of the CEX inflows came from a single address and in a single transaction. This deposit came from an old wallet that accumulated 61,216 ETH during the Ethereum Initial Coin Offering (ICO). This pre-mine wallet had been dormant for eight years, with its constituent ETH worth more than $116 million untouched. On Wednesday, July 19, this address became activated, and its stash of Ether tokens was abruptly moved to another address associated with the Kraken exchange. Data from Whale Alert shows that a significant amount of Ether tokens has been transferred to crypto exchanges by several whales over the past week. Notably, more than 200,000 Ether tokens have been transferred to Coinbase in separate transactions within this period. Indeed, the movement of massive amounts of ETH to centralized exchanges can signal impending selling pressure, which can drive the asset’s price down. However, not all large transfers to an exchange precipitate a downward price movement, as the whales might not intend to sell immediately or all at once. Total ETH Staked Reaches All-Time High The Ethereum network has been experiencing a steady increase in the total amount of ETH staked on the blockchain. According to data from IntoTheBlock, this figure has reached $52.3 billion, representing its highest value ever. The data analytics company also noted that with an increasing amount of staked ETH, the Ethereum blockchain is bound to become even more secure, as there will be a corresponding decrease in the risk of the network being taken over by a single entity.  Related Reading: Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap It is worth noting that this surge in staking activity can be linked to the successful launch of the Shapella upgrade. The Shapella upgrade offered a new dimension to ETH staking, as investors can now lock and unlock their assets at will. This increased flexibility eliminated a substantial portion of risk that has been attributed to ETH staking in the past.

					<description><![CDATA[Dogecoin continues to cement itself as the largest meme coin by market cap, displaying signs of renewed enthusiasm every so often. This week, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency added over $1 billion to its market cap, making it the 8th-largest crypto. This was a result of Dogecoin’s surge of over 10%, boosting its market cap to more than $10 billion in a matter of hours. Dogecoin Pushes Solana To Number 9 Dogecoin has come a long way since its creation as a joke. Fueled by the hype on social media, the meme cryptocurrency has skyrocketed up the rankings to become the 8th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The price of Dogecoin recently crossed over the $0.070 resistance level to reach $0.076. As a result, more than $1 billion was added to its market cap, surging from $9.67 billion to $10.66 billion.  Related Reading: Coinbase Exchange Tells Borrowers That They Have Four Months To Pay Back Although its price has now dropped to $0.074 at the time of writing, Dogecoin still has a $10.35 billion market cap, pushing Solana down to the number 9 spot.
