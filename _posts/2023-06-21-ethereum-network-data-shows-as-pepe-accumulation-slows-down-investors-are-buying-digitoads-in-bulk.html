<p class="s7">DigiToads presale, which started a few weeks back, has been one of the hottest presales in 2023. Now in its Lilypad 8 stage, the presale has raised more than 4.85 million after selling more than 90% of the tokens allocated for the presale. As the launch of the $TOADS tokens approaches, investors have continued to show support for the project by purchasing TOADS tokens in chunks.</p>
<p class="s7">The fast presale growth of the DigiToads presale has led investors to predict a bright future for the token that includes massive growth of more than 1000%.

Why are investors so bullish about DigiToads?
<p class="s7">Well, DigiToads is a meme coin that stands out from the rest of the meme coins in the market, while most meme coins such as PEPE focus fully on the fun aspect and growing a community, DigiToads offers much more utility. This means that, unlike other meme coins that have to rely on community sentiment for value, the value of DigiToads is derived from the utility it offers investors.</p>
<p class="s7">Some of the features that differentiate DigiToads from other meme coin projects include a robust play-to-earn platform, deflationary nature, NFTS staking, a metaverse, and environmental consciousness.</p>
<p class="s7">The play-to-earn web3 gaming platform on DigiToads provides TOADs token holders with an immersive gaming experience that also rewards them with TOADs tokens for their efforts. In the game, players can collect, nurture and breed digital pet NFTS. Once a month, players battle their DigiToads against those of other players in a fierce competition where the top 25% of winners get rewards in the form of TOADs tokens. Players can use their rewards to enhance their rewards through staking, purchase more in-game items or buy more NFTs.</p>
<p class="s7">DigiToads is also getting recognition in the NFT space with the introduction of its NFT staking platform. Users have the opportunity to stake their TOADS NFTS and earn additional rewards. The longer they take their NFTS, the greater the rewards they earn. The staking pool receives funds from 2% of all TOADS transactions, ensuring a steady supply of rewards for participants in the staking process.</p>
<p class="s7">Another aspect of the DigiToads platform that has continued to attract investors is the monthly trading competitions. &nbsp;Once a month, DigiToads will hold a competition where traders will be required to show their trading skills and expertise. The winners will receive prestigious DigiToads, which give them access to funds in the treasury.</p>
<p class="s7">There will be 12 DigiToads available each year, and they will serve to ensure that only the top traders have control and access to the treasury, while also motivating other traders to sharpen their trading skills.</p>
<p class="s7">DigiToads will also play a role in conserving the environment by Donating 2.5% of its profits each month to a charity that is focused on conserving the Amazon rainforest and other natural habitats of wildlife like TOADs. This is a massive step in the right direction for DigiToads as it differentiates the project from other cryptocurrencies that have a rap for leaving a large carbon footprint.</p>
