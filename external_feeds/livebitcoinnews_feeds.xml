<li>ADA price is struggling to climb above the $0.2920 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $0.288 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $0.2850 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Coinbase).</li>
<li>The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.292 and $0.302 levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is holding the $0.276 support against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-upsides-above-31250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.302 resistance.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a decent upward move from the $0.276 support against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair was able to climb above the $0.285 and $0.292 resistance levels.</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $0.302 zone. A high is formed near $0.3018 before there was a fresh decline. A low is formed near $0.2768 and the price is now rising. It broke the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3018 swing high to the $0.2768 low.</p>
<p>ADA is now trading near $0.288 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-more-gains-seems-likely-above-0-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support near $0.285 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.292 zone. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3018 swing high to the $0.2768 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.302 level.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.302 resistance might start a steady increase. In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise toward the $0.325 resistance or even $0.332.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.285 level. The next major support is near the $0.276 level. A clear move below the $0.276 level might send the price toward the $0.265 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $0.242 support, below which the bears could aim for a test of $0.225.</p>

<li>Ethereum price is eyeing an upside break above the $1,900 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>ETH price is now trading below $1,890 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the 4-hour chart (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could climb further if it stays above the $1,825 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is rising above the $1,850 level against the US Dollar. ETH/USD could rise further if it clears the $1,900 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, Ethereum saw a bearish wave from the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-rally-above-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2,000 zone</a> against the US Dollar. ETH price declined below the $1,900 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p>The bears even pushed the price below the $1,850 level. A low was formed near $1,825 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1,850 resistance level. The price broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,976 swing high to the $1,825 low.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $1,890 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-eyes-more-gains-above-1920/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $1,900 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $1,900 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,976 swing high to the $1,825 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,940 zone. A clear move above the $1,940 level could send the price toward $1,980.</p>
<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $2,000 resistance zone or $2,050 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,860 level. The next major support is now near the $1,825 level.</p>
<p>A break below the $1,825 support could push the price to $1,760. Any more losses could lead the price toward $1,720 or even $1,700 in the coming days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several people have thrown their hats into the 2024 presidential ring, and while many of them are talking about their alleged plans involving crypto and America, it’s interesting that the one man who’s stayed relatively silent on the subject – Donald Trump – could still be the best hope for the country’s digital currency arena.</p>
<h2>Why Trump Remains the #1 Choice</h2>
<p>Let’s look at the most known presidential candidates to see which one stands higher than the rest:</p>
<h2>Joe Biden</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that another term for Joe Biden would mean the death of crypto. As the leading face of the democrat party, Biden has worked hard to make traders’ lives miserable. Between an Obama-era policy designed to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-biden-using-an-obama-era-program-to-ban-btc/">shut out the crypto</a> arena from traditional financial tools, a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-amendment-for-infrastructure-bill-leads-to-more-problems-and-infighting/">phony infrastructure bill</a> aimed at traders, and now a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/biden-wants-to-tax-crypto-mining-companies-at-30/">30 percent tax</a> on all crypto mining, it’s clear Biden seeks a future for America where crypto doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Unless Americans want more persecution and financial repression, they should do all they can to get Biden out of office.</p>
<h2>Robert Kennedy Jr.</h2>
<p>Arguably Biden’s biggest threat when it comes to this year’s democratic nomination, Kennedy has said, in passing, he’s against Biden on all things when it comes to crypto. Making an appearance at this year’s Miami Bitcoin Conference, he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-has-big-plans-for-the-crypto-space/">mentioned he’s not only</a> accepting crypto donations for his campaign, but he’ll ensure no government interference ever occurs when it comes to bitcoin trading.</p>
<p>While this sounds dandy, the fact remains that Kennedy is still an active member of the democrat party, which one could argue is the main enemy of all crypto fans in the U.S. Figures like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/elizabeth-warren-is-building-an-anti-crypto-rhetoric-as-part-of-her-reelection-campaign/">Elizabeth Warren</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-attorney-generals-office-now-suing-ku-coin-exchange/">Leticia James</a> in New York, and others have made it clear they seek to end the reign of crypto in this country for good.</p>
<p>They’ve also made a habit of sticking together no matter what. This raises several questions, a big one being whether Kennedy, down the line, will have the guts to always stand up against those he calls his colleagues, and if he does, will he have the strength to maintain such fortitude for four years? Getting the answers to these questions <em>after</em> he’s entered the White House may prove too late.</p>
<h2>Vivek Ramaswamy</h2>
<p>Republican candidate Ramaswamy has stated that he <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/vivek-ramaswamy-is-making-crypto-a-big-part-of-his-white-house-campaign/">seeks to limit all taxes</a> on crypto mining. He’s also very much against the damaging tactics Biden has instilled and wants America to ring in a whole new wave of crypto innovation.</p>
<p>While this sounds promising, however, what else is he planning? Ramaswamy, for the most part, has remained relatively silent when it comes to other policy aspects. What will he do, for example, about the economy should he win next year? Bitcoin and crypto can only go so far, and it’s unlikely they’ll solve all the damage done to America’s financial system… at least not quickly, so what else does he have in store?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don’t quite know, and until we do, we cannot assume that his candidacy is strong or legitimate enough simply because he’s willing to discuss crypto and blockchain when others won’t.</p>
<h2>Ron DeSantis</h2>
<p>At first glance, DeSantis – the republican governor of Florida who announced <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ron-desantis-is-running-for-president-appears-to-be-very-pro-crypto/">his candidacy in late</a> May – seems like the perfect candidate. He’s commented, in the past, that everyone has a right to bitcoin trading, and he’s worked to prevent CBDCs from <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ron-desantis-signs-anti-cbdc-crypto-bill-into-law/">being established in Florida</a>, as he believes they’ll be tools for government spying. This is all good… Right?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, DeSantis’ background and network appear rather shady when one looks deep enough. There are several allegations, for example, that DeSantis is a neocon secretly <a href="https://truenewsamerica.com/2023/02/25/ron-desantis-accepts-endorsement-and-donations-from-george-soros/">being funded by</a> George Soros, a known enemy of the U.S. Soros is <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-fans-see-joe-biden-for-the-destructive-force-he-is/">also funding Alvin Bragg</a>, the corrupt DA in Manhattan who lets violent criminals get off with warnings while going after President Trump for an NDA case from roughly seven years ago that both the federal government and the Federal Election Commission (FEC) looked at and passed on after feeling there was nothing worthy of prosecution.</p>
<p>If such statements regarding DeSantis are true, that’s scary, and it’s something Americans likely don’t want to find out after he’s already been elected to the White House. If DeSantis indeed has connections to Soros, one can bet that all his talk about crypto will probably go out the door if he’s pressed to police Americans and their financial liberties.</p>
<h2>Donald Trump</h2>
<p>When it comes to crypto’s future in America, Trump (who&#8217;s currently <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/new-polls-show-trump-commanding-lead-2024-gop-race-rcna86232">leading in all the polls</a>) may seem like the least likely candidate given he’s said some <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/donald-trump-is-no-fan-of-bitcoin/">negative things about digital</a> assets in the past. However, when one puts these comments aside, they can’t help but realize that he’s the one, true choice if crypto is going to survive within this nation’s borders.</p>
<p>The fact is that Trump already has a proven track record, meaning he can potentially get the current financial state of America back on track in the shortest period. During his first term as president, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/face-it-economy-under-trump-great-opinion-1484645">the economy was in</a> its best shape in a long while. Bitcoin reached its first all-time high of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/gmnovp/what_caused_bitcoin_to_rise_to_20k_in_2017/">nearly $20K during</a> 2017, and the arena endured a remarkable <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/bitcoin-and-cryptocurrencys-2020-turnaround-5094080">turnaround in 2020 during</a> the COVID pandemic, a time when it likely should have gone to pieces.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/stocks/stocks-soared-under-trumps-presidency/">stocks</a> and <a href="https://www.mining.com/gold-price-rockets-on-trump-victory/">gold</a> were also high, and this is <em>exactly</em> what crypto fans should be eager for. An arena where all three primary asset classes – stocks, precious metals, and digital currencies – are strong and on the same level. This is the only way to achieve economic balance. This doesn’t happen when one is performing miles above another or when one endures shakiness while another is steady. Trump, in many ways, leveled the playing field for America’s economy like no other president has, and for this reason alone, he’s likely the top candidate when it comes to crypto’s safety.</p>
<p>Lastly, Trump has pledged freedom for all American citizens, suggesting that while he may not partake in crypto trading, investors can rest assured their plans will not be hindered while he’s in office.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite what has still felt like a relatively up-and-down period for bitcoin, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap, a new <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-volatility-drops-lowest-since-161846391.html">study suggests that the</a> volatility of the asset is at its lowest since 2020.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Volatility is Slowing Down Big Time</h2>
<p>The last time bitcoin was this calm was in October three years ago. During that period, bitcoin either didn’t move at all or endured very small maneuvers over 70 separate sessions, and it looks like those patterns are repeating. Strahinja Savic – head of data and analytics at FRNT Financial – commented on the situation and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a few macro catalysts playing out right now. Whether debt-ceiling negotiations or the Fed rate policy, traders are waiting for more clarity. It’s just a wait-and-see-type of moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news is odd given that in May, for example, bitcoin endured a near $4,000 slide <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/">from the $30K price</a> it hit just a month earlier. In April, bitcoin struck a ten-month high, and many felt that the days of 2022 – arguably the worst period on record for the currency – were finally coming to an end.</p>
<p>However, the following month, it was clear that present resistance was still proving to be too harsh an enemy for the world’s leading digital asset. The currency fell into the mid-$26,000 range and only hit $27K briefly after it was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-prices-rise-following-positive-sentiment-from-hong-kong/">announced that Hong Kong</a> would allow certain forms of retail crypto trading through specific (licensed) platforms.</p>
<p>When one looks at data like this, it’s easy to assume that volatility is still relatively constant in the digital currency arena, though it could also be argued that bitcoin has remained almost completely still compared with where it was last year. In her newsletter “Crypto Is Macro Now,” Noelle Acheson explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>There could be some downside, but conviction in this is not strong enough to offset the possibility of missing out on any rally. Obviously, there is some buying and selling going on, but it is not enough to boost volatility despite the low volumes and liquidity.</p></blockquote>
<h2>2022: The Worst Year on Record!</h2>
<p>The good news is that 2023 has offered a degree of healing that many crypto fans and traders likely needed to see before they jumped back into the trading game. The fact is nothing has ever been as damaging as the trends witnessed in 2022, which will probably go down as one of the worst years for bitcoin and crypto.</p>
<p>During that period, the leading digital asset lost more than 70 percent of its value, dropping from $68,000 (an all-time high) in November 2021 to about $16,600 just a year later. Sadly, the trouble didn’t stop there, as several assets chose to follow in BTC’s footsteps and bring the overall valuation of the crypto arena down by more than $2 trillion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rick Nott – a CFA, CFP, and senior wealth advisor at Lourd Murray – <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-financial-advisor-think-cryptocurrency-200040990.html">recently had a few things</a> to say about the world of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<h2>Rick Nott Discusses Crypto</h2>
<p>As a man who has established a large career for himself in finance, Nott had several notes to make in a recent interview about the growing crypto arena. He said that while allotting some of your portfolio into bitcoin and crypto may not be a bad idea, it really depends on how much tolerance you have for risk, and crypto is indeed a risky business. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>The consideration to invest in any asset should be taken within the context of your entire portfolio and your ability to take the risk of that investment. Crypto is no different and is a distinct asset class with, at this point, a decent history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, while he feels crypto is a legitimate asset class, he thinks bitcoin is a standalone asset that should not be part of the same arena. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it’s important to separate ‘crypto’ as all the digital assets (new coins, NFTs, etc.) versus bitcoin. I truly believe that bitcoin is in a class of its own, and if someone were looking to invest in crypto, bitcoin is the only asset with enough history, size, accessibility, and legal resiliency to be considered. It is very likely that all other crypto assets are unregulated securities. The U.S. government is actively waging regulatory war against those assets (and rightly so).</p></blockquote>
<p>Nott also warned that novice investors may not want to jump into crypto so quickly, and that waiting a little bit to garner experience in the field of investing might be a good idea before considering BTC and its cousins. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike a traditional investment that you might buy at a qualified and insured custodian like Schwab or Fidelity, there is tremendous complexity around buying and storing any bitcoin/crypto that you own. The safety of where you buy, the entity that holds your funds, or the risks if you [engage in] self-custody require much more technical know-how than most other investments.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Be Aware of Tax Issues</h2>
<p>Lastly, he said one should always consider the tax implications of crypto before heading forward with digital investing. He commented that the taxes surrounding crypto can be quite complicated, and it’s important to understand things well before getting involved:</p>
<blockquote><p>In buying any crypto, you will be significantly increasing your tax complexity. Not only are tax laws not truly adapted to crypto yet, but your tax preparer may not have the expertise to properly advise you on it. Even worse, if you transact frequently in it, you [must] keep records of those transactions, and the custodians don’t provide the tax documentation as your trading account would at year-end.</p></blockquote>

<li>The pair could start another increase if it clears the $0.10 and $0.102 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading above $0.095 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-upsides-above-31250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XLM’s price must stay above the $0.092 support to rise again.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After forming a base above the $0.090 level, Stellar lumen price started a fresh increase against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair broke the $0.100 resistance zone to move into a positive zone.</p>
<p>The price even cleared the $0.1120 resistance and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). The upward move was such that the price spiked to $0.1180 before it corrected lower. There was a drop below the $0.105 support level. There is a break below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0752 swing low to the $0.1177 high.</p>
<p>However, the bulls were active near the $0.0950 level. It is also stable above the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.0752 swing low to the $0.1177 high.</p>
<p>XLM is now trading below $0.105 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-could-rally-further-above-0-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.100 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.100 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.1020 level. A clear move above the $0.1020 level might send the price toward the $0.1050 level.</p>
<p>Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.1150 level or even $0.1180. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.095 level. The next major support sits near the $0.0920 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.085 level in the near term.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ripple price is struggling below $0.485 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-eyes-more-upsides-above-31250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price could decline further if it settles below the $0.455 support in the near term.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ripple price started a fresh decline from well above $0.4950 against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair gained bearish momentum below the $0.4850 level.</p>
<p>The bears were able to push the price below the $0.4800 support. It even traded below the 55 simple moving average (4 hours) and spiked below the $0.462 support. A low is formed near $0.4580 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave.</p>
<p>XRP is now trading below $0.485 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-bulls-aim-fresh-surge-to-0-52/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Besides, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.476 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.475 and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4956 swing high to the $0.4580 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.4860 level.</p>
<p>It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4956 swing high to the $0.4580 low. A clear move above the trend line resistance and $0.4860 might start a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.495 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.520 resistance.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near $0.4550. The next major support is near the $0.4450 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.420 level, below which the price might even test $0.40.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cynthia Lummis – the republican senator of Wyoming – has proven herself to be a major bitcoin bull. During the recent Miami Bitcoin Conference, Lummis <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/cryptocurrency/news/cynthia-lummis-bitcoin-environment-miami">made an appearance and</a> commented that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could help clean up the environment.</p>
<h2>Cynthia Lummis on the Power of Crypto</h2>
<p>She explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the advantages of bitcoin mining is that when you drill an oil and gas well, and it is distant from other oil and gas wells, you vent the gas into the atmosphere until you can bring in a pipeline to hook it up. Well, while that’s being vented, you can pull a bitcoin mining operation in a trailer, use the vented methane gas to mine your bitcoin, and you are preventing that gas from being vented into the atmosphere. Bitcoin is cleaning up the environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news is interesting given that for the past several years, many environmentalists have stepped in to say that bitcoin and crypto are doing incredible harm to the environment – the <em>exact opposite</em> of what Lummis is stating. There have been many reports, for example, for some time, that bitcoin and crypto mining <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/">uses more energy than</a> most developing nations such as Iceland.</p>
<p>Also, in April of 2023, reports from the Environmental Working Group linked bitcoin and crypto mining to higher air, noise, and water pollution. Many industry heads – from Kevin O’Leary to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-has-taken-a-nasty-stumble-many-are-blaming-elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> – have also expressed concerns about how the mining industry has affected Earth’s atmosphere and resources.</p>
<p>Continuing her speech, Lummis further stated that bitcoin is also a national security issue. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m actually worried as we go into another debt ceiling debate that we will eventually increase the debt ceiling to the point where our interest payments will exceed how much money we spend on national defense, so it is a national security issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>She also criticized other lawmakers in Washington for not doing enough to know more about the crypto industry. She said that many of her constituents in Congress do not recognize the differences between bitcoin and its many altcoin cousins, a scary fact in her opinion. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even though you all know that when FTX failed, they held zero bitcoin, there are a lot of people in Washington D.C. that conflate companies with digital assets. They conflate bitcoin with other cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Major Bull</h2>
<p>Since she first entered Congress <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wyoming-bitcoin-advocate-heads-for-the-senate/">in January of 2021</a>, Lummis has shown herself to be a major bitcoin and crypto advocate, as she was very clear that she had invested in bitcoin multiple times prior.</p>
<p>She also introduced a crypto bill in mid-2022 that would allegedly carve <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/wyomings-cynthia-lummis-is-drafting-a-new-crypto-bill/">out rules and structures</a> for all future crypto legislation. The move was alleged proof that crypto innovation in America was an important talking point for Lummis and her staff.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Gemini exchange in New York <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/cryptocurrency-platform-founded-by-us-entrepreneurs-chooses-ireland-as-european-hq/ar-AA1bJfyA">is relocating to</a> Dublin, Ireland, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-is-now-active-in-bermuda/">joins a growing list</a> of digital currency exchanges and related companies leaving the U.S. either due to complicated regulations or persecution from agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>The Gemini Sets Its Sights on the Emerald Isle</h2>
<p>The crypto industry in the U.S. has been under heavy scrutiny from organizations like the one mentioned above. Its head, Gary Gensler, has gone after several leading digital currency companies over the past few months. Among the big names he’s attacked are Kraken, a crypto exchange based in Northern California, and Coinbase, arguably the largest and most dominant digital trading platform in the country.</p>
<p>Kraken was forced to end <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">all its staking activities</a> and services while also parting with a $30 million penalty fee. Coinbase, on the other hand, was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">served what’s called</a> a Wells notice that informed executives that financial charges were likely coming in the future. The group’s leaders took issue with the notice on account of they had allegedly met with representatives of the SEC several times over a nine-year period to ensure the company was fully compliant.</p>
<p>Gemini services have only been available in Europe for about a year, though in a statement, the company’s founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss made it clear they have a positive view of the Irish regulatory landscape. They’re also thrilled by how far the nation has come in terms of technology adoption and innovation. They commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>We look forward to being a part of and adding to the vibrant tech community in Dublin. Crypto is as transformative as the internet, and we are committed to unlocking the opportunities it represents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Irish politician Taoiseach Leo Varadkar TD commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is significant for Ireland as the government focuses on innovation as a driver of growth. Gemini&#8217;s decision to locate in Ireland highlights our competitive offering for the international financial services sector. We take pride in how it has grown from 60 staff in Dublin 30 years ago, to approximately 56,000 people around the country working in finance today. I wish Gemini every success as they build their team in Ireland.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Gillian Lynch – head of Ireland and Europe at Gemini – also threw her two cents in, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>As we continue to expand our global footprint, we’re excited to tap into the talent and innovation that Dublin and the Irish market have to offer. Dublin has long been a hub for innovation and technology, with a thriving startup scene and deep talent pool. We continue to be encouraged by the city’s commitment to fostering innovation, by a policy environment which encourages entrepreneurship.</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Great Landscape?</h2>
<p>Michael Lohan – CEO of IDA Ireland – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This investment will act as a strong reference case in seeking to further develop the digital assets sector.</p></blockquote>
