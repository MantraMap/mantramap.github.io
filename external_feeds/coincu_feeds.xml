<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Grayscale urges the SEC to simultaneously approve bitcoin ETF registrations among competitors so that no one has an advantage.</em></li>



<li><em>If the SEC decides to change course and approve one or more of the spot bitcoin ETF applications outlined above, &#8220;they must do so in a fair and orderly manner,&#8221; he said.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC previously rejected Grayscale&#8217;s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF but approved a number of bitcoin ETFs based on futures.</em></li>

<p>A July 27 post by Grayscale chief legal officer Craig Salm said their legal team had sent <a href="https://grayscale.com/grayscales-latest-gbtc-comment-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a letter</a> regarding eight spot Bitcoin ETF filings and argued that the SEC should not select some of the applications for approval because it will give a more significant competitive advantage to the winner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The SEC should approve spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#bitcoin</a> ETFs to trade in the US. <br>Whatâ€™s more, their previous approval of bitcoin futures ETFs shows that they are already in a position to do so. <br>Read more about the latest from our legal team: <a href="https://t.co/UC8ksqNcwy" target="_blank">https://t.co/UC8ksqNcwy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$GBTC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$BTC</a></p>&mdash; Grayscale (@Grayscale) <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale/status/1684681713962921986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The SEC previously <a href="https://coincu.com/204120-sec-adds-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-federal-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accepted</a> the listed proposals, including Ark 21 Shares, Invesco Galaxy, iShares (BlackRock), Valkyrie, VanEck, WisdomTree, and Wise Origin (Fidelity).</p>



<p>Therefore, Grayscale believes that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should approve all spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications simultaneously, if it approves any, in order to ensure equal treatment of all applicants.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers; instead, the SEC should continue to provide issuesrs with feedback or guidance consistently and equitably.&#8221;</p>
<cite>Written statement.</cite></blockquote>



<p>In addition, the crypto regulator also emphasized that the SEC is ready to approve a spot bitcoin ETF based on its previous approval of a bitcoin futures ETF. The spot and futures markets of Bitcoin are closely linked (as evidenced by third-party studies showing a 99% correlation).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2098.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="711" height="474" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2098.png" alt="Grayscale Expects SEC Concurrent Approval Of Bitcoin ETFs To Balance Competitive Advantage" class="wp-image-206694" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2098.png 711w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-2098-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px" title="Grayscale Expects SEC Concurrent Approval Of Bitcoin ETFs To Balance Competitive Advantage 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Grayscale added the recent custodial sharing agreements (SSAs) between Coinbase and spot ETF providers &#8220;are not a new idea&#8221; and stated that they will not meet SEC standards. If the SEC decides to change course and approve one or more of the spot bitcoin ETF applications outlined above, &#8220;they must do so in a fair and orderly manner,&#8221; the statement said.</p>



<p>The SEC previously rejected Grayscale&#8217;s application to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF but approved a number of bitcoin ETFs based on futures. Cryptocurrency fund manager filed a lawsuit against the SEC for refusing to convert last June.</p>

<li><em>MakerDAO&#8217;s proposal to increase the DAI savings rate has been approved and the interest rate will temporarily increase to 8%.</em></li>



<li><em>The vote received almost absolute support from the community (99.93% of the community agreed).</em></li>

<p>As suggested, The <a href="https://coincu.com/206624-makerdao-unveils-innovative-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enhanced Dai Savings Rate</a> is a system to temporarily increase the effective DSR available to users in the early bootstrapping stage when DSR utilization is low. The EDSR is determined based on the DSR and the DSR utilization rate, and represents over time as the utilization increases, until it eventually disappears when utilization gets high enough. EDSR is a one-time, one-way temporary mechanism, which means that the EDSR can only decrease over time, it cannot increase again even if DSR utilization goes down.</p>



<p>The EDSR ensures that DAI holders pioneering the adoption of DSR will receive more fair value from the incremental profits generated by the protocol. In turn, this could help drive adoption and possibly push other DeFi protocols to quickly integrate DSR while EDSR is live.</p>



<p>Uilization rate here can be understood as the proportion of DAI locked into DSR / total supply of DAI in the market. Thus, it is likely that the interest rate of 8% will be maintained until 20% of the total supply of DAI is locked into the DSR.</p>

<p>In addition, the founder of Rune also said that this proposal could be put to the test and if it failed, the Stability Advisory Council could immediately deploy a vote to urgently shut down the program.</p>



<p>MakerDAO started using more income generating assets like government bonds to back DAI and share a portion of the income with users. The protocol increased the DSR to 3.49% last month to increase the appeal of DAI but has since quickly reduced it to 3.14%.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Leading venture capital firm Sequoia Capital drastically cuts its crypto fund from $585 million to $200 million.</em></li>



<li><em>The cuts come amid a downturn in the crypto industry to focus on other opportunities.</em></li>



<li><em>Sequoia had previously invested $150 million in FTX, but the company collapsed in November.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amid a cryptocurrency recession, the inflow of money dropped sharply. The latest name in downsizing crypto investments is Sequoia Capital.</strong></h5>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sequoia-capital-slashes-crypto-fund-as-it-downsizes-amid-startup-crunch-f396bb0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, citing people familiar with the matter, venture capital giant Sequoia Capital has slashed the size of its crypto fund by more than 65% to $200 million from $585 million. It also cut the size of an ecosystem fund that invests in other venture funds from $900 million to $450 million.</p>



<p>The downsizing of the fund announced to the company&#8217;s limited partners in March of this year, comes amid a widespread downturn in private technology companies and a liquidity crunch for one company&#8217;s limited number of partners.</p>



<p>Future crypto funds will be used to support startups, not large companies that are facing challenges under current conditions. As per previous news, Sequoia Capital has reorganized its venture capital team and fired two crypto investors. Last year, the company recorded zero investment in the crypto exchange FTX.</p>



<p>The demise of FTX serves as a wake-up call for the sector, and Sequoia will now roll out its shrinking fund into early-stage companies. The company says it can still invest in cryptocurrencies through its other funds.</p>



<p>Venture capital investments in cryptocurrency companies <a href="https://coincu.com/199477-vcs-crypto-funding-in-june-hits-lowest-2-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have plummeted</a> over 70% over the past 365 days, according to informationÂ <a href="https://www.rootdata.com/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>Â by RootData, a crypto data provider. During June 2022, the digital asset space received $1.81 billion in 149 rounds, whereas this year, only 83 projects registered $520 million &#8211; the lowest funded month to date.</p>

<p>While it&#8217;s true that it will be difficult to raise startup capital in 2023, that doesn&#8217;t mean the well has completely dried up &#8211; that&#8217;s especially true in the crypto space. Last week, crypto startups raised over $200 million in venture capital, led by a $54 million raise for metaverse startup Futureverse and a $40 million Series A round for RISC Zero.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the role of virtual asset operators is very important as the main gateway to prevent illegal activities, we plan to strengthen the system to encourage compliance with the law and improve the ability to predictability of laws and systems to assist operators in ensuring compliance with autonomy,&#8221; said Lee Yoon-soo, head of Korea&#8217;s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU).</p>



<p>The top five crypto exchanges in South Korea under <a href="https://coincu.com/199844-daxa-implement-virtual-asset-alert-system-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DAXA</a>, including Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax, all participated and introduced the current state of each company&#8217;s organization and human resources to respond to virtual assets crime. Each exchange has created its compliance systems to monitor illegal activity.</p>

<p>The meeting revealed that Upbit had created an anomalous transaction detection system using artificial intelligence (AI). Bithumb has developed a feature that automatically terminates trading applications when a remote control application is installed, and money laundering is detected.</p>



<p>In addition, Coinone has increased the management and supervision of &#8220;risky wallet addresses&#8221; related to financial accidents. Korbit introduced a real-time management system and a secondary review system for each stage of the Suspicious Transaction Report (STR).</p>



<p>Gopax has also set up a hotline to immediately respond to account suspension requests related to crimes like voice fraud.</p>



<p>Through collective engagement, participants commit to strengthening the common dialogue around improving compliance. They plan to meet every 2-3 months in the future to maintain this commitment.</p>

<p>A shocking incident has sent shockwaves through the crypto community as the dismembered body of 41-year-old crypto millionaire influencer Fernando Perez Algaba was found in a suitcase in Argentina. The grim discovery was made by children who stumbled upon the red suitcase in the ingeniero Budge area of Buenos Aires Province, setting off a chain of events that have now become the focus of a police investigation.</p>



<p>The parents of the children promptly informed the Buenos Aires police about the macabre find, leading to a harrowing investigation that captured the attention of the nation. The suitcase contained Algaba&#8217;s arms, legs, and other body parts, which were subsequently identified as belonging to the missing influencer.</p>



<p>The investigation took a chilling turn when authorities recovered Algaba&#8217;s head and torso a few days later. The manner in which the dismemberment was executed has led investigators to believe that the crime was committed by someone skilled, suggesting the involvement of a professional criminal. The autopsy revealed three gunshot wounds on Algaba&#8217;s body, indicating that he suffered a violent end before the dismemberment.</p>

<p>Fernando Perez Algaba was a well-known figure in the crypto space, admired and followed by many for his success in the digital asset market. While he was reported missing just a week before the horrifying discovery, details of his activities in Argentina during that time are still under investigation.</p>



<p>The influencer was easily identified by his fingerprints and distinctive tattoos. Although he was known to be residing in Spain, he had been in Argentina for an extended period leading up to his untimely demise.</p>



<p>As the news of Algaba&#8217;s tragic fate spreads, the crypto community mourns the loss of one of its own. Messages of condolences and shock flood social media platforms, with many expressing their grief and demanding justice for the slain influencer.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of FTX, has had one criminal charge relating to campaign finance dropped by US prosecutors.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite this, Bankman-Fried still faces trial in October for other charges related to the fall of FTX, which led to a slew of criminal charges against the company&#8217;s executives.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has one criminal charge <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.181.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.181.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped </a>by US prosecutors.

<p>Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried has had one of the criminal charges against him dropped. Specifically, the US federal prosecutors have eliminated the campaign finance charges against him. Although this may be viewed as a win for Bankman-Fried, he is still set to face a trial in October to defend himself against other criminal charges related to the fall of FTX.</p>



<p>FTX&#8217;s downfall has been one of the most significant controversies in the industry&#8217;s young history, and its collapse led to various criminal charges against the company&#8217;s executives. Bankman-Fried, the co-founder of FTX, was detained in the Bahamas following the platform&#8217;s rapid collapse and was then extradited to the United States, where he faced over 13 criminal charges.</p>



<p>The prosecutors announced that the Bahamas officials informed them that the nation&#8217;s government did not intend to extradite Bankman-Fried on the specific campaign finance charge. Therefore, the prosecution has opted not to go further with the campaign contributions count amid the impending trial.</p>



<p>This news comes after the prosecutors had initially charged Bankman-Fried with potential violations related to Federal Election campaigns. Still, they have now dropped these charges, leaving him with only the fraud charges related to the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s collapse.</p>



<p>Despite the dropped charge, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s legal woes are far from over, and he will still have to face trial in October. While this news may be seen as a positive development for the former CEO, it remains to be seen how the rest of the case will unfold.</p>

<li><em>Binance experienced a significant increase in trading volume after listing Worldcoin, doing $65 million in volume in the first hour.</em></li>



<li><em>The circulating supply of Worldcoin is 111 million, with 100 million sent to market makers and 11 million claimed by users during the pre-launch phase.</em></li>

Binance saw a sharp increase in trading volume after listing.</strong></h5>



<p>Recently, the circulating supply of Worldcoin was revealed to be 111 million, with 100 million of those tokens being loaned to market makers. The other 11 million tokens were claimed by users who participated in the pre-launch phase. As more users claim their tokens, the circulating supply will increase, with 1.6 billion WLD tokens set to unlock by next year.</p>



<p>What makes Worldcoin unique is the involvement of market makers in the token&#8217;s launch. Five market makers were loaned 100 million WLD tokens for a period of three months, after which they can return the tokens or purchase them for $2.00 plus ($0.04 * X), where X is the number of tokens purchased divided by 1 million. This arrangement creates an interesting game theory dynamic, which anchors the token&#8217;s price around $2 and incentivizes users to participate in the pre-launch phase.</p>

<p>The launch of Worldcoin was one of the most orderly launches in recent memory. Bybit and Huobi were the first exchanges to list the token, with Huobi experiencing some false starts before trading began in earnest. Uniswap joined the fray next, with its price eventually converging with other centralized exchanges over a 45-minute period. Binance&#8217;s listing caused a spike in volatility before prices quickly converged and began to trade in lockstep. Despite some price divergences, this was a clean launch in terms of price discovery.</p>



<p>In the first two hours, the combined volume for other exchanges was $16 million. In Binance&#8217;s first hour of listing, it did $65 million in volume, followed by Bybit at $14 million. Huobi&#8217;s hourly volume was also steady compared to other exchanges.</p>

<p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has launched Amazon Managed Blockchain (AMB), a fully managed service that provides developers access to blockchain data across multiple chains through application programming interfaces (APIs). The service offers AMB Access, which expands AMB&#8217;s node offerings with serverless, scalable access to blockchains. </p>



<p>Developers can use standard remote procedure calls to interact with digital assets and distributed applications across multiple blockchains without specialized infrastructure. The service will initially support the Bitcoin network. AMB Query provides developers access to blockchain data across multiple chains, beginning with Bitcoin and Ethereum, through APIs. Pricing is done through a pay-as-you-go model.</p>



<p>During the two-day AWS Web3/Blockchain Summit in New York City, the company expanded the general availability of AMB Access and Query functions. Amazon lists the potential use cases as custodial and wallet crypto applications and Web3 consumer engagement campaigns that use non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>



<p>Amazon Web Services is the largest provider of cloud services in the world. The Seattle-founded tech giant added Amazon Managed Blockchain to the mix in 2019 and has gradually moved further into the Web3 space. Earlier this year, Amazon posted new job listings for Web3 staffers.</p>



<p>Developers can now interact with digital assets and distributed applications across multiple blockchains without specialized infrastructure. In addition, the service will initially support the Bitcoin network, which is the most well-known and widely used blockchain.</p>
