title: MicroStrategy sold its Bitcoin for good reason

<p>Some eyebrows were raised when Microstrategy sold a part of its Bitcoin holdings, even though the company then bought more. A tax loophole was the reason.</p>
Sell at a loss then immediately repurchase
<p>Crypto investors can reduce their capital gains tax in 2022 by selling their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchasing them, thanks to a regulatory distinction that crypto assets have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy was recently used by business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which bought 2,395 bitcoin on Wednesday, sold a portion at a loss, and bought 810 bitcoin just two days later.</p>
Crypto still an asset and not a security
<p>Unlike other securities, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not consider crypto to be a security, but rather an asset, which means that certain tax laws, such as the "wash rule," do not apply to it. This allows investors to sell crypto at a net loss and buy it back instantly while still being able to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other investors who sell securities for a net loss at the end of the tax year can deduct up to $3,000 from their capital gains tax and carry any additional losses over to the next tax year.</p>
IRS could change its policy
<p>Crypto investors will continue to have this advantage as long as the IRS maintains its current policy of treating crypto as assets rather than securities. This allows investors to sell their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchase them, allowing them to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the IRS has not made any official statements on this matter, and it is possible that they may change their policy in the future. It is worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers many widely-traded cryptocurrencies to be securities, which has been a source of controversy in the crypto community.</p>
