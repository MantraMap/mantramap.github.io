Bitcoin (BTC) has been no stranger to dramatic price swings in the volatile cryptocurrency world. As September approaches, market analysts closely monitor BTC&#8217;s possibility of plunging below the $25,000 mark.  However, history has shown that September&#8217;s struggles often pave the way for a resurgence in October, with massive rallies that rekindle investor optimism.  Potential For BTC To Drop Below $25,000 Before A Promising October When examining Bitcoin&#8217;s historical performance during September, it becomes evident that the month has posed challenges for the world&#8217;s most renowned cryptocurrency.  Related Reading: BREAKING: Did Solana Miss A Golden Opportunity To Collaborate With PayPal’s PYUSD Stablecoin? Previous September has witnessed BTC experiencing declines of up to 13%. This downward trend has undoubtedly concerned traders and investors, raising questions about the sustainability of Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish momentum. According to Timothy Peterson, market analyst and investment Manager, based on current market analysis, there is a 50% probability that Bitcoin&#8217;s price will dip below the $25,000 threshold before September concludes.  While a potential drop below $25,000 might cause temporary unease among Bitcoin enthusiasts, historical patterns suggest that October could be the month to look forward to.  In the past, September&#8217;s price declines have often catalyzed significant rallies in the subsequent month. Observing the heatmap above, Peterson identified instances where Bitcoin rebounded with gains as high as 48% following sharp declines in September. If Bitcoin does indeed experience a dip below $25,000 in September, it may mark the final significant correction before the commencement of a new bull run cycle.  On this note, Peterson believes that such a dip, coupled with the subsequent recovery and October&#8217;s potential rally, could set the stage for substantial gains in the coming months. Bitcoin Bullish Divergence As BTC experienced a drop from $32,000 to $29,000, trader Ali Martinez highlighted a significant trend; the number of new Bitcoin addresses continued to rise steadily.  Related Reading: Ripple Is Now A Member Of Trade Organization That Hosts The Likes Of BlackRock This intriguing divergence between price and network growth provides insights into BTC&#8217;s potentially stable long-term uptrend.  While Bitcoin&#8217;s price exhibited a downward trajectory, the number of newly created Bitcoin addresses has consistently grown.  This divergence is noteworthy, suggesting that despite short-term price fluctuations, the network&#8217;s expansion remains robust. It signifies a growing interest in Bitcoin adoption and usage, which, in turn, supports the notion of a stable and sustainable long-term uptrend. Conversely, Bitcoin remains trapped within a price range of $29,200 and $28,900, a pattern that has persisted since the start of August. As of the time of writing, BTC is trading at $28,960, reflecting a 0.5% decrease in the last 24 hours. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com
