<h2>Peter Schiff on U.S. Dollar’s ‘Death Blow’</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff explained that a death blow is coming for the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency in a recent interview with Commodity Culture, which he shared this week.</p>
<p>Regarding whether de-dollarization is happening and whether it&#8217;s a real threat to the U.S. dollar&#8217;s global reserve currency status, Schiff said: “The only thing that’s surprising about the dollar’s reserve status is that it still has it. Despite everything that we’ve done, we still haven&#8217;t lost that privilege.” He elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the current financial crisis which just started is going to ultimately deliver the death blow to that status.</p></blockquote>
<p>The economist added: “People are still reluctant to call it a financial crisis, but that’s exactly what it is, except it’s bigger in scale and it’s going to be far more impactful than the 2008 crisis.” He cautioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s probably going to result in even more aggressive and reckless monetary and fiscal policy. And this time, it’s going to take the dollar’s reserve status down with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s going to really complicate things here in the U.S. because it&#8217;s going to send inflation much, much higher and American standards of living much lower,&#8221; he opined.</p>

<p>Responding to a question about whether the U.S. dollar is at risk of hyperinflation, Schiff detailed: &#8220;There&#8217;s always a risk. For every country that issues fiat currency, inflation is always a risk. The question is how high is the probability.” The economist continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the risk is a lot higher now than it&#8217;s ever been, and in order to avoid that outcome, it&#8217;s going to required some very difficult political decisions and choices that need to be made to avert that outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff has consistently warned about an incoming <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-says-banking-crisis-not-over-much-worse-financial-crisis-incoming-warns-of-massive-recession/">financial crisis</a>. Earlier this month, he advised people to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-advises-get-rid-of-your-us-dollars-now-warns-usds-reserve-currency-status-in-jeopardy/">gid rid of their U.S. dollars</a> now. Last month, he warned of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-of-us-dollar-devaluation-and-biggest-economic-disaster-in-history/">biggest economic disaster</a> in U.S. history.</p>

Expecting to see $100K per bitcoin, he emphasized that the crypto does not need the Fed or government bailout because it&#x2019;s &#x201C;people&#x2019;s money.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Why Robert Kiyosaki Loves Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, shared on Twitter Thursday why he loves bitcoin. He expects to see the price of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> hit $100K. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. Over 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Thursday explaining that years ago, he watched the price of the largest cryptocurrency climb to $20,000 and then shed almost all of its value. At the time, he thought bitcoin was finished. However, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> slowly climbed to $6,000, he bought &#x201C;lots&#x201D; of it. His reasoning was that people support bitcoin and not the Fed or government. Bitcoin did not need the Fed or the government to bail it out because it&#x2019;s people&#x2019;s money.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-584503 aligncenter" title="Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Robert Kiyosaki Shares Why He Loves Bitcoin &#x2014; Expects BTC to Hit $100K" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-loves-bitcoin.jpg" alt="Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Robert Kiyosaki Shares Why He Loves Bitcoin &#x2014; Expects BTC to Hit $100K" width="731" height="186" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-loves-bitcoin-300x76.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kiyosaki-loves-bitcoin.jpg 731w" sizes="(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px"></p>
<p>In a recent Rich Dad Radio show, the famous author revealed that he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoins-price-to-keep-rising-says-im-betting-on-it/">bought 60 bitcoins</a> at $6,000 per coin. He also previously said he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-he-likes-bitcoin-calls-btc-peoples-money/">bought some more</a> <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> at $9,000.</p>

<p>Kiyosaki has recommended bitcoin alongside gold and silver for quite some time. He recently said he expects the price of bitcoin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoins-price-to-keep-rising-says-im-betting-on-it/">keep rising</a>. In his Thursday tweet, he mentioned $100,000 as a price for bitcoin. However, he predicted in February that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-bitcoin-hitting-500k-by-2025-and-gold-soaring-to-5k/">bitcoin will hit $500,000 by 2025</a> while gold will hit $5,000 and silver to reach $500 in the same time period.</p>
<p>The renowned author also repeatedly warned about the U.S. economy and the direction the U.S. dollar is headed. Last month, he predicted a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-of-crash-landing-ahead-as-bailouts-begin-advises-buying-more-bitcoin/">crash landing</a> ahead, noting that the Federal Reserve&#x2019;s rate hikes will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-fed-rate-hikes-will-crash-stocks-bonds-real-estate-and-us-dollar/">crash</a> stocks, bonds, real estate, as well as the U.S. dollar. He also warned of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-america-is-dying-warns-of-hyperinflation-death-of-us-dollar/">hyperinflation</a>.</p>

However, the meme token pepe (PEPE) has surged 77% against the U.S. dollar, and its market capitalization has swelled to $141 million, just $24 million shy of its all-time high valuation. Other top meme coin assets, including dogecoin and shibu inu, have risen by 1.2% to 1.4% today, while baby doge coin has experienced a 10% increase in value over the past day.</strong></p>
<h2>While the Meme Coin Market Is Down, Pepe and Babypepe Tokens Jump in Value</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/meme-token">meme coin market</a> has declined 3.1% against the U.S. dollar over the past 24 hours and currently stands at $18.9 billion. On Saturday, eight of the top ten meme coins saw daily gains, with the new crypto asset <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pepe">pepe (PEPE)</a> leading the way. PEPE has risen 77% in the last day and is now 513.15% higher than the meme coin&#8217;s all-time low of $0.000000055142 per unit, which was recorded on April 18.</p>
<p>Although the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/new-pepe-the-frog-crypto-token-becomes-sixth-largest-meme-coin-by-market-cap/">new PEPE coin</a> has risen 77% today, it remains down more than 15% from its all-time high, which was recorded on April 20. On that day, a single PEPE coin was exchanged for $0.000000399788, and the token&#8217;s market capitalization exceeded $165 million. Currently, at $0.000000336030 per unit, the meme coin&#8217;s market valuation is $141 million today.

<p>On Saturday, other notable gainers in the meme coin market included baby doge coin (BABYDOGE), which rose 10%, floki (FLOKI), up 5.5%, and dejitaru tsuka (TSUKA), up 7.5% against the U.S. dollar. In terms of meme coin trading volume on Saturday, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DOGE/">dogecoin (DOGE)</a> led the way with $610 million over the past day, while shibu inu (SHIB) had $172 million in global 24-hour trade volume. PEPE commanded the third-largest volume for meme coins over the weekend, with $54 million.</p>

<p>PEPE&#8217;s gains have seemingly propelled other Pepe the Frog-related crypto assets up in value over the past 24 hours, with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/search_redirect?id=zkpepe&amp;type=coin">zkpepe</a> up 9.9%, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/search_redirect?id=mcpepe-s&amp;type=coin">mcpepe’s</a> jumping 4.1%, and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/search_redirect?id=pepe-bet&amp;type=coin">PEPE.bet</a> rising 0.7%. Interestingly, according to Coingecko.com metrics, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/search_redirect?id=babypepe&amp;type=coin">babypepe</a> (BABYPEPE) saw a 132% increase against the U.S. dollar during the last day. Babypepe is only a few days old, similar to the new PEPE token, after gathering fiat value on April 18, 2023. While babypepe has more than four quadrillion tokens, both coingecko.com and <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/babypepe/">coinmarketcap.com</a> do not list the new coin&#8217;s market valuation.</p>

The legal team asserts that U.S. law precludes regulators &#8220;from using federal securities law to assert jurisdiction over the digital assets in this case.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Co-Founder’s Legal Team Claims SEC Lacks Jurisdiction Over Digital Assets in Terra Case</h2>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-22/do-kwon-says-sec-is-out-of-bounds-in-pursuing-crypto-fraud-suit?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=business&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, Kwon&#8217;s lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing that the SEC&#8217;s case relies on outdated regulations and that the agency&#8217;s definition of digital assets as securities <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-deems-dash-algo-and-omg-unregistered-securities-in-bittrex-lawsuit/">is far from clear</a>. In fact, Patrick McHenry (R-NC), the House Financial Services Committee chairman, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethers-security-status-remains-unclear-as-sec-chair-gensler-fails-to-answer-lawmakers-question/">expressed</a> that there is &#8220;a great deal of uncertainty&#8221; regarding the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions. Kwon&#8217;s lawyers capitalize on this ambiguity to assert that the SEC&#8217;s attempt to categorize all cryptocurrencies as securities falls short.</p>
<p>Kwon’s lawyers stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC’s improper assertion of power here by trying to shoehorn all cryptocurrencies into its definition of a ‘security’ fails.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kwon faces <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-and-ceo-do-kwon-charged-by-sec-with-multibillion-dollar-crypto-fraud/">charges</a> by the SEC of leading &#8220;a multibillion-dollar crypto-asset securities fraud&#8221; filed in mid-February 2023. The SEC alleged that the stablecoin terrausd (UST) and Terra&#8217;s token LUNA were &#8220;unregistered securities&#8221; and that Kwon had created a suite of mirrored assets that replicated the value of U.S. stocks, which were used on the now-defunct defi platform Mirror.</p>

<p>This lawsuit is not the first time Kwon and the SEC have crossed paths. The SEC had previously served Kwon with a subpoena in 2021 over the Mirror protocol, and Kwon had <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-suing-sec/">sued the SEC</a> over its lack of jurisdiction. In November 2021, the SEC <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-files-action-against-terraform-labs-ceo-do-kwon-regarding-mirror-protocol/">attempted to compel</a> Kwon with subpoenas, seeking documents from Terraform Labs. Six months later, the once-stablecoin UST depegged, leading to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/a-dark-day-for-crypto-a-deep-dive-into-the-obliterated-terra-token-ecosystem-and-damaged-apps/">colossal collapse</a> of the Terra blockchain ecosystem.</p>
<p>Kwon currently is in custody in Montenegro after <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">his arrest</a> on March 23 for possessing false identification. He is at risk of extradition by law enforcement officials from the U.S. and South Korea over the Terra ecosystem&#8217;s collapse and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-daniel-shins-firm-chai-reportedly-raided-by-seoul-prosecutors/">transactions</a> involving its native assets, UST and LUNA. According to a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwons-terraform-sent-7-million-to-law-firm-before-collapse-report-unveils/">report</a>, Kwon had paid $7 million to a top law firm in South Korea before the Terra ecosystem&#8217;s collapse.</p>

However, the intervening weeks have seen a sharp decline in crypto-AI economy gains, with losses of $730 million. The three most prominent AI-driven crypto projects have all suffered double-digit losses, ranging from 10% to 29.58%, against the U.S. dollar over the last 30 days.</strong></p>
<h2>Interest in the Combination of Crypto and Artificial Intelligence Has Declined, Crypto-AI Token Economy Sheds $730M</h2>
<p>Various data points suggest that interest in and value of crypto-AI projects has waned. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&amp;q=crypto%20AI&amp;hl=en">Global search trends</a> for “crypto ai” peaked in early February 2023, with a Google Trends&#8217; score of 100. Despite the rise, over the past 90 days, the score has slumped to a low of 22. Slovenia, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Lebanon, and Nigeria make up the top five countries interested in “crypto ai” searches at present.</p>

<p>In February, the collective crypto AI economy reached a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/artificial-intelligence-crypto-assets-continue-to-surge-accounting-for-4-billion-in-market-value/">$4 billion milestone</a>, driven by impressive gains among top AI-focused cryptocurrencies following a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/23/microsoftandopenaiextendpartnership/">multibillion-dollar investment</a> by Microsoft in Openai, the creators of Chatgpt. However, the crypto AI sector has since incurred significant losses. <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/cryptos/ai/">Current data</a> from cryptoslate.com indicates that $730 million has been wiped off the crypto AI token economy.</p>

<p>The largest crypto AI asset by market capitalization, graph (GRT), has suffered a loss of 10.71% in the past month. The second largest AI-centric crypto asset, singularitynet (AGIX), has fared worse, down 29.58% in the same period. Fetch (FET), the third largest crypto AI token, has seen a 14.36% drop in value over the past 30 days. Most of these losses occurred during the last seven days of trading, coinciding with a general downturn in the broader crypto market.</p>

<p>Overall, the crypto tokens associated with artificial intelligence have declined by 7.38%. The past week has been particularly rough, with a drop of 15.70% recorded. Currently, the 24-hour global trade volume for the crypto AI sector stands at $325.58 million. Interestingly, the cannabis-focused crypto sector is currently the top performer, having gained 3.89% against the greenback in the past week, according to data from cryptoslate.com.</p>

While this figure falls short of the number of Ordinal inscriptions, stamp creators are exploring new ways to leverage this technology.</strong></p>
<h2>Number of Bitcoin Stamps Rises Above 18,000</h2>
<p>A mere 17 days ago, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-stamps-emerge-as-new-image-storage-trend-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-over-8000-stamps-minted-so-far/">reported</a> on the trend of Bitcoin Stamps, as more than 8,000 stamps had been minted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Since then, the tally has grown to <a href="https://stampchain.io/">18,443 stamps</a>. The trend of creating stamps began following the craze of Ordinal inscriptions, and proponents of stamp technology argue that it enhances permanence, as stamps cannot be pruned like witness or signature data.</p>
<p>Stamp creation comes with a higher price tag than Ordinal inscriptions, and the creators suggest using &#x201C;24&#xD7;24 pixel, 8-color-depth PNG or GIF&#x201D; files for encoding stamps. However, creators have <a href="https://twitter.com/adamamcbride/status/1649534197718024193?s=20">managed</a> to develop high-resolution artwork using scalable vector graphics (SVGs). Recently, a user managed to <a href="https://twitter.com/ordinalsbot/status/1649498682402787337?s=20">attach an MP3</a> to a stamp, and the classic game of Snake was also <a href="https://twitter.com/adamamcbride/status/1649534199336976384?s=20">appended</a> to a stamp.</p>

<p>Though still in its early stages, stamps are sold over-the-counter (OTC) and through <a href="https://twitter.com/tencryptoes/status/1647668532845457411?s=20">Emblem Vault sales</a>. The wallet Hiro, which supports Ordinal inscriptions, <a href="https://twitter.com/hirowallet/status/1645902875854241792?s=20">expressed interest</a> in adding support for Stamps in the future, and welcomed Hiro Wallet pull requests on the team&#x2019;s Github page. In addition, the <a href="https://www.rarestamp.xyz/0">Rare Stamp</a> platform is a web portal that parses Bitcoin-based stamps, displaying prices and collections.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rarestamp.xyz/collection">Collections</a> include Stampunks, Bitcoin Flocks, Broken JPGS, Stamp Pepes, Stamp Pepes Not, Stamp Wizards, Pixel Gods, Classic Arcade, Depepes, and more. Stamp #791 from the Stampunks collection has a floor value of <a href="https://www.rarestamp.xyz/stamp/A245455820662787070">0.05 BTC or $1,365</a>. While the number of stamps approaches the 20,000 mark, the number of Ordinal inscriptions has surpassed <a href="https://ordinals.com/">1.3 million</a> inscriptions as of April 22, 2023. On the same day, the number of Ordinal inscriptions on the Litecoin blockchain was <a href="https://litecoin.earlyordies.com/inscription/7f9e38b50100ab787e56d8b5d0566949835eb0149be4a65549bdaaadd843dcf9i0">224,059</a>.</p>

However, taking a broader perspective, the precious metal has made significant gains this year. Over the past six months, silver has risen more than 29% against the greenback, and as of April 22, 2023, it was hovering around $25.08 per ounce. Citi analysts recently projected that silver prices could increase to $30 per ounce this year, citing &#8220;near-perfect conditions for the ongoing bull market&#8221; in silver markets.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Analysts See Potential for Silver Market to Take Off</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Although silver has experienced a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SILVER/">recent decline</a>, the precious metal has made significant gains in 2023. Last week, Citi analysts, led by Maximilian Layton, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2023/04/18/silver-prices-dollar-decline-precious-metal/?sh=73f649176409">told</a> Forbes writer Jonathan Ponciano that the U.S. dollar still has room to weaken. In a recent note, Layton and the Citi analysts stated that &#8220;precious metals, and especially silver, [have] near-perfect conditions for the ongoing bull market.&#8221; They also projected that silver could increase by 18% to around $30 per ounce in the coming months.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-584472 size-full" title="Citi Analysts Predict ‘Near-Perfect Conditions’ for Silver's Ongoing Bull Market; Experts Suggest $30 an Ounce a Possibility" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silver_2023-04-22_07-39-03.png" alt="Citi Analysts Predict ‘Near-Perfect Conditions’ for Silver's Ongoing Bull Market; Experts Suggest $30 an Ounce a Possibility" width="1996" height="778" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silver_2023-04-22_07-39-03-300x117.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silver_2023-04-22_07-39-03-1024x399.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silver_2023-04-22_07-39-03-768x299.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silver_2023-04-22_07-39-03-1536x599.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/silver_2023-04-22_07-39-03.png 1996w" sizes="(max-width: 1996px) 100vw, 1996px" /></p>
<p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Citi analysts noted a &#8220;distinct possibility&#8221; of $34 per ounce in 6 to 12 months. In recent times, several market researchers and economic forecasters have predicted a bullish year for silver. Despite a slight drop this week, Fxempire analyst Christopher Lewis <a href="https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/silver-price-forecast-silver-continues-to-threaten-resistance-2-1341092"><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasized</span></a> on Thursday that &#8220;silver continues to threaten resistance.&#8221; Lewis added, “On the upside, if we were to take out the recent high, then we could go looking to the $27 level, which also has been important.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">He went on to say, &#8220;If we take that out, then it’s possible that we may enter a phase where the silver market takes off like it did a couple of times in the past, trying to get all the way to the $50 level.&#8221; In a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4573442-silver-price-may-touch-30-per-ounce-2023">Jan. 30 article</a> on Seeking Alpha, author Anna Sokolidou suggested that silver could reach $30 this year, citing <a href="https://twitter.com/nixsa84">Nicky Shiels</a>, head of metals strategy and macro for MKS Pamp Group. According to Sokolidou, Shiels&#8217; &#8220;bullish case&#8221; predicts that one ounce of silver could reach the price of $30 or more.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Janie Simpson, managing director at ABC Bullion, also shared this optimistic outlook for $30 silver. “Silver has historically delivered gains of close to 20% per annum in years inflation is high. Given that track record, and how cheap silver remains relative to gold, it wouldn’t surprise to see silver head towards $30 per ounce this year, though that will likely offer significant resistance,” Janie Simpson <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/20/metals-silver-prices-could-hit-a-9-year-high-in-2023-outpacing-gold.html">told</a> CNBC at the end of January.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.kitco.com/news/2022-12-30/Retail-investors-see-silver-prices-rallying-more-than-50-in-2023-to-38-an-ounce.html">Kitco&#8217;s 2023 Outlook</a>, author Neils Christensen reported that retail investors expect to see silver prices rally more than 50% in 2023. At the end of 2022, Kitco surveyed 1,482 investors about the price of silver by the end of 2023. &#8220;On average, retail investors see silver prices rising to $38 an ounce,&#8221; Christensen reported. A retail investor from Middleville, Michigan, told Kitco that silver prices could double this year and surpass $40 per ounce. The Michigan resident believes that the industrial metal will also serve as a hedge against inflation and the stock market.</p>

The meme coin dropped below a key price floor at $0.080 following today’s plunge. Shiba inu was also lower to start the weekend, falling by as much as 3%.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) moved to a three-week low to start the weekend, as bears pushed the meme coin below a key price level.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.08435 on Friday, DOGE/USD dropped to a bottom at $0.07752 in today’s session.</p>
<p>Saturday’s decline saw DOGE fall below a long-term support point at $0.080, hitting its weakest point since April 3.</p>

<p>From the chart, it appears that dogecoin has found a new floor at near the $0.0760 mark, which comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also consolidated.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index is now tracking at 43.21, which is close to a support point at 42.00.</p>
<p>The next visible resistance level looks to be at 51.00, and should bulls begin to move towards this, DOGE will soon be back above $0.090.</p>

<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Another meme coin in the red on Saturday was shiba inu (SHIB) which also slipped to a multi-week low.</p>
<p>SHIB/USD dropped to a low of $0.00001012 to start the weekend, less than 24 hours after trading at a peak of $0.00001064</p>
<p>This is the lowest level that shiba inu has hit since March 11, and comes following a four-day losing streak.</p>

<p>The recent mini-bear run has now pushed the 10-day (red) moving average to the brink of a downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>As of writing this, shiba inu continues to hover close to an area of support at the $0.00001020 level.</p>
<p>Price strength is also marginally above a floor of its own at 37.00.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) was in the red for a fourth consecutive session, as prices neared a breakout below $27,000.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD plunged to a low of $27,169.57 to start the weekend, a day after trading at a high of $28,291.60.</p>
<p>Saturday&#x2019;s drop in price resulted in bitcoin falling to its lowest point in roughly three and a half weeks.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, this latest downturn has pushed the 10-day (red) moving average closer to a cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the relative strength index is now tracking at 41.73, which is marginally higher than its long-term floor at 41.00.</p>
<p>If price strength were to slip below this point, there is a good chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will move toward $26,000.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) continued to trend lower on Saturday, as the world&#x2019;s second-largest cryptocurrency dropped below $1,900.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,926.30 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to an intraday low at $1,827.79 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>As a result of this move, ethereum started the weekend by declining to its weakest level since April 9.</p>

<p>Today&#x2019;s price slippage also resulted in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> briefly breaking out of an interim support point at $1,830.</p>
<p>Bulls swiftly reentered the market seemingly buying the dip, and this has resulted in ethereum now trading at $1,848.66.</p>
<p>Although there is likely to be further declines in the coming days, once this current red wave passes, there may be a significant reversal.</p>

Yellen said that the U.S. government will not hesitate to punish Chinese companies that violate its Russian sanctions policy. </strong></p>
<h2>U.S. Ready to Shore up Its Financial System</h2>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said while her country’s financial system is still in good shape the United States government is still prepared to take &#8220;any necessary steps&#8221; to ensure it remains the most dominant, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/yellen-us-banking-system-remains-sound-2023-04-20/#:~:text=%22The%20U.S.%20banking%20system%20remains,School%20of%20Advanced%20International%20Studies.">report</a> has said.</p>
<p>In her speech at the Johns Hopkins University&#8217;s School of Advanced International Studies, Yellen also touted the recent actions taken to shore up the financial system by U.S. authorities following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The comments by Yellen come amidst a growing chorus for the adoption of an alternative reserve currency.</p>
<p>As has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-acknowledges-sanctions-weaponization-could-hurt-dollar-hegemony/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, several countries led by Russia and China are pursuing cross-border settlement methods that exclude the U.S. dollar. These countries accuse the United States government of weaponizing the greenback and using its overbearing influence on the global financial system to punish its enemies.</p>
<p>These accusations as well as the ongoing attempts to de-dollarize have prompted economists to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/de-dollarization-escalates-amid-us-economic-warfare-and-error-fraught-policies-economist-says/">warn</a> that the U.S. dollar may eventually lose its position as the most dominant currency in the world. Losing this status would the United States’ ability to project its financial power globally.</p>

<p>However, Yellen vowed that the U.S. government would take steps to ensure its financial system will the strongest and safest in the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. banking system remains sound and we will take any necessary steps to ensure the United States continues to have the strongest and safest financial system in the world,&#8221; Yellen reportedly said.</p>
<p>Although she recently conceded that the weaponization of the U.S. dollar could potentially cause problems for her country, <a href="https://www.forexlive.com/news/treasury-secretary-yellen-banking-system-remains-sound-20230420/">warned</a> in her speech that the United States government will not hesitate to punish Chinese companies that violate its sanctions on Russia. She added that her government will also impose sanctions on human rights abusers.</p>
