<p>One of Europe&rsquo;s leading decentralized crypto exchanges, StormGain DEX, is looking to replace complicated wallet addresses with human-readable names in order to improve access to its trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do so, it&rsquo;s partnering with a company called Unstoppable Domains, whose technology makes it possible to replace lengthy and seemingly-random blockchain addresses with simple names that are easier to remember.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unstoppable Domains has been around since 2018 and to date has registered more than 2.5 million readable blockchain addresses. Its platform lets users create a crypto-centric domain extension, in order to replace their difficult-to-remember wallet addresses. So instead of a random string of 37 hexadecimal characters, you can create a fun name such as &ldquo;hotdog.bitcoin&rdquo; or &ldquo;superman.blockchain&rdquo; that&rsquo;s issued as an NFT, and easy for people to remember. More than 300 decentralized applications already support Unstoppable Domains wallet addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StormGain, which also offers a centralized trading platform, said its partnership with Unstoppable Domains will provide enhanced security and more convenient access to users of its platform. Security is improved because it&rsquo;s all too easy to make a mistake when typing out traditional crypto addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, StormGain said Unstoppable Domains is also being added as a new authorization method. What that means is users can authorize access to StormGain DEX using their Unstoppable Domains account, in order to trade cryptocurrencies directly with any wallet associated with that account. According to the company, this will simplify the onboarding process for new users and improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage users to adopt an Unstoppable Domain wallet address, StormGain said it&rsquo;s offering a 25% discount on the price of any domain to all users. The offer will run for five days and automatically be applied at check out when users register a new address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>StormGain said it&rsquo;s confident that its partnership with Unstoppable Domains will help to change the way people interact with, and own, crypto assets. It said its ongoing mission is to provide the best possible crypto trading experience for all users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are excited to partner with Unstoppable Domains to offer our account users a more secure and convenient way to access our platform,&rdquo; a spokesperson for StormGain said.&nbsp;</p>
