The company, which uses its biometric World ID system to differentiate human beings, stated it has more than doubled the number of sign-ups since January when it reported having passed its first million.</strong></p>
<h2>Worldcoin Passes 2 Million Sign-Ups</h2>
<p>The Worldcoin project, a startup building an identity database of users as a public utility, has <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldocin-passes-2-million-world-id-sign-ups-demand-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> two million sign-ups using its World ID protocol. The company — which is backed by Openai co-founder <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/openai-boss-sam-altman-claims-hes-not-involved-in-worldcoins-day-to-day-operations-at-all/">Sam Altman</a> — reported that these sign-ups came via people registering from cities such as Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo, as part of the &#8220;<a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-orb-going-on-tour-globally" target="_blank" rel="noopener">world tour</a>&#8221; announced in May. Overall, Worldcoin is registering more than 40,000 sign-ups each week.</p>
<p>The World ID protocol requires using special hardware devices for users to register to prove their &#8220;uniqueness and humanness in a privacy-preserving way.&#8221; The device, called the Orb, reads the user&#8217;s iris using two cameras and stores a high-definition image.</p>
<p>The cities mentioned have been provided with several Orbs, allowing users to scan their irises at selected locations. Worldcoin stated that it reached two million sign-ups in less than half the time it took them to score the first <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-passed-1-million-sign-ups" target="_blank" rel="noopener">million</a>.</p>
<p>On reaching this milestone, Worldcoin stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Achieving 2 million World ID sign-ups is more than just an accomplishment for the Worldcoin community; it’s also a significant milestone in the broader global effort to make digitally-verifiable identity more accessible to everyone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin reported that, in response to the growing demand for verified World IDs, it will ramp up the availability of Orbs in the coming months. The project is still in its beta phases.</p>

<h2>Integration Growing</h2>
<p>The startup also stated its World ID protocol was being integrated into other apps, which are taking advantage of its identification database. To ease its integration tasks, Auth0, a company that provides identity and authentication services for third parties, developed a &#8220;sign in with Worldcoin&#8221; <a href="https://marketplace.auth0.com/integrations/worldcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">integration plugin</a>, allowing the protocol to be used in tens of thousands of applications using Auth0&#8217;s services.</p>
<p>Also, Talent Protocol, a Web3 developer social platform, recently <a href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/talent-protocol-first-web3-platform-integrate-world-id-europe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it included World ID as one of the various ways of getting verified. Talent Protocol&#8217;s Pedro Oliveria stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human verification is a fundamental trust component for any builders community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worldcoin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-app-to-bolster-decentralized-identity-and-finance-for-mass-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> its World App in May, designed to serve as a wallet that supports the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/worldcoin-launches-world-id-an-ai-resistant-iris-dependant-id-protocol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World ID protocol</a> and get Worldcoin tokens, which the company intends to give as a sort of universal basic income (UBI) for verified users.</p>

Regarding Blackrock’s bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the executive stressed: “We are working with our regulators because, as in any new market, if Blackrock’s name is going to be on it, we’re going to make sure that it’s safe and sound and protected.”</strong></p>
<h2>Blackrock CEO Larry Fink Highlights Crypto&#8217;s &#8216;Differentiating Value&#8217;</h2>
<p>Larry Fink, the CEO and chairman of Blackrock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, discussed cryptocurrency in an interview with CNBC on Friday. Blackrock <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">filed</a> to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 15. While the SEC has rejected all bitcoin ETF applications so far, many are hopeful that the securities regulator will approve Blackrock’s filing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over the last five years, more and more global investors are asking us about the role of crypto,&#8221; the Blackrock CEO shared. &#8220;As I said, I do believe a lot of crypto is an international asset,&#8221; the executive continued, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has a differentiating value versus other asset classes, but more importantly, because it’s so international it’s going to transcend any one currency and currency valuation.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you just look at the value of our dollar — how it depreciated the last two months and how much it appreciated over the last five years — an international crypto product can really transcend that,&#8221; Fink noted. &#8220;And that&#8217;s why we believe there&#8217;s great opportunities and that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re seeing more and more interest, and that interest is broad-based, worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>“We believe we have a responsibility to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-seeks-to-democratize-crypto-ceo-says-bitcoin-can-hedge-against-inflation-currency-devaluation/">democratize</a> investing. We’ve done a great job, and the role of ETFs in the world is transforming investing. And we’re only at the beginning of that,” Fink detailed.</p>
<p>Regarding Blackrock’s bitcoin ETF filing, Fink stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are working with our regulators because, as in any new market, if Blackrock’s name is going to be on it, we’re going to make sure that it’s safe and sound and protected.</p></blockquote>

This seems backwards to say the least,&#x201D; he stressed.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>SEC v Ripple Ruling &#x2018;Troubling on Multiple Fronts&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark shared his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ripple-decision-cause-crypto-celebration-momentarily-best-stark/">analysis</a> of the SEC v. Ripple <a href="https://news-bitcoin-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">ruling</a> concerning <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> on Linkedin Friday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The Ripple decision is troubling on multiple fronts,&#x201D; he stressed, adding:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>IMHO, the decision resides on shaky ground, is likely (and ripe) for appeal, will likely result in reversal and is not necessarily a cause for celebration.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Regarding the offering of securities, the court categorized Ripple&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> offering into three distinct categories: institutional sales, programmatic sales, and other sales. Each category received a separate ruling, Stark explained. Ripple Labs&#x2019; chief legal officer, Stuart Alderoty, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">broke down the ruling</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The former chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement detailed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ripple decision grants to the institutional investor full SEC protection and all remedies that go along with SEC violations, including rescission, fines, penalties, etc. However, the retail investor is not granted any SEC protection at all. This seems backwards to say the least.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
After providing a detailed analysis, Stark warned: &#x201C;My take is that the SEC will appeal the Ripple decision to the 2nd Circuit and the 2nd Circuit will overturn the district court&#x2019;s rulings related to &#x2018;programmatic&#x2019; and &#x2018;other sales.&#x2019;&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
He predicted that if the SEC does not win after the appeal, there will be &#x201C;a new crypto-iteration &#x2013; PBTs &#x2013; programmatic buyer tokens, available on your friendly neighborhood (and unregistered and unregulated) crypto-trading platform.&#x201D; According to the Ripple ruling, &#x201C;PBTs will be exempt from securities regulation because programmatical buyers don&#x2019;t read anything about the PBTs, don&#x2019;t know who their buying their PBTs from and don&#x2019;t know who is issuing the PBTs.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Stark concluded:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Ripple decision holds that the same exact token can be a security sometimes but not a security other times. And the more ignorance and willful blindness by retail investors, then the less protection the retail investors will receive. And the less disclosure about the token, then the less liability for the token issuer. That just can&#x2019;t be right.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Last week, attorney Bryan Jacoutot similarly warned that the ruling on the SEC v. Ripple case &#x201C;rests on very shaky ground.&#x201D; Expecting an appeal, he believes that the judge <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/legal-expert-warns-victory-may-be-short-lived-for-ripple-and-xrp-says-judge-got-the-law-wrong/">got the law wrong</a>.&#13;<br />

India&#8217;s prime minister Narendra Modi visited the UAE, where the countries announced the linking of the UAE&#8217;s Instant Payments Platform (IPP) and India&#8217;s Unified Payments Interface (UPI).</strong></p>
<h2>India, UAE Ink Deal for Trade in Native Currencies</h2>
<p>India and the UAE <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india-ties-up-with-uae-settle-trade-rupees-2023-07-15/">signed</a> a memorandum of understanding Saturday to promote trade settlements in rupees and dirhams. Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra said that although short, prime minister Narendra Modi&#8217;s visit to Abu Dhabi was a &#8220;landmark in the partnership between India and the UAE.&#8221; In addition to facilitating trade in both currencies, the countries will link India&#8217;s UPI and the UAE&#8217;s IPP systems.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very important aspect of India-UAE cooperation. It paves the way for enhanced economic collaboration and will make international financial interactions simpler,&#8221; prime minister Narendra Modi <a href="https://www.rt.com/india/579764-modi-uae-rupee-dirham-trade/">said</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, both countries announced a plan for the Indian Institute of Technology to establish a campus in Abu Dhabi, partnering with IIT-Delhi. This endeavor aims to strengthen technological innovation ties between India and the UAE. “The manner in which ties between our countries have expanded, you have made a big contribution to that. Every person in India views you as a true friend,&#8221; Modi conveyed to the UAE&#8217;s president and Abu Dhabi&#8217;s ruler, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p>
<p>Before the recent agreement between India and the UAE to settle trade payments in rupees and dirhams, Indian refiners were required to buy U.S. dollars to purchase oil. For approximately 48 years, many international buyers were obligated to pay for Saudi Arabian crude in U.S. dollars. That has been shifting recently. In January, just six months prior, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s finance minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-open-to-trading-in-currencies-other-than-us-dollar-signaling-a-shift-toward-de-dollarization/">announced</a> the kingdom&#8217;s openness to trading in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Although the recent agreement between Modi and Al Nahyan simplifies transactions, several Indian refiners had <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/dollar-dominance-india-refiners-uae-dirham-russia-crude-oil-sanctions-2023-2">already begun</a> to veer away from the U.S. dollar, opting for the UAE&#8217;s dirham when buying Russian crude oil. Among those adopting the dirham were companies such as Reliance Industries, Bharat Petroleum, and Nayara Energy. Initially, there were some stumbling blocks, as reports suggest the State Bank of India (SBI) encountered difficulties with these settlements. However, since February, SBI has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/indian-refiners-pay-traders-dirhams-russian-oil-2023-02-03/">successfully</a> been clearing dirham payments.</p>

The Treasury secretary flagged the Asian superpower for potential &#8220;unfair trade practices,&#8221; illustrating her firm stance on international economic fairness</strong>.</p>
<h2>Yellen: Ukraine Aid Essential for Global Economy</h2>
<p>On July 16, U.S. Treasury secretary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/janet-yellen-urges-congress-to-enact-stricter-regulations-for-crypto-industry-amid-sec-shakedown/">Janet Yellen</a> held a press conference in Gandhinagar ahead of the G20 summit and she discussed the global economy. Yellen noted to the pre-credentialed press that she would “push back” against the people saying that developing nations could use more help than Ukraine. &#8220;Ending this war is first and foremost a moral imperative,&#8221; Yellen <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230716-yellen-says-ukraine-aid-is-the-best-boost-for-global-economy">explained</a> to reporters in Gandhinagar. The Treasury secretary added:</p>
<blockquote><p>But it&#8217;s also the single best thing we can do for the global economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Detractors, however, argue that U.S. lawmakers have let down their own economy as <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-most-stressed-us-cities-run-democrats-study?intcmp=tw_fnc">numerous cities</a> nationwide are succumbing to <a href="https://twitter.com/darren_stallcup/status/1680256088007135232?s=20">destitution</a>, riddled with <a href="https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1678549431610736649?s=20">crime</a> and squalor. Figures indicate that America has funneled nearly <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/heres-how-much-aid-the-u-s-has-sent-to-ukraine">$75 billion</a> into Ukraine through financial and military support.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The shrooms are strong with this one. <a href="https://t.co/S0M7Yjjhkn">https://t.co/S0M7Yjjhkn</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Sven Henrich (@NorthmanTrader) <a href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1680631870650810369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Some calculations even escalate this figure to a staggering <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/fact-check-have-us-taxpayers-sent-200-billion-ukraine-1796322">$113 billion</a> since the Russia-Ukraine conflict ignited. In the imminent G20 summit, the World Bank, Yellen, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), among other key players, will also deliberate on the regulation of cryptocurrencies and strategies to address climate change in developing countries.</p>
<h2>China Tariffs Still Necessary</h2>
<p>Yellen broached the topic of rescinding China&#8217;s tariffs, albeit asserting it was premature to do so. In 2018, Donald Trump, the then-U.S. president, implemented three substantial tariffs impacting approximately <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/26/politics/china-tariffs-biden-policy/index.html">$350 billion</a> worth of Chinese merchandise. These tariffs continue to remain in effect under the Biden administration. Katherine Tai, Biden&#8217;s lead trade representative, initiated a comprehensive analysis of the Trump-era tariffs. &#8220;Tariffs were put in place because we had concerns with unfair trade practices on China&#8217;s side, and our concerns with those practices remain, they really haven&#8217;t been addressed,&#8221; Yellen told the press.</p>
<p>She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps over time, this is an area where we could make progress, but I&#8217;d say it is premature to use this as an area for de-escalation.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Biden was anticipated to lift some tariffs, it has been <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/biden-administration-maintain-china-tariffs-while-review-continues-2022-09-02/">suggested</a> that this action is now paused in response to China&#8217;s military posturing. In retaliation to the U.S. tariffs, China has imposed its own duties on a <a href="https://www.china-briefing.com/news/the-us-china-trade-war-a-timeline/">wide range</a> of American goods, encompassing agricultural produce, automobiles, coal, copper scrap, fuel, buses, medical equipment, and more. <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-much-money-has-the-us-given-ukraine-since-russias-invasion/">Numerous studies</a> have probed into the impact of these tariffs on the U.S. economy. Renowned economists Mary Amiti, Stephen J. Redding, and David Weinstein <a href="https://www.cfr.org/blog/cost-trumps-trade-war-china-still-adding">found</a> that U.S. real income fell by $1.4 billion monthly by the end of the tariffs&#8217; first year.</p>

While numerous speculators picture a solitary genius behind its inception, it&#8217;s plausible that this anonymous architect may actually be a collective entity. Allow us to delve into the 14th installment of the &#8220;Many Facts&#8221; Satoshi series, where we explore compelling evidence suggesting the likelihood that the mastermind behind Bitcoin&#8217;s creation may indeed be a group, rather than an individual.</strong></p>
<h2>‘Many Facts’ Suggest Bitcoin&#8217;s Creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, May Be Multiple People</h2>
<p>In recent years, Bitcoin.com News has rolled out a collection of articles titled the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/?s=the%20many%20facts">&#8220;Many Facts&#8221; Satoshi series</a>. These pieces present an array of evidence, suggesting possible identities of Bitcoin&#8217;s elusive creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. Included in the lineup are individuals such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-pointing-to-paul-le-roux-being-satoshi-nakamoto/">Paul Le Roux</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-pointing-to-chainlinks-sergey-nazarov-being-satoshi-nakamoto/">Sergey Nazarov</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/many-facts-dorian-nakamoto-satoshi/">Dorian Nakamoto</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-pointing-to-hal-finney-being-satoshi/">Hal Finney</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Moreover, the series has also featured a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-many-facts-that-indicate-bitcoins-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-wont-ever-come-back/">story</a> contemplating the likelihood that Bitcoin&#8217;s inventor may never resurface. While the bulk of these articles spotlight individual figures, there exists compelling evidence hinting that Satoshi Nakamoto might not be a single entity, but rather a collective.</p>
<p>The initial evidence pointing to Satoshi as a collective rather than an individual is the usage of &#8220;we&#8221; in the <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a>. Notably, Nakamoto employs both &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;I,&#8221; implying the possibility of a team operating under the singular pseudonym. Further evidence from the white paper includes its impeccable English text.</p>
<p>It is largely free of errors, exhibiting precise language, coherent structuring, and accurate usage of complex technical terms. Despite its simplicity in understanding, Nakamoto&#8217;s document maintains a high standard synonymous with technical and academic writing. Interestingly, however, Nakamoto&#8217;s writing style appears noticeably different in forums and email correspondences.</p>
<p>A notable disparity exists between Nakamoto&#8217;s writing style in the Bitcoin white paper and the forum posts in terms of consistency and grammar, implying that Nakamoto could possibly be a group. A 2018 <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3052559.0">linguistic analysis discussion</a> of Satoshi&#8217;s extensive Bitcointalk forum posts suggested varying writing styles, further supporting the hypothesis of multiple individuals behind the pseudonym.</p>
<p>However, one unifying characteristic is consistent across all of Nakamoto&#8217;s written communications — double spacing is employed after every sentence, a convention meticulously followed in forum and email writings, as well as the white paper. Some argue that Nakamoto&#8217;s timestamps on messages, such as emails, might indicate multiple individuals behind the pseudonym.</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>For example, there are <a href="https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/did-satoshi-nakamoto-live-in-london-does-it-even-matter-to-bitcoin/">theories</a> positing Nakamoto&#8217;s writing origins in the U.K., while others <a href="https://twitter.com/MartinSewell/status/1215039007903690753?s=20">assert</a> California as the inventor&#8217;s locale. A review titled &#8220;The Time Zones of Satoshi Nakamoto&#8221; underscores an <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=37743.0">analysis</a> of Nakamoto&#8217;s hourly activity published in 2011. This particular study concludes that Satoshi likely resided in the EST time zone in the U.S. If Satoshi Nakamoto was indeed a group rather than a single person, it&#8217;s plausible that multiple time zones could have been encompassed.</p>
<p>An additional indication that Nakamoto might be a collective rather than a single person is the creator&#8217;s demonstrated proficiency in a myriad of areas: computer science, mathematics, flawless English as evidenced in the white paper, game theory, and the successful concealment of Bitcoin&#8217;s creator&#8217;s identity for over a decade.</p>
<p>It inevitably raises the question: How can a single individual possess such a diverse skill set while remaining elusive to this day? Though compelling theories and details suggest Nakamoto might be multiple individuals, no evidence definitively confirms this. Similar to all other entries in the &#8220;Many Facts&#8221; Satoshi series, no clear-cut indicator points to Nakamoto&#8217;s true identity.</p>

Taking into account the 710-day period that followed, the Ethereum network maintained a relentless burn rate, burning an average of over 146,000 ethereum every month.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum Has Burned 3.46 Million Ether in 710 Days</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Nearly two years &#x2014; precisely 23 months &#x2014; have zipped by since the enforcement of Ethereum&#x2019;s London hard fork, marking the implementation of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. This significant change has led to the continuous burn of the base fee portion of a transaction fee on the Ethereum network, around the clock, each day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Current figures reveal a total of over 3.46 million ether has been burned since the London hard fork. Given the prevailing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> exchange rates, the overall worth of the obliterated ether adds up to $6.68 billion. This equates to a monthly average of more than 146,000 ether being destroyed since EIP-1559 came into effect.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-598070 size-full" title="Ethereum's Fiery Path: $6.6 Billion Ether Burned Since the London Hard Fork" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny.jpg" alt="Ethereum's Fiery Path: $6.6 Billion Ether Burned Since the London Hard Fork" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/bunny.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
To give a sense of scale, the sum of $6.68 billion worth of ether burned could enable a person to purchase roughly 19,085 single-family homes, each estimated at an average price tag of $350,000. EIP-1559 paved the way for a deflationary technique in Ethereum, steadily diminishing the total <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> supply.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Regular <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> transfers have contributed most significantly to the Ethereum reduction, incinerating nearly 300,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. Opensea&#x2019;s non-fungible token (NFT) transactions have witnessed over 230,000 ether burned, while Uniswap v2 has led to the destruction of close to 200,000 ether.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Transactions involving Tether have wiped out over 150,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>, and combined, Uniswap v3 and v1 have caused the burning of more than 200,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. At the time of writing, an estimated 120,201,621 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> is making its rounds in circulation, holding a worth around the $232.53 billion mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Post the implementation of EIP-1559, a little over 3 million ethereum has been minted. It&#x2019;s been 304 days since The Merge on September 15, 2022, the transition when the Ethereum network pivoted from a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain to a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Had The Merge not transpired, the network would have generated 6.5 million ether. Moreover, if the chain remained a PoW model and shunned the implementation of EIP-1559, an additional 9.9 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> would be contributed to the existing 120 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> in circulation.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

With Ethereum standing as an exception, four of the top five blockchains known for NFT sales have witnessed a week-over-week downturn.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>NFT Sales Decline for Second Consecutive Week</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The past week recorded $148.55 million in NFT sales, marking a 4.33% drop from the previous week. Ethereum-based NFT sales accounted for $88.54 million of the total, constituting 59.6% of this week&#x2019;s overall NFT sales, and reflecting a 1.41% uptick from the week prior. Meanwhile, Bitcoin-based NFTs yielded $25.92 million in sales, roughly 17.44% of the week&#x2019;s total, but exhibited a significant 14.37% decrease from the previous week.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io">Cryptoslam.io</a> stats show NFT sales revolving around Solana amassed a sum of $8.2 million, marking a 17.46% decline. Polygon, in the same vein, garnered $5.9 million, reflecting a 16.44% dip from its NFT sales in the previous week. The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain also followed the trend, reporting around $5.3 million in total NFT sales for the week, representing a modest 2.61% downturn.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In terms of seven-day sales, the highest-grossing collections this week were both tethered to Bitcoin. The Fram NFT collection and Uncategorized Ordinals outperformed others, nabbing the two top spots. Meanwhile, Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), an Ethereum-centric NFT collection, slipped to the third rank this week. Trailing behind BAYC, Ethereum&#x2019;s Captainz and Cryptopunks collections occupied the subsequent positions.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the top echelon of NFT sales this week, Bitcoin-based NFTs secured three out of the five leading spots. The priciest NFT transaction belonged to an offering from the Bitcoin Burials collection, changing hands for a staggering $1.68 million. Following that, BAYC #1,734 fetched a cool $1.2 million, and Cryptopunk #8,531 commanded a price slightly over $1 million. The two remaining positions in this week&#x2019;s top NFT transactions originated from the Bitcoin blockchain, each pulling in upwards of $400K.&#13;<br />

<p>&#13;<br />
According to a recent ruling handed down by U.S. judge Analisa Torres, the crypto asset <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> is not &#x201C;necessarily a security on its face.&#x201D; In the ruling, both parties, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs&#x2019; motions for summary judgment were granted in part and denied in part. The order states that the court cannot conclude that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> is a security under the law insofar as &#x201C;programmatic sales&#x201D; are concerned.

According to a report published on Friday, Robert F.

Kennedy&#x2019;s campaign manager maintains that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> acquisition occurred subsequent to the candidate&#x2019;s remarks in May.&#13;<br />

During an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, DeSantis vowed to send CBDC “to the ash heap of history” if he is elected President of the United States.</strong></p>
<h2>DeSantis Tells Carlson CBDC is ‘Not Happening’ in America With Him as President</h2>
<p>Presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis reaffirmed his stance against the introduction of a central bank-issued digital currency such as a digital version of the U.S. dollar. Speaking with conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson on Friday, the candidate for the White House stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I am the president, on Day 1, we will nix central bank digital currency. Done, dead, not happening in this country.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeSantis pointed out that the U.S. Federal Reserve has been talking about <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a> and warned that the Fed may try to take unilateral steps in that direction. He doubted that the U.S. Congress would pass a bill allowing the central bank to issue a digital currency.</p>
<p>The governor reminded that Florida adopted legislation banning the use of CBDCs within the state which he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">signed</a> into law in May, citing potential risks associated with CBDCs as well as concerns over privacy invasion and centralized control of financial transactions.</p>
<p>“I think other states are probably going to follow suit. That will jam their ability to do it through executive action,” DeSantis said when he was interviewed among other GOP presidential primary candidates during a conference organized by the conservative Christian organization The Family Leader.</p>
<p>“They want to get rid of cash, they want no cryptocurrency and they want this [CBDC] to be the sole form of legal tender, and they have said this publicly at like Davos and these other places. It will allow them to prohibit ‘undesirable purchases like fuel and ammunition,’” the governor detailed.</p>
<p>DeSantis further elaborated that “the minute you give them the power to do this, they are going to impose a social credit system on this country” and stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>CBDC is a massive threat to American liberty. On Jan. 20, 2025, it goes to the ash heap of history in this country.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before his election as Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis represented the Sunshine State’s 6th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives between 2013 and 2018. He announced his bid for President of the United States on May 24, 2023. DeSantis has promised to protect people’s rights to use bitcoin, attracting <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-based-stablecoins-to-strengthen-greenback-cz-says-thinks-desantis-is-great/">positive reactions</a> from the crypto community.</p>
