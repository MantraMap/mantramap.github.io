					<description><![CDATA[<p>Hours after news broke out that DCG&#8217;s crypto trading subsidiary Genesis is planning to file for bankruptcy, another media house CoinDesk has now come into trouble. DCG&#8217;s own media publication has potentially hired advisors at the Lazard Group for a potential sale. This move would mean CoinDesk&#8217;s exit from Barry Silbert&#8217;s Digital Currency Group.

<p>DCG&#8217;s own media publication has potentially hired advisors at the Lazard Group for a potential sale. This move would mean CoinDesk&#8217;s exit from Barry Silbert&#8217;s Digital Currency Group.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news of CoinDesk hiring the bankers at Lazard. Furthermore, in an email statement, CEO Kevin Worth <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-media-outlet-coindesk-taps-bankers-for-potential-sale-11674076000?reflink=share_mobilewebshare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Over the last few months, we have received numerous inbound indications of interest in CoinDesk&#8221;. He further added that Lizard will help CoinDesk “explore various options to attract growth capital to the CoinDesk business, which may include a partial or full sale.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>FTX Contagion Spreads to CoinDesk</h3>
<p>Launched back in 2013, crypto media publication CoinDesk was among the first to report the balance sheet troubles at Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s Alameda Research. That report spiraled further into exposing a deeper hole at FTX and eventually led to the bankruptcy of both firms.</p>
<p>However, the contagion of the FTX collapse has come to hit CoinDesk and its parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG). DCG&#8217;s subsidiary and crypto lender Genesis filed for bankruptcy last month putting crypto exchange Gemini into greater trouble.</p>
<p>Many market analysts have been warning that the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX is likely to spread further in the market and impact several crypto firms this year. However, any major trouble at Digital currency Group (DCG) could put the crypto market in greater trouble considering that it controls the world&#8217;s largest digital asset management firm Grayscale.</p>
<p>While DCG has been claiming no trouble at Grayscale, investors should keep a watchful eye on the developments. This year of 2023 has started with a much relief for crypto investors as Bitcoin and the broader crypto space have registered a strong bounceback.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In light of the current shortage of liquid assets&#8211;Genesis Global&#8211;the crypto lending division of Digital Currency Group (DCG) has been engaged in private discussions with a variety of creditor parties.

According to a recent <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week" rel="nofollow">report</a>, it has issued a warning that the firm may need to file for bankruptcy if it is unable to raise further funding.</p>
<h2>Genesis Prepares For Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Reports suggest that creditors like the Winklevoss twins would be willing to agree to a remission period between one and two years under the prepackaged <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a> plan. This forbearance period would apply to the majority of the payments. Furthermore, creditors would receive cash payments in addition to shares in the parent business of Genesis, the Digital Currency Group, which is headed by Barry Silbert.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</a></em></p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cameron-winklevoss/">Cameron Winklevoss</a>, the co-founder of Gemini, and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/barry-silbert/">Barry Silbert</a> have been engaged in a Twitter fight where the former has accused Silbert of intermixing finances at the crypto conglomerate and of negotiating in bad faith. In his most recent open letter, he demanded the <a href="https://coingape.com/winklevoss-vs-silbert-gemini-founder-dcg-ceo-removal/">DCG chief stand down from his position</a> as he failed to keep his end of the promise of returning customer funds worth $900 million.</p>
<h2>Genesis Faces Growing Tension</h2>
<p>Further proving Genesis&#8217; weak financials, DCG sent a letter to the shareholders on January 17,  where the company informed that it will <a href="https://coingape.com/digital-currency-group-halts-dividends/">stop paying quarterly dividends</a> in an attempt to preserve capital. The creditors, Genesis, and DCG have compared several different approaches but have not been able to come to an agreement as of yet. Both Kirkland &amp; Ellis and Proskauer Rose have been serving as advisors to various creditors&#8217; groups.</p>
<p>After the failure of the hedge fund <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, financial pressure started to build up at Barry Silbert&#8217;s DCG. In November, shortly after the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>&#8211;where Genesis had some of its cash stored&#8211;filed for bankruptcy, Genesis ceased processing withdrawals. The crypto exchange Gemini Trust, which is run by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has been affected by these developments as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> Earn, a program that allows users of the platform to earn interest on their coins by lending them out through Genesis, also had to cease processing redemption requests.</p>
<p>Genesis Global is currently preparing the groundwork for the bankruptcy petition, which may take place as soon as this week.</p>

Amid this recovery, the coin price rebounded from the 0.33 support, breached the local resistance of $0.374, and rallied 23% higher to make a swing high at the $0.4 mark. However, can the XRP price maintain a sustained recovery in the coming weeks?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price resonating between the 0.41 and 0.33 mark for the past 2 months indicates a range Bond Trend.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $0.41 could set the XRP price for a 7.6% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.4 Billion, indicating a 39% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YqqsEo7Y.png" alt="XRP Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market has stalled its recovery in the last few days, to which the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-update-ripple-ceo-at-davos-clears-air-over-settlement-odds-with-sec/">XRP price</a> went sideways and wobbled between the $0.37 and $0.41 barriers. Between this range, the daily chart candles showed several Doji candles with long higher and lower price rejection wicks, indicating uncertainty in the XRP price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, the lateral walk above the $0.37 mark would allow the buyers to retest the recently reclaimed support. Moreover, a prolonged consolidation above the aforementioned support will validate whether the coin price is well supported by this level and can be used to climb higher. </span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, investors believing the XRL price could rise in the near future can use this support as an entry opportunity. Meanwhile, those looking for a safer entry can consider buying after the breakout of the $0.4 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from the overhead resistance could drive the exact price 7.6% higher to hit the $0.44 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a country note, a breakdown below the $0.37 support will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the flattish crucial are (20 50,100, and 200). highlights a sideways friend in XRP. However, a potential bullish crossover between the 20-and-50-day EMA near the 0.37 mark increases the support power of this level.                                                                                            </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index</strong>: the delay RSI slope moving above the midline indicates the market sentiment is positive for a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.387</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.41 and $0.44</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.37 and 0.33</span></li>

The value of cryptocurrencies fell after it was disclosed that the United States government would take legal action against a relatively obscure <a href="https://coingape.com/doj-takes-enforcement-action-against-this-crypto-exchange/">Russian crypto exchange known as Bitzlato</a>.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Dips On Bitzlato News</h2>
<p>The DOJ&#8217;s news alarmed the crypto markets, causing the top <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> by market cap to drop by about $1,000 and Ethereum (ETH) to retrace back to the $1,500 level. Other major cryptocurrencies such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, XRP, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cardano/">Cardano</a> also saw a dip in price after the announcement was widely covered by media outlets.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135935" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/19001313/FmxhiUmWQAcN1xc.jpeg" alt="" width="1170" height="881" /></p>
<p>The majority of investors anticipate that the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> and global regulators will eventually place a heavy regulatory burden on <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a> and other businesses connected to the cryptocurrency sector; as a result of the high number of crypto-related scams and the proliferation of black swan events that occurred in 2022.</p>

<h2>Layoffs &amp; Economic Worries</h2>
<p>The gloomy forecast for the U.S. and global economy in 2023 that was made by banks visiting Davos and the rising tendency of large technology businesses laying off personnel could both be contributing factors to the additional pressure that is being placed on crypto assets. recently, Ethereum development company <a href="https://coingape.com/metamask-creator-consensys-layoffs-workforce-due-reason/">ConsenSys announced its decision to axe 11% of its workforce</a> globally. Earlier, Coinbase, Amazon and even Microsoft issued similar notices to their employees.</p>
<p>Enjin coin, Lido, Frax and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/chiliz/">Chiliz</a> were a few of the digital currencies which witnessed larger drops of more than 5% in value; however, have now recovered slightly after the steep decline.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="793" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/14205856/enjin-coin-enj-editorial-illustrative-260nw-2153901365.webp" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to the majority of major cryptocurrencies, the Enjin coin price witnessed a sustained recovery in the first two weeks of 2023. The coin price has rallied 72.5% since January 1 and currently trades at the $0.39 mark. Furthermore, the U-shaped recovery in the daily chart reveals the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a>. Here’s how this bullish reversal could influence the ENJ coin’s future price.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A higher price rejection at $0.4 resistance indicates a potential pullback in the ENJ price.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish crossover between the 20 and 50 DMA would increase the buying pressure on the market.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in ENJ price is $164.4 Million, indicating a 372% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/hl8SQmnv.png" alt="Enjin Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rounding bottom pattern is one of the famous trend reversal patterns that offer steady recovery in any asset. Earlier today, the Enju coin witnessed a significant inflow that surged its market value by 20% and breached the local resistance of  $0.4.  However, a sudden downfall in the crypto market in the last few hours has evaporated these gains considerably and formed a higher price rejection at mentioned resistance.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rejection indicates high supply pressure, and If the daily candle closes below $0.4 resistance, the ENJ price would likely witness a minor pullback. This potential correction could tumble the price by 17.5% and revisit the $0.35 support. If this local support recuperates bullish momentum, and Enjin coin will resume the prevailing trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, under the influence of the rounding bottom pattern, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> should eventually ride a steady recovery to hit the $0.49-$0.5 neckline resistance.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Vortex indicator</strong>: the enlarged gap between the VI+ and VI- slope projects a sustained buying of the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>DMAs</strong>: In case of a possible retracement, the reclaimed DMAs(20, 50, and 100) could offer additional support to the rising prices. Conversely, the 200 DMA wavering around the $0.44 mark suppresses the bullish growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjin Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.39</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.4 and $0.49</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.325 and $0.275</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The Terra Classic community has burned over 16 million LUNC tokens in a week amid the push to increase the burn rate.

In order to raise the burn rate, Terra Classic validators and projects aim to burn billions of Terra Classic (LUNC) in 2023. Until now, the Terra Classic community has burned 37.717 billion LUNC tokens.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Community Shifts Focus on LUNC Burns</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic community has shifted its focus to burning more amounts of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens to compensate for fewer burns in December and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> reducing LUNC burn contributions to 50%.</p>
<p>The community burned over 16 million LUNC tokens in a week, increasing the burn rate as compared to the last week&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-community-burns-over-12-million-lunc-price-jumps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 million LUNC tokens</a>. Most of the LUNC burned came from validators, with LUNC DAO <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finder.terra.money/columbus-5/address/terra13s4gwzxv6dycfctvddfuy6r3zm7d6zklynzzj5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">burning</a> 2.63 million LUNC and Luna Station 88 burning 4.78 million LUNC.</p>
<p>Luna Station 88 postponed its regular burn of one-third of collected commissions for a week as the community favored passing Proposal 11242. It reduces the re-minting of LUNC after burn and set the seigniorage reward policy to zero.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Terra Rebels developer Duncan burned 6 million LUNC tokens in two transactions. Core developers Edward Kim, Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson, and Duncan were among the members of the developer group Terra Rebels that left due to funding disputes with the team.</p>
<p>The Terra Classic community recently <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-community-passes-two-crucial-proposals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed two crucial proposals</a> to increase the LUNC burn rate. While Proposal 11242 and Proposal 11243 effectively increased the burn rate, they reduced contributions to the community pool.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-classic-lunc-price-increase-with-this-new-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TFL&#8217;s interchain Station</a> added support for LUNC. The Station currently supports LUNA, LUNC, Osmosis, Juno, Kujira, Carbon, HuaHua, and Cresent chains.</p>
<h2>Terra Classic Price Fails to Build Momentum</h2>
<p>Terra Classic witnessed a massive rally in the starting week of January. However, it failed to hold on to the rally and fell below $0.00015.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the LUNC price is trading at $0.000165. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000158 and $0.000179, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 50% in the last 24 hours, indicating an increase in interest among traders.</p>

The Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency trading platform known as Bitzlato is the subject of this investigation. The announcement comes at a time when the cryptocurrency industry is experiencing significant upheaval, particularly in relation to the demise of the formerly dominant <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchange</a> <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>.</p>
<h2>DOJ Seizes Bitzlato Exchange</h2>
<p>According to Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, the Hong Kong-based platform Bitzlato has been disrupted by U.S. authorities, and the platform&#8217;s founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, has been arrested. This brings an end to the platform&#8217;s persistent catering to known criminal activity linked to Russia. Monaco was outlining coordinated enforcement actions that also included the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Treasury Department. Monaco characterized the operation as the most significant one taken to date against a crypto criminal network.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>To anyone who still believes that they can hide from the law by using cryptocurrency, this prosecution should put that illusion to rest.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/"><em>Check Out The Top Crypto Telegram Channels Of 2023</em></a></p>
<p>The government claimed that BitZlato provided power to darknet marketplaces and assisted in the process of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ransomware/">ransomware</a> assaults, which amounted to over 700 million dollars in unlawful transactions, both directly and indirectly, between the years 2018 &amp; 2022. Similar to the case with the majority of larger exchanges, the fact that the platform accepted very little in the way of personally identifying information from its users made it appealing to criminals.</p>
<h2>AML Laws Violated</h2>
<p>Anatoly Legkodymov, the Russian kingpin was taken into custody on Tuesday evening in Miami on allegations that he ran a money transmission company which did not comply with <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">anti-money laundering laws</a> and transported illegal funds. On Wednesday afternoon, the 40-year-old crypto mogul, who currently resides in China will be brought before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to face the criminal charges.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether you break our laws from China or Europe, or abuse our financial system from a tropical island, you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom&#8221;, said Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.justice.gov/" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> came on Wednesday noon, led by the Deputy Attorney General of the United States, Lisa Monaco, who presided over a press conference along with the Associate Deputy Director of the FBI Brian Turner, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-department-of-justice/">Department of Justice&#8217;s</a> criminal division, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo.</p>

While it is still not clear as to when the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/">XRP vs SEC lawsuit</a> judgement will be out, Garlinghouse criticized the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) behavior in the lawsuit. Speaking on the occasion of the World Economic Forum annual meeting, the Ripple CEO touched about the timeline for the lawsuit closure. He said the judgement could be out in the space of a few months.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/price-surge-crypto-ethereum-eth/?utm_source=priceanalysisbar">Up 25% in 7 Days, This Crypto’s Next Move Deserves Your Attention</a></p>
<p>Earlier, Garlinghouse said there was zero chance that both parties could reach a settlement due to fundamental differences. Any settlement would depend on whether the SEC recognizes XRP as not a security, he added. The XRP case is revolved around the SEC&#8217;s allegation that Ripple sale of XRP represented sales of unregistered securities. However, Ripple always contested that view and kept fighting the argument.</p>
<h2>&#8216;SEC Behavior Embarassing&#8217;</h2>
<p>Speaking to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppMKgcJ_vY8" rel="nofollow">CNBC</a>, the Ripple CEO described SEC&#8217;s behavior while handling the XRP case as embarrassing as a U.S. citizen. Garlinghouse said he was expecting that the judge overseeing the XRP lawsuit would come out with the judgement in 2023 itself. In fact, he is optimistic of the judgement to be out in the space of months. The case is now fully filed and fully briefed in front of the judge, and we expect a decision certainly in 2023, he said.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s behavior while handling the XRP case was embarrassing as a U.S. citizen. There are some of the things you have seen happen and you are like you&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The XRP price recovered significantly in 2023. As of writing, the XRP price stands at $0.37543, down 3.48% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/">CoinGape price tracker</a>.</p>

On Wednesday, the company&#8217;s founder, Joseph Lubin, announced on his blog that 97 employees would be let off, which represents 11% of the total human resources.</p>
<h2>Consensys Layoffs Support Staff</h2>
<p>According to the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/01/18/ethereum-builder-consensys-axes-100-staff-founder-lubin-says-balance-sheet-very-solid/" rel="nofollow">reports</a>, the layoffs are not targeting any employees who work directly on the products themselves; rather, they are focusing on those who are employed in support roles &#8212; whose workloads have decreased as a result of the recent market slowdown. The official announcement further states that departing workers of ConsenSys would be offered substantial severance compensation based on their length of service; as well as an extended option exercise window that will range from 12 to 36 months. In addition to this, tailored assistance from an outside placement agency and the extension of healthcare coverage in applicable jurisdictions will be provided, according to the official announcement.</p>
<p>Lubin was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today we need to make the extremely difficult decision to streamline some of ConsenSys’ teams to adjust to challenging and uncertain market conditions. This decision will impact a total of 97 employees, which represents 11% of ConsenSys’ total workforce.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Lubin Puts Blame On CeFi</h2>
<p>Lubin said that the struggles of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> industry are the result of the end of a hype cycle and, in particular, so-called <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cefi/">&#8220;CeFi&#8221;</a> (centralized finance) companies. Furthermore, Lubin opines that the companies operating under the veil of cryptocurrency, in reality, lack the core ethos of decentralization and its operations. While speaking about the recent failures of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchanges</a>, Lubin claims that organizations such as Voyager and Celsius pursued profits in an irresponsible manner, often burning their customers in the process &#8212; which finally led to their demise.</p>

<p>ConsenSys, which is currently headquartered in New York City and has approximately 900 employees, is just one of the many crypto businesses that have been forced to lay off staff as a result of the grinding <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a> that has been affecting the industry since April. Till now, an estimated 27,000 jobs have been lost across the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

This rejection hints at the exhausted bullish momentum, which could encourage a minor pullback in the near term. Here’s what you can expect if Ethereum starts falling in the coming weeks.</span></p>
<h2><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential correction could tumble the ETH price by 5-10%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rounding bottom pattern may eventually lead the ETH price to $1660</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $7.4 Billion, indicating a 5.5% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/R1dKjIng.png" alt="Ethereum Coin Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">rounding bottom pattern</a> and the ongoing recovery in the crypto market, the Ethereum price witnessed a parabolic rally within the last three weeks. This bull run surged the ETH price 35.6% since January 1st, where it currently trades at $1597.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the increasing volume activity and breakout from multiple resistance levels indicate a high momentum recovery. The last resistance the Ethereum price breached was the $1500 psychological level, offering buyers suitable support to boost further growth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, while the altcoin hovers above the breached resistances, the daily candle shows multiple higher price rejections suggesting the exhausted bullish momentum. These rejection signs hint the altcoin could witness a minor correction before resuming the prevailing uptrend. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, this potential correction will be healthy for the Ethereum coin as it experienced a sharp rally in a relatively short period. Moreover, a minor correction to retest the breached levels will determine whether the ETH price can sustain higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential pullback could revisit the $1500 or $1420 support to replenish the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, in response to the rounding bottom pattern, the  Ethereum coin price is expected to drive a sustained rally to the $1660 neckline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line maintain a significant gap between them, indicating the sustaining buying pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs</strong>: the recently breached 200-day EMA wavering around the $1500 mark increase the support strength on this level. Moreover, the 20-day EMA at $1400 does the same job.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1598</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1660  and $1800</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1500 and $1420</span></li>

In spite of the fact that some market participants may still be skeptical, there is a chance that ETH may surge significantly based on the technical factors currently favoring the second-largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> by market cap.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Key Price Levels</h2>
<p>The ETH price has delivered nine consecutive days of green daily candles, demonstrating significant market vigor. Since ETH had its most recent halt at around $1,197, the newly discovered uptrend has recovered 25% of the market value that investors had lost. However, according to a well-known crypto analyst Crypto Tony, the price range of $2,250 &#8211; $2,500 determines a key level for ETH. Breaching these price levels will validate a price bottom for further uptrend.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135916 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18201035/FmwS7OOaUAIUsl_-1.jpeg" alt="Ethereum (ETH) price" width="2284" height="1052" /></p>
<p>He goes on to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTony__/status/1615692355234840577" rel="nofollow">say</a> that the decline in the price of Ethereum will greatly depend on the state of the stock market and global economics for the remainder of this year. Additionally, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a>, an indicator that is used to evaluate the underlying power of market participants, demonstrates that the price of ETH is in severely overbought conditions near the level of 90. In January 2021, when Ethereum momentarily marked $1,300 and established a new all-time high, the RSI read 90 for the last time.</p>
<h2>Factors Driving ETH Price</h2>
<p>On Monday, the number of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> addresses that have a balance greater than zero reached a new all-time high of 92.5 million, breaking the previous record set on Friday. It does not appear that the bear market of 2022, which ended in the closure of one of the world&#8217;s formerly largest <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> in November, had any effect on the growth in the number of addresses that have a balance greater than zero.</p>

<p>In addition, according to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/AlchemyPlatform/status/1615351175179808769" rel="nofollow">report</a> recently published by the blockchain software development firm Alchemy, the number of smart contracts implemented on the Ethereum mainnet increased by an astounding 300% in 2022. And, in spite of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/">bear market</a> of 2022, smart contract deployment growth essentially matched the rate of growth experienced in 2021. At the end of Q4 2022, 4.6 million smart contracts were active on the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>, according to the research.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-135918 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18204524/Screenshot-2023-01-18-204505.png" alt="Ethereum (ETH) price" width="1266" height="706" /></p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Ethereum (ETH) is currently being traded at $1,598. This represents an increase of 0.96% in the past 24 hours, in contrast to its 19.76% jump during the last seven days, as per CoinGape&#8217;s crypto market tracker.</p>

<p>Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam of Singapore and Francois Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the Governing Council of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ecb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">European Central Bank</a>, both stressed the necessity of crypto regulation during a panel discussion on the difficulties facing banks. UBS Group AG Chairman Colm Kelleher echoed their points.</p>
<p>Regulators had &#8220;taken their eye off the ball with respect to the non-banking industry,&#8221; according to Kelleher. He started the discussion on digital assets.</p>
<h2>Demand for regulating non-banking sector</h2>
<p>Villeroy reacted, citing recent instances of financial instability such as the performance of money market funds, UK pension funds affected by liability-driven investments, and the demise of Sam&#8217;s Club, saying that the banks are the most challenging in today’s times.</p>
<p>Villeroy siad that they all share the trait of being connected to institutions other than banks and they fall short in this aspect. He added the changing landscape as the reason and called for a quick action to enact non-bank regulation, starting with cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Some things were extremely evident to Tharman, for example, whether it&#8217;s regular finance or cryptocurrency, needs to regulated for things like money laundering.</p>

<h2>Kelleher claims blockchain as “unstoppable”</h2>
<p>Kelleher reaffirmed a sentiment that has been expressed frequently by executives of both traditional banking institutions and cryptocurrency businesses. Regarding certain UBS clients&#8217; desire to invest in digital tokens, he added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are searching for a regulatory structure that will allow us to accommodate it for our clients.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While sounding a note of caution about the current challenge of assuring compliance with laws and policies surrounding KYC (know-your-customer) standards and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/aml-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AML (anti-money laundering)</a> rules, he was bullish about the underlying technology of the blockchain and characterised it as unstoppable.</p>
<p>CEO of Citigroup, Jane Fraser interrupted saying that it was critical to take a step back. He said rather than discussing cryptocurrency they should discuss on other issues, claiming it as something that is potentially less new and shiny. Thus, the discussion for crypto ended.</p>

However, ethereum stakers won&#8217;t be able to withdraw right away. There will be a long complicated process for stakers before they can withdraw their stakes. <a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-is-ethereum-staking-how-does-it-work-pros-and-cons-of-ethereum-staking/">Ethereum staking</a> requires a validator to put up 32 ETH in order to begin validating transactions.</p>
<p>A reseracher <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/WestieCapital/status/1613645213792366595?s=20&amp;t=5J2_JTS2O_mzrodiPelz1g" rel="nofollow">explained</a> that Ethereum is dynamic when it comes to withdrawals of staking, unlike other PoS networks like Cosmos, where the period of stakers is fixed at 21.</p>
<h2>Withdrawal process for validators</h2>
<p>Validators in Ethereum must go through two stages, i.e., the exit queue and the withdrawal period.</p>
<p>The exit queue is defined by a few variables. As the total number of validators set the minimum churn limit at 4, and the churn limit quotient at 2^16 (65,536).</p>
<p>Thereafter, we need to use the variables to calculate the churn limit. The number of validators able to exit the set every epoch (32 blocks).</p>
<p>The churn limit is then calculated as the total number of validators divided by the churn limit quotient. Then round down to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p>Remember that as the number of validators increases, it increases the churn limit as well.</p>
<h2>Ethereum crosses 500,000 validators</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://dune.com/hildobby/ETH2-Deposits" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dune.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Ethereum recently hits 500,000 validators before the completion of its scheduled Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade. Ethereum validator secures a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/">proof-of-stake</a> blockchain to validate network transactions and prevent double-spending errors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To use validator software in Ethereum, one should be able to stake an initial investment, which is 32ETH, approx. $50,000, as per its current value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This validator milestone comes just before the launch of the Ethereum Shanghai Upgrade scheduled for March 2023.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, around 70% of the Ethereum stakers are at a loss ETH inaccessible. The development of Shanghai Upgrade will allow ETH stakes to access their ETH, and they can decide whether to hold the coin until it is back to profit or should sell it at a loss.</span></p>

Garlinghouse revealed the commission’s stance on the crypto market before attending the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO staying optimistic</h2>
<p>Ripple CEO in <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpbXi1pSL8M&amp;ab_channel=CNBCInternationalTV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an interview</a> with CNBC answered a question about the possibility of a settlement with the SEC ahead. Garlinghouse mentioned that they have always said that they would love to settle. However, this deal would depend on a very crucial aspect which is whether <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a> is a security or not.</p>
<p>He stated that Gary Gensler, SEC Chair and the team have already expressed their views on the digital assets. They believe that almost all crypto is a security. This stance leaves very little space in a Venn diagram made by the SEC for settlement.</p>
<p>However, the case is now completely briefed in the court and judges know would take however long they want to. Still, Ripple CEO is trying to stay optimistic and believes that the lawsuit will be resolved in 2023 or may be in the first half. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP Lawsuit Update Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<p>Garlinghouse mentioned that they have seen a significant change in posture from the SEC. This has made the Ripple team believe that they will have a resolution from the judge.</p>

The BTC price managed to hold onto recent gains and hit a high of $21,438 on January 17, first time since the collapse of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a>.</p>
<p>However, Bitcoin price is mostly trading in a range for the last few days, causing investors to speculate whether the BTC price has actually bottomed out or there&#8217;s still a downfall left.</p>
<h2>On-Chain Data to Identify Bitcoin Bottom</h2>
<p>According to on-chain analysis <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1615640417554554881" target="_blank" rel="noopener">platform</a> Glassnode, investors can rely on 10 on-chain indicators to identify a bottom for Bitcoin during <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear markets</a>.</p>
<p>An intersection between Realized Price x 0.7 and the 200D-SMA x 0.6 (Mayer Multiple) pricing models helped indicate a Bitcoin market bottom historically. Currently, the indicator fully confirmed that the Bitcoin has bottomed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-135859" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18171704/02_pricingmodels-2.png" alt="Bitcoin price" width="716" height="412" /></p>
<p>Market recovery is accompanied by a rise in the number of unique addresses, which shows an increase in demand. Comparing the monthly average against the yearly average of addresses helps identify relative shifts in momentum. A continuous rise for at least two months is considered an indicator of an upcoming price rally.</p>
<p>Moreover, an uptick in Miner Revenue sourced from Fees shows growing network demand. Generally, the miner fee revenue momentum indicator confirms a shift in Bitcoin cycle as miners&#8217; profit from bitcoin production continues to rise. Currently, on-chain data confirms the regime shifts in network utilization and demand.</p>
<p>Forth indicator, the Relative Activity of Small and Large Entities is considered one of the easy and most used indicators by investors to identify Bitcoin price changes. The rise in whale activity generally denotes a rise in the price, but <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/whale-accumulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whale accumulation</a> is missing currently.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-135866" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18174408/05_smalllarge_entities.png" alt="bitcoin price" width="717" height="413" /></p>
<p>The Realized Profit/Loss Ratio is also one of the most powerful tools in on-chain analysis. It provides an oscillator tracking whether the aggregate volume of realized profits exceed the volume of realized losses or realized profits. If the 30D-SMA of the Realized P/L Ratio recovers back above 1.0, it will indicate Bitcoin market bottom. At present, the indicator is not triggered.</p>
<p>Another similar network profitability model Adjusted Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is a popular tool among on-chain analysts to identify price changes in the short-term. aSOPR is quite responsive to macro changes in market sentiment as well as whales activity. This indicator is also not triggered as realized losses still dominates.</p>
<p>Short-Term Holder Confidence Indicator is also not triggered yet as the confidence of newer investors has not reached that level, but it is slowly rising.</p>
<h2>Does This Bitcoin Price Rally Indicate Cycle Change?</h2>
<p>The bear market witnessed heavy Bitcoin supply redistribution. Bitcoin moved from Long-Term Holders to new small investors as Bitcoin price dropped below $20K. The Long-term to Short-term supply profitability indicator confirms Bitcoin bottom conditions.</p>
<p>Ninth indicator, Bitcoin Cycle Change Detection also confirms that the Bitcoin price has bottomed out as seller exhaustion may have been reached.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-135886" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/18182941/09_drilling.png" alt="Bitcoin price" width="707" height="407" /></p>
<p>Moreover, the Supply Stress Ratio indicates the bear market is ending as financial pain for investors seems to subdue amid the recent Bitcoin price rally this month. A fall in Supply Stress below 1.0 will confirm a Bitcoin bear market end.</p>
<p>Thus, four out of 10 indicators confirm the market bottom, while two indicators show as &#8220;In Progress.&#8221; And, four crucial indicators are yet to confirm that the Bitcoin price has bottomed.</p>

Under the influence of this pattern and a recovery sentimental the market, the SHIB  price rebounded from the $0.000008 support and surged 58% higher to its current price of $0.00000125. Will this memecoin continue to rise higher from here, or are there hurdles that could interrupt it?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing above $0.0000117 may drive the coin price 12% higher to rechallenge the $0.000017 barrier</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-and-100-day EMA on the verge of bullish crossover encourages buyers to extend the price rally further.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $988.1 Million, indicating a 254% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/hoWaSi43.png" alt="Shiba Inu Coin" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A parabolic rally with increasing volume activity indicates a sustained recovery in the Shiba Inu coin. A rounding bottom pattern is currently shaping this recovery rally and sets a potential rise to $0.000014 neckline resistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the SHIB price showed an 18% intraday hike and breached a local resistance of $0.000017. Moreover, this bullish breakout, backed by a high volume spike, indicates the traders’ confidence in reaching higher levels.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this sudden price jump could be triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/shiba-inu-coin-burn-rate-spikes-by-650-amid-huge-price-pump/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">more burning activity</a> as recently highlighted by @shibburn through Twitter. The tweets showcased that a total of 52,280,070 SHIB tokens burned and 15 transactions in the last 24 hours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the bullish breakout from the 0.000017 ceilings could offer an entry opportunity for trade with suitable support to prolong further recovery. If the daily candle closes above the mentioned level, a post-breakout rally could drive the SHIB price 13% higher to challenge the $0.000014. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The traders should be cautious at the multi-month resistance of $0.000014 as it encourages a temporary pullback.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band</strong>: the recent price jump priced the upper band of the Bollinger band indicator, suggesting the ongoing recovery is aggressive for the time spent. Therefore, to stabilize the bullish trend, a consolidation above the dollar $0.000017 is expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI</strong>: The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">daily RSI</a> slope rising higher into the bullish territory indicates active buying in the market.</span></p>
