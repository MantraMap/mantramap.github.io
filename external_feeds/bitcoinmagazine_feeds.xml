The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.” </em>In other words what really drives the fiat monetary to a great extent is trust, because without it the system as we know it wouldn’t be functional, however the trust is being placed in untrustworthy individuals and institutions. The Bitcoin monetary system is trustless and decentralized by design and is reliant on cryptographic proof instead, thus removing altogether the need for “trusted intermediaries” in every financial interaction, from the central bank all the way down to transactions between individuals.</p><p><a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">The Blocksize War</a> of 2015-2017 is one of the most significant events in Bitcoin’s history. This was really a battle between those that favored centralization of the protocol by a handful of developers, exchanges and miners (akin to what you have in Ethereum today) versus those that favored decentralization, security and resilience over the long term. For the first time in its existence Bitcoin faced a potential hostile takeover engineered by powerful corporate entities that wanted to capture and impose their will on Bitcoin. What started out as a disagreement on how to scale Bitcoin, whether the size limit of the blocks that make up the Bitcoin blockchain should be increased or not, eventually morphed into a two year long tug of war over the very soul of Bitcoin itself. Two camps emerged; the “big blockers'', who were in favor of increasing the<a href="https://www.bitstamp.net/learn/crypto-101/what-is-block-size/"> block size</a> as their priority was ensuring faster and cheaper transactions at the base layer thus making Bitcoin into a global payments system that would rival Visa (i.e. corporate control); and the “small blockers'' who were more focused on Bitcoin being a new form of money, which had to remain fully decentralized if it was to achieve the goal of separating money and state (i.e. individual control).</p><p>Jan3 CEO, Samson Mow, who was at the frontlines of the block size war, in a recent<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war"> article</a> made the following remark about the small blockers, <em>“They prioritized integrity, resilience and security, arguing that if blocks became big, it would become expensive for users to run a node and would thus incentivize hosting nodes in data centers; a one-way street towards centralization and control by a few, not much different from other systems like banks. This would mean the death of the dream of an apolitical, incorruptible, decentralized money.”</em> The small blockers foresaw a scenario in which overtime it would be expensive for users to run full Bitcoin nodes which would have led to further centralization and thus recreating the trusted third parties in another form; the very middlemen that Bitcoin was designed to disrupt. Satoshi designed Bitcoin with the intention of it remaining a technically and socially robust peer-to-peer (P2P) network which should never be “corrupted” through centralization. He summarized it<a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/1/"> this way</a>, <em>“Digital signatures provide part of the solution, </em><em>but the main benefits are lost if a trusted party is still required</em><em> to prevent double-spending.”</em></p><p>In order for Bitcoin to remain user-controlled, every attempt or form of centralization has to be fiercely resisted, especially given the innate human tendency to lean more towards centralized systems with a leader. If a handful of business entities and developers could force such a significant change without consensus would that not be akin to how the Federal Reserve plans the economy by dictating interest rates and maintaining “price stability?” As stated earlier, it wasn’t just about block sizes anymore but it was now an ideological clash about control. Who had control, was it the users or the miners or the developers that would steer the protocol? In the book,<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM"> “The Blocksize War<em>,</em>”</a> the author accurately described this phenomenon and how it was an underlying driver for the big blockers when he noted;</p><p>“<em>In some people’s minds, the idea of a system controlled by end users is too difficult to grasp. Instead, they look for somebody or some entity who controls the system. Some people cannot fathom the idea of a system which has global consensus, but lacks a leader...As for whether Bitcoin really is the leaderless system it proclaims to be and whether this will always remain the case, the jury is still out. However, after the drama and shenanigans of the blocksize war, one thing is clear: there is still hope that the claim is true.”</em></p><p>Ultimately, it was the small blockers that prevailed and as a result Bitcoin remained firmly in the users’ control.</p><p>When it comes to Bitcoin most of the attention is focused on bitcoin the asset and less on the infrastructure required to maintain this global, decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network. While the small blockers’ victory in the blocksize war secured Bitcoin’s path towards future mass adoption, it still remains unclear to most people why running a node is so important that it was worth fighting for. Let’s start by defining what a node is. A full node is any computer that maintains and stores the entire Bitcoin blockchain; in order to verify and record new transactions as they happen, according to a common set of network consensus rules. In the absence of a central party, it’s these nodes that act as referees of the Bitcoin network by independently validating all transactions and blocks; and filtering out invalid transactions. This is how the Bitcoin network removes trust in any centralized entity and ensures the integrity of its 21 million supply cap. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>While running a full node is important, it’s still optional to do so. Running a full node, grants anyone the ability to broadcast transactions (or blocks) on a permissionless basis. The more nodes there are on the network, the more decentralized Bitcoin becomes. This not only increases redundancy, but it results in Bitcoin being more secure by making it increasingly harder to corrupt or censor. Each full node executes the consensus rules of the network, an important element being Bitcoin’s fixed supply. Bitcoin Core developer, Luke Dashjr,<a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bitcoin-independence-day%3A-luke-dashjr-on-the-lessons-from-segwit-that-were-forgetting"> perfectly summarized</a> it this way, <em>“All of Bitcoin’s advantages — including its security from outright theft and the 21 million BTC cap — stem from the assumption that the majority of the economy are using their own full nodes to verify payments to them. Centralized verification and third-party/custodial wallets are a bigger threat to Bitcoin than anything else.” </em>In other words, nodes are very important parts of the Bitcoin network’s defense mechanism with regards to processing transactions, and they are the last line of defense against centralization and malicious actors. More information regarding running your own node can be found <a href="https://armantheparman.com/why-should-you-run-your-own-bitcoin-node/">here.</a></p><p>Despite the critical role that nodes play in the Bitcoin ecosystem, it’s<a href="https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/bitcoin/files/charts/historical.html"> estimated</a> that the number of Bitcoin nodes has dropped considerably from a peak of 200,000 in 2018 to less than 45,000 today as of time of writing according to Dashjr’s data. Given the fact that users being able to run full nodes was one of the biggest factors that culminated in the blocksize war, it’s definitely of great concern that we are seeing a reduction of nodes on the network in 2022 when compared with 2018. This could potentially make the Bitcoin network less secure and much more prone to centralization. Furthermore from a geographical standpoint, 32.8% of Bitcoin nodes globally are located in just seven countries — the United States, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, as of time of writing according to<a href="https://bitnodes.io/dashboard/"> data</a> from BTC nodes analytics platform <em>Bitnodes.</em></p><figure>

    </figure><p>Ironically in the global south where there is a huge need for Bitcoin from a financial inclusion perspective, there is a paucity of Bitcoin nodes in that part of the world. There are numerous reasons that can explain the decrease of Bitcoin nodes or the lack thereof in other regions; firstly there are a lot of people that are not educated about the importance of running a full Bitcoin node, especially given the current obsession with number go up. Secondly, due to the significant bandwidth usage of Bitcoin full nodes especially as the network scales, the costs of doing so are prohibitive; especially in places with subpar internet connectivity. This is where Erlay comes in. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf">Erlay</a> is a new efficient transaction relay protocol that aims to significantly minimize the bandwidth usage required to connect Bitcoin full nodes. </p><p>Approximately 50% of the bandwidth required to run a Bitcoin node is used just for announcing transactions. When a new bitcoin transaction is broadcast, it is sent to all nodes on Bitcoin’s p2p network and this occurs in two ways. Firstly, after receiving a transaction, a node sends a transaction identifier (i.e. transaction ID) to all of the peers it’s connected with. This transaction ID is subsequently verified by all these peers to ensure that they haven’t received the transaction in question from another peer. If not, the whole transaction is requested from the node that sent the transaction ID. This process repeats continuously and the end result is that there is a plethora of redundant messages being shared on the Bitcoin network, thus unnecessarily consuming a lot of bandwidth. It’s<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf"> estimated </a>that 44% of overall bandwidth used between nodes consists of these redundant messages. The long and short of it is that this approach has high redundancy and poor bandwidth efficiency. The bandwidth costs therefore become a huge impediment for some users to run a full node, which severely limits the extent of decentralization of the network. <br><br></p><p>Secondly, the decentralized nature of the network gives rise to another critical issue with regards to Bitcoin’s node connectivity, which is that it also uses large amounts of bandwidth to keep the connection open with all the other nodes. In other words the current protocol increases bandwidth consumption as the number of connections between nodes increases. This also increases the costs to run a Bitcoin full node as the network scales, which would make the network more prone to centralization. Over and above that, since the security of the Bitcoin network is heavily reliant on the connectivity between nodes (i.e. higher connectivity results in a more secure network) fewer connections between nodes would be bandwidth efficient but would result in a less secure and borderline centralized network. According to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf">white paper</a> that was co-authored by Gleb Naumenko, Bryan Bishop, Pieter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, Alexandara Fedorova and Ivan Beschastnikh; Erlay will reduce the amount of bandwidth required to maintain current levels of connectivity between<a href="https://coinrivet.com/dictionary/bitcoin/"> </a>Bitcoin nodes by 40%, while simultaneously maintaining bandwidth usage as the connectivity between nodes increases. To put this in perspective, currently a connection to 32 nodes utilizes approximately 17.3GB per month to relay transactions and Erlay drastically reduces this to a meager 0.94GB per month! This is a huge quantum leap for bandwidth efficiency as shown by the diagrams below:<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10518.pdf"></a></p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzMxMTAyMDA4MDU5Mzk3/image2.png" height="239" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The paper further states that; “<em>By allowing more connections at a small cost, Erlay improves the security of the Bitcoin network. And, as we demonstrate, Erlay also hardens the network against attacks that attempt to learn the origin node of a transaction.” </em> In other words Erlay significantly improves bandwidth efficiency by reducing bandwidth used for transaction relay as well as scalability of connections between peers thus making the network more resistant to <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/~mohaisen/doc/icdcs19d.pdf">partitioning attacks</a> and fortifies single nodes against <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-an-eclipse-attack">eclipse attacks.</a> While Erlay protocol support signaling has successfully merged into<a href="https://blockchainreporter.net/bitcoin/"> </a>Bitcoin core, this was a development that took three and a half years to materialize, given the extensive review and testing that had to be done beforehand, because stability and security at the base layer are everything.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>While Bitcoin is a significant breakthrough in creating a trustless and decentralized monetary system with superior monetary properties, its success is not guaranteed unless we the users remain committed to defending the principles upon which it is anchored. The victory by the small blockers in the blocksize war wasn’t handed to them on a silver platter but it came about through relentless commitment to the goal of separation of money and state. It was all or nothing. Many more attempts to control Bitcoin at the protocol level will be launched, however they will be doomed to fail if we remain resolute and unwavering in preserving the network’s core tenets; of which decentralization is chief among them, in my humble opinion. By keeping the costs of running a node as low as possible,more individual users from around the world are able to participate in validating the network, this is what Erlay represents. It’s a defense against centralization of the network by larger players thus preserving Bitcoin’s identity as a fully decentralized, permissionless and trustless peer-to-peer monetary system. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

Short-term holder realized price (STH RP), as indicated by the report, is a more volatile, quick-to-move metric determined by the price of coins moved during a certain period, while long-term holder realized price (LTH RP) is a less volatile, more sticky metric determined by the price of coins held that have been unmoved for longer periods. When price dips below LTH RP, meaning that most long-term holders are underwater, it often coincides with previous bear market lows. The report suggests that the price of bitcoin is likely to flip both LTH RP and STH RP, which it is currently under, which could signal the low of the bear market.</p><figure>

ASIC Commoditization</p><p>2. Lack of Mining Investment in 2022</p><p>3. Global Energy Crisis (lack of available cheap energy).” </p><figure>

A version of this article was originally published on </em><a href="https://jonathanleger.substack.com/p/how-i-came-to-understand-bitcoin"><em>Substack</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>I was raised in a doomsday cult that taught that God was getting ready to wage the war of Armageddon and bring about the end of the current world order. The governments, all ruled by the devil, would be replaced with the Kingdom of Heaven ruled by Jesus Christ. The cult discouraged any kind of real financial planning because of this worldview. After all, what was the point of investing in a system facing imminent destruction? </p><p>This extreme religious upbringing — and my eventual escape from it — helped me in my path to understanding Bitcoin Maximalism.</p><h2>Discovering Bitcoin</h2><p>My Bitcoin experience began with a losing trade in the summer of 2014. After reading a few articles about this “magic internet money,” I bought my first whole coin for about $500. I wasn’t prepared for how volatile the price swings would be, though, and sold at a loss later that year. If only I had known…</p><p>The last five years have been an intense learning experience for me. At the end of 2017, I left the cult with my wife, who is currently shunned by her entire family (as required by cult doctrine). I lost all of my “friends” as well. We had to learn how the real world worked and how to build a social network outside of the ready-made set of “friends” handed to us by the church, as getting close to non-members was deeply discouraged. All non-members were going to die by God’s hand at Armageddon anyway, so there was no point in getting too familiar. Plus, their wicked ways might rub off on you, so it was best to keep your distance for fear that you might get hit by a stray fireball when the end came.</p><p>After leaving the cult, I embraced life with the fervor of a wrongly-jailed prisoner embracing freedom upon exoneration. I studied politics for the first time, since members didn’t vote or participate in any form of campaigning due to the belief that all earthly governments were Satanic. I read books on how far humanity had advanced and how much better off we all are than in centuries past, however imperfect the current world may be. I was excited and optimistic for the future.</p><p>In 2004, I had started and grew a successful business as a software developer and internet marketing coach. The tools our team developed helped people compete with larger companies for getting websites to the top of the search results in Google, as well as other related use cases. For many years, searching Google for “coolest guy on the planet” returned my website as the number one result, demonstrating the importance of the Bitcoiner mantra, “Don’t trust, verify.”</p><p>Despite making millions of dollars in successful software product launches, I lost most of it through poor financial decisions coupled with intensifying competition from much better capitalized companies. On top of that, I went through a very expensive, acrimonious divorce. </p><p>“Love is grand,” they say, “but divorce is a hundred grand.” I grew up poor and had little formal or personal education in how to properly manage money or what money even really was, so when I finally “made it” I didn’t know how to properly handle it.</p><p>As you might imagine, it wasn’t all bad. The money afforded me many incredible personal experiences. But my personal and home life were a mess, I was still a true believer in the doomsday cult praying for the end of the world, and on balance was very unhappy. I felt like the wealthy writer of <a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/ecclesiastes/1-14.htm">Ecclesiastes</a>, “I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.”</p><p>In 2019, I was 42 years old, had escaped the cult and was remarried to a wonderful woman whom I adore. I spent much of my time studying markets to prevent repeating past mistakes and working to develop a retirement plan. I did well with stocks that year but kept hearing about Bitcoin and how it was like nothing else. After reading “The Bitcoin Standard,” I finally understood why sound money was important and why fiat was doomed to fail. I again bought into BTC, this time at around $9,000.</p><h2>Contagion Hits</h2><p>When COVID-19 first reared its ugly head in early 2020, I did what many people did: listen to the “experts.” But as the scenes of pandemic theater played out, I began to understand that politics exhibited many of the same attributes as the cult I came out of. There were leaders that could not be questioned and members who would shame and shun anyone who dared to speak up. Their god was “The Science,” their Pope, Anthony Fauci, their clergy, the CDC and politicians. Rights were eroded and small businesses shut down while big box chains and mega-corporations raked in record profits, including Big Pharma. Trillions of dollars were printed out of thin air, proving true the Cantillon effect that says the largest beneficiaries of changes in money supply are the people and corporations closest to the money printers.</p><p>Unlike many hardcore Bitcoiners, my investment goals were purely financial, not philosophical. Like so many others in the crypto casino, I was chasing gains. Because of this, I sold my bitcoin at $45,000 and jumped into altcoins with the belief that I could multiply my investment, which I did. In fact, I did well enough to be able to stop writing software for about a year and a half, which was a much-needed hiatus and gave me even more time for the research I was doing.</p><p>Then came the market crash of 2022. With inflation clearly not “transitory,” the money printer was halted, and the Federal Reserve began to raise rates at a historically-unprecedented pace. Markets reacted negatively, bringing all cryptocurrencies down with them. The price of bitcoin cratered along with everything else. Low prices exposed the weakness of overleveraged schemes like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a>, sending them into bankruptcy. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin">Terra collapsed</a> along with a host of other smaller crypto operations.</p><p>The purportedly second-largest centralized crypto exchange in the world, FTX, stepped in with a promise to rescue the industry, only to turn out to be the<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns"> largest fraud of them all when its own balance sheet was leaked</a>. FTX’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was accused of stealing investors’ and users’ money and sending it to its trading arm, Alameda, where it was gambled away on high-risk trades that spectacularly failed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/10/23451484/ftx-customer-funds-alameda-research-sam-bankman-fried">to the tune of $10 billion</a>. </p><p>A massive “hack” of FTX followed shortly thereafter, the repercussions of which are still playing out. Evidence of political intrigue emerged, supported by the fact that most mainstream media coverage treated SBF with kid gloves, some even painting him as a victim rather than a predator. As of this writing, nobody has been arrested. By way of comparison, <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/billionaire-conman-bernard-madoff-arrested">Bernie Madoff was in handcuffs the day after his fraud was uncovered</a>.</p><p>Bitcoin began flying off exchanges while Bitcoiners shook their damn heads at how many people had again ignored one of their most basic truths, “Not your keys, not your coins.” While I was glad to see people finally listening, the damage done was tremendous, both in financial and reputational loss. Since my start with Bitcoin, I always self-custodied my bags and so was unaffected by any of the collapses, at least as far as losing any of my holdings.</p><p>Though I never lost my respect for Bitcoin or the principles of decentralization and sound money, these events returned them front and center to my consciousness. I resumed listening to Bitcoiner podcasts, reading long-form articles, watching videos and reminding myself just how badly off the current world financial system really is. </p><p>“It’s just math,” say the Bitcoiners, and I believe they are correct. There’s no stopping the debt spiral now. The end is indeed coming, just not in the way I had been taught growing up. </p><h2>I Finally Get It: ‘Don’t Trust, Verify’</h2><p>During the time I was trading and HODLing altcoins, I thought Bitcoin Maxis were too extreme. Even though I agreed with their views on sound money and decentralization and agreed that <em>most</em> cryptos were just vaporware rug pulls waiting to happen, I didn’t understand their disdain for <em>every</em> crypto that wasn’t bitcoin. This was especially true for projects that were actively being used in the real world to seemingly beneficial effect.</p><p>As a software developer myself, I am aware that there is no single tool that covers all use cases. There’s Windows, or MacOS X, or Linux for computers, Android or Apple’s iOS for phones, and countless different apps that run on all of those platforms that perform different functions, many of them competing for market share. This competition encourages innovation which ultimately makes all software better. That free-market principle is something Bitcoiners honor, so I didn’t understand why they jettisoned it when it came to cryptocurrencies. My assumption was they did so out of self-interest. If people invested in other projects, they wouldn’t put their money in bitcoin, which hurt the Bitcoiner’s own portfolio.</p><p>Then there was proof of work. It’s power intensive and comparatively slow, even if far superior to bank technologies like SWIFT in terms of speed and guaranteed settlement. Even if the “green” argument was just fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD), why stick with proof of work when other tech had proven far faster and more efficient, making it much more viable for payments systems?</p><p>Today, at last, after everything that’s happened over the past three years, I finally get it.</p><p>“Don’t trust, verify.”</p><p>The whole Bitcoiner philosophy comes down to those three words. Trust has always been abused, even if only by a small minority. But all it takes is a minority of people abusing and misusing your trust to cause you, and everyone else who trusts them, grave harm. So don’t trust, verify.</p><p>How does this relate to Bitcoiner’s referring to all other cryptos as “shitcoins” and dismissing them outright? It’s simple. The entire fiat currency system is a Ponzi scheme. Fiat is “money by decree” — it’s not backed by any real asset and only has value because the government says it does. Governments use fiat to rob citizens by printing money without citizens’ consent. This is, in effect, a tax that has not been approved by or voted on by the people. It’s theft.</p><p>For example, prior to fiat, governments would need actual hard currency (usually gold) to fund the wars they wanted to fight. If they didn’t have the money, they couldn’t fight the wars without raising taxes, which is never a popular proposition. With fiat, however, the government can print as much money as they want, pulling the money to fund their self-serving conflicts out of the pockets of the people who use that fiat currency: no permission necessary, and without most people realizing what’s happening.</p><p>Fiat also keeps people on a perpetual hamster wheel through inflation. If you know the money you have in the bank will be worth less next year than it is this year, you must keep trying harder to earn more money, year after year, just to keep your head above water. This keeps the majority of people as perpetual wage slaves, never quite able to get ahead, at least not enough to stop and enjoy their lives.</p><p>Without inflation you could live below your means, save your extra money, and trust in the deflationary effects of technology to make your money stretch much further once you decide to retire. After all, with technology constantly making supply chains more efficient through improvements in transportation and automation, everything <em>should </em>cost <em>less</em> over time, not more. And yet prices keep rising. Why? Inflation.</p><p>So what does fiat have to do with cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin? All other cryptocurrencies are working <em>within</em> the current financial system trying to improve it, make it more efficient, provide better privacy, etc. This has some positive effects. For instance, stablecoins give access to the U.S. dollar to people in countries whose currency is undergoing severe inflation and whose banking systems are corrupt or unreliable. <em>But it still requires the fiat Ponzi to function.</em></p><p>You can talk until you’re blue in the face about how a highly-efficient cryptocurrency could give access to the financial system to billions of unbanked individuals, improving their lives by helping them escape their own inflationary currencies and bypassing their corrupt governments. But it doesn’t matter because you’re only providing those people access <em>to another fiat currency, </em>and fiat is murdering the free market. You can talk about how issuing tokens give small businesses the ability to raise money without having to pay billions to big banks to IPO. Doesn’t matter. You’re still working <em>within the fiat system</em>, and the fiat system is the fundamental root of all the problems to begin with.</p><p>To the Bitcoiner, cryptocurrencies are decks being built onto the Titanic as it sinks, while Bitcoin is the life raft people need to get on to save themselves. The tech of some cryptos might be great, but it only delays the inevitable demise of the sinking ship. Maxis believe that bitcoin is destined to replace fiat, not shore it up, returning sound money to the world. As they often say, “Bitcoin fixes this.”</p><p>For Bitcoiners, this isn’t just about money. It’s a guidestone that influences every aspect of life. It’s a belief system, though I’ll stop short of calling it a religion, since people of every conceivable religion also subscribe to its tenants. To those who aren’t Bitcoiners, maxis can appear to be in some kind of cult, but it’s not a cult. Quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p>Bitcoiners are people who, like me, have <em>escaped</em> a cult: the cult of fiat. Once they were like everyone else, brainwashed into believing that the government could be trusted with control over the money printer, that the Fed was capable of central planning of the economy, and that inflation was necessary for economic growth.</p><p>Plato’s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_cave">Allegory of the Cage</a><em> </em>describes a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave for their entire lives. All they can see is a blank wall and the shadows cast upon it from a fire burning behind them. They give the shadows names, believing them to be actual representations of the real world. One of the prisoners escapes from the cave and, having experienced the actual world, realizes that the shadows are not true representations of it. He returns to the cave to try and convince the other prisoners, but they don’t believe him because the shadows are all they have ever known. Bitcoiners are the escaped man.</p><p>The Bitcoiner tribe can be rowdy and crass and harsh, but you must consider what they’re out to achieve and what they’re up against. Their endeavor is not for the faint of heart. It’s a real David and Goliath moment. The Bitcoiner stands, golden coins in hand, looking the giant in the eye with a defiance that onlookers usually perceive as madness. Maybe it is madness, but without that dauntless quality, Bitcoin wouldn’t have come as far as it has. And I, for one, will cheer them on as the giant collapses.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jonathan Leger.

Many newcomers to bitcoin mining will consult the profitability of an ASIC on a mining calculator, expecting that that profitability will stay relatively the same going forwards in the future. This is a misunderstanding as the profitability of any given machine, trends downwards over time. Increases in difficulty should be understood before purchasing an ASIC. </p><p> A simple way of understanding this is comparing an ASIC to any other electronic device. The longer the device is in use, the less relevant it is as new software requires more computing power. If you were to use an iPhone from 6 years ago, its performance would be incredibly frustrating. The older the phone gets, the less utility it has. </p><p>A very similar process happens in mining. When you are mining, you are competing with all the other miners around the world. As more miners turn on machines, it gets more difficult to compete. Having newer and more efficient hardware makes you more competitive, but that hardware is quickly moving towards being less competitive.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Difficulty Adjustment</p><p> Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment is something built into the Bitcoin protocol in order to ensure Bitcoin has a stable and predictable supply schedule. If there was no difficulty adjustment, all of the bitcoin likely would’ve already been mined and there would be little to no incentive for miners to secure the network. When more miners join the network, blocks are minted at a faster rate as a result of a hash rate increase. The network responds by adjusting the difficulty higher to ensure that blocks come in around 10 minutes. For miners, increased difficulty adjustments mean less profits. For the average Bitcoin user, it means more security for the monetary network they are using. </p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Picture taken from insights.braiins.com</em><br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>Downwards difficulty adjustments mean that miners will be earning more profits as these are a result of hash rate coming offline. The famous example of this happening is when China banned Bitcoin mining and a large portion of the network hash rate went offline for a period of time. Downwards difficulty adjustments are not the norm as mining hardware is always getting more powerful and efficient. Even if there was a stagnation of machine efficiency and hash rate increases, more machines would be produced and plugged in. The Bitcoin mining industry is incredibly immature and there is a tremendous amount of room for growth going forward which means that hash rate is almost certainly going to increase at rapid rates going forward over the long run.</p><p>We are currently seeing a bull market in energy prices with a suppressed bitcoin price which means that miners are experiencing quite a bit of pain. There is a possibility that there could be a series of downward difficulty adjustments as hash rate comes offline, but this is not something that miners should put in their models. It is important to prepare for the worst case scenario which is what we have seen the last few months. </p><h2>New Machines Coming To Market</h2><p> Every couple years, ASIC manufacturers release a new machine with significant improvements in regards to hash rate and efficiency. Recent network hash rate increases are largely due to seeing Bitmain’s S19 XP and S19 Hydro being deployed. Another factor is that a large amount of older generation machines are finally being turned on as a result of infrastructure being built out.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MzA4ODIzMjA3Mzg4ODQ5/image2.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>This chart is an oversimplification just for visual purposes.<br></figcaption>
    </figure><p>When you buy an ASIC, its value will be constantly depreciating as both network hash rate increases and new machines come onto the market. The value will fluctuate depending on the Bitcoin price, but it’s safe to say the machine loses value over time. That is why it is incredibly important to have the machine running when you have it. Buying it to plug in later means you are throwing money away unnecessarily.</p><h2>Bitcoin Purchasing Power</h2><p> Bitcoin mining is like taking a long position on Bitcoin, but with a lot of headaches and execution risk. If done correctly, it can be incredibly lucrative. If done incorrectly, it is a fantastic way to get poor quickly. The income the machine makes is fairly consistent, but the purchasing power of that income varies tremendously. Power prices may be stable priced in dollars, but are very volatile when priced in the income you are making from that machine. A S19j Pro may make 38,000-40,000 sats a day in income, but if you are mining on $0.10 a kWh, your power costs will be 41,263 sats with bitcoin trading at $17,461. </p><p>This is why it is incredibly important to try and get the lowest possible electricity prices in order to be profitable and ROI on your equipment. Finding cheap electricity is neither straightforward nor easy. Oftentimes there are hidden fees or complications that cause miners to fail. All miners regardless of how big or small are subjected to these economics of variable purchasing power, network hash rate increases, and machine devaluation/obsoletion. </p><h2>ASIC Pricing</h2><p> There is a base cost for the manufacturers to produce new equipment. We are currently at or reaching that floor for new equipment coming from the manufacturer. As a result, they are either slowing down or halting production of certain models. Individuals choose to pay a premium for new equipment because they come with warranties. Used equipment on the other hand generally does not come with a warranty, and also uncertainty of conditions that it was run in. For this reason, used equipment is often sold at a substantial discount. </p><p>ASIC pricing is variable just like every other industry. Supply and demand are the major factors that determine price. Individuals buying ASICs have a million different reasons why they may want to purchase at a certain time, but Bitcoin price and difficulty are major influences. If the purchasing power of the income being earned by an ASIC is low, there will be less demand and the ASIC price will fall. Bear markets are generally good times to buy because the demand drops significantly. </p><h2>Moore’s Law And The Future Of ASICs</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Moore’s Law: an axiom of microprocessor development usually holding that processing power doubles about every 18 months especially relative to cost or size.”&nbsp;</em>— <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Moore%27s%20law">Merriam Webster</a></p></blockquote><p>We are coming to the end of the computer chip revolution as chip makers are pushing the boundaries of physics. In no way is this the end of massive increases in Bitcoin’s network hash rate. The mining industry is very rough around the edges in regards to very basic principles such as heat dissipation, software implementations, and relationships with energy producers. Computer chips may have slower leaps as far as increases in computing power, but we have barely scratched the surface in regards to other technological leaps forward that will ultimately lead to more power being consumed and more computing power expended in order to secure the Bitcoin Network.</p><p> As bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, and its value understood, the demand for mining is bound to increase globally. The result will naturally be an increase in Network hash rate. As a miner, this is a painful reality as it means the profitability of my hardware will decrease over time. As a Bitcoiner, it gives me confidence in the monetary network that I use daily. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kaboomracks Alex.

As of December of 2021, Canada <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">had 6.48% of global hash rate</a> according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index.</p><p>A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/in-canada-bitcoin-mining-is-thriving">Bitcoin Magazine article</a> from 2021 details the various regulatory challenges in Canada, as well as the successful operations that continue to prosper in the country despite these. Recently, the Manitoba province’s government set an <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map">18-month moratorium</a> on new mining operations. In the past, Canada has <a href="https://montrealgazette.com/business/local-business/crypto-craze-has-hydro-quebec-ceos-phone-ringing-off-the-hook">experienced large influxes</a> of miners seeking to take advantage of the abundance of power there. <br><br>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/quebec-shuns-bitcoin-mining-in-bid-to-conserve-power-11670514921?mod=business_minor_pos13">a report</a> by the Wall Street Journal, “Hydro-Québec charges the lowest rates for industrial power in North America, with average prices as of April 1 of 3.93 cents per kilowatt-hour… The average cost in North America is 8.22 cents, according to Hydro-Québec.”<br></p><p>The request is up for approval by Québec’s energy regulator, Régie de l’énergie du Québec, which is believed to be completed within the next few months. The move would not restrict power to existing firms within the province, but could impact future development and investment into the region. </p><p>Bitcoin miners’ ability to move their equipment does make it possible for operations to shift out of the region to more friendly locations such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/texas-is-the-bitcoin-mining-capital">Texas</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wyoming-aiming-5-bitcoin-mining-hashrate">Wyoming</a>, which could become prime examples of the power of favorable regulation.

The proposed eighth Directive on Administrative Cooperation was previously reported on by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/30/eu-crypto-nft-providers-must-report-tax-details-under-leaked-eu-plan/">CoinDesk</a>, and could have wide-reaching implications including forcing non-EU based companies to have to register with tax entities there. <br></p><p>In a statement, the EU Commissioner for tax, Paolo Gentiloni <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/eu-to-make-crypto-companies-report-tax-details-to-authorities/">said</a>, “Anonymity means that many crypto-asset users making significant profits fall under the radar of national tax authorities. This is not acceptable.”</p><p>The enforcement of the measures was not made entirely clear, as the cryptocurrency industry has various entities and actors residing in various jurisdictions, including some who claim no base of operations. Beyond that, there should be concern for the honeypot of user data that registering user holdings creates. Often, holdings on centralized exchanges (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sam-bankman-fried-and-ftx-largest-crypto-fraud-history">which are dangerous in their own right</a>) are paired with sensitive identifying information which could potentially be used by criminals to attach people to their holdings. </p><p>There have been various cases of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ledger-hack-victim-scam-details">documented</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/20/revolut-cyberattack-thousands-exposed/">data</a> <a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/11/8/data-security-incident">leaks</a> in and outside of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/celsius-user-data-dump-crypto-tracing-scammers/">cryptocurrency industry</a>: and these are simply the ones that surface. Forcing companies to provide European tax authorities — including companies based outside of the EU — once again forces firms to collect copious amounts of data exposing user holdings, and then transmit them to tax authorities in Europe whom they must trust to keep them safe. <br></p><p>Concerns have also been voiced that this could have ramifications for the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) which is the “first all-encompassing effort to tackle cryptoassets and brings rules contained in Mifid, Market Abuse and the Prospectus Regulation to the cryptoasset industry,” according to the <a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/2a647jipe3beilngwqlmo/primer-markets-in-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">International Financial Law Review</a> (IFLR).</p><p>The European Crypto Initiative made a statement indicating <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/08/eu-to-make-crypto-companies-report-tax-details-to-authorities/">it was</a> “concerned that it would apply to a far wider range of obliged entities and individuals” than MiCA.</p><p>The EU has said it believes the move could generate as much as $2.5 billion (2.4 billion euros) through the introduction of the directive.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNjA3MTM2MjI2NzQ4MTUz/20220926_good-gdog-proof-collaborative-custody-multisig-by-will-schoellkopf_.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Future Of Venture Capital Is Investing In Bitcoin-Only Companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Among the plethora of investors in the crypto world, there is a niche that shares common visions and strategies.

They are the Bitcoin-only venture capitalists.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>“The smartest people in the world are working on Bitcoin, they’re not working on some other project,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeJarmuz">Mike Jarmuz</a> told Bitcoin Magazine. “They’re not working on altcoins or selling real estate in a metaverse fantasy land. Your medical records are not going onto some other thing masquerading as a blockchain. We view these as ridiculous and completely uninvestable ideas.”</p><p>Jarmuz is the the managing partner of an investment fund called <a href="https://ltng.ventures/">Lightning Ventures</a>, whose peculiarity is that it focuses its investments solely on companies that develop products and services on bitcoin and no other cryptocurrency. </p><p>“The 21st century digital economy is being built on Bitcoin-native companies,” added <a href="https://twitter.com/mcshane_writes">McShane</a>, a venture partner at Lightning Ventures and employee at BTC Inc, which operates Bitcoin Magazine. “We invest in best-in-class Bitcoin founders who deliver focused, and differentiated, value to humanity. We are determined to return a multiple to our investors through Bitcoin companies that strive to make a positive impact on the world.”</p><p>And Lightning Ventures is not alone, but rather part of a growing niche, that of Bitcoin-only venture capitalists (VCs).</p><h2>The Fall Of Crypto Hedge Funds</h2><p>Last year, at the height of the bull market, it was the crypto VCs who dominated the headlines, pouring over <a href="https://docsend.com/view/pwgbawfj6sc8q7de">$33 billion</a> into crypto/blockchain/Web3 projects and startups. This golden age was very short-lived, as this year's market crash also claimed illustrious victims in the world of hedge funds: one in particular was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/06/27/three-arrows-capital-default-crypto-voyager-digital/">Three Arrows Capital</a>, which defaulted last June after being unable to repay a loan of over $670 million.</p><p>Such sudden gains and collapses are not very common for a venture capital fund, <a href="https://seraf-investor.com/compass/article/charting-course-building-winning-vc-fund-strategy-part-ii#:~:text=Most%20venture%20funds%20have%20a,but%20that%20is%20fairly%20standard.">which traditionally approaches investments with a 10-year time horizon</a>, not horizons of just a few months. When, however, the bet is in projects that issue tokens out of thin air, the moment these appreciate on the wave of enthusiasm, the temptation to turn investment activity into speculation is very strong — with the risk of getting burnt when the markets reverse their course.</p><h2>Low Time Preference</h2><p>The crypto hedge funds demonstrated the mentality of the short term — the opposite of that shared by VCs who believe in Bitcoin's long-term success, investing in those companies that, without issuing useless tokens invented on the spot, try to develop services that bring real value to the market.</p><p>“Early-stage Bitcoin startup or angel investing is definitely a low time preference choice,” Jarmuz specified. “Many ‘crypto’ projects choose to issue unlicensed, unregistered securities, in exchange for equity but you don’t end up with quality investors. What happens is that investors dump those ‘tokens’ or equity the minute they can. With our Lightning Ventures’ thesis and Bitcoin-only investments, we are committed for the life of the company and are not concerned with selling ‘tokens’ the moment we can. When we invest in a company, we back it and support it throughout its entire life cycle.”</p><p>On this same page is <a href="https://twitter.com/mecee">Christopher Calicott</a> of <a href="https://tvp.fund/">Trammell Venture Partners</a>, or TVP, who said that the idea of funding projects that attract customers by generating tokens is not only symptomatic of a short-term view, but is also inconsistent with the typical incentives of a venture capital fund.</p><p>“Investing in these tokens, said Calicott, is a fundamental misalignment of interest to really grow the company and achieve maximum success. Investors actually become speculators trying to get out of their position with the best timing.”</p><p>Moreover, while there used to be a feeling that it was difficult to build on Bitcoin — and so many moved to other cryptocurrencies — today things are changing:</p><p>"Bitcoin is becoming a platform and entrepreneurs are starting to realize that,” Calicott continued. “There’s blood in the streets being brought by the crypto industry, but despite this, there are now more entrepreneurs willing to build services on Bitcoin than ever before. We see ourselves as long-term investors. We are trying to make smart bets on companies that we think can usher a whole new global monetary order on a solid standard: Bitcoin.”</p><h2>Overcoming An Obsolete System</h2><p>A new monetary standard, a global store of value, a peer-to-peer payment method that renders the big traditional players obsolete. Whichever way you look at it, Bitcoin offers a vision of the future that completely overturns the paradigms to which we are accustomed: the idea of inflation necessary for growth, that of macro-economic control by states and central banks, that of having to entrust the management of savings and digital payments to intermediaries.</p><p>Is the old way of seeing things compatible with the Bitcoin future? According to <a href="https://egodeath.capital/intro#:~:text=For%20a%20new%20system%20to,a%20false%20sense%20of%20loss.">Ego Death Capital’s website</a>, it is not. </p><p>“For a new system to thrive, to bring abundance, opportunity and accessibility, the old system must self-destruct,” per the website for the VC firm, whose CEO is <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBooth">Jeff Booth</a>, author of “The Price of Tomorrow.” “For this to happen, it will require a phase of ‘self-surrender and transition.’”</p><p>Confirming the view are <a href="https://twitter.com/nico_lechuga">Nico Lechuga</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/1andipitt">Andi Pitt</a>, both general partners at Ego Death.</p><p>"The traditional system is already self destructing," they explained. “Banking systems fail billions of people around the world — it is very evident in emerging markets but even in Western countries. Meanwhile, the Visa and Mastercard duopoly holds back innovation and opportunity so as competition arises — including through the Lightning Network, providing very fast and low-cost transactions — they are already in the process of self-destructing.”</p><p>The Lightning Network is also seen as a payments gamechanger for <a href="https://twitter.com/olegmikh1">Oleg Mikhalsky</a> of <a href="https://fulgur.ventures/">Fulgur Ventures</a>, because, as he said, “almost-instant settlement with very limited counterparty risk is a feature of Lightning that is well positioned to reduce traditional payment overheads and lower counterparty risk existing in fiat rails.”</p><p>"For the digital economy to grow,” added Mikhalsky, “we need a native digital currency that has two features: velocity and the ability to make micro-transactions. We believe Bitcoin and Lightning will become the global monetary and payment standards. Some aspects of the Lightning Network adoption spectrum are yet to be explored: we see some adoption in video games, digital content monetisation, but there are other use cases such as machine-to-machine payments and micro-transactions for energy."</p><h2>More And More Bitcoin-Only Startups</h2><p>Contrary to what one might think, in a year when the market collapsed dramatically, the world of Bitcoin-only startups has experienced very indicative growth. As confirmed by all VCs surveyed for this article, the number of companies focused exclusively on Bitcoin has grown significantly over the past year. It is plausible to think that when the Pandora's box of the crypto world was discovered, at that point, entrepreneurs realized that it was wiser to focus on the one technology whose fundamentals have never stopped strengthening since the beginning.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/julian_liniger">Julian Liniger</a>, CEO of <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> — a Swiss startup which allows users to buy and sell bitcoin in a non-custodial way — emphasized that future growth.</p><p>“In the long run, it is less risky to invest in Bitcoin-only startups than in crypto startups: investors see Bitcoin-focused companies as more profitable and a more sustainable business model,” he explained. “With Bitcoin-only VCs, we are 100% aligned. They see the future in 10 years, they understand where we are going, they understand that all the experiments that are happening on other blockchains will end up on Bitcoin.”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Federico Rivi.

Here’s how it works and what you can do to get a bitcoin-backed loan.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>Loaning your bitcoin invites an element of risk that you may not need to incur. You should not make any financial, investment, trading or otherwise decision solely based on the information presented in this article.</em></p><p>Bitcoin lending will be the future of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-does-not-need-defi-but-defi-needs-bitcoin">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a>. Many DeFi projects are currently sitting on Ethereum due to its built-in support for smart contracts and network effects, but this is changing rapidly.</p><p>Smart contract platforms are being built on Bitcoin to create a new ecosystem that offers the highest protocol security and the sound money network only an established asset like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">bitcoin</a> can offer.</p><p>A bitcoin-backed loan is a type of secured loan that lets you easily borrow cash using your bitcoin as collateral. Due to their rising popularity, BTC loans facilitate the transition to decentralized finance based on a bitcoin standard, where intermediaries have little to no space and the protocol’s solid foundations ensure security. A new financial system opens up plenty of opportunities for everyone, with no censorship allowed.</p><p>Bitcoin’s total value locked (TVL) is <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Bitcoin">$108 million</a> as of October 2022, while Ethereum’s sits at $30.37 billion. Even though the potential of unlocking DeFi on Bitcoin is evidently enormous, there are reasons behind the extreme gap in such comparison.</p><p>One of them is Bitcoin’s true decentralization which prevents any central planning or venture capital funds from interfering with its prodigious independent development. While this is the best thing for Bitcoin, it also means that money for development is limited, making it slower than Ethereum, which is backed by big corporate money.</p><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-semantics-of-the-bitcoin-layers">Bitcoin’s base layer</a> is excellent for money transaction settlement, but smart contracts, which are the fundamental components of DeFi, need to be built on upper layers like the Internet is built upon the base TCP/IP layer.</p><p>This article will explore the opportunities that Bitcoin lending could open in DeFi, how it works and where you can look for the current services offered. </p><h2>DeFi vs. CeFi</h2><p>Centralized finance (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) are fast-growing branches of the cryptocurrency space that will likely shape the future of financial services.</p><p>Not to be confused with TradFi (traditional finance), which is the customary way of borrowing and lending money through the banking system, CeFi is still provided by an intermediary while using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to offer cheaper, faster and more secure financial products. People must still place trust in an intermediary; in this case, the centralized platform. </p><p>DeFi, on the other hand, is peer-to-peer financial services and lending where trust is placed in the protocol and smart contracts without an intermediary (other than, perhaps, an escrow service). This is important because third-party gatekeepers can make transactions inefficient while users lose control over their own money. </p><p><em>"To build DeFi on a centralized protocol, or one that is a protocol managed by rulers, is inherently broken from the start" </em>- @AlyseKilleen</p><p>Within the two branches, there are two main types of bitcoin lending platforms: decentralized and centralized lenders. They both offer high-interest rates for lenders and lower-than-usual rates for borrowers; they typically require borrowers to deposit bitcoin as collateral to access a loan.</p><p>However, there are several differences amongst lenders so borrowers should consider carefully when choosing the most suitable platform.</p><p>In particular, DeFi provides more privacy than centralized finance platforms, which usually require some form of verification to allow users to access their services. DeFi platforms work directly through smart contracts without having to trust a central authority.</p><p>User experience and custody are on the side of CeFi, which usually provides an efficient customer interface while taking custody of the users’ bitcoin. With DeFi, users must take responsibility and complete control over their bitcoin while facing the risk of technology hurdles.</p><h2>Why Get A Bitcoin-Backed Loan?</h2><p>Getting a bitcoin-backed loan will help you avoid selling bitcoin — and you’re actually putting your bitcoin to work. HODLing bitcoin is already the best thing you can do if you’re after sound money; however, as a lender or a borrower, you can give bitcoin an additional purpose with the help of DeFi loans. </p><p>Just like banks lend you money in exchange for cash, bitcoin DeFi loans allow you to borrow money from other bitcoin peers in exchange for fiat or stablecoins. However, you will only be able to access a bank loan or lend your money if you have an excellent credit score and provide additional guarantees. With bitcoin DeFi loans, everyone can become a lender or a borrower.</p><p>As a borrower, you won’t be giving up your bitcoin. Instead, you’ll be paying reasonable loan interest rates in order to purchase products and services using fiat — all while usually paying fewer taxes, depending on your jurisdiction. As a lender, you will earn interest on the bitcoin you’re lending. </p><p>In traditional finance, trust between borrowers and lenders must be necessarily ensured by financial institutions that face enormous risks in offering their money to customers. This is why banks and institutions must take strict verification procedures to minimize the chance of losing their money. </p><p>By lending cash in exchange for bitcoin as collateral, businesses do not need any other verification; they will hold the cryptocurrency until the loan is paid back entirely, either in installments or in one lump sum at the end of the term.</p><p>This type of loan will also satisfy the borrower who enjoys a service that is permissionless and is mostly a private matter. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PA5TvqD4bI">emerging countries</a>, ordinary people can’t easily get traditional loans from banks. With bitcoin ownership, they finally have the chance to use it as collateral for loans, which is a game changer for billions of people worldwide.</p><p>We’ll go into more detail in the “How Does It Work” section. However, what has been discussed up to here should already give you an idea of the impact bitcoin lending can have in the financial world.</p><h2>Risks</h2><p>Bitcoin lending is rapidly growing in the world of cryptocurrency finance. However, you should keep in mind that the industry is still in its infancy; there are risks associated with the early days of the technology, coupled with financial hazards.</p><p>Here are a few of the drawbacks to consider before using bitcoin as collateral to take up a loan:</p><ul><li>Collateral loss through bugs in the smart contract or peg.</li><li>Collateral loss through hacks, especially in CeFi platforms.</li><li>Collateral loss if capital dips below the threshold in the event of a bitcoin price drop. For example, in the case of a margin call, borrowers could lose all or part of their capital if they don’t top up the collateral with more bitcoin.</li><li>Some of DeFi lenders are decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), so if something happens and you lose your bitcoin, there is no corporation or entity you can sue.</li><li>Rehypothecation and eventual insolvency by the platform.</li></ul><h2>How Does It Work</h2><p>The Bitcoin base layer (also referred to as L1 or Layer 1) is the most immutable, trustworthy, robust and decentralized of all blockchains. This is achieved via a tradeoff: the base layer’s capabilities are very narrow by design and can only support a limited number of basic transactions. Bitcoin is unscalable if you’re limited to the base layer. However, its solid foundational structure is perfect for building upon, enabling development on top of its network to build DeFi and smart contract platforms. </p><p>Bitcoin was designed to scale in layers; even Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696">suggested the possibility</a> in 2010, unlocking a new surge of innovation that can massively expand the Bitcoin economy.</p><p>Here we look to the future of Bitcoin and how this ecosystem will be built. We’ll highlight some projects that are bringing new use cases to Bitcoin.</p><p>The Bitcoin base layer was built to support settlements, not payments. So, for instance, payments are faster and cheaper on the Layer 2 Lightning Network or Liquid sidechain, but remain secure as they settle on Bitcoin’s base layer. Similarly, Layer 2 side chains like RSK or Stacks — they’ll be discussed later — provide functioning smart contract capability that settles on the base layer without changing it.</p><p>To sum up, the base layer is the foundation that ensures decentralization, censorship resistance and a sound environment, while experimentation occurs on the upper layers — along with increased risks.</p><h3>Improving Bitcoin Layers</h3><p>Major scripts’ improvements on the Bitcoin mainchain, like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/pros-cons-and-possibilities-for-bitcoin-discreet-log-contracts">DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts)</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/understanding-taproot-in-a-simple-way">Taproot</a> that allow more efficient and faster transaction verification, inevitably bring benefits to the interaction between the base layer and the multiple Bitcoin layers, too.</p><h3>How It Works For Individuals</h3><p>It would be best if you did your research to find the most suitable Bitcoin DeFi lending platform. You are giving your money to a centralized entity or an escrow that will hold it until you pay back the loan, so you should ensure your money is safe.</p><p>The lending or borrowing process is usually straightforward, supported by user-friendly interfaces and little to no verification required. Strategies exist to help you save money or reduce fees and the risks of being liquidated. For example, you should try to keep the total portfolio loan-to-value (LTV) ratio at 20% to better withstand a possible 50% drawdown in BTC price.</p><p>Your primary strategy should <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-i-did-to-fix-my-bitcoin-loan">work around the LTV element</a> because you risk getting liquidated if the loan’s bitcoin collateral falls in value, making it a margin loan unless you keep topping up with additional bitcoin. Exploring such strategies will better prepare you for facing loan challenges.</p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/what-i-did-to-fix-my-bitcoin-loan">Learning From Bitcoin Loan Strategies</a></p><h2>Where To Get A Bitcoin-Backed Loan</h2><p>Bitcoin’s native Script language is technically capable of supporting some limited smart contracts; however, it is cumbersome and restricted to prioritize security over programmability. Hence, side chain solutions that settle on the main chain are preferred methods to manage smart contracts and enable DeFi services like borrowing or lending against bitcoin.</p><p>Here are some popular and efficient solutions to choose from if you are considering taking out a bitcoin-backed loan.</p><h3>Sovryn Zero</h3><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDY1ODE1ODI3OTcz/sovryn-2.png" height="620" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><a href="https://www.sovryn.app/">Sovryn</a> is a decentralized trading and lending protocol built on <a href="https://www.rsk.co/">RSK (Rootstock)</a>. RSK is a Bitcoin sidechain that is simultaneously merge-mined with Bitcoin for enhanced security. It has a native currency called RBTC, which is meant to be a 1:1 BTC peg. </p><p>BTC conversion to RBTC is required to access <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/zero">Zero</a>, a decentralized protocol that enables customers to borrow ZUSD — a USD-pegged stablecoin — with zero interest using BTC as collateral. People must still place trust in an intermediary, in this case, the centralized platform.</p><p>The Sovryn loan’s minimum collateral ratio (collateral/debt) is 110%, which means that you must keep your loan collateralized above 110% at all times, without exception. BTC must first be converted into RBTC and then transferred to the Rootstock bitcoin sidechain to be used as collateral. Sovryn claims that the Zero protocol is non-custodial, governed by stakers according to the <a href="https://www.rsk.co/solutions/sovryn">Bitocracy protocol rules</a>, and operated by smart contracts that users interact with in a KYC-free manner.</p><h3>FUJI Finance</h3><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://fuji.money/">Fuji</a> is a <a href="https://liquid.net/#:~:text=The%20Liquid%20Network%20is%20a,top%20of%20the%20Bitcoin%20timechain.">Liquid</a>-based non-custodial protocol that enables the borrowing of synthetic assets (tokens that are digital representations of derivatives), such as stablecoins and synthetic stocks or bonds, against over-collateralized bitcoin positions. </p><p>Anyone can use Fuji to borrow any asset offered on the platform after locking L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin) as collateral in a smart contract. The smart contract creates 1 fUSD (Fuji USD) for each $1.50 worth of BTC locked. More collateral automatically decreases the risk of liquidation.</p><p>The borrower can always get the entire collateral back once the debt is settled. Repayment occurs upon burning the same amount of Fuji assets issued for this collateral, plus a small 0.25% payout for the redemption of the locked collateral.</p><h3>Ledn</h3><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTA5ODM5MjQyNzU3/ledn.png" height="620" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p><a href="https://www.ledn.io/">Ledn</a> is a Canadian cryptocurrency platform that provides BTC and USDC savings accounts to its customers, who can earn interest on these assets or borrow against them. Ledn provides Proof-of-Reserve attestations overseen by an independent certified public accountant.</p><p>Clients’ privacy is preserved with a unique anonymized ID for every client reference number; the individual's identity is never revealed to the independent accounting firm. Moreover, Ledn uses <a href="https://www.bitgo.com/">BitGo</a> for cold storage of clients' deposited bitcoin and doesn’t rehypothecate their collateral assets (i.e. doesn’t lend them to other parties) to earn extra revenue.</p><p>Ledn bitcoin-backed loans require an initial LTV ratio of 50%. When it reaches 70%, Ledn starts warning the borrower that it will liquidate enough BTC to repay part of the debt. If the LTV hits 80%, then all of the collateral Bitcoin will be liquidated unless more collateral is added to the loan.</p><p>Ledn only requires one payment at the end when the client wants to close the loan and avoids monthly interest payments, which is more convenient for the borrower.</p><p>The company has also started rolling out bitcoin mortgages in Ontario, Canada, allowing borrowers to use BTC as collateral in addition to the property's value to secure the loan. Pairing it with the property's value, the mortgage becomes overcollateralized, meaning that the collateral backing a loan is worth more than the loan itself, drastically reducing the chances that a loan is liquidated.</p><h3>HODL HODL</h3><figure>

The platform already offers bitcoin-backed loans, but support by better liquidity providers such as banks should be an added benefit for Hodl Hodl and its customers.</p><p>Their current offer includes non-custodial P2P bitcoin-backed loans that both lenders and borrowers can benefit from anonymously, and by setting their own terms, including loan duration, interest rates, and currencies used. </p><p>The company creates a multisig escrow contract where the borrower’s bitcoin is held. The lender transfers the loan amount to the borrower according to the contract. When the loan is repaid, the lender releases the bitcoin back to the borrower's wallet.</p><h3>Unchained Capital</h3><figure>

Only bitcoin is accepted as collateral on Verify21, the platform has no token and the platform does not rehypothecate client bitcoin or lend out client collateral to other borrowers. Bitcoin collateral is stored with institutional custody partners. Verify21 undertakes a bi-annual proof of reserve audit.</p><p>Initial loans are offered for a one year term at an interest rate of 10%, with an origination fee of 2.5%. This brings the total APR on the loans to 12.5%*</p><p>The company will notify borrowers that they need to top up their collateral when the bitcoin price falls drastically and approaches a risky LTV ratio. If the bitcoin price continues to fall and no collateral top-up has occurred, Verity21 will be forced to liquidate client loan collateral, settle the loan and return any excess loan collateral to the client"</p><h3>Atomic Finance</h3><figure>

    </figure><p>An interesting project that is undergoing its Beta phase is <a href="https://atomic.finance/">Atomic Finance</a>, a bitcoin-only financial services business that wants to provide sound finance to bitcoin holders.</p><p>They are currently testing a way to earn a yield on bitcoin without giving up custody, using Discreet Log Contracts (DLCs) that preserve users’ privacy and self-sovereignty. Such smart contract protocols do not need the creation or use of a native token different from bitcoin to unlock DeFi capabilities on the blockchain.</p><p>A DLC consists of two parties sending funds to a multisig address in order to bet on a particular outcome based on some pre-established condition being met. For example, bitcoin’s price at a certain point in the future. An agreed-upon oracle (a party that bridges smart contracts with off-chain data like the price of bitcoin, in this example) — or oracles — sign a transaction that attests the outcome of the event once the result is known. The DLC participant who bet correctly on that outcome will now be the only one who can claim the funds from the DLC multisig.</p><p>Other companies looking to follow the same model as Atomic Finance are <a href="https://www.dglab.com/">DG Lab</a> and <a href="https://suredbits.com/">SuredBits</a>. They are considered the purest forms of bitcoin finance as they allow DeFi to solely use bitcoin without other native tokens to function.</p><h3>ZEST </h3><figure>

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.zestprotocol.com/">Zest protocol</a> is an on-chain bitcoin capital market that allows clients to borrow cash from liquidity providers (LPs) who join professionally managed lending pools. LPs can earn 4-6% bitcoin yield this way, while borrowers can obtain on-chain bitcoin loans directly against their balance sheets. Zest is exclusive to institutional and corporate borrowers at this stage.</p><p>Strict KYC procedures are applied to borrowers who must be approved following a standard process. </p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Bitcoin’s Layer 2 DeFi lending platforms could shape the future of finance in a way that has never been experienced before. They are less dependent on the banking system and fairer to the participants, with no borders or censorship allowed in a permissionless environment.</p><p>All of this is being built before our eyes on top of the immutable, robust and trusted Bitcoin protocol. It’s opening opportunities that everyone will be able to seize.</p><p>That being said, to engage in DeFi is to relinquish control of your bitcoin. Losing access to your bitcoin permanently is a risk you must be comfortable with. So caution is advised. If you’re willing to take the risk, then let it be with a small portion of your bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0Mjk5NDE5OTEzMzY0OTk3/bitcoin_backed_loans_thumbnail-01.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDY1ODE1ODI3OTcz/sovryn-2.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NDk2Njg1OTA1NTg1/fuji-finance.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTA5ODM5MjQyNzU3/ledn.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTIwODQ1MDk2NDUz/hodl-hodl.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTI3NTU1OTgzMDI1/unchained-capital.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTMzNzI5OTk4NTEz/verify-21.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTQ0NDY3NDE2NzUz/atomic-finance.png" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0Mjk5NTUzODYyNjU3NTQx/zest.jpg" height="620" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why I Quit Investing In The Fiat Ponzi And Started Saving In Bitcoin]]></title><description><![CDATA[The tired argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is really more applicable to fiat, which makes it impossible for us to retain savings.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/quit-investing-save-in-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/quit-investing-save-in-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Fiat]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Saving]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mickey Koss]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 Dec 2022 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2NDMxNjgz/bitcoin-dollar.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The tired argument that Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme is really more applicable to fiat, which makes it impossible for us to retain savings.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Mickey Koss, a West Point graduate with a degree in economics.

The abject lack of intellectual curiosity is astonishing, yet somehow unsurprising given my recent stint in academia:</p><blockquote><p>“<em>The whole thing depends on even more people parting with their savings…</em>”</p></blockquote><p>Is this not true for the stock market? The housing market? The commodities market? By that logic, every market with fluidity of pricing based on supply and demand is a Ponzi scheme. I guess it’s time to go back to the barter economy? Or does the stock market go up on earnings alone without any buyers or demand?</p><p>In fact, It appears to me that prices have been going up faster than earnings since about 1980, even when taking inflation into account:</p><figure>

Can anyone say “<a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect">Cantillon effect</a>”? </p><h2>Fiat Is The Ponzi</h2><p>Crypto is a symptom, not the underlying problem.

    </figure><p>In what now feels like the blink of an eye, trillions of dollars were created to prevent the system from imploding. Suddenly, the stock market was booming while it seemed like everything was crumbling. I don’t even blame the central bankers. They responded to their incentives and did what they had to, but the effects were dire. If you weren’t already invested, you lost big, making it just that much harder to get your dollars to work for you, to escape inflation and eventually escape the rat race.</p><p>One of the most salient illustrations to me is the below graph. It demonstrates that you should buy a house, any house, it doesn’t matter. Because if you don’t already own a house, if you choose to save instead, you may never actually be able to afford one. It doesn’t take a lot of empathy to understand the financial desperation many are feeling today.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Now, I admit that I’m not a professional statistician, but the charts appear to have some significant correlation. Perhaps CPI inflation may not be the only problem. Perhaps asset price inflation may be forcing savers to become part-time investors. Supply and demand has a price impact on bitcoin, yes, but does the stock market not require new money to support prices as well?</p><h2>Bitcoin Is Savings</h2><blockquote><p>Savings: Money put by the excess of income over expenditures.</p><p>–<a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/savings">Merriam-Webster</a></p></blockquote><p>So, why can’t we just save money anymore? The FRED graphs included here tell it all. If you don’t become an investor, you will never keep up. That is, until now. </p><p>Bitcoin is our savings in a world bereft of things worthy of investment. Even if it hits $1 million tomorrow, we’re not selling. What would we even sell it for? To diversify? Into what? A stock market completely dependent upon money printing? An investment property where our tenants won’t have to pay rent following the stroke of a politician’s pen? A shiny rock with “intrinsic value”?</p><p>You see, how could Bitcoin be a Ponzi when Bitcoiners don’t even want your dollars? What you don’t understand is that we’re playing a different game now. What you don’t understand is that we’re trying to build something new; a better future for our children and grandchildren. </p><p>So, if you think bitcoin is doomed to crash and burn then short it. Try to profit off our demise, though I don’t think you will.</p><p>We will just keep buying and holding, continuing to front-run you and Wall Street, and everyone else who refuses to even try to understand Bitcoin. We hold no anger or resentment toward you. We don’t want to eat the rich, or to burn the system down; we just don’t want to play by your rules anymore.

Sam Bankman-Fried, better known by the three letter acronym SBF, burst onto the scene at the peak of the 2017 bubble, founding Alameda Research that September, just four years after graduating from an internship into a full-time position at one of the world’s largest market makers, Jane Street Capital. </p><p>SBF is the son of Stanford Law professor and founder of left-wing super PAC Mind The Gap, Barbara Fried, and Stanford professor Joseph Bankman, an expert on tax shelter laws and government regulation. At the start of 2018, SBF had struck digital gold while taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity presenting itself between a higher demand for bitcoin in the Asian market, colloquially known as the “kimchi premium”. By the end of the year, and after amassing a considerable fortune from this high-volume bitcoin/dollar spread, he officially moved to Hong Kong, formally founding the derivatives exchange FTX in the following spring. </p><p>The Bitcoin network that SBF rode from rags to riches and back again was partially launched in direct response to the fiat money experiment rearing its ugly head in the subprime mortgage, real estate and eurodollar crises that culminated into what is now known as the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 to 2009. </p><blockquote><p>“??EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks%”</p><p>  - Satoshi Nakamoto, January 3, 2009</p></blockquote><p>This now infamous inscription in the genesis block made clear the inappropriate fractional reserve banking and predatory loan fiascos of our regulated banking industry was to be put to rest once and for all by this emergent monetary protocol; a completely transparent and decentralized ledger would de-incentivize fraud and prevent obfuscation of illicit activity. A new competitor to the dollar arose from the ashes of the meltdown, and with it, a new standard for financial fairness, complete with predictable issuance, controlled once and for all by the people for the people. Yet in any system made with good intentions, criminals like SBF and his bought-and-paid-for political and media allies manage to find a way to hurt innocent people for the advantage of an unknown few. Like most intriguing stories of fraudulent financial crimes, this one starts in the Bahamas, and ends with a tidal wave of asset liquidations and broken homes. </p><blockquote><p>“If you think the Bahamas has ruined your global tax system, you have a pretty terrible global tax system.”</p><p>  - Steven Dean, Summer 2020 [1]</p></blockquote><h2>Launching The Stablecoin, CBDC Race To The Bottom</h2><p>The Bahamas seems innocuous enough, and yet there is a long history of U.S. tax avoidance, complete with rum-running bootleggers during the prohibition era. Continuing this tradition, the Caribbean banking centers, including the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands, as of August 2022, were the fourth-largest foreign holders of treasury securities, behind only Japan, China and the U.K. Shortly after the time of its founding, FTX was fully taking advantage of the free money era that began with the 2008 crash and was sustained by low-to-zero interest rates brought upon by the Trump administration. </p><p>These rate cuts were started by the Trump-nominated and Biden-renominated Jerome Powell and were further exacerbated by both of their administrations’ COVID responses. An unprecedented pumping of all things dollar denominated occurred, with real estate, stock indexes, bitcoin and a whole bunch of unregistered securities known as altcoins reaching new highs across the board. In June 2019, one month after the founding of FTX, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg announced Libra, a digital currency based on a basket of international currencies; a novel take on stablecoins. This launched the stablecoin and CBDC race in earnest, and coincidentally enough, the Central Bank of the Bahamas became the first such institution to announce its own CBDC, the sand dollar, in October 2020. The sand dollar itself was pegged to the Bahamian dollar, which is itself pegged to the United States dollar, and thus with its government-sanctioned launch, the birth of the first central bank-issued stablecoin dollar came to be on the sandy beaches of SBF’s new home.</p><blockquote><p>"What is the reserve currency of the crypto economy going to be? Right now it's unambiguously the USD. And interestingly it's USD whether or not you're looking at the American crypto economy."</p><p>  - Sam Bankman-Fried, November 5, 2021</p></blockquote><p>While the U.S. government feigned fear of systemic risk at the time, the Chinese government understood the Libra project to be a backdoor dollarization of the G7 currencies rumored to be included in its basket. A Metaverse-held take on the 1985 Plaza Accord, this plan of coordinated central banking would spread USD network users across the internet’s biggest network, sped up by the high velocity available in centralized digital payments and globalized by the borderless nature of the Facebook user base. </p><p>The digital yuan was trialed in April 2021 with great haste in reaction to this development, and by the Winter Olympics 2022, had launched for foreign attendees in Beijing. Not to be outdone by these new-look, same-shit fiat cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin made its own financial history when President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador took to the stage at Bitcoin 2021 to announce the legal tender aspirations of his small but dollarized nation. On March 9, 2022 President Joe Biden signed Executive Order #14067–”Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets”, which included aspirations for mitigation of financial risks in digital asset markets, as well as a clause stating that within 210 days, the attorney general, in consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, must provide a formal proposal for a government-issued CBDC.</p><p><br>By this point, the Bitcoin financial system had been utterly and properly dollar-ified, with billions of dollars in liquidity of dollar-denominated trading pairs making up the lion’s share of market activity. The same can be said for the Ethereum network, which has seen its compliance-driven perversion by non-native assets taking the wheel from its token Ether, as stablecoin and other dollar derivatives now uphold the majority of economic weight of the system. Both stablecoin giants Circle, issuer of USDC, and Tether came out in support of the merge, further ossifying their stake in the now-nearly-70%-OFAC-compliant blockchain. [2] As of this article’s writing, over 15.5 million ether are currently staked without active withdrawals in the Ethereum 2.0 beacon chain, worth nearly $18 billion dollars.[3] Fortunately for Bitcoin, the consensus weight of its system is not manipulated by user stake, and thus the Bitcoin market has been seemingly unaffected – negatively anyway – by this decade-long development. At least until scammer Do Kwon and his ponzi-scheme Luna wreaked havoc on investors at the start of May of 2022.</p><blockquote><p>“[Crypto is] obviously serious…you want to do right by it in the regulatory space.”</p><p>  - President Bill Clinton, April 27, 2022 (Allegedly) [4]</p></blockquote><h2>Contagion Spreads</h2><p>Only a few weeks after SBF hosted a keynote with former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair and President Bill Clinton at the FTX-organized Crypto Bahamas conference, one of the largest-ever over-the-counter bitcoin purchases was announced by the LUNA team. </p><p>Terraform Labs and the non-profit Luna Foundation Guard, two entities headed by Do Kwon, had begun a campaign to purchase bitcoin as a reserve asset in the event that their algorithmic stablecoin, UST, deviated from its $1 peg. Shortly before their collapse, the plan had ballooned to the lofty goal of stacking over $10 billion in the hardest known digital commodity known to man. This purchase was financed with Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, and was facilitated by cryptocurrency broker Genesis. </p><p>"Terra's remarkable growth has continuously reshaped crypto markets over the last two years”, said Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis. “Genesis is excited to be a liquidity partner to the Terra ecosystem, connecting it to a broader audience of institutional market participants." </p><p>With the bitcoin reserves of Luna Foundation Guard totalling 80,394 BTC, valued at over $3.1 billion on May 5, 2022, this purchase placed LFG among the top-10 bitcoin holders in the world. [5] But only for a moment, for while it might feel like a lifetime ago, what happened next should look awfully familiar; the peg was attacked, the recently-purchased bitcoin fortune was liquidated, Binance, led by CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), aptly halted all trading on LUNA and UST pairs – with notable exceptions to their own stablecoin BUSD – and Kwon seemingly fled to outside of U.S. jurisdiction to Asia. [6] </p><p>Thus begins our first of many repeatable points of inquiry; where exactly did this bitcoin go? According to an audit released in November 2022, over 33,000 bitcoin were transferred to Binance on May 10, 2022, and sold along with other assets while failing to defend the peg. [7] The same day the nearly $1 billion dollars worth of bitcoin hit Binance’s order books, bitcoin’s USD price broke below $30,000, falling from $40,000 just a week before. </p><p>On May 13, SBF purchased a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, the trading platform that came under scrutiny for halting trading during the GameStop fiasco in early 2021. Bloomberg had reported that around 40% of Robinhood’s revenue came directly from selling customers orders to firms such as Two Sigma Securities, and Citadel Securities. [8] Citadel had been fined $700,000 in July 2020 for front running trades placed by customers orders, and in September of that same year, Robinhood itself was questioned by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for improperly informing clients of selling stock trades to known high-frequency trading firms. </p><p>Previously in December 2020, Robinhood had agreed to pay $65 million to settle charges of repeated misstatements for failure to disclose their receipts of payments from said trading firms. [9] When newly-nominated Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen briefed newly-elected President Joe Biden on this conflict of interest in February 2021, she herself had to acquire an ethics waiver due to having received at least $700,000 in speaker fees from Citadel LLC the year prior. [10] SBF had disclosed this purchase via a filed Schedule 13-D form with the SEC, costing $648.3 billion dollars and giving him 2.8% voting power in their dual-class share structure, under the entity Emergent Fidelity Technologies; a name said to be randomly generated. [11]</p><blockquote><p>“On July 13, Coinbase Exchange will be unifying USD and USDC order books. As part of the unification process, USDC order books will be merged under USD order books to create a better, more seamless trading experience with deeper liquidity for USD and USDC.”</p><p>  - Coinbase Exchange Twitter, June 29, 2022 [12]</p></blockquote><p>Circle, the entity behind the increasingly utilized USDC stablecoin, had previously expanded their international offerings with a subsidiary operation based in Bermuda with an announcement made on July 22, 2019. [13] This entity, filed under the Digital Assets Business Act of 2018 (“DABA”) meant that Circle was the first major stablecoin issuer to receive a Class F (“Full”) DABA license that covered their operation of custody, payment services, exchange, trading and more financial services within the digital asset realm. Circle’s other banking partners, Signet, Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital had made USD loans to Celsius, Voyager, Block Fi, Three Arrows Capital and Alameda Research. By the time this article was written, all had filed for bankruptcy. Two of their other business affiliates, Galaxy Digital and Genesis, have also reported massive losses in the FTX collapse, with rumors of further contagion effects coming. Coinbase, a publicly-traded exchange under the ticker $COIN, announced in its Q2 2022 shareholder letter that nearly one third of total revenue was derived from interest on USD-denominated holdings, including a large USDC position: </p><p>“Interest income was $33 million, up 211% compared to Q1. The increase was primarily driven by our USDC activity, as well as higher interest rates as we generate interest on fiat customer custodial funds… at the end of Q2, we had $6.2 billion in total $USD resources. In addition, we had $428 million of crypto assets.” [14] </p><p>When the letter was released in late August 2022, interest on USDC holdings for 12 months was up to 4.7%, while one-month yields were an even 4%. By November 16, 2022, USDC yields were down to 0% across all time frames.[15]</p><blockquote><p>“1) Binance converts USDC --&gt; BUSD, and we see the change in supplies. Thus begins the Second Great Stablecoin War.”</p><p>  - @SBF, October 23, 2022 [16]</p></blockquote><p>On September 4, 2022, Binance announced that it would be auto-converting all USDC, USDP and TUSD, three major dollar stablecoins, into its self-issued BUSD, effective in just 25 days. [17] This led to continued concerns about Binance’s solvency with the preceding few months, especially July 2022, seeing the largest known outflows of bitcoin in the exchange’s history, eclipsing even March 2020’s black swan bottom. </p><p>On October 11, 216 days after Biden’s executive order with the aforementioned 210-day clause, BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian bank with over $43 trillion on the books, and coincidentally, the custodian of Circle’s reserves backing USDC, announced the launch of its digital asset custody program. [18] Involved with more than 20% of the world’s investable assets, the bank founded by the first secretary of the treasury, Alexander Hamilton, was also listed as a partner in the FedNow pilot. [19] </p><p>Despite these institutional developments, a continued bear market weighed heavily on the now-plummeting bitcoin price. Paradoxically, more and more Bitcoin hash rate poured onto the network. These concurrent movements saw Bitcoin’s hash price plummet to an all-time low, spurring a massive liquidation of bitcoin liabilities off mining operators books. On October 26, Core Scientific, then the largest Bitcoin mining operation in the world, filed for bankruptcy with millions of dollars in debt liabilities, thousands of ASICs, and yet in their filings, held only 24 bitcoin total when the circus came to town. [20] Where exactly did all this bitcoin go? On that same day, barely two weeks before the FTX collapse, Binance saw its largest single day outflow, with 71,579 coins, totalling over $1.1 billion in dollar terms. [21] This pushed net outflows to nearly 95,000 coins from the world’s largest exchange since just that July. Again, where exactly did all this bitcoin go? The very next day, October 27, 2022, SBF appeared on The Big Whale and announced future plans for FTX to launch its very own stablecoin. [22] </p><h2>More Sand Than Dollars</h2><blockquote><p>“CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and caribbean islands. They are going to frame me with a laptop planted by my ex gf who was a spy. They will torture me to death.”</p><p>  - Nikolai Muchgian, October 28, 2022 [23]</p></blockquote><p>On October 24, 2022, the MakerDAO approved a community proposal to custody nearly $1.6 billion USDC with Coinbase Prime. [24] Four days later, Nikolai Muchigan, the co-founder of MakerDAO and inventor of Rai, a DAI-fork stablecoin, tweeted that his life was in danger due to a Caribbean island blackmail ring, supposedly backed by Israeli and U.S. intelligence agents. Three days later, on Halloween, the 29-year-old coder Muchigan was found dead, having drowned in the sea off Condado Beach in Puerto Rico. [25] </p><p>Two days later, on November 2, 2022, CoinDesk reporter Ian Allison released findings that over a third of all assets – around $5.8 billion of $14.6 billion – on the balance sheet of SBF’s Alameda Research was intrinsically, and soon to be fatally, linked to FTX’s exchange token FTT. A “bank” run commenced, and after three days of nearly $6 billion in withdrawals, FTX was left with literally one single bitcoin. Where exactly did all this bitcoin go? The next day in an interview with Fortune, Coinbase founder and CEO Brian Armstrong made note that USDC will become the de facto central bank digital currency in the U.S. [26]</p><blockquote><p>“The policymakers in the U.S. will set the framework that need to be followed so that the private market will actually create the solutions, and USD coin has been on a really rapid rise… the regulatory environment is one of the biggest unlocks we’re going to have in terms of growing this industry and perhaps even getting the prices to go back up in the right direction”</p><p>  - Brian Armstrong, November 3, 2022</p></blockquote><p>On November 6, CZ announced Binance would liquidate a remaining portion of FTT it had acquired from exiting FTX’s equity, having received around $2.1 billion in BUSD and FTT. Minutes after his announcement, Caroline Ellison, SBF’s partner and the CEO of Alameda Research, offered to purchase the tokens at $22 each, in an over-the-counter fashion. [27] By November 8, CZ and SBF had a phone call and seemingly came to a tentative deal for acquisition, reserving the right to back out of the deal at any time, while interestingly also leaving both U.S.-based proprietary exchanges, Binance.us and FTX.us, outside the scope of the deal. </p><p>“Things have come full circle, and FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for FTX.com (pending DD etc)”, SBF tweeted. [28] </p><p>Later that evening, FTX officially suspended all asset withdrawals. As part of the conditions of the acquisition, SBF was forced to open the FTX books and show the bottom of his pockets; seeing more sand than dollars, CZ backed out of the deal. A few important statements were made in the 48 hours or so that led up to this sudden cataclysm, including from the awfully-quiet U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission itself. </p><blockquote><p>“Liquidating our FTT is just post-exit risk management, learning from LUNA. We gave support before, but we won't pretend to make love after divorce. We are not against anyone. But we won't support people who lobby against other industry players behind their backs. Onwards.”</p><p>  - CZ, November 6, 2022 [29]</p></blockquote><p>On November 7, 2022, the SEC officially deemed LBRY, or Library Coin, an unregistered security offering, setting a devastating precedent throughout the extended cryptocurrency market. [30] In the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, the memorandum and order read, “The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contends that LBRY, Inc. offered and sold unregistered securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933”, the act colloquially known as The Howey Test.</p><p>Due to LBRY reserving a pre-mine of nearly 400 million LBC tokens, and the knowledge that the company to date had spent approximately half of its pre-mined LBC, the SEC determined common enterprise complete with a lack of disclosure and proper filing of its now alleged security offering through required channels in the Gary Gensler-chaired SEC. The implications of this filing sent shockwaves across the pre-mined token industry, including exchanges listing these tokens as well as the entities behind their issuance. Conveniently, the next day was November 8, the United States’ midterm elections, with the balance of the senate and the house — and perhaps the regulatory path of the digital asset industry — once again at stake. </p><p>Searching for FTX on FEC.gov brings up 456 individual campaign contributions from SBF, CEO Ryan Salame, and others. [31] Salame’s contributions total over $14 million towards GOP candidates, while SBF’s “effective altruism” contributed over $20 million in donations to DNC politicians. Having been the second leading donor to the Biden campaign, by the time the final tallies from election night rolled in, SBF’s bankroll had finally caught up with his morals, and he found himself nearly completely bankrupt. </p><p>By November 9, the day after the elections, SBF had reportedly lost 94% of his net worth, down to $1 billion from more than $15 billion, leaving him with the largest single-day loss by a person according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. [32] Early in the morning of November 10, SBF took to Twitter to explain what happened, writing “I'm sorry. That's the biggest thing. I fucked up, and should have done better”, before making a specific note that “THIS IS ALL ABOUT FTX INTERNATIONAL, THE NON-US EXCHANGE. FTX US USERS ARE FINE!” [33]</p><h2>Chapter 11</h2><blockquote><p>“The administration [...] has consistently maintained that without proper oversight, cryptocurrencies risk harming everyday Americans…The most recent news further underscores these concerns and highlights why prudent regulation of cryptocurrencies is indeed needed.”<br></p><p>  - White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, November 10, 2022 [34]</p></blockquote><p>On the eleventh day of the eleventh month, FTX and Alameda Research officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and SBF stepped down as CEO. In addition, 130 affiliated companies connected or associated with FTX also commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11. [35] The tide had gone out, and nearly everyone involved got caught swimming naked, as a near-endless tidal wave of dollar-denominated liquidations made quick work of SBF’s Caribbean empire. </p><p>While the first trickles of a dollar CBDC may have started in the Bahamas, the monsoon of coming regulation and contagion of the Second Great Stablecoin War is far from over. The dollar, having fallen 10% off 35-year DXY highs since September, looks for new ways to innovate and further dollarize markets across the globe. </p><p>On November 15, just four days after the SBF tsunami crashed to shore, BNY Mellon, as well as a dozen or so other banking institutions, announced the start of a twelve-week digital dollar pilot program with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. [36] On the very same day, BlockFi announced plans for bankruptcy filings, only five months after taking a $250 million loan from FTX, and Circle announced users would now be able to settle payments by accepting Apple Pay. [37,38] With a significant 43% discount now showing on the highly-regulated Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, further community requests for proof of reserves are growing around Genesis and Grayscale, both owned by the Digital Currency Group, and even their custodian, Coinbase Custody. [39,40] As of this writing, these requests have so far been denied for security reasons. </p><p>While appearing to be riding the wave of the booming digital asset revolution, gathering celebrity endorsements and political allies alike, it turns out SBF was drowning in debt and capital misallocation amongst the loud, mainstream praise. Later that month, on November 30, SBF was set to appear in person at a New York Times event, sponsored by Accenture, alongside Secretary Yellen, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, former Vice President Michael Pence, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and others; tickets for the event were listed at $2,499 per attendee.[41] The interview between SBF and Andrew Ross Sorkin was streamed as advertised, albeit with both parties shooting remotely.</p><p>Bitcoin tends to be a ballast of truth, bringing all sorts of ballooning fraud rushing to the surface. FTX and Alameda Research will take their place amongst the seemingly too-big-to-sink players that ended up doing just that. They will certainly not be the last. However the following weeks, months, and years play out, it is clear that SBF was but a small fish in an ocean-sized, dollarized pond. And as he quickly found out, there is always a bigger fish.</p><blockquote><p>“At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak. But you know, glass houses. So for now, all I’ll say is: well played; you won.” [42]</p><p>  – Sam Bankman-Fried, November 10, 2022</p></blockquote><hr><h3>ENDNOTES:</h3><p>[1]<a

--><p>Kazakhstan is moving forward with regulation that will further stifle its bitcoin mining industry.</p><p>The country’s federal parliamentary body has completed secondary <a href="https://yandex.ru/video/preview/14309848359203792774">approval</a> of a bill "<a href="https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=38842072&amp;pos=5;-106#pos=5;-106">On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan</a>." With a third approval, the legislation will introduce new licensing requirements for bitcoin miners based on their facility ownership and operational structure. It would also require that miners purchase their electricity from the energy provider Korem at market rates. <br><br>Previously, specific reporting and tax <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/145103/kazakhstan-formalizes-reporting-regime-for-cryptocurrency-miners">requirements were implemented</a>, including registration of names, locations and quarterly reports to the government. These occurred as a result of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/is-kazakhstan-a-home-for-bitcoin-mining">major influx of mining</a> amidst <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/129152/following-energy-shortage-kazakhstan-is-reining-in-2021s-stampede-of-crypto-miners">energy shortages</a> and protests, all while bitcoin miners fled China as a response to the government’s banning of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/china-ban-bitcoin-is-a-good-thing">bitcoin</a>.<br><br>Kazakhstan’s close proximity to China and previously highly favorable energy access led to the large amounts of hash rate migrating to the country. Afterwards, Kazakhstan went as far as seizing up to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/linked/137902/kazakhstan-has-confiscated-nearly-200-million-in-mining-equipment-from-unregistered-miners">$200 million in mining equipment</a>&nbsp;who did not comply with regulation, and the country continues to try and absorb the benefits of the influx in bitcoin mining using legislation like this most recently approved bill. <br><br>Bitcoin Magazine <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/kazakhstan-to-establish-legal-framework-for-bitcoin-crypto">previously reported</a> on regulation in Kazakhstan, citing a <a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/16024131">report</a> from the Russian media outlet Tass. In the report, Ekaterina Smyshlyaeva, a member of the Committee on Economic Reform and Regional Development of the Majilis (Kazakhstan’s federal parliamentary body) detailed the government’s intentions, describing how, "Kazakhstan was used as a raw material appendage of the blockchain industry. [Through] bills, we oblige miners to license in Kazakhstan, that is, to create legal entities and become full-fledged subjects of taxation.”&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4Mjc5NjUwMzkxMTcyMjE4/how-to-heat-your-home-with-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[These Six Charts Show How Bitcoin Mining Is Enduring The Bear Market]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bear market history never repeats, but it often rhymes and these six datasets show how the bitcoin mining industry is faring today.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/six-charts-on-the-bitcoin-mining-market</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/six-charts-on-the-bitcoin-mining-market</guid><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[hash rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[bear market]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 07 Dec 2022 17:35:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNjgwMTk1/bitcoin-bear-market.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bear market history never repeats, but it often rhymes and these six datasets show how the bitcoin mining industry is faring today.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin mining companies continue struggling to survive the ongoing bear market. Dreams of<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-price-hits-miner-profitability"> outperforming</a> bitcoin as a public mining company are long gone.<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-warns-it-might-go-bankrupt-stock-plunges.html"> Bankruptcies</a> and<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/21/riot-blockchain-sues-northern-data-over-disclosures-related-to-texas-bitcoin-mine-acquisition/"> lawsuits</a> make routine headlines. And even Wall Street analysts that were<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/good-time-to-buy-crypto-mining-stocks-says-da-davidson-as-it-slashes-hashrate-forecasts/"> once bullish</a> on bitcoin mining investment opportunities now say they’re “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/wall-street-analyst-pulling-the-plug-on-bitcoin-miners-owing-to-bear-market-woes/">pulling the plug</a>” until the market improves. But exactly how bad is the current bear market?</p><p>It’s always darkest before dawn, as the adage says. And compared to previous bear markets, the mining industry looks much closer to the end of a turbulent market phase than the beginning of it. This article explores a bunch of data sets from the current and previous bear markets to contextualize the state of the industry and how the mining sector is faring. From hardware lifecycles and miner balances, to hash rate growth and hash price declines, all of these data tell a unique story about one of Bitcoin’s most important economic sectors.</p><h2>Mining Revenue Is Evaporating</h2><p>When bitcoin’s price drops, it’s not surprising that dollar-denominated mining revenue also drops. But it has – a lot. <a href="https://earthweb.com/how-many-bitcoins-are-mined-per-day/">Roughly 900 BTC are still mined every day</a> and will be until the next halving in 2024. But the fiat price for those bitcoin has plummeted this year, meaning miners have far fewer dollars for expenses like electricity, maintenance and the servicing of loans.</p><p>As the chart below demonstrates, in November, the entire bitcoin mining industry earned less than $500 million from processing transactions and issuing new coins. The bar chart below shows this monthly revenue compared to the past five years. November mining revenue marks a two-year low for monthly earnings.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NjA3MzQ1/bitcoin-mining-monthly-revenue.png" height="395" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>This past month marked a two-year low for Bitcoin mining company revenue.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Potential Hash Rate Uptrend Reversal</h2><p>Comparing the current bear market to the previous one in 2018 offers some interesting insights into how the mining industry has changed and how it has remained the same. One such comparison is hash rate growth during downward price trends. It’s not uncommon to see hash rate grow during bear markets. The annotated line chart below shows normalized hash rate growth during the 2018 and 2022 bear markets from bitcoin’s price peak to the drawdowns’ history (or current) lows.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NzM4NDE3/bear-market-daily-hash-rate-growth.png" height="393" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>So far in this bear market, Bitcoin hash rate has only grown.</figcaption>
    </figure><p>But one thing that is obviously missing from the above chart is a correction in hash rate growth during the later period of the bearish phase. In 2018, for example, the growth trend clearly changed course and dropped as the market eventually found a low for bitcoin’s price. But in the current market, hash rate has only grown. Perhaps a slight drop in hash rate through late November signals a trend change, but the question is still open.</p><h2>Collapse Of Public Mining Companies</h2><p>Perhaps the most brutal bitcoin mining chart of all shows the drawdowns of publicly-traded mining companies this year. It’s no secret that the past year has been brutal for bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and the global economy in general. But mining companies in particular have been clobbered. Over half of these companies have seen their share prices fall over 90% since January. Only two — CleanSpark and Riot Blockchain — have not dropped more than 80%.</p><p>Mining companies in general are often considered to be a high-beta investment in bitcoin, meaning when bitcoin goes up, mining stock prices go up more. But this market dynamic cuts both ways, and when bitcoin falls, the downside for mining stocks is even more brutal. The bar chart below shows the massacre these stocks have endured.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin mining stocks have been massacred.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>The Rise And Fall Of Bitcoin Mining’s ‘AK-47’</h2><p>An underappreciated hallmark of the current bitcoin bear market is the precipitous decline in hash rate contributed by Bitmain’s Antminer S9 machines. This model of mining machine is occasionally<a href="https://kaboomracks.com/learn/how-to-setup-a-antminer-s9/"> referred</a> to as the “AK-47” of mining because of its durability and reliable performance. And at one point in the 2018 bear market, the S9 was king. Nearly 80% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate came from this Bitmain model during the depths of the previous bear market.</p><p>But the current bear market tells a completely different story. Thanks to new, more efficient hardware and a vice-grip squeeze on mining profit margins, the percentage of hash rate from S9s dropped below 2% in early November. The annotated line chart below shows the rise and fall of this machine.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1NTQxNjM3/antiminer-s9-bitcoin-hash-rate.png" height="416" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>The Antminer S9 has seen a remarkable fall.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Miner Balance Retraces Its Sell Off</h2><p>The past few months have been disastrous for the “crypto” industry as exchange wars, insolvent custodians and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/crypto-contagion-intensifies-more-dominoes-fall">other forms of financial contagion swept the market</a>. Many bitcoin investors like to assume their segment of the industry is mostly insulated from the chaos of the rest of “crypto,” but this is usually false. In the case of miners, who are notoriously bad at timing the market, some panic was evident as address balances and miner outflows appeared to drop and spike, respectively.</p><p>But this activity was short lived. The line chart below shows that miner address balances have almost fully retraced their drop from late September through October. In short, miners appear to be back in HODL mode, impervious to exogenous market events. Whether the bear market is over or not is unknown. But miners seem to be accumulating more than selling.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjgwMDA5MzQ1ODAzOTUz/bitcoin-miner-one-hop-address-balances.png" height="413" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption>Miners appear to be back in HODL mode.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Hash Price Drop Today Vs. 2018</h2><p>Hash price is one of the most popular economic metrics for miners to track, even though few people outside of the mining sector understand it. In short, this metric represents the dollar-denominated revenue expected to be earned per marginal unit of hash rate. And like everything else in the bear market, hash price has fallen significantly. But its decline is not unusual, especially when it's compared to the hash price decline in 2018.</p><p>Shown in the chart below are normalized hash price drawdowns from 2018 and 2022. Readers will notice the fairly similar slope and size of the drawdowns. 2018 was slightly steeper. 2022 to date has been shallower but longer. But both were and are brutal for fledgling mining operations.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>This 2022 hash price drawdown has been shallower but longer than its 2018 equivalent.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>The Next Phase Of Mining</h2><p>Boom and bust cycles are a natural series of events for any properly functioning market. The bitcoin mining sector is no exception. For the past year, mining has seen its weaker, unprepared operators weeded out as the excesses from the bull market are brought to account. Now, in the depths of a bearish period, the real builders can continue to expand their operations and build a solid foundation for the next phase of euphoric bullishness. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

Who to trust? How can one verify for themselves? It’s all very unclear. What does it bring for precoiners, casual bitcoiners and purists alike? Confusion, fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD). The state of bitcoin privacy is embarrassing with all this perpetual drama scaring away new users. Precious time is wasted by developers, educators and regular users who would probably be better off doing anything but trying to keep up with the drama. </p><p>It is obvious that no one agrees on “how to do CoinJoins right,” let alone, how CoinJoins should be implemented to optimize user privacy and block space efficiency on the Bitcoin network? What are the tradeoffs between different implementations? Are some implementations outright flawed? How do CoinJoins “cross the chasm” from early adopters to mainstream users when billions of people will turn to bitcoin in the coming years? </p><p>Let’s now take a look at CoinJoins by asking fundamental questions and raising some assumptions to build some sort of mental models, which will be useful in evaluating different implementations in future articles. </p><h2>Not All CoinJoins Are Made Equal </h2><p>Blockspace efficiency should be considered to make sure CoinJoin transactions scale as Bitcoin gets used by more people across the world. This is rarely discussed as a top priority. Any CoinJoin design that ignores blockspace scarcity is unnecessarily spamming the block chain while accumulating technical debt, which will be difficult to pay back as more users CoinJoin in the future. Having a minimal footprint on the block chain is one goal that seems very reasonable to aim for: a small number of transactions to get to an acceptable level of anonymity sounds ideal. </p><ul><li>What is an acceptable level of anonymity? </li><li>What does anonymity even mean in the context of bitcoin privacy?</li><li>How are particular CoinJoin designs dealing with blockspace scarcity?</li></ul><h2>Reclaim Your Privacy</h2><p>Anonymity in bitcoin would mean that there are no outstanding or unusual features that would make a given transaction remarkable from other transactions on the ledger. That, of course, is not by design on the Bitcoin network, which is a pseudonymous system where coins (UTXOs, which stands for Unspent Transaction Output in technical terms) are by default not fungible due to having unique transaction histories. </p><p>CoinJoins add a level of anonymity to the bitcoin network by breaking links between transaction inputs and outputs primarily making resulting UTXOs indistinguishable from each other. There are other heuristics that chain analysis companies use to watch the bitcoin network, such as common input ownership, self-spending, round amounts or timing analysis to name a few, which may or may not be obscured by CoinJoins. </p><p>CoinJoins help bitcoiners reclaim their privacy but are not the solution to everything. If privacy is understood as the choice to share information about oneself, great privacy can be achieved through CoinJoins but picking the right implementation is essential. </p><ul><li>What is my privacy goal using CoinJoins? </li><li>Which heuristics does a CoinJoin implementation protect me against?</li><li>What are the risks that I want to avoid?</li></ul><h2>Number Of Participants</h2><p>Existing CoinJoin implementations have very different ways of improving privacy. Irrespective of each CoinJoin implementation design, the anonymity set (one measure for the level of anonymity) seems to be the most traditional way to evaluate how much privacy one gets from a CoinJoin. There are other ways that will be discussed in other articles. The assumptions are that either a high anonymity set is achieved with a large CoinJoin transaction or that it is achieved over multiple smaller CoinJoin transactions. These two parameters are both important, but is there one that is more important than the other? </p><p>In terms of blockspace efficiency, the assumption would be that achieving a large anonymity set with a single very large transaction that has many participants is better than multiple very small transactions with a few participants. </p><ul><li>Is one single large CoinJoin or multiple small CoinJoins better for privacy?</li><li>How can that be verified truthfully and rigorously? How small is too small for a CoinJoin? </li><li>What is the right metric to evaluate how much privacy you can get from a CoinJoin? </li><li>What is the most blockspace efficient when it comes to the size and number of CoinJoins to reclaim your privacy?</li><li>Is it realistic to expect coins to participate in multiple CoinJoins over time as more people start using CoinJoins? How many CoinJoin rounds is enough or too much?</li></ul><p>In simple terms, CoinJoins allow bitcoiners to reclaim their privacy by giving them plausible deniability. Plausibility is a measure of probability. How likely is it that your bitcoins were spent or simply moved to another address you still control? How likely is it that one input is linked to a given output? </p><p>Obviously, the smaller the probabilities across many options, the better plausible deniability you get as a hodler. Plausible deniability is hard to preserve because errors are easy to make. Change outputs are often problematic for bitcoiners who care about privacy and are often a source of contentious discussions and criticism. Why is change output such a controversial topic in CoinJoins? </p><h2>Change Output</h2><p>It’s all about deterministic links. If bitcoin transactions had a spectrum of privacy, on one end would be a transaction with absolute plausible deniability, meaning 0% chance of knowing the link between inputs and outputs. This is also referred to as randomness or entropy in a CoinJoin. The assumption is that the more random or higher the entropy, the better. On the other end would be a transaction with 100% deterministic links between its only input and single output. </p><p>Unintuitively, a high entropy doesn’t necessarily mean that a transaction provides good privacy. A transaction with three inputs and three outputs of equal amounts technically has 100% entropy, meaning there is no way to distinguish each output from each other; and yet, there is a 33.33% chance that each input is linked to a particular output. High entropy does not necessarily mean good plausible deniability.</p><p>Change almost always has a very high deterministic link to its previous transaction. In other words, there is little doubt that a change output is not tied to the previous transaction that spent it. That can be a considerable privacy issue if a given change output were to be co-spent with other anonymous inputs following CoinJoins (though exceptions may apply in certain cases). This is usually referred to as UTXO consolidation and can be fatal to your privacy if done naïvely. </p><p>Change outputs can de-anonymize outputs that have gained some plausible deniability from CoinJoins if spent together. Errors are commonplace for bitcoiners and sometimes the realization comes too late, undoing years of diligent privacy enhancements in one single spend. How to get rid of this change output problem? </p><p>Existing CoinJoin implementations have three ways of dealing with change outputs: isolate the change into another wallet that is not CoinJoining, include the change output in the same wallet that is CoinJoining or get rid of the change output by not having change outputs at all. The latter seems to be the most advisable in terms of privacy and blockspace efficiency but further digging is required to validate or reject this assumption. </p><ul><li>Is a high entropy score enough to qualify a CoinJoin as good for your privacy?</li><li>Is it better to isolate change outputs in another wallet or should it be removed entirely?</li><li>Is a change output always bad for your privacy?</li></ul><h2>Coin Denominations</h2><p>Getting rid of change outputs in CoinJoins requires that coin denominations be variable in a CoinJoin. In other words, the inputs registered in a given CoinJoin cannot have a fixed size like 0.1 BTC, otherwise it becomes impossible (or at least very hard) to consume inputs without creating change outputs as most UTXOs don’t have round numbers (i.e. 0.19572394 BTC where 0.09572394 BTC would be the change in a 0.1 BTC fixed coin denomination CoinJoin). </p><p>Change outputs can be dangerous for your privacy, remember? Having multiple sizes for inputs and outputs in a CoinJoin seems to be a bad idea as it brings us closer to deterministic links between inputs and outputs, right? Well, yes and no. It depends. If a CoinJoin has a small number of participants (meaning few inputs and few outputs), then different denominations are a bad idea. But what if a large number of inputs and outputs are included in a given CoinJoin? </p><p>In a large CoinJoin, multiple denominations can bring a high level of plausible deniability to each resulting output without creating change outputs and requiring additional transactions, which is a highly efficient use of blockspace. It seems that many boxes could be ticked at this point. </p><ul><li>Is it better to have fixed or variable coin denominations in a CoinJoin?</li><li>How big should a CoinJoin be for variable denominations to make sense?</li><li>Are variable coin denominations the best way to get rid of change output in CoinJoins? </li></ul><p>It goes without saying that CoinJoin rounds interconnectivity should not be tolerable in any circumstances regardless of whether coin denominations are different or if the CoinJoin is a large or small transaction, right? Well, here again, there is an important nuance to understand. </p><h2>Coinjoin Rounds Interconnectivity </h2><p>It is claimed that registering inputs from past shared CoinJoins into new CoinJoins is ill-advised in all cases. Participants from mutually shared past CoinJoins do not seem to benefit from mixing together in other CoinJoins. It seems harmful to privacy, and is often criticized. </p><p>What if a CoinJoin is large and some registered inputs come from multiple other CoinJoins, each being also downstream from multiple other CoinJoins? In such a case, participants remixing together are still improving their privacy despite coming from a shared past CoinJoin. If each CoinJoin is large enough, the participants are not required to remix multiple times, though they can if they want to further increase their anonymity sets. </p><p>If many large intertwined CoinJoins are involved, the resulting anonymity set should provide plenty of plausible deniability, despite sharing past CoinJoins as origin of funds. </p><ul><li>Is CoinJoin rounds interconnectivity, which is sharing mutual past CoinJoins, a bad thing on its own?</li><li>How large should a CoinJoin be for remixing with other past inputs to be considered safe?</li></ul><h2>Personal Full Node</h2><p>Should you run your own bitcoin full node when participating in CoinJoins? On the surface, it seems like a great idea, and it usually is. Some CoinJoin implementations allow that, while others outright require it. Others won’t allow you to even use your own full node. Is that to condemn absolutely? If you’ve read until now, you should know that the answer is nuanced and opens up a deep rabbit hole to be explored later.</p><p>Running your own full node comes with usability tradeoffs, and may not add much privacy protection if not all users do it. Running your own node may even give you a false sense of security and privacy if few CoinJoin participants do it, which can be deeply harmful. If Tor is used as an anonymous way to CoinJoin (and we’ll leave it as that for now), then using a trusted full node to broadcast the CoinJoin transaction can be fine as the default. Lots of nuances, and of course, don’t trust, verify. </p><p>There are some essential questions to ask so as to not fall in the trap of privacy virtue signaling. </p><ul><li>Does the CoinJoin implementation allow to run full nodes, require them by default or don’t allow them? </li><li>If personal full nodes are not mandatory, what are the privacy shields in place? i.e. Tor, block filters, etc… </li><li>If I run my own full node, but expect most users to use a default trusted node to CoinJoin, how does that affect my privacy? Can the coordinator de-anonymize me?</li></ul><p>With privacy concerns, it is always important to understand what you’re trying to protect, and against whom. Running a full node and using it with your own wallet is the right way to use bitcoin as it allows you to verify your wallet balance and broadcast transactions to the network without trusting anyone. But when it comes to CoinJoins, there is usually a coordinator in charge. What does the coordinator do and how is it selected? Read on.</p><h2>The Coordinator</h2><p>The CoinJoin coordinator is in charge of having every participant register their inputs and outputs, and sign the collaborative transaction before broadcasting it. Most CoinJoin implementations default on a central coordinator, which is a single point of failure. Up until now, this has been an accepted tradeoff in most bitcoin communities. Can a central CoinJoin coordinator fail? Absolutely. Other implementations allow anyone to be a coordinator for each different CoinJoin, though there are other sets of trade offs here that will be discussed later. </p><p>Coinjoins being non-custodial, no loss of funds could occur if any coordinator would fail. The coordinator should never know more than what everyone knows publicly on the bitcoin network. Why? If a coordinator knows more than what is publicly available, a CoinJoin coordinator becomes a honeypot with highly sensitive data that can be exploited against bitcoiners trusting the service. </p><p>You should never trust a CoinJoin coordinator. If a CoinJoin coordinator cannot be evil, good. If it can be evil, it will be eventually, out of errors, omissions, coercion or outright dishonesty. </p><p>An example of sensitive user data would be XPUBs, which undeniably leak all the information about a wallet, its addresses, including past, current and future bitcoin transactions. Another example would be the ratio between users running their own full nodes and users trusting the coordinator’s full node to broadcast CoinJoins, as it could de-anonymize users running their own nodes, and therefore deterministically know the links between their inputs and outputs. This is yet another nuanced topic, which would require further investigation and discussion. </p><ul><li>Does the coordinator know more than what is publicly available on the bitcoin network? </li><li>Do users leak sensitive data to the coordinator, such as their XPUB or whether or not they run their own full nodes?</li><li>Does the coordinator claim that users should trust them using legal defense mechanisms? (i.e. warrant canaries, regulatory arbitrage, etc…)</li></ul><h2>Fees</h2><p>Bottom line, who pays for what in CoinJoins? These bitcoin transactions can be expensive and sometimes fee structures are unclear for bitcoiners. It’s hard to know how much good privacy will cost you or even if you are getting any privacy out of it. Some CoinJoin implementations allow a single input to buy its privacy from other inputs who only participate for free to increase their own anonymity set. Getting paid to CoinJoin? With patience, yes. </p><p>Some models rely on shared fees where only some UTXOs pay fees while others don’t. Other models rely on inviting an ever growing number of new clear inputs (not mixed yet) to fund the existing CoinJoins for remixing inputs that do not have high enough anonymity levels. Some models seem unsustainable over the long term while others are naïve, or way too expensive for most users. </p><p>And what fees are we talking about? Well usually, inputs participating in CoinJoins pay both a coordinator fee or taker fee, (the service fee to get some level of anonymity) and the bitcoin network fees. In particular CoinJoin models, these fees get waived in certain circumstances. The economics of CoinJoins is a deep rabbit hole which requires further investigation for a much deeper understanding. </p><ul><li>Who pays for what in a CoinJoin? What are all the fees? </li><li>What are the incentives of the CoinJoin coordinator? </li><li>Are all CoinJoin rounds paid for or is there any free remix?</li></ul><p>Having read thus far, the hope is that bitcoiners shopping around for CoinJoins would not necessarily have all of the answers, but the right questions to ask. A mental model or framework to evaluate different CoinJoin implementations can be quite helpful for anyone who is considering using CoinJoins to reclaim their privacy on bitcoin. Sorting through the noise of social media requires intellectual honesty and the right evaluation system rigorously applied. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thibaud Maréchal.

Only 0.5% of Nigerian citizens are estimated to be using the digital Naira, per a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-25/shunned-digital-currency-looks-for-street-credibility-in-nigeria">Bloomberg</a> report. Now, it seeks to increase the usage of it through regulations like this. <br><br></p><p>Bitcoiners have been outspoken opponents of CBDCs, describing various weaknesses that point to Bitcoin being the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/rise-fall-central-bank-digital-currency">superior</a> alternative. CBDCs, Bitcoiners <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/the-dangerous-implications-of-cbdcs">argue</a>, can lead to outsized surveillance of the population, total <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/digital-dollar-threat-civil-liberties">control</a> of people’s money and complete lack of sovereignty when it comes to the debasement of value of a currency. <br><br>Beyond that, Bitcoiners have argued that not only are CBDCs inherently bad, but their success is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/us-cbdc-narrative-is-a-fantasy">entirely improbable</a>, as the infrastructure necessary to implement them as envisioned simply doesn’t exist and is not going to be made by incapable governments. Some <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/stablecoin-monster-cbdc-red-herring">have even pointed to stablecoins</a> as potential vehicles for carrying the attributes of CBDCs, while theorizing that CBDCs simply distract from the incentive perversion created by stablecoins. <br><br>Developments like these ATM limits point to the desperation of governments as they seek to hold their citizens within the boundaries of government monetary systems.

By looking at on-chain realized profit and loss data, we can see that this was true for many forced-sellers of bitcoin. Before any bitcoin price bottom, a hallmark sign that you want to see is extended periods of forced selling, capitulation and rise in realized losses. One way to view this is by looking at the sum of realized profit and loss for each month relative to bitcoin’s total market cap. We saw these bottom signals in November 2022, and similarly in the July 2022 Terra/LUNA crash, March 2020 COVID fear and December 2018 cycle bottom capitulation events.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Net realized profit/loss over market cap</figcaption>
    </figure><p>Looking at the 2018 cycle, the end was marked by excess realized losses, although this was much different with the forced liquidations and cascades of private balance sheet leverage and paper bitcoin unwinding that we saw this year.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>30-day cumulative net realized profit/loss</figcaption>
    </figure><p>We’ve talked about the current drawdown in bitcoin’s price and how that compares to previous cycles many times over the last few months. Another way to look at cyclical drawdowns is to focus on bitcoin’s realized market capitalization — the average cost basis of the network which tracks the latest price where each UTXO moved last. With price being more volatile, realized price is a more stable view of bitcoin’s growth and capital inflows. The realized market capitalization is now down 17.33% which is significantly higher than 2015 and 2018 cycles of 14.13% and 16.51%, respectively.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin realized cap drawdown</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As for duration, we’re 176 total days into the price being below bitcoin’s realized price. Those aren’t consecutive days as price can temporarily go above realized price, but price trends below realized price in bear market periods. For context, trends in 2018 were short-lived at around 134 days and the trends in 2014-15 lasted 384 days. </p><p>On one hand, bitcoin’s realized market capitalization has taken a significant hit in the previous round of capitulation. That’s a promising bottom-like sign. On the other hand, there’s a case to be made that price being below realized price could easily last another six months from historical cycles and the lack of capitulation in equity markets is still a major headwind and concern.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Net unrealized profit/loss</figcaption>
    </figure><p>As per the net-unrealized-profit/loss (NUPL) ratio, we are firmly in the capitulation phase. NUPL can be calculated by subtracting the realized cap from market cap and dividing the result by the market cap, as described in this <a href="https://medium.com/@adamant_capital/a-primer-on-bitcoin-investor-sentiment-and-changes-in-saving-behavior-a5fb70109d32">article</a> authored by By Tuur Demeester, Tamás Blummer and Michiel Lescrauwaet. </p><p>There is no denying it: For bitcoin-native cycles, we are firmly in the capitulation phase. Currently, only 56% of circulating supply was last moved on-chain in profit. On a two-week moving average basis, under 50% supply was last moved above the current exchange rate, which is something that has only ever happened in the depths of previous bear-market lows.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>When thinking of the bitcoin exchange rate, the numerator side of the equation is historically cheap. The Bitcoin network continues to produce a block approximately every 10 minutes in an unabated fashion, as hash rate ticks higher and as the ledger offers an immutable settlement layer for global value. The speculation, leverage and fraud of the previous cycle is washing to shore and bitcoin continues to exchange hands.</p><p>Bitcoin is objectively cheap relative to its all time history and adoption phases. The real question over the immediate future is the denominator. We have talked at length about the global liquidity cycle and its current track. Despite being historically cheap, bitcoin is not immune to a sudden strengthening in the dollar because nothing truly is. Exchange rates are relative and if the dollar is squeezing higher, then everything else will subsequently fall — at least momentarily. As always, position sizing and time preference is key for all. </p><p>As for the catalyst for a surge higher in the dollar denominator of the bitcoin exchange rate (BTC/USD), there are 80 trillion possible catalysts…</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/financialjuice/status/1599735857816240129"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><figure>

Bitcoin emerged as a response to this global crisis of legitimacy.</p><p>Now, more than a decade later, the economic damage created by the pandemic has triggered a further breakdown of the system. As the Federal Reserve’s infinite money printing creates high inflation, Bitcoin steadily increases its popularity as a safe haven. </p><p>At the same time, as the old economy is being destroyed, the leading global institutions have stepped forward to reboot the entire system. The key organization, the World Economic Forum (WEF), with the theme of “<a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">The Great Reset</a>,” <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_CBDC_Technology_Considerations_2021.pdf">prepares for</a> the rollout of the central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).</p><h2>CBDC Versus Bitcoin</h2><p>Agustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpNnTuK5JJU"> explains</a> CBDCs as programmable money that gives issuers the power to control every transaction. Using these powers, issuers can restrict what ordinary people are allowed to spend money on.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/resist_05/status/1585028310748499969"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>In response to central banks creating their own digital currencies, the original cypherpunk and cryptographer, Adam Back tweeted:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1517843949091799042"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1517843949091799042"><em>Link to embedded Tweet here</em></a>. </p><p>Now, Bitcoin and CBDCs, two different types of digital currency with contrasting features, race toward a global adoption. The crux of this competition involves different visions of the world. The outcome of this race will determine the future of humanity.</p><h2>Shift Of Authority</h2><p>The crisis of legitimacy triggered by the financial panic of 2008 signaled the demise of the Western liberal democracy. This has begun to create a shift in the locus of authority in our society. </p><p>The idea of democracy that inspired the birth of the United States was based on a humanistic worldview. In the past, authority was placed in the gods, and the sacred text. People sought answers from the external. They turned to religion, the Bible and Popes for their decisions. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>A move towards democracy brought a shift in values. It placed authority in human hands, putting emphasis on the individual. People who were seeking behavioral norms outside of themselves began to rely on their personal experience.</p><h2>Threat To Democracy</h2><p>Yuval Noah Harari, Israeli public intellectual and historian,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> talks about</a> how, in this crisis of democracy, a threat to the humanistic worldview is now emerging from laboratories and research departments in places like Silicon Valley.</p><p>Harrai, who is<a href="https://www.weforum.org/people/yuval-noah-harari"> a lead advisor</a> to Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum (WEF),<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> points out</a> ways in which science is challenging the story of humanism. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs">explains</a> that scientists are saying there is no such thing as free will and that freedom is just another myth, an empty term that humans have invented. He defines feelings as biochemical processes of calculation and contends that there is no reason to consider them the highest authority in the world.</p><h2>Techno-Religion</h2><p>Harari, who has been<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-loves-sapiens-2019-2?op=1"> praised by</a> the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, and celebrated by tech workers in Silicon Valley, explains how in this twilight of democracy, authority is now once again moving away from humans. This time, he states it is not some gods above the clouds that control human destiny, but algorithms, and data in the clouds of the Amazon and big tech giants.</p><p>He<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGt5xklfmsU"> describes</a> a new revolution happening around this shift of authority. It is led by a “techno-religion”, the ideology that technology provides salvation. He<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3158&amp;v=g6BK5Q_Dblo&amp;feature=youtu.be"> explains</a> that this techno-religion is a data religion within which “data and information becomes a supreme source of authority and of meaning in the world.” It makes us believe that technology knows more about us than we do ourselves. It tells us, “Don’t listen to feeling or gut intuition. Just turn to data.” </p><p>Acting as a spokesperson for this new sect of techno religion, Harari<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ChHc5jhZxs"> predicts</a> a coming of a future without humanity. He states that humans like you and I will disappear and that the earth will be dominated by very different kinds of beings or entities. Under the new authority of algorithms, Harari<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuL3wlodJC8"> describes</a> how human beings are viewed as no longer spiritual souls, but become “hackable animals.”</p><h2>Warning For Humanity</h2><p>Some saw what was coming and warned about the potential machine takeover of the world and the elimination of human beings.</p><figure>

The mysterious creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto recognized that this system was not adequate by itself to secure the value of freedom and the place of individuals as supreme authority in the system.</p><p>Those who gained control over the production of money have created an economic system that works to their advantage. Concentration of economic power in a few hands turned democracy into a system of control. With sophisticated methods of persuasion, through use of propaganda and PR under the guise of democracy, the population was subjected to manipulation of their feelings.</p><p>By challenging the monopoly of money, Bitcoin — cypherpunks’ holy grail — has enabled economic liberty. With the principle of “don’t trust, verify,” this technology places the source of legitimacy with individuals, for the first time in history. </p><p>Rather than residing in the clouds of tech giants, authority is now descending into the human heart.</p><h2>Revival Of Humanism</h2><figure>

    </figure><p>The birth of Bitcoin has helped creativity and freedom of expression to flourish, creating the resurgence of the arts. It now inspires a new renaissance of humanism.</p><p>Before the Renaissance, history was seen as being shaped by divine forces. With the advent of the Renaissance, beginning in the 14th century in Italy, this view shifted.</p><p>The Renaissance placed human beings at the center of life. A man was regarded as a partner in the creation of Gods, to actively engage in shaping the course of their own lives.</p><p>Just as the Renaissance placed emphasis on the individual, now, the Bitcoin Renaissance 2.0 creates sovereign individuals, enabling human beings to truly come alive.</p><h2>A Path Of Salvation Via Proof-Of-Work</h2><p>People from all nations, with different backgrounds, started to align themselves with humanistic ideals that exist at the core of Bitcoin. Through meetups and <a href="http://b.tc/conference">conferences</a>, they are now finding one another. They begin to speak the same language and share values. </p><p>Transcending their cultural differences, they have become Bitcoiners. They are bearers of humanity, beginning to claim the source of authority in human imagination.</p><p>This is now creating a humanistic movement, generating a force strong enough to counter the techno revolution.</p><p>Between Bitcoin and CBDCs, we are now presented with a choice.</p><figure>

Through each individual voluntarily participating in a network of consensus, each of us can engage in validating our own truth.</p><p>While a path of technological salvation moves a society toward the post-human era, Bitcoin, pro-human technology inspires each individual to create a new world of humanism.</p><h2>El Salvador (“The Savior”)</h2><p>El Salvador, the country that first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">declared bitcoin legal tender</a>, has become a center of this Renaissance 2.0.

Direction: San Salvador. The Bitcoin community is about to gather here for Adopting Bitcoin, the final major Bitcoin conference of the year, but certainly not the least. Friends and Bitcoiners from around the world are flying into the country to work together and promote Bitcoin adoption. Who knows how many of them knew much about this country before the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-approves-bitcoin-legal-tender">“Ley Bitcoin” was implemented</a>?</p><p>Before returning to San Salvador, we made a pit stop in the village of Ataco — we were invited to participate in the handing out of a Bitcoin diploma, an actual qualification in Bitcoin and financial education that students in (currently) seven public schools in El Salvador receive after participating in a course offered by <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/38-high-school-students-in-el-salvador-earned-a-bitcoin-diploma">My First Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>Less than a year ago, during our first trip to El Salvador living in Bitcoin only, we attended a meeting between the first principal to join the Bitcoin diploma project, government representatives and the project's founders.

Because of this, we decided to do something we had not yet done here in El Salvador and we went to Starbucks. Last year, we saw dozens of videos on Twitter of bitcoin transactions at this chain in the country and felt confident this coffee shop would our sats. </p><p>“Two cappuccinos and two chocolate muffins please,” we said. “We will pay in bitcoin!” </p><p>Silence. The waitress' lost look meant only one thing: she had never used Bitcoin before and had no idea how to do accept our proposed payment. Her colleague came to her aid but she could not remember the password to their Chivo wallet. No dice. So, we went to the McDonald's next door, with the same intent. </p><p><br>That is where the real surprise took place: Not even the McDonald's manager remembered the password for the Chivo app. Less than a year ago, the same establishment was studded with illuminated “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/pkq91j/mcdonalds_el_salvador_now_mcdonalds_everywhere/">pay for your burger in bitcoin!</a>' signs. Unbelievable. <br><br></p><p>We remembered that the restaurant’s automated checkouts could create a bitcoin QR code without requiring any password and we asked the staff to try it. It worked! But what a struggle.</p><p>Education is everything. </p><p>The day before, we witnessed the final test of 16- and 17-year-olds who proved perfectly capable of creating and managing new, non-custodial bitcoin wallets, importing them into new devices, making on-chain transactions and monitoring them in a Bitcoin explorer. Less than 24 hours later, we found ourselves drinking watered-down coffee at a venue whose staff could not remember an application PIN.</p><section><figure>

It is good to see so many friendly faces again, from all over the world. The content was of a high standard and audience participation was good.</p><p>The panel I participated in was titled "<a href="https://pretalx.com/adopting-bitcoin-2022/schedule/">Orange Pilling The World’s Masses</a>" — as if that were easy. I spent the night taking notes:</p><ul><li>I don't like the term “orange pilling,” though I wish that teaching Bitcoin was as easy as swallowing a pill: You swallow it and boom, you're a Bitcoiner. I consider it a misleading term. Studying and understanding Bitcoin is a long, time-consuming process.</li><li>Bitcoin is the greatest human rights tool ever invented. It was so long before “have fun staying poor,” and its price does not even matter to me. Price is just a consequence of its technology and the social revolution it is bringing. In El Salvador, where a person understands that bitcoin is also fundamental to their own survival, they understand everything. That, for me, is the “orange pilling” moment.</li><li>What wallet do I recommend downloading for orange pilling? It depends on who I'm talking to. If it's someone completely new to the field, I go with Wallet Of Satoshi. The Lightning transactions there are amazing. True, it is completely custodial (not your keys, not your coin!), but the user experience is amazing. There are just two buttons and it's instant. It works like a charm. But if I talk to someone who already knows something about the technology, I go with Blue Wallet. In this application, you have two different wallets: the non-custodial bitcoin wallet (of which you then own the private key) and one for using the Lightning Network. I think it's very useful to make the difference between Layer 1 and Layer 2 clear. If you want to pay for a coffee with the Lightning Network, you literally have to move your bitcoin from Layer 1 to Layer 2. </li><li>In our work, we always have to keep in mind that it is really very early. As Bitcoiners, we would like to see this technology applied to the world as soon as possible. The truth is that history itself teaches us that this will not be possible. Think of credit cards: Frank McNamara invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diners_Club_International">Diners Club</a>, the world's first credit card, in 1950. It took a notable amount of time after this for credit cards to become truly relevant. Bitcoin, in addition to being a disruptive technology, is a philosophical achievement. That's why so many pre-coiners don't think they need it and that it doesn't solve any problems for them. We have to be patient and allow this creature more time to develop. </li><li>When will we reach hyperbitcoinization? I always wonder what is meant by this word. The diffusion of a technology to transmit value instantaneously and without boundaries? To me that is not hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin will allow us to vote in a distributed network, to certify in a distributed network. It will enable us sooner or later to disintermediate any trust process. Trust is obsolete.</li></ul><p>The notes worked and the panel went very well. There were roars of applause and lots of compliments.</p><section><figure>

All around us were tropical vegetation, incredible sunsets and exotic animals. People from dozens of different countries have gathered here. To sharpen your hearing was to perceive a Babel of different languages and accents. All of this happened solely because of the intuition of a pseudonymous scientist — someone who dared to dream so big as to come up with something capable of changing the world. </p><p>If this thing, in itself, is not incredible, I really don't know what is. </p><p>The truth is that Bitcoin has already changed our lives, irreversibly. And it has also already done so for so many people who are able to take this idea and embed it into their jobs or even to invent a new job from scratch. There are many such examples here. Sure, lots of technical people, like developers, journalists and entrepreneurs. But also many more creative people. The young man from India who decides to travel the world in Bitcoin, 40 countries in 400 days. The American couple who manages to teach while having fun. The journalist who, once he falls down the rabbit hole, devotes himself exclusively to Bitcoin. The driver who, thanks to Bitcoiners, sees his business scale like he never could have imagined. The small coffee producer who manages to export by getting paid in an instant and without onerous fees. </p><p>We could go on listing similar cases for hours. These are small things, let's be clear. And perhaps they are isolated examples. And it may take resourcefulness and a touch of madness to make your dreams into realities with Bitcoin. But it is already possible. Bitcoin works. It changes the lives of those who can seize opportunities and all that it takes is having that spark.</p><p>The nights in El Zonte were hot and humid at this time. The sun set quickly behind the horizon. We all met at a hotel called Palo Verde for a conference party organized by IBEX. All of our friends were there, those we love. We had something to eat, chatted for a while, and then the music started. There is nothing more liberating than dancing on the beach, feet in the sand. It was super hot, but the dance floor was still crowded. </p><p>At the entrance we were given tickets for a raffle and prizes were to be drawn. Someone in our group won a very good bottle of whiskey. That's the end. As the amber liquid trickled down our throats, we already anticipated the hangover headache. When the music ended, it was time for goodbyes.</p><p>The road home for us translates into a long walk on the shoreline, under an impressive starry sky, barefoot, with the waves placidly bathing our ankles.</p><p>Pura vida.</p><section><figure>

Bitcoin is the modern answer for international economics.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Ansel Lindner, a bitcoin and financial markets researcher and the host of the “Bitcoin &amp; Markets” and “Fed Watch” podcasts.</em></p><p>Two forces have dominated the globe economically and politically for the last 75 years: globalization and trust-based money. However, the time for both of these forces has passed, and their waning will bring about a great reset of the global order.</p><p>But this is not the global, Marxist kind of Great Reset promoted by <a href="https://www.weforum.org/great-reset">Klaus Schwab</a> and those who attend Davos. This is an emergent, market-driven reset characterized by a multipolar world and a new monetary system.</p><h2>Globalization Is Ending</h2><p>The first reaction I usually get to my claim that the age of hyper-globalization is ending is flippant disbelief. People have so completely integrated the environment of the dying global order into their economic understanding that they cannot fathom a world where the cost-to-benefit analysis of globalization is different. Even after COVID-19 exposed the fragility of complex supply chains, like when the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/04/why-were-running-out-of-masks-in-the-coronavirus-crisis/609757/">U.S. very nearly ran out of surgical masks and basic medications</a> or when the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/how-covid-19-caused-a-global-shortage-of-semiconductors-computer-chips.html">world struggled to source semiconductors</a>, people have yet to realize the shift that is happening. </p><p>Is it that hard to imagine that the businessmen who designed such fragile, overcomplicated production processes didn’t properly weigh the risks?</p><p>All that is needed to break globalization is for risk-adjusted costs to change a few percentage points and outweigh the benefits. The pennies saved by outsourcing numerous tasks to numerous jurisdictions will no longer outweigh the possibility of complete collapse of supply chains.</p><p>These concerns about fragile supply chains did not disappear as horrible COVID-19 policies ended. Now, they have shifted to concerns about trade wars and real wars. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/02/15/us-china-economic-financial-decoupling-controls-restrictions-sanctions/">U.S. trade sanctions against China</a>, the Russian conflict with NATO-proxy Ukraine and subsequent sanctions, the <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/07/18/why-u.s.-needs-to-say-less-and-do-more-on-taiwan-pub-87468">seemingly-erratic U.S. position on Taiwan</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJG04pElY7I">coronation of Xi Jinping and his Marxist revival</a>, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/traces-explosives-found-nord-stream-pipelines-sweden-says-2022-11-18/">Nord Stream sabotage</a>, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/countries-split-plastics-treaty-focus-un-talks-close-2022-12-03/">clear split of international consensus in the UN</a> and even the weaponization of these international institutions, and most recently, the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20221202-turkey-s-operation-against-kurds-in-syria-risks-reviving-is-group">Turkish ground offensive versus the Kurds</a> — all these things should be interpreted as a rise in costs.</p><p>Gone is the time when complex supply chains were robust against typical risks. The risks today are much more systemic. Sure, there were skirmishes around the world and disagreements among parliaments, but great powers did not openly threaten one another’s spheres of influence. Risk-adjusted costs and benefits to globalization have radically changed.</p><h2>Credit Doesn’t Like Conflict</h2><p>Very closely related to deglobalization of supply chains is deglobalization of credit markets. The same factors that affect business peoples’ physical, risk-adjusted costs and benefits are also felt by bankers. </p><p>Banks don’t want to be exposed to the risk of war or sanctions wrecking their borrowers. In the current environment of deglobalization and rising risks to international trade, banks will naturally pull back on lending to those associated activities. Instead, banks will fund safer projects, likely fully-domestic or friend-shoring opportunities. The natural reaction by banks to this risky global environment will be credit contraction.</p><p>The deglobalization of supply chains and credit will be as closely linked on the way down as they were on the way up. It will start slowly, but pick up speed. A feedback loop of rising risk leading to shorter supply chains and less credit creation. </p><h2>The Credit-Based U.S. Dollar</h2><p>The prevailing form of money in the world is the credit-based U.S. dollar. <a href="https://www.suomenpankki.fi/en/learn-economy/learn-economy/what-is-money/">Every dollar is created through debt</a>, making every dollar someone else’s debt. Money is printed out of thin air in the process of making a loan. </p><p>This is different from pure fiat money. When fiat money is printed, the balance sheet of the printer adds assets alone. However, in a credit-based system, when money is printed in a loan, the printer creates an asset <em>and</em> a liability. The borrower’s balance sheet then has an offsetting liability and asset, respectively. Every dollar (or euro or yen, for that matter) is therefore an asset and a liability, and the loan that created that dollar is both an asset and a liability.</p><p>This system works extremely well if two factors are present. One, highly-productive uses of new credit are available, and two, a relative lack of exogenous shocks to the global economy. Change either of these things and a breakdown is bound to occur.</p><p>This dual nature of credit-based money is at the root of both the <a href="https://money.visualcapitalist.com/buying-power-us-dollar-century/">dollar’s spectacular rise in the 20th century</a>, and the coming monetary reset. As global trust and supply chains break down, the comingling of assets in banks becomes more risky. Russia found this out the hard way when the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/russian-bank-foreign-reserve-billions-frozen-sanctions-n1292153">West confiscated its reserves of dollars held in banks abroad</a>. How is trust possible in that sort of environment? When credit-based money’s creation is based on trust... Houston, we have a problem.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Role In The Future</h2><p>Luckily, we have experience with a world that doesn’t trust itself — i.e., the entire history of man prior to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II">1945</a>. Back then, we were on a gold standard for reasons which included all those that bitcoiners are very familiar with (gold scores highly in the characteristics that make good money), but also because it minimized trust between great powers.</p><p>Gold lost its mantle for one reason — and you’ve probably never heard this anywhere before: because the global economic, political and innovation environment post-WWII created an extremely fertile soil for credit. Trust was easy, the major powers were humbled and all joined the new international institutions under the security umbrella of the U.S. The Iron Curtain provided a stark separation between zones of trust economically, but after it fell, there was a period of roughly 20 years where the world sang “kumbaya” because new credit was still extremely productive in the old Soviet block and China.</p><p>Today, we are facing the opposite sort of scenario: Global trust is eroding and credit has exploited all productive low-hanging fruit, forcing us into a period that demands neutral money. </p><p>The world will soon find itself split between regions/alliances of influence. A British bank will trust a U.S. bank, where a Chinese bank will not. To bridge this gap, we need money that everyone can hold and respect.</p><h2>Gold Vs. Bitcoin</h2><p>Gold would be the first choice here, if not for bitcoin. This is because gold has several drawbacks. First, gold is owned mainly by those groups who are losing trust in one another, namely the governments of the world. Much of the gold is held in the United States. Therefore, gold is unevenly distributed.</p><p>Second, gold’s physical nature, once a positive holding profligate governments in check, is now a weakness because it cannot be transported or assayed nearly as efficiently as bitcoin.</p><p>Lastly, gold is not programmable. Bitcoin is a neutral, decentralized protocol that can be tapped for any number of innovations. The Lightning Network and sidechains are just two examples of how Bitcoin can be programmed to increase its utility.</p><p>As globalization of both trade and credit is breaking down, the economic environment favors a return to a form of money that doesn’t depend on trust between major powers. Bitcoin is the modern answer.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ansel Lindner.

This comes in addition to an angel round led by Factor[e].</p><p>The investment is intended to support further expansion of bitcoin mines across Africa. In regards to this mission, the CEO of Gridless Erik Hersman said, “Africa needs affordable electricity. Our work in supporting renewable energy mini grid developers fills a gap, helping developers expand faster, be more sustainable, and serve thousands of households. This investment, and the high caliber of partners that are coming alongside us, means that we can accelerate our rollout knowing that we have both the capital and strategic support required.”<br><br>In its first year of operation, Gridless has entered five different project contract pilots in rural Kenya alongside HydroBox, an African hydroelectric energy company. Three of these pilots are now operational. Gridless finances the construction and managers the operation of the data centers in these rural communities. The company has now set its sights on expansion into other areas in East Africa. <br><br>In regards to their decision to lead this funding round alongside Block, Alyse Killeen, managing partner at Stillmark, stated, “Stillmark is focused on investing in companies that are helping to advance the Bitcoin ecosystem in ways that offer sustainable value and solutions to many. Gridless does this by bringing a socially and environmentally conscious approach to bitcoin mining, one that provides tangible benefits by way of access to electricity for communities in rural parts of East Africa.”</p><p>Thomas Templeton, lead for bitcoin mining and wallet at Block explained the company’s view too, adding that “Gridless represents a close strategic alignment with our vision of ensuring the bitcoin network increasingly leverages clean energy, in combination with bitcoin computational centers around the world.” <br></p><p>According to the press release, in 2020 more than 50% of Africans were without electricity. Gridless identifies bitcoin mining as playing a pivotal role in revolutionizing Africa’s access to cheap and reliable electricity. The release corroborates Gridless’ goal of increasing this access, as it explains, “The electricity generated from these sites is prioritized for community electrification and to support community uplift business such as containerized cold storage for local farmers, battery charging stations for electric motorcycles, and public WiFi points. After those needs are met, the remaining electricity capacity is used to power the bitcoin computational mining datacenter.” <br></p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMDI2MTUyOTY3Nzc1NDUz/green-sustainable-bitcoin-mining.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Path To A Bitcoin Economy: Decentralized Bitcoin-Backed Credit]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin-backed credit built with DeFi represents a stronger and more practical vision of "bitcoin free banking" originally described in 2010 by Hal Finney.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/decentralized-bitcoin-backed-credit</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/decentralized-bitcoin-backed-credit</guid><category><![CDATA[Stablecoins]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Credit]]></category><category><![CDATA[sovryn]]></category><category><![CDATA[defi]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[David Seroy]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 02:39:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoin-backed credit built with DeFi represents a stronger and more practical vision of "bitcoin free banking" originally described in 2010 by Hal Finney.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by David Seroy, Founder and President of Old North Capital Fund.</em></p><p><em>It is the author's opinion that credit-based, bitcoin-backed dollars will act as the bridge connecting bitcoin, dollars, the Lightning Network, validity roll-ups, and elements of free banking in a hyperbitcoinized world.</em></p><hr><p>Bitcoin and the dollar are symbiotic. Like yin and yang, bitcoin and dollars provide balance. On the one hand, bitcoin acts as a counterparty-free, decentralized, scarce, digital bearer asset to hedge against excessive credit creation. On the other hand, the free market has an insatiable desire for issuing credit-based dollars which fill the role of both a 'stable" unit of account and an elastic monetary layer.</p><p>Thus the market has competing desires for both a fixed supply asset, as well as a monetary unit of account which is “stable" and can expand in response to economic demands. This reality leads us to believe the path to hyperbitcoinization will naturally be paved with an array of credit-based, bitcoin-backed dollars underpinned by bitcoin collateral. Nik Bhatia describes a similar vision in his book, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkW31xHP95o">Layered Money</a>.” Put simply, credit money will exist because the market demands it, but it will be backed by and therefore limited by bitcoin's fixed supply also because the market demands it. The net result is a synergistic fly-wheel will begin to form between the demand for bitcoin and bitcoin-backed dollars.</p><p>In 2010, <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.msg34211#msg34211">Hal Finney described such a vision</a> where bitcoin-backed banks could "issue their own digital cash currency, redeemable for bitcoins." This idea was based on George Selgin’s Free Banking research. Eric Yakes summarizes Free Banking in his article <a href="https://yakes.io/bitcoin-banking-systems-full-reserve-vs-free-banking/">"Bitcoin Banking Systems</a>":</p><p>“Imagine a world in which banks were allowed to competitively issue their own private monies and markets were allowed to sort out whether these monies were valuable. This system is built on the assumptions that (1) information transparency is high; (2) it exists within a competitive market environment; and (3) it is subject to minimal regulations. If such a system emerged and was predicated upon voluntary agreement and exchange amongst market actors, who's to say that it would not be just?”</p><p>Unfortunately, none of the three criteria can be met in the existing legacy system, and therefore we are unlikely to ever see a true bitcoin "free banking" revolution via the legacy system. Specifically:</p><ul><li>Information Transparency: Large financial institutions can and already do issue their own private dollars, but they exist on shadow ledgers outside the purview of regulators. The inability to regulate these shadow ledgers prevents any sort of broad information transparency from ever existing in the legacy banking system.</li></ul><ul><li>Competitiveness: Getting approval for a banking license is a tedious, lengthy, and highly costly endeavor. It is very much restricted to a select few and is therefore not competitive. </li></ul><ul><li>Regulation: Banks have never been more highly regulated, as a result of the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (“GFC”). There is no reason to believe this will change. Even if it does, there is no assurance it would last.</li></ul><p>However, Decentralized Finance (“DeFi”) could circumvent these issues in a “<a href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2020/Oct-2020/How-Hayek-predicted-Bitcoin-and-the-rise-of-crypto">sly round-about way</a>" à la Friedrich Hayek. While much of DeFi is riddled with grift and gambling, a small subset of it is equipped to usher in the bitcoin free banking movement. </p><p>The exact mechanics could vary by protocol and would be defined by smart contracts. However, functionally it would operate as Finney originally described. Consider this excerpt from Finney's <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2500.0">original forum post</a> and swap in "protocol," “smart contract," and “stablecoin":</p><p>“Different banks (protocols) can have different policies (smart contracts), some more aggressive, some more conservative. Some would be fractional reserve, while others may be 100% Bitcoin-backed. Interest rates may vary. Cash (Stablecoins) from some banks (protocols) may trade at a discount to that from others.”</p><h2>Advantages Of DeFi Over Legacy Free Banking</h2><p>There are many advantages to building these "bitcoin free banks" aka protocols on DeFi over the legacy system:</p><ul><li>Transparent: Stablecoins issued via DeFi would exist on-chain, meaning on a transparent immutable ledger. Specifically, outstanding claims and underlying collateral would always be public and cryptographically auditable. Building on-chain is a superior form of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/proof-of-reserves-industry-standard">proof of reserves</a>. </li></ul><ul><li>Permissionless: DeFi removes gatekeepers just as free banking envisioned. For builders, anyone technically can create and launch a new protocol. Thus we could see a Cambrian explosion of bitcoin-backed credit experiments. For individual users no inherent restrictions such as KYC would prevent anyone around the world from interacting with the protocol.</li></ul><ul><li>Non-Custodial: With DeFi, users can maintain control of their own keys (subject to the terms of the smart contract) instead of entrusting them to centralized entities who may rehypothecate the assets—or even honest actors exposed to regulatory capture who may be coerced into giving up the keys. </li></ul><ul><li>Better Terms: By dis-intermediating banks, users can create superior terms for themselves. One such example is "Zero" (described below), which allows users to borrow stablecoins at a 0% interest rate against bitcoin collateral, with no set loan term and strong capital efficiency.</li></ul><h2>Examples In The Wild</h2><p>Active examples of bitcoin free banking would be <a href="https://fuji.money/">Fuji</a> built on the Liquid sidechain and Sovryn's <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/blog/if-bitcoin-is-magic-internet-money-zero-is-magic-internet-borrowing">Zero</a> protocol built on the RSK sidechain, both of which function as a <a href="https://medium.com/iovlabs-innovation-stories/building-the-most-secure-permissionless-and-uncensorable-bitcoin-peg-b5dc7020e5ec">quasi-decentralized</a> borrowing and stablecoin services. Zero specifically allows users to provide collateral in the form of RBTC (a pegged version of bitcoin on the Rootstock "RSK" sidechain) into a smart contract and subsequently issue dollar-denominated stablecoins to themselves.</p><p>The stablecoins technically has]ve no cost to issue (Specifically, the protocol has no cost to mint tokens, but users are charged an origination fee to borrow, which normally sits at 0.5%), and thus zero interest, because the stablecoins are minted rather than diverted from another use. This is similar to the way free banks functioned when issuing private bank notes against their collateral, except the newly issued tokens have a value pegged to the dollar. Instead of banks issuing private money notes in the legacy system, protocols issue bitcoin-backed stablecoins. Instead of free banks controlling the collateral and allocation of credit, users individually interacting with the protocol control their own credit creation system. </p><p>The use of a permissionless, distributed credit creation system disempowers singular central entities from reaping privileged benefits from the Cantillon effect and controlling the allocation of new credit money.</p><h2>The Importance Of Bitcoin-Backed Credit And Stablecoins</h2><p>Outside of Bitcoin itself, stablecoins are unequivocally the "<a href="https://www.castleisland.vc/cryptodollars">killer app</a>" in crypto. Alex Gladstein argues that the importance of stablecoins as a humanitarian tool “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIjfsX6j958">is impossible to deny</a>.” The market capitalization of stablecoins strongly affirms the crucial place of stablecoins.</p><p>Some Bitcoiners struggle to acknowledge the importance of dollars, as it can seem antithetical to the Bitcoin ethos. However, bitcoin-backed credit makes these ideas compatible. When stablecoins are minted as claims against bitcoin collateral, this process is effectively a short against the dollar. Over a long time frame, we would expect the value of bitcoin to increase as the dollar decreases in purchasing power, thus making it easier to pay back the debt. This is the premise of Pierre Rochard's article “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/">speculative Attack."</a> </p><p>The key component of bitcoin-backed credit is the ability to create a synergy and fly-wheel between dollars and bitcoin. Specifically, as the market demand for censorship-resistant dollars increases, it consequently drives demand for more bitcoin collateral to be purchased and locked in smart contracts to mint stablecoins and meet that demand. Separately, as organic demand for issuing bitcoin backed increases (such as borrowing against it at 0% interest rate), it leads to the creation of more liquidity of censorship-resistant stablecoins. Both censorship-resistant stablecoins and loans against bitcoin collateral have proven to have significant demand. Tying these two high-demand products together creates a synergy between dollar and bitcoin advocates that mutually perpetuate growth of the other.</p><h2>The Tech Stack And The Circular Economy</h2><p>Due to Bitcoin's limited scripting capabilities, projects such as Zero and Fuji currently must be built on Bitcoin sidechains that provide for smart contract functionality. The tradeoff is that users must lock their bitcoin in a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/federated-sidechains-bitcoin-original">federated</a> multisignature address and receive a bitcoin derivative known as RBTC or L-BTC.</p><p>In the interim, this is a trust limitation that is not perfectly aligned with the Bitcoin ethos. However, we can use these federated models to prove product-market fit while exploring research around trustless options such as <a href="https://www.drivechain.info/">drivechains</a> and validity rollups (aka "zk rollups"). <a href="https://twitter.com/lightcoin/status/1579856946781298688?s=20&amp;t=L1zD2qTNB6rSCOW97DiwLQ">Validity rollups</a> are particularly interesting as a way to create a trustless two-way peg that could one day replace the functionality of federations and circumvent the current trust assumptions of sidechains without altering the core tenets of the Bitcoin base layer. A detailed analysis of validity rollups on Bitcoin can be found <a href="https://bitcoinrollups.org/">here</a>. Alternatively, video's discussing ZK Roll-ups on Bitcoin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feODuDF2xv0&amp;t=1s">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qChILPxdOA4">here</a>:</p><p>An eventual future could include creating a trust-minimized bridge between stablecoins minted on a validity Rollup that are then subsequently used for payments on the Lightning Network. This could be enabled by the developments of <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taro">Taro</a> and <a href="https://www.rgbfaq.com/faq/what-is-rgb">RGB</a>, which allow the issuance of tokens (but have limited smart contracting functionality in part due to having no global state) onto the Lightning Network. Currently the vision for Taro and RGB is to bring well-established stablecoins like USDT and USDC onto Lightning. However, the ability to send bitcoin-backed stablecoins which are more censorship resistant, and drive demand to the underlying bitcoin collateral, instead of centralized fiat stablecoins across the Lightning Network is more consistent with the Bitcoin ethos and would be the next evolution of creating a more decentralized circular bitcoin economy. </p><p>The advent of bitcoin-backed stablecoins bridges these technologies together in a world which allows HODLing bitcoin forever, while getting the short- to medium-term benefit of a bitcoin backed dollar unit of account, with the superior payment rails of Lightning. Rather than working against the dollar and its ubiquitous acceptance as a unit of account, decentralized bitcoin-backed credit works with it to build a superior system with Bitcoin at its base.</p><p><strong>Read More &gt;&gt;</strong> <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-backed-loans">DeFi &amp; CeFi platforms offering Bitcoin backed loans</a></p><h2>Implications Of Bitcoin-Backed Credit</h2><p>On the surface, bitcoin-backed credit using DeFi allows Bitcoiners to get dollar denominated loans without having to sell their bitcoin, in a KYC-free and non-custodial manner. However, that would be hugely understating its importance.</p><p>On a deeper level, bitcoin-backed credit will be the incentivized bridge to hyperbitcoinization. It will facilitate a transition from dollars to bitcoin-backed dollars, to eventually completely new bitcoin-backed credit instruments, as the dollar fades into irrelevance. </p><p>By breaking down the barriers and opacity to credit creation using DeFi, we will disempower centralized authorities’ monopoly on money creation. Simply being able to have and to transfer bitcoin, the asset, is not sufficient. We must also decentralize the financial services and money-creation layers. If we ignore these monetary layers, then we relegate Bitcoin to a life of gold 2.0 in truly all the worst ways — a world in which central authorities use the ever-present demand for credit to hijack our monetary sovereignty through custody. </p><p>The transition to Bitcoin DeFi will shift the paradigm from top-down centralized money creation to distributed bottom-up. Specifically, individuals will have the option to become their own credit creators. The banks and central authorities will no longer be able to unilaterally dictate how credit is created and where it is allocated. This will create a distributed model of capital allocation with an infinite number of isolated experiments as opposed to a few centralized allocators, which more properly reflects the desires of the market.</p><p>The importance of decentralized bitcoin-backed stablecoin loans via DeFi cannot be understated.

According to <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/12/05/2567462/0/en/Riot-Announces-November-2022-Production-and-Operations-Updates.html">the release</a>, the company produced 521 BTC, a 12% increase on its November 2021 production of 466 BTC. It sold 450 BTC, generating net proceeds of $8.1 million, and had a deployed fleet of 72,428 miners with a hash rate capacity of 7.7 exahashes per second (EH/s) on November 30.<br><br>Jason Les, CEO of Riot stated, “Riot again achieved a new record for total hash rate capacity during the month of November, resulting in our highest monthly bitcoin production figure to date.” He did caveat this positivity, saying, “Despite this new level of production, expected production was approximately 660 bitcoin given our operating hash rate over the month, assuming normalized performance of the mining pool we participate in. Variance in a mining pool can impact results and while this variance should balance out over time, can be volatile in the short term. This variance led to lower bitcoin production than expected in the month of November, relative to our hash rate.” <br><br>Bitcoin’s hash rate has been on a tear in recent months, <a href="https://data.hashrateindex.com/network-data/btc">achieving new all-time highs</a> and effectively making miners not using cutting-edge equipment unprofitable. This in turn has an <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-hash-rate-increases-implications-for-equities">impact on the public companies exposed</a> to this market.</p><p>To better formulate an outlook on their production, Les stated in the release, “In order to ensure more predictable results going forward, Riot will be transitioning to another mining pool which offers a more consistent reward mechanism, so that Riot will fully benefit from our rapidly growing hash rate capacity as we work towards our goal of reaching 12.5 EH/s in the first quarter of 2023.”<br><br>The report did not specify which mining pool Riot will now point its miners towards.</p><p>Looking ahead, Riot seeks to achieve a total self-mining hash rate capacity of 12.5 EH/s during Q1 2023, assuming full deployment of approximately 115,450 Antminer ASICs. <br><br>However, this does not include any potential incremental productivity gains from the company’s utilization of 200 MW of immersion-cooling infrastructure. The majority of Riot’s self-mining fleet will consist of the latest S19-series miners. In addition to its self-mining operations, the company hosts approximately 200 MW of institutional Bitcoin mining clients.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best Apps To Buy Bitcoin in 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[Discover the best mobile payment apps.

Apps are the quickest and most convenient way to buy or sell Bitcoin. Read our guide covering the top 10 payment apps.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Payment apps are the easiest and quickest way to buy or sell bitcoin and directly convert it into fiat currencies or vice versa.</p><p>Most payment apps are very similar in use and functionality; however, some are more aligned with the Bitcoin ecosystem and focused on applying certain standards — such as Strike using the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/lightning-network">Lightning Network</a> for fast and secure payments, or Relai, offering a non-custodial wallet and a no-KYC policy. </p><p>A bitcoin payment app allows users to pay with bitcoin and businesses to accept bitcoin payments for goods and services. Bitcoin payments usually happen through gateways that automatically convert bitcoin into fiat currencies. </p><p>Payment apps are mostly like traditional digital payments with lower fees. If users also want to trade bitcoin, they’ll have to sign up for a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/best-bitcoin-only-exchanges">Bitcoin exchange</a> that offers a better range of trading services. </p><p>Note: <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/best-bitcoin-only-exchanges">Bitcoin-only exchanges</a>, P2P bitcoin platforms and exchanges that publish their <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/proof-of-reserves-industry-standard">proof of reserves</a> are usually regarded as being safer to use. However, the best you can do to protect your bitcoin is to move it out of the exchanges as soon as your trade is executed and store it safely in your wallet with your private key.</p><h2>Best Apps To Buy Bitcoin</h2><p>1. <a href="https://strike.me/">Strike</a> is a payment app similar to PayPal or Cash App, with the main difference being the payment network used. While the most popular apps use traditional systems like SWIFT, Strike uses Bitcoin and the Lightning Network to secure payments. Launched in 2020, the app is currently only available in the U.S. and El Salvador but will soon be rolled out in Europe with the aim to expand it to the rest of the world as a global transaction and remittance service that needs no intermediary to function.</p><p>2. <a href="https://cash.app/">Cash App</a> is a peer-to-peer payment system that allows users to purchase and sell bitcoin and stocks. Unlike Robinhood, the platform enables investors to transfer bitcoin to their wallet, although withdrawals are limited to $2,000 daily or $5,000 within any seven days. Cash App sets a fee depending on price volatility and market trading volume, which is disclosed at the time of purchase.</p><p>3. <a href="https://bitpay.com/">BitPay</a>: As one of the first bitcoin payment systems launched in 2011, BitPay is still a popular option for merchants and customers. Users can download the app and have access to a crypto debit card, wallet and web browser extension. You can buy or sell bitcoin with the app and use it for online retailers through the Chrome extension. They have a 1% flat transaction fee applied to all businesses.</p><p>4. <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> is based in Switzerland and is Europe’s most accessible bitcoin-only investment app. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/relai-enables-instant-bitcoin-purchases">It enables instant bitcoin purchases</a> with no deposit, registration or strict KYC procedure. The Relai app only provides non-custodial wallets, meaning its customers maintain control of their private keys at all times.</p><p>5. <a href="https://peachbitcoin.com/">Peach</a> is a peer-to-peer mobile app that allows customers to buy and sell bitcoin. The service is still in beta mode, and there’s a waiting list to join it; however, it is one of the few Bitcoin P2P marketplaces on a mobile application for the European market.</p><p>6. <a href="https://river.com/">River</a> is a U.S.-based, bitcoin-only custodial exchange that claims to be very easy and secure to use while offering plenty of good educational material to understand Bitcoin.</p><p>River charges fees based on how much bitcoin you buy, starting from 1.20% but offers no fees for recurring buys. River stores all bitcoin offline in secure cold storage and also offers customers to buy bitcoin miners.</p><p>7. <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan</a>&nbsp;is River’s main competitor in the USA and claims to be the most secure platform to buy bitcoin. Swan provides similar services to River, with the main difference being the fees: Swan’s are 0.99% while River’s start at 1.2%. They offer recurring daily, weekly or monthly purchases, which they make enticing due to a very competitive USD/BTC conversion rate.</p><p>8. <a href="https://www.revolut.com/go-from-cash-to-crypto-instantly/">Revolut</a> was one of the first European fintech apps to offer cryptocurrency trading, although with a temporary license. In 2022 it won full authorization to provide its cryptocurrency services across Europe and the U.K. The app is straightforward to use and supports the trading of cryptocurrencies at competitive exchange rates, having access to the largest liquidity pool in Europe. Its metal customers in the U.K. can also transfer bitcoin to their private wallets.</p><p><em>9. </em><a href="https://venmo.com/">Venmo</a><em> </em>is an American peer-to-peer mobile payment service owned by PayPal since 2012. The platform allowed the buying and selling of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in April 2021 and has a similar fee structure to PayPal: an estimated 0.5% trading price and a tiered transaction fee ranging from 0.5% for purchases below $25 to 2.3% for trades between $25 and $100. </p><p>10. <a href="http://pocketbitcoin.com/">Pocket</a> is a young company and so far available in some <a href="https://pocketbitcoin.com/faq/where-is-pocket-available">European countries</a>. It enables you to stack satoshis by setting up recurring payments from your bank account directly to your preferred wallet. Each payment will be automatically exchanged to bitcoin and paid out on the date you set. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions: </h2><p><strong>Which is the safest app for Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>The safest Bitcoin app is a service that allows you to move your bitcoin off the platform to a private hardware wallet. Only you must have access to that wallet and hold the private key.</p><p><strong>What is the best Bitcoin app for beginners?</strong></p><p>General-purpose apps like Revolut or Cash App are usually good for onboarding beginners at their first experience with purchasing bitcoin. Relai, a bitcoin-only app, is also a very straightforward app with low fees.</p><p><strong>Where is the best place to buy Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>Bitcoin Magazine always recommends decentralized P2P exchanges or bitcoin-only exchanges, but ultimately the best you can do to secure your assets is to move them out of exchanges right after the purchase.</p><p><strong>Is Paypal a good option to buy Bitcoin?</strong></p><p>PayPal launched its crypto service in late 2020, offering customers the ability to buy, hold and sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Although they provide the option to buy Bitcoin, there are far better options available to buy and then secure your BTC.</p><h2>Summary: </h2><p>We’ve come a long way from Mt. Gox being the only reputable exchange in the market. Today, we experience the creation of new exchanges on a regular basis, even though some are perhaps too large. </p><p>The dramatic events of 2022, with the collapse of giant crypto services like FTX and Celsius, will teach everyone the most important lesson of all: move your coins out of exchanges and always self-custody after purchase. </p><p>Especially for considerable amounts, bitcoin should only be stored in hardware wallets or multisig noncustodial wallets. Services with a single point of failure (centralized) are always at risk of losing your assets, as has happened multiple times in the short history of cryptocurrencies.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMzMzIzMzE5NDY5NTcz/best_bitcoin_payments_apps-01.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data Suggests Bitcoin Miners Have Capitulated, Bottom Is Close]]></title><description><![CDATA[The inflection point in every bitcoin bear market is capitulation, and the mining sector may have just reached its own trough of bearishness.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-miner-capitulation-could-set-price-bottom</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[bear market]]></category><category><![CDATA[bitcoin price]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Zack Voell]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2022 16:27:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MjkyMDIwNzAyMjkwOTU4/bitcoin-price-and-bitcoin-mining-asic.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The inflection point in every bitcoin bear market is capitulation, and the mining sector may have just reached its own trough of bearishness.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Zack Voell, a bitcoin mining and markets researcher.</em></p><p>Bitcoin miners often suffer the brunt of bear market woes thanks to some of the industry’s highest capital expenditures, smallest margins and most unreliable infrastructure. Although the current bearish phase has been one of Bitcoin’s<a href="https://twitter.com/zackvoell/status/1595614076834652162"> shallowest</a> drawdowns, miners have suffered more than ever.<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/compass-mining-retrenches-15-of-staff-execs-to-take-major-pay-cuts"> </a></p><p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/compass-mining-retrenches-15-of-staff-execs-to-take-major-pay-cuts">Layoffs</a>,<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/22/crypto-mining-data-center-provider-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy-protection/"> bankruptcies</a>,<a href="https://decrypt.co/114789/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-facing-lawsuit-improperly-disclosing-financials"> lawsuits</a> and other negative press have battered one of Bitcoin’s most prominent sectors. But every bear market eventually finds a bottom — the pain climaxes and things slowly begin to recover. A variety of data suggest mining has reached this point of its market cycle, which could offer a bit of optimism going into the new year.</p><p>This article is not intended to offer financial or investment advice of any kind. On the contrary, its intended purpose is data-driven analysis of the current state of the bitcoin mining sector in context of some exogenous and endogenous influences that could shape its near-term future.</p><h2>Understanding Capitulation</h2><p>Before diving into the data, it might help to understand what “capitulation” is. The term is commonly used in financial markets to reference an acute and often dramatic crescendo of fear or widespread surrender by investors or businesses during the throes of depressed market conditions. Basically, everyone says, “It’s over. We can’t take this anymore.” For mining, capitulation basically means the economics became so bad and operating margins are so thin that miners chose to quit or simply cannot operate anymore and are squeezed out of the market.</p><h2>Wall Street Analysts Turn Bearish</h2><p>One of the hallmark signs of miner capitulation (in this author’s opinion) at the current stage of the ongoing bear market is the full pivot from financial analysts who report on publicly-traded mining companies. For the past 12 months, these analysts have preached about the upside potential of bitcoin mining stocks. But now they are “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/21/wall-street-analyst-pulling-the-plug-on-bitcoin-miners-owing-to-bear-market-woes/">pulling the plug</a>.” This language was used by Chris Brendler of DA Davidson to describe his outlook on the mining sector. Since July, Brendler has said that the current market conditions were a good time to buy mining stocks, as<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/01/good-time-to-buy-crypto-mining-stocks-says-da-davidson-as-it-slashes-hashrate-forecasts/"> reported</a> by CoinDesk.</p><p>In December 2021, JPMorgan’s analyst Reginald Smith also<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/13/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-has-more-than-100-upside-jpmorgan-analyst-says/"> wrote</a> a memo that said one particular mining company — Iris Energy — has “more than 100% upside.” He also suggested the current stock price was at a “deep discount.” Shares of the company were trading around $14 at the time of the memo. No they’re trading below $2… an even deeper discount!</p><p>If Wall Street giving up on mining isn’t capitulation, then what is?</p><h2>Bitcoin Hash Rate Starts Dropping</h2><p>For the entirety of the bear market to date, the Bitcoin hash rate has steadily grown larger, forcing difficulty increase after increase on struggling miners. But that trend might be changing. In early December, the next adjustment is set to drop by<a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinkatee/status/1597246812943187970"> almost 11%</a> at the time of writing. This drop will be caused by hash rate falling, which is notably off its recent all-time highs and currently sitting near<a href="https://insights.braiins.com/en#bitcoin_mining_stats"> 240 exahashes per second (EH/s)</a>.</p><p>Normally a dip in hash rate and difficulty would not be too significant. But seven of the past nine difficulty adjustments have been<a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff"> positive</a>. And in context of the incessant hash rate growth and subsequent<a href="https://insights.braiins.com/en#mining_economics"> hash price collapse</a>, the apparent trend reversal for hash rate is notable. Some miners appear to be throwing in the metaphorical towel and taking their machines offline. Discussing the hash rate and difficulty on Twitter in context of whether miners were capitulating, Foundry Senior Vice President Kevin Zhang simply<a href="https://twitter.com/SinoCrypto/status/1597249569481687040"> replied</a>, “Yes.”</p><h2>Bitcoin Miners Are Re-Accumulating</h2><p>Generating fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) around on-chain movements of bitcoin from miner addresses is a popular pastime for Twitter influencers. And observing miner balances can be helpful. Current data shows notably larger balances compared to just a month ago. In short, net selling activity by miners appears to have subsided and their stockpiles of bitcoin are on the rise again.</p><p>Bitcoin mining address balances have seen small reductions over the past year. But the line chart below shows data that indicate a trend reversal is beginning. One-hop miner balances have increased by over 3%, or roughly 85,000 BTC since early October. Perhaps miners decided it’s time to HODL again.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Bitcoin miners may have decided it’s time to HODL again.</figcaption>
    </figure><h2>Miner Outflows Spiked And Fell</h2><p>One other piece of on-chain data that fuels mining FUD is outflows — the activity of miner addresses moving coins from those addresses to some other location. In mid-November, these outflows<a href="https://twitter.com/BraiinsInsights/status/1592547604306747392"> spiked</a> to their highest level since June, which could indicate that fear and panic in the market has affected at least a few miners. Not surprisingly, the spike in outflows occurred at the same time as the collapse of FTX and its subsequent fallout were making headlines.</p><p>It should be noted that any inferences from on-chain data like outflows are informed guesstimates at best. Bitcoin network data is a useful tool for contextualizing certain market events, but it is far from infallible or un-manipulatable. But miners are notoriously bad at timing markets, and the timing of this sudden spike in coin movements could reasonably suggest some panicking miners. In the following week, however, outflows fell back to normal levels and have remained there as of the time of this writing. </p><p>Did miners panic near the market bottom? Very possibly.</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining In 2023</h2><p>Assuming the above analysis is correct and capitulation has occurred, the market will not immediately recover. As the dust settles and survivors emerge, the process of building and scaling more mining infrastructure will be as slow, expensive and tedious as ever. Winners are built in the bear market, and after some of the largest mining companies have sold bitcoin balances down to<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/22/bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-ended-october-with-32m-in-cash/"> nearly zero</a> and even<a href="https://argoblockchain.com/news-room/2022-october-strategic-actions"> sold significant amounts</a> of mining hardware in desperate attempts to stay operational, all that’s left is survival or bankruptcy. </p><p>Of course, things could always get worse overnight. But this article suggests the weak and panicked have been squeezed out, and the time for recovery is here. Now is the time to be optimistic, not bearish. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

Education is also a key to protecting vulnerable communities from bad actors and teaching people how Bitcoin can support them and their families through entrepreneurship, financial inclusion, knowledge and social empowerment.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjM1MDQyMzgwMTI5OTY5/59db328e-9e1f-4e81-8647-eae2ac5259fa.jpg"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MjM1MDQ0NTI3NjEzNDQ1/fec40ee7-8c05-493c-b505-20afd34eff80.jpg" height="827" width="620" medium="image" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Proof-Of-Work Is The Only Viable Form Of Consensus]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism ensures that work needs to be done in order for transactions to confirm and secures bitcoin in the fairest manner.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-is-important-for-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-is-important-for-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Censorship Resistance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consensus]]></category><category><![CDATA[Proof of work]]></category><category><![CDATA[Proof of stake]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Pierre Gildenhuys]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 02:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgwODA0OTg3MDA0MTM0NzYw/mining.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism ensures that work needs to be done in order for transactions to confirm and secures bitcoin in the fairest manner.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Pierre Gildenhuys, the co-founder of a Hong Kong-based social environment tech startup.</em></p><p>Proof-of-work is the consensus mechanism that the Bitcoin protocol uses. On a fundamental level, this means that work has to be done to prove the transactions that have transpired on the network are valid. </p><p>Proof-of-work functions with specialized “computers” known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which input transaction data, information from the previous block hearer and a nonce (random number) to guess the result of hash functions. Hash functions are <a href="https://youtu.be/mMxkxwPSfvo">one-directional mathematical equations</a>, so it is impossible to figure out a resulting output from a publicly visible input other than through rapid guessing as these ASICs do. “Miners” are the people who operate these machines, and they want to increase the number of hashes (or guesses) per second that their devices can produce, and they want to find the cheapest and most reliable source of energy so that this mining becomes profitable for them to pay off the cost of their machines and to make an income to cover their other expenses. Despite this, it is an incredibly competitive industry as a result of Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment: depending on how many hashes per second are mining on the network, the complexity and difficulty of the hash function will increase or decrease accordingly so that it takes an average of 10 minutes for each new block to be found across the global network. </p><p>Blocks are a collection of the transactional data that has to be transmitted and are added to a chain of all of the previous blocks on the network and will only be transmitted and added to this “blockchain” when the answer to the hash function is found. Miners are rewarded for doing this by receiving transaction fees that are paid by users as well as earning a block subsidy which began as 50 bitcoin, but halves every 210,000 blocks — approximately every four years. (The current block subsidy is 6.25 bitcoin per block.) The Bitcoin protocol has a maximum issuance of 21 million bitcoin, meaning the block subsidy will run out around the year 2140, and all mining rewards will be paid by transaction fees. </p><p>The fundamental importance of proof-of-work: </p><ul><li>There is a real-world cost to producing bitcoin. </li><li>There is a real-world cost to defending the integrity and accuracy of Bitcoin.</li><li>Bitcoin has “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">unforgeable costliness</a>,” meaning that it would only be possible to make fake bitcoin or fraudulent bitcoin transactions through redoing all of the costly proof-of-work that came before it, at a rate that outpaces all of the ongoing proof-of-work on the network.</li></ul><p>It has already become too costly and unfeasible to gain the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-a-51-attack/">51% needed</a> for any individuals, nation-states or organizations to take control of the network for their benefit and maliciously change the transaction history.</p><p>This is contrasted by proof-of-stake which serves as the consensus mechanism for many altcoins, digital penny stocks and the other Ponzi schemes being marketed as alternatives to bitcoin.</p><p>Proof-of-stake works through “staking” or more simply put, locking the tokens of that protocol so that they cannot be spent. The number of tokens staked represents your chance of validating a block of transactions. The more tokens staked, the higher the chances of validating a transaction and thus the more frequently you would be rewarded.</p><p>Bearing this in mind, most altcoins were issued to insiders and the development teams before they became publicly available — so major quantities of those tokens were already owned before outsiders could even start acquiring or staking them. </p><p>According to a study by Sam Callahan, Ethereum had an officially admitted <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/bitcoin-vs-altcoins/">premine of around 20%</a> — which is among the lowest of all altcoins — meaning that those insiders only had to acquire an additional 31% since public launch in order to change the protocol in whichever way that benefited them. While Bitcoin has a provable 0% premine, the number of bitcoin owned by any individual or group cannot change the protocol in any way, again unlike altcoins. The only way to change the Bitcoin protocol is through true consensus of 51% of work done for the network, which has historically proved incredibly difficult to achieve and thus leaves the virtues of Bitcoin untouched, unless changes prove beneficial for everyone in the network. Research into the “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-controls-Bitcoins-protocol/dp/B08YQMC2WM">Blocksize War</a>” is a good way to understand this. </p><p>The implications of proof-of-stake:</p><ul><li>Proof-of-stake has no real-world cost of production. </li><li>A majority 51% stake is easily acquired by wealthy individuals, nations and organizations so they can change the rules of the protocol to benefit themselves.</li><li>The defense of proof-of-stake tokens relies purely on the trust in everyone with enough capital or enough tokens to not change the protocol.</li></ul><p>Proof-of-work is a good use of energy as it secures a global monetary network in a way where no one can change the rules or produce more tokens to inflate the supply, meaning that it becomes a financially suitable money to hold for a long period of time. Proof-of-stake is not an adequate replacement to proof-of-work because it doesn’t solve the issue of intervention from malicious parties anywhere in the world at any time. </p><p>Blockchain is not a new development, and financial payment rails can be developed which are much faster than any platform that uses a blockchain. Blockchains distribute total information about transactions to thousands of computers globally, thus making it slower than simply distributing balances from a centralized system. The only reason Bitcoin makes use of a blockchain is because it needs to be truly decentralized. And with the help of proof-of-work, it is provably decentralized, however, since the decentralization of proof-of-stake chains cannot be ensured, using proof-of-stake altcoins essentially places your trust in a centralized platform which could have malicious intents and thus making it irrelevant to use a proof-of-stake system, when more efficient centralized systems such as PayPal, Cash App or other digital payments platforms exist.</p><p>If you are comfortable with the risk that your funds can be stopped, censored or confiscated from you at any time for any reason — or more pertinently, that the platform can be revealed to be fraudulent or insolvent — then make use of centralized systems such as the legacy financial system or digital payments applications. However, using proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, which are most often centralized Ponzi schemes that enrich its founders, is wasteful as they are pointless and simply take up storage space that could be used for more important data storage for the future.</p><p>I will stick to Bitcoin which is secure, immutable, unseizable and decentralized with no single point of failure. Bitcoin is money with a finite issuance, so the value of a bitcoin cannot be stolen through the unnecessary inflation of the supply — as has happened to every fiat currency and to most altcoins. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Pierre Gildenhuys.

There’s over hedging, short squeezes, options market dynamics and forced buying. This is beyond our expertise to say exactly why markets are exploding with volatility on any given data point or new Powell speech. However, these types of events and market movements have nearly always been a sign of unhealthy and heightened volatile swings in bear markets. Despite more talk from Powell with nothing new really said, markets perceived the speech as more “dovish” with his commentary around the concern of overdoing rate hikes. Yet, if this is another bear market rally taking shape for the major indices, we seem to be close to that rally turning over yet again.</p><p>What is also concerning and expected to continue, is the trend of economic contraction as told by the data from the <a href="https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-report-on-business/pmi/november/">ISM manufacturing index (PMI)</a>. Today’s latest release shows a print of 49.0 below market expectations of 49.7. New orders are contracting, the backlog of orders are contracting and prices are decreasing. By all measures and survey responses, these are the signs of demand softening, conditions worsening and the economy moving into more cautious territory. The ISM PMI data highly correlates to the less impactful Chicago PMI data which just printed contraction lows similar to 2000, 2008 and 2020. This is the sign of an economic recession starting in the manufacturing sector.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>What does economic contraction mean for financial markets? It’s typically bad news when there’s a sustained contraction trend of ISM PMI below 50 and even below 40s playing out. It seems we’re in the early stages of a larger contraction trend playing out: The despair phase of the market. </p><p>The specific question for the bitcoin and macro relationship is now: Was this industry-leverage wipeout and capitulation event enough selling to mute the potential probability and effects of an equity bear market meltdown? Will bitcoin flatline and form a bottom if equities are to follow similar past bear market drawdown paths?</p><p>We’ve still yet to see a real blowout in stock market volatility which has always impacted bitcoin. It’s been a core part of our thesis this year that bitcoin will follow traditional equity markets to the downside. </p><p>The magnitude of the long-duration debt in real terms was, and still is, the biggest story here. </p><p>Furthermore, what does this mean going forward for asset valuations? </p><figure>

At the very least, it will create a system that is parallel to the current banking one and that would therefore be protected from the latter’s crashes (see 2007-2008 </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008"><em>financial crisis</em></a><em>). Of course it is taking years for this new system to fully mature. Taleb says this mission is worth exactly zero because he lacks the vision.</em></p><p>Is it a good time to invest in bitcoin? I believe it is. Besides proper philosophers, who are thinking in terms of centuries, not many can build such a belief, with the exception of the best wealth managers, who think in terms of decades.</p><p>So philosophers, who historically never cared about wealth, and wealth managers, who naturally enough only care about wealth, are uniting here in an interesting turn of events. Philosophers see that the inevitable fate of mankind is to evolve into a cybernetic organism, and they see that any technology that facilitates this process is bound to come to dominate. Wealth managers, on the other hand, realize that an alternative financial system that is thermodynamically closed can be useful to their activities.</p><p>That’s all there is to say about it. But I can say more.</p><p>Because there are indeed other opinions in the marketplace, which are however mostly inconsequential. There’s, for example, the confused Nassim Taleb, who writes 300-page books about trivial ideas that can be summarized in a single paragraph. He talks about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable">black swans</a>'' as if we didn’t already know that a scientific model is merely a rough sketch and not the freaking gospel. He literally wrote 300 pages about this — that you can’t accurately predict any event with 100% certainty and that accidents and disasters happen. Only instead of calling these events accidents or disasters, which is what they are, he called them “black swans.” In an utterly exasperating prose riddled with <em>italics</em>, moreover, literally <em>italicizing</em> at <em>least</em> a word in <em>every single paragraph</em>, if not <em>sentence</em>. And also gratuitously quoting and name-dropping intellectuals for absolutely no reason. So why did people pay attention to him again? Because he made a fortune trading options. Nassim Taleb believes bitcoin is <a href="https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1382446478539550727">worth exactly zero</a> and that bitcoin’s price drop in March 2020 “proves'' that it can’t be used to hedge against risk (as if all risks were equal, and as if diversification wasn’t the best general hedge against risk to begin with), showing once and for all that he not understand his own book. You cannot “prove” anything from a single data point, my dear Taleb. The March 2020 lockdown was a freak event⁠ — an exception ⁠— a “black swan,” to adopt your terminology. If you had paid attention, you’d have also seen that the entire market also collapsed, and you’d have maybe realized that you cannot extrapolate anything worthwhile about bitcoin at this stage from this freak event. But Taleb says that bitcoin collapsed more than the stock market did — therefore, he thinks, “bitcoin is worthless”. We’re moving now, then, from childish terminology to childish logic. </p><p>But what exactly is his mistake here? The problem is that he has failed to realize that bitcoin is still in development, it is still growing and evolving. The mistake he’s making is equivalent to watching a healthy cat kill a newborn lion, and then concluding from that freak observation that cats are stronger than lions. He seems to think that bitcoin’s future behavior will mirror its current behavior, but how could that be the case when we are this early? So early in fact that no regulation exists for it and most people are still trying to define what exactly bitcoin is. Meaning, practically nobody has a clue about what bitcoin is. Taleb, then, is not considering in his analysis the idea that bitcoin’s maximum utility hinges on a future widespread adoption. He’s analyzing bitcoin at this point in time, myopically, with a total disregard for the effect of future <em>favorable</em> conditions in his analysis, as if bitcoin today was already a finished product and process. But it isn’t⁠ — because bitcoin is designed to bind itself cyber-symbiotically to mankind, and right now the portion of mankind to which it has bound itself is not significant enough, in terms of raw wealth and investment power. </p><p>To Nassim Taleb, bitcoin seems to function like a Ponzi scheme, but I say it will resemble a Ponzi only if it fails to develop into maturity. Otherwise, it will be nothing like a Ponzi and very much like an extremely awesome asset with great utility. I could also say that most life on planet Earth is a “Ponzi,” because a few billion years down the line the Sun will expand and destroy the entire planet, destroying with it, for example, all the real estate contained in it. At that time, the real estate bag-holders might perhaps say that real estate investment was always a Ponzi to begin with, especially after they see every bitcoin holder safely move their bitcoin out of the planet. In this scenario, what exactly is the Ponzi? So we see that Taleb’s quote above is meaningless: in a sufficiently advanced future, <em>everything</em> is fated to go to zero, but of course that doesn’t mean there’s no value to anything. </p><p>Right now we are, then, entering bitcoin’s “development into maturity” phase (having already gone through ten years of its infancy) which is the final and protracted phase that will reduce price volatility and effectively bring to the table its store of value capabilities. Can this phase fail to be completed? Sure. In nature, lifeforms occasionally fail to develop into maturity. That doesn’t stop me or any other person from trying to imagine what a particular lifeform can look and behave like if favorable conditions emerge that guarantee its prosperous development. This is, of course, a basic idea from biology. In the technological realm, however, the same principles from biological and evolutionary thought can be applied because tools are created, they grow, they mutate, they clash with each other, and eventually evolve or become obsolete in a manner that resembles that of lifeforms in nature; only in the technological realm it is mankind which dictates the fate of the tool, while in the biological realm, it is nature. The point is that this “development into maturity” phase that I’m referring to is of course in the case of bitcoin the “widespread adoption of bitcoin” phase: the phase in which all worthwhile wealth managers agree that bitcoin’s rules are great and decide to play by them⁠—allocating a small portion of their capital to it, initially⁠—and gradually but steadily adding some more whenever they see fit. For it will be this phase that will put the cybernetic symbiosis between bitcoin and mankind in full swing. </p><p>As of right now, bitcoin is useful for wealth transfers and that’s about it. However, bitcoin can potentially, i.e., in theory, under favorable conditions, be much more useful than it currently is. For we are envisioning, after all, a radical optimization of the entire financial structure with the aid of automation. It’s on this coming, higher utility that we are betting, dear Taleb ⁠— and this is why we couldn’t care less now about volatility or fragility or your “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14631.pdf">convex curve responses to stressors</a>.” I know you wrote an entire book about randomness, and even tried to create a theory on how to utilize randomness to our benefit. But at the end of the day this entire theoretical endeavor is pointless because the purpose of theory is to predict the future, while randomness is defined precisely as that which cannot be predicted. Sure, yes, of course we want to minimize the harmful effects of randomness (=chance,=accidents, =disasters). It’s called risk management. But until the non-predictable accident (see the pleonasm?) actually happens nobody knows how fragile our process-activity-asset stands relative to said accident⁠—otherwise the event wouldn’t be by definition an accident and we’d have been able to factor it in our theories and models! But not only do you fail to see this triviality, you even give lectures about it, as if randomness could be in anyway intelligible, as if we hadn’t already <em>defined it</em> as unintelligible! And as if the book’s message was something profound instead of obvious, as obvious as saying the sky is blue or that birds fly.</p><p>If you think I am being too tough on Taleb, dear reader, I’ll just say that he was asking to get such a reply when he started gratuitously quoting philosophers for no reason, hundreds of pages in a row. He invoked the spirit of philosophy⁠—so here it is now biting him back⁠—a proper case of a wizard’s spell turning against the caster. Hope you like it, Taleb!</p><p>So that’s that. Philosophers, wealth managers and a few visionaries agree that bitcoin is awesome. Then, there’s the rest of humanity who simply doesn’t care about this stuff. Finally, there are thinkers like Nassim Taleb who aren’t thinking straight. In short: the potential gains far over-shadow the, in my view, laughably low risk of bitcoin going to zero.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bernardo Filipe.

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the app saw an increase of 60% compared to the previous month of October 2022.</p><p>The company also reports that November 2022 was its best month for both active users and new users, saying that more people downloaded the app in November than in September and October combined. <br><br>Simultaneously, the director general of market infrastructure and payments at the European Central Bank and an advisor released an article on November 30 titled “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2022/html/ecb.blog221130~5301eecd19.en.html">Bitcoin’s Last Stand</a>,” that described Bitcoin as on the “road to irrelevance.” The paper criticized the investment thesis of bitcoin, the technology’s importance and its relevance as a payments mechanism. This stance isn’t necessarily new as the ECB has <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/ecb-president-christine-lagarde-says-bitcoin-is-not-currency">expressed its contempt</a> for Bitcoin before. <br><br>In response to this and the recent data, CEO and Co-Founder of Relai Julian Liniger said, “If Bitcoin is doomed to fail, why is the ECB spending so much effort attacking it over and over? To me, it seems that it boils down to either not understanding Bitcoin and mixing it up with ‘crypto,’ or that the ECB in fact understands and fears it. Looking at our numbers and the positive long-term sentiment in the Bitcoin community shows that the ECB is just out of touch with what is happening in the real world. In fact, the ECB is on the road to irrelevance and Bitcoin is just getting started.” </p><p>A recent <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/relai-checkout-com-partnership-enables-24-7-bitcoin-purchases-in-europe">update covered in Bitcoin Magazine</a> means Relai now has support for 24/7 bitcoin purchases on Visa, Mastercard and Apple Pay. With this, and further expected investment into the user-experience of the app, the company continues on its stated mission of being Europe’s easiest and quickest way of acquiring bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNDgzNTg3/bitcoin-to-the-moon.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here’s Everything That’s In Brazil’s Bitcoin And Crypto Bill]]></title><description><![CDATA[Brazil’s Congress just approved a complete regulatory framework for cryptocurrency markets in the country.

Here’s everything that’s in it.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>On Tuesday, Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/brazil-approves-use-of-bitcoin-as-payment">approved a landmark cryptocurrency legislation</a> that sets the tone for how the country will regulate bitcoin.</p><p>Key aspects of the bill relate to the way “virtual assets” are defined and their possible local uses, who can provide services to the public and what are the penalties for fraud and money laundering that involve cryptocurrencies.</p><p>The bill had been discussed in Congress for seven years, but recent events in local and global markets, including the fall of prominent exchange FTX, placed urgency on its voting and subsequent approval.</p><p>After being approved by the Chamber of Deputies, the bill headed over to the Senate, which modified parts of the bill and added a few new sections. The text was then brought back to the Chamber so the Senate’s changes could be voted on, which is what happened on Tuesday.</p><p>Now, President Jair Bolsonaro, who is scheduled to hand over Presidential reins to Lula on January 1st, has 15 days to sign or veto the bill. A partial veto is also possible, an event through which the president would be able to reject only one or more parts of the bill. The bill comes into effect 180 days after an eventual signature from the president.</p><p>Here’s everything that’s in Brazil’s <a href="https://www.camara.leg.br/propostas-legislativas/1555470">new regulatory framework</a> for bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets.</p><h2>The Assets</h2><p>A virtual asset is “a digital representation of value that can be negotiated or transferred electronically and used for payments or as an investment,” per the bill’s text.</p><p>This definition shouldn’t be overlooked, as it directly legitimizes the use of bitcoin and cryptocurrency for conducting payments in the country. While arguably no regulatory approval for such activity is needed given Bitcoin’s decentralized nature, receiving greater regulatory clarity encourages businesses to explore the burgeoning payment method more closely. This, in turn, can translate into more widespread adoption of bitcoin as a medium of exchange in Brazil.</p><p>The same can be said for El Salvador’s national adoption of bitcoin. There wasn’t anything preventing businesses in the Central American country from accepting bitcoin –– as evidenced by the fact that the circular bitcoin economy in Bitcoin Beach predates the Bitcoin Law –– but the advent of the legal tender legislation allowed many more corporations to start accepting BTC as payment. It also attracted tourism and investments. And while Brazil is not recognizing bitcoin as legal tender, which is in some ways a missed opportunity, this can mark a first step toward a greater dissemination of bitcoin payments in the country’s economy. Whether that will actually happen, however, will depend on the actions of the watchdog tasked with overseeing the market.</p><h2>The Regulator</h2><p>Initially, the bill directly tasked the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) with regulating the bitcoin market in the country. That aspect was later removed, and the executive branch is now directly tasked with picking a watchdog for the sector.</p><p>The expectation is that the BCB will be in charge when cryptocurrencies are used as payment, while the country’s securities and exchange commission (CVM) will be the watchdog when they are used as an investment asset. It is expected that the two government bodies will act in collaboration in these matters. Both the BCB and the CVM, along with the federal tax authority (RFB), helped lawmakers craft the overhaul legislation.</p><p>The regulator will be tasked with authorizing virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to operate in the country, as well as overseeing their operations to ensure they abide by current legislations.</p><h2>The Service Providers</h2><p>As already mentioned, VASPs will need to obtain regulatory approval from the watchdog selected by the executive branch before operating in the country.</p><p>The bill considers VASPs an enterprise “that executes, on behalf of third parties, at least one of the following virtual asset services: exchange between virtual assets and national or foreign currency; exchange between one or more virtual assets; transfer of virtual assets; custody or administration of virtual assets or of instruments that enable control over virtual assets; or the participation in financial services and offering of services related to the offer by an issuer or the sale of virtual assets.”</p><p>There are two key aspects to highlight in this definition. First, it only applies to entities that hold a specific kind of Brazilian enterprise ID called CNPJ (A CNPJ is similar to a business’ tax identification number, TIN, or employer identification number, EIN, in the U.S.). Second, it requires that the aforementioned services be provided <em>on behalf of a third party</em> for the provider to be considered a VASP. These two points mean that individuals, as well as hardware and software services such as self-custodial solutions, shouldn’t fall under the rules and therefore not be identified as VASPs.</p><h2>The Penalties</h2><p>The bill establishes that existing criminal penalties for fraud and money laundering should also encompass illegal actions involving cryptocurrency. Penalties vary from three to 10 years in prison, in addition to fees, and are in some cases more severe if virtual assets are involved.</p><h2>The Parts Left Out</h2><p>Key aspects of the bill were removed from the text in the final voting. Here are some of the most important ones.</p><h3>Patrimonial Segregation</h3><p>One rule added by the Senate required VASPs to keep user funds separate from their own capital. It sought to prevent issues similar to what happened with FTX, the now-bankrupt global exchange that apparently used customer funds to fund trades executed by a sister company, Alameda. Notably, this rule meant that in the event of a bankruptcy, user funds would be immediately returned instead of being part of the bankruptcy process or used to settle some of the company’s debt. </p><p>The inclusion of this section was supported by several key players in the market, as well as the BCB. Deputies voted against it in Tuesday’s session, arguing that the rule could stifle innovation in Brazil as it could present a big barrier for entry into the cryptocurrency market.</p><h3>Tax Exemptions On Mining Rigs</h3><p>Another seemingly positive rule that was left out of the final text sought to exempt federal taxes on the purchase of mining equipment and software such as ASIC rigs until December 2029. It included some conditions for the benefit, such as the need to use renewable energy sources. The rule could have helped spur a healthy mining market in the country as federal import taxes alone can often double the price of some goods being shipped to Brazil.</p><h3>Public Agencies Holding Accounts On VASPs</h3><p>A third rule that didn’t make it to the final text allowed governmental agencies to open and operate accounts at VASPs such as exchanges. The possibilities for operating such accounts would be limited by those established by the executive branch.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MTAxMTcwMzk2OTk3Mjk3/26812213289_f460d63e07_k.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The FTX Ponzi: Uncovering The Largest Fraud In Crypto History]]></title><description><![CDATA[Modern day alchemy, unsurprisingly, failed.

    </figure><p><strong><em>The below is an excerpt from the Bitcoin Magazine Pro report on the rise and fall of FTX. To read and download the entire 30-page report, </em><a href="https://mailchi.mp/bitcoinmagazine/proftxreport"><em>follow this link</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><h2>The Beginnings </h2><p>Where did it all start for Sam Bankman-Fried? As the story goes, Bankman-Fried, a former international ETF trader at Jane Street Capital, stumbled upon the nascent bitcoin/cryptocurrency markets in 2017 and was shocked at the amount of “risk-free” arbitrage opportunity that existed. </p><p>In particular, Bankman-Fried said the infamous Kimchi Premium, which is the large difference between the price of bitcoin in South Korea versus other global markets (due to capital controls), was a particular opportunity that he took advantage of to first start making his millions, and eventually billions …</p><p>At least that’s how the story goes.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTQwOTIyNzM1MjQwNzA5/kimchi-premium.png" height="268" width="620">

    </figure><p>The real story, while possibly similar to what SBF liked to tell to explain the meteoric rise of Alameda and subsequently FTX, looks to have been one riddled with deception and fraud, as the “smartest guy in the room” narrative, one that saw Bankman-Fried on the cover of Forbes and touted as the “modern day JP Morgan,” quickly changed to one of massive scandal in what looks to be the largest financial fraud in modern history. </p><h2>The Start Of The Alameda Ponzi</h2><p>As the story goes, Alameda Research was a high-flying proprietary trading fund that used quantitative strategies to achieve outsized returns in the cryptocurrency market. While the story was believable on the surface, due to the seemingly inefficient nature of the cryptocurrency market/industry, the red flags for Alameda were glaring from the start. </p><p>As the fallout of FTX unfolded, previous Alameda Research pitch decks from 2019 began to circulate, and for many the content was quite shocking. We will include the full deck below before diving into our analysis.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The deck contains many glaring red flags, including multiple grammatical errors, including the offering of only one investment product of “15% annualized fixed rate loans” that promise to have “no downside.”</p><p><em>All glaring red flags.</em></p><p>Similarly, the shape of the advertised Alameda equity curve (visualized in red), which seemingly was up and to the right with minimal volatility, while the broader cryptocurrency markets were in the midst of a violent bear market with vicious bear market rallies. While it is 100% possible for a firm to perform well in a bear market on the short side, the ability to generate consistent returns with near infinitesimal portfolio drawdowns is not a naturally occurring reality in financial markets. Actually, it is a tell-tale sign of a Ponzi scheme, of which we have seen before, throughout history.</p><p>The performance of Bernie Madoff’s Fairfield Sentry Ltd for nearly two decades operated quite similarly to what Alameda was promoting via their pitch deck in 2019:</p><ul><li>Up-only returns regardless of broader market regime</li><li>Minimal volatility/drawdowns </li><li>Guaranteeing the payout of returns while fraudulently paying out early investors with the capital of new investors&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><p>It appears that Alameda’s scheme began to run out of steam in 2019, which is when the firm pivoted to creating an exchange with an ICO (initial coin offering) in the form of FTT to continue to source capital. Zhu Su, the co-founder of now-defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, seemed skeptical.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTQwOTIzMDAzNjc2MTY1/zhu-su-tweet.png" height="399" width="620">

    </figure><p>Approximately three months later, Zhu took to Twitter again to express his skepticism about Alameda’s next venture, the launch of an ICO and a new crypto derivatives exchange. </p><blockquote><p><em>“These same guys are now trying to launch a "bitmex competitor" and do an ICO for it. 🤔”</em> - Tweet, <a href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1116945693946433536?s=20&amp;t=OJ8_HouN0JRhfqe2zWQFdw">4/13/19 </a></p></blockquote><p>Beneath this tweet, Zhu said the following while posting a screenshot of the FTT white paper: </p><blockquote><p><em>“Last time they pressured my biz partner to get me to delete the tweet. They started doing this ICO after they couldn't find any more greater fools to borrow from even at 20%+. I get why nobody calls out scams early enough. Risk of exclusion higher than return from exposing.” - </em><a href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1116951872214953988?s=20&amp;t=OJ8_HouN0JRhfqe2zWQFdw"><em>Tweet</em></a><em>, 4/13/19&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote><figure>

    </figure><p>Additionally, FTT could be used as collateral in the FTX cross-collateralized liquidation engine. FTT received a collateral weighting of 0.95, whereas USDT &amp; BTC received 0.975 and USD &amp; USDC received a weighting of 1.00. This was true until the collapse of the exchange.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>FTT Token</h2><p>The FTT token was described as the “backbone” of the FTX exchange and was issued on Ethereum as a ERC20 token. In reality, it was mostly a rewards based marketing scheme to attract more users to the FTX platform and to prop up balance sheets. Most of the FTT supply was held by FTX and Alameda Research and Alameda was even in the initial seed round to fund the token. Out of the 350 million total supply of FTT, <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1593297972258693120?s=20&amp;t=hG0M6q-3w-fmmeZmb34rkg">280 million (80%) of it was controlled by FTX</a> and 27.5 million made their way to an Alameda wallet. </p><p>FTT holders benefited from additional FTX perks such as lower trading fees, discounts, rebates and the ability to use FTT as collateral to trade derivatives. To support FTT’s value, FTX routinely purchased FTT tokens using a percentage of trading fee revenue generated on the platform. Tokens were purchased and then burned weekly to continue driving up the value of FTT. </p><p>FTX repurchased burned FTT tokens based on 33% of fees generated on FTX markets, 10% of net additions to a backstop liquidity fund and 5% of fees earned from other uses of the FTX platform. The FTT token does not entitle its holders to FTX revenue, shares in FTX nor governance decisions over FTX’s treasury.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Alameda’s balance sheet was first mentioned in this <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/">Coindesk article</a> showing that the fund held $3.66 billion in FTT tokens while $2.16 billion of that was used as collateral. The game was to drive up the perceived market value of FTT then use the token as collateral to borrow against it. The rise of Alameda’s balance sheet rose with the value of FTT. As long as the market didn’t rush to sell and collapse the price of FTT then the game could continue on. </p><p>FTT rode on the backs of the FTX marketing push, rising to a peak market cap of $9.6 billion back in September 2021 (not including locked allocations, all the while Alameda leveraged against it behind the scenes. The Alameda assets of $3.66b FTT &amp; $2.16b “FTT collateral” in June of this year, along with its OXY, MAPs, and SRM allocations, were combined worth tens of billions of dollars at the top of the market in 2021.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>CZ Chooses Blood</h2><p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589283421704290306?s=20&amp;t=vVGC0s9mBjgFX2iiuJdL_Q">one decision and tweet</a>, CEO of Binance, CZ, kicked off the toppling of a house of cards that in hindsight, seems inevitable. Concerned that Binance would be left holding a worthless FTT token, the company aimed to sell $580 million of FTT at the time. That was bombshell news since Binance’s FTT holdings accounted for over 17% of the market cap value. This is the double edged sword of having the majority of FTT supply in the hands of a few and an illiquid FTT market that was used to drive and manipulate the price higher. When someone goes to sell something big, value collapses. </p><p>As a response to CZ’s announcement, Caroline of Alameda Research, made a critical mistake to announce their plans to buy all of Binance’s FTT at the <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589287457975304193?s=20&amp;t=1EDBHIrUk2OwYc7FODu8rw">current market price of $22</a>. Doing that publicly sparked a wave of market open interest to place their bets on where FTT would go next. Short sellers piled in to drive the token price to zero with the thesis that something was off and the risk of insolvency was in play. </p><p>Ultimately, this scenario has been brewing since the Three Arrows Capital and Luna collapsed this past summer. It’s likely that Alameda had significant losses and exposure but were able to survive based on FTT token loans and leveraging FTX customer funds. It also makes sense now why FTX had an interest in bailing out companies like Voyager and BlockFi in the initial fallout. Those firms may have had large FTT holdings and it was necessary to keep them afloat to sustain the FTT market value. In the latest bankruptcy documents, it was revealed that <a href="https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/33/188450/042020648197.pdf">$250 million in FTT was loaned to BlockFi</a>. </p><p>With hindsight, now we know why Sam was buying up all of the FTT tokens he could get his hands on every week. No marginal buyers, lack of use cases and high risk loans with the FTT token were a ticking time bomb waiting to blow up.&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1579504364338958337"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>How It All Ends</h2><p>After pulling back the curtain, we now know that all of this led FTX and Alameda straight into bankruptcy with the firms disclosing that their top 50 creditors are owed $3.1 billion with only a $1.24 cash balance to pay it. The company likely has over a million creditors that are due money. </p><p>The <a href="https://pacer-documents.s3.amazonaws.com/33/188450/042020648197.pdf">original bankruptcy document</a> is riddled with glaring gaps, balance sheet holes and a lack of financial controls and structures that were worse than Enron. All it took was one tweet about selling a large amount of FTT tokens and a rush for customers to start withdrawing their funds overnight to expose the asset and liability mismatch FTX was facing. Customer deposits weren’t even listed as liabilities in the balance sheet documents provided in the bankruptcy court filing despite what we know to be around $8.9 billion now. Now we can see that FTX never had really backed or properly accounted for the bitcoin and other crypto assets that customers were holding on their platform. </p><p>It was all a web of misallocated capital, leverage and the moving of customer funds around to try and keep the confidence game going and the two entities afloat.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><figure>

Inflation has come out of practically nothing.” So said European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, on the Irish talk show <a href="https://www.rte.ie/player/series/the-late-late-show/SI0000001694?epguid=IH000413654">Late Late Show</a> on October 28, 2022. Words apparently contradicting a statement that came shortly afterwards in the same interview. Inflation, <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1586742825693192192">she said</a>, is caused "by Russian President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. [...] This energy crisis is causing massive inflation that we have to defeat.”</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1586742825693192192"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><h2>The Rate Hike</h2><p>The day before the interview the European Central Bank had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/ecb-meeting-oct-2022-hikes-rates-by-75-basis-points-new-terms-for-european-banks.html">raised interest</a> rates by a further 75 basis points, bringing the total growth applied in the last three meetings to 2%: the highest level since 2009. In all likelihood it will not end there, as the Governing Council <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.mp221027~df1d778b84.en.html">plans</a> to “raise rates further to ensure a timely return of inflation to its medium-term objective of 2 per cent.”</p><p>According to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/15131946/2-19102022-AP-EN.pdf/92861d37-0275-8970-a0c1-89526c25f392#:~:text=The%20euro%20area%20annual%20inflation,up%20from%2010.1%25%20in%20August.">latest data</a>, the rise in prices in the euro area has actually reached levels never seen in the last 20 years: +9.9% in September compared to the same month last year. Countries like Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are seeing price increases of 22%, 22.5% and 24.1% respectively.</p><p>In the widespread consensus on the meaning of the term <em>inflation</em>, however, there is a major inconsistency. A distortion of the real concept that leads leaders, experts - and consequently the media - to attribute different causes to the word, depending on the convenience of the moment. When the cause, in reality, is always and only one.</p><h2>Inflation And Price Increases Are Different</h2><p>For many, inflation is now synonymous with rising prices. This is not just a widespread belief but a meaning that has also been adopted by economics textbooks and the official language. According to <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/it/dizionario/inglese/inflation">Cambridge Dictionary</a> inflation is “a general, continuous increase in prices.”</p><p>But is this really the case? Bitcoin teaches one thing: <em>Don't trust, verify</em>. And by verifying, a problem emerges: the reversal of cause and effect.</p><p>Inflation is treated as the effect of a certain event: an energy crisis, a chip shortage, a drought can all lead to higher prices for goods and services in certain sectors. But in reality inflation, in its original meaning, does not mean the rise in prices, it indicates its cause.</p><p>The clue comes directly from etymology: inflation comes from the Latin word <em>inflatio</em>, itself a derivative of <em>inflare</em>, i.e. <em>to</em> <em>inflate</em>. Think about inflating a balloon: the act of <em>inflare</em> (inflating) is when air is blown from the mouth into the balloon: the cause. The immediate consequence is the expansion of the volume of the balloon that is taking in air: the effect. </p><p>Pumping new air into the balloon is the action that leads to its expansion. The same reasoning applies to money: the very act of printing money is inflation and its consequence is an increase in prices. This reversal of cause and effect was already referred to in the late 1950s as <em>semantic confusion</em> by one of the most prominent economists of the Austrian school, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30154679">Ludwig von Mises</a>:</p><p><em>“There is nowadays a very reprehensible, even dangerous, semantic confusion that makes it extremely difficult for the non-expert to grasp the true state of affairs. Inflation, as this term was always used everywhere and especially in this country, means increasing the quantity of money and bank notes in circulation and the quantity of bank deposits subject to check. But people today use the term "inflation" to refer to the phenomenon that is an inevitable consequence of inflation, that is the tendency of all prices and wage rates to rise. The result of this deplorable confusion is that there is no term left to signify the cause of this rise in prices and wages.”</em></p><p>If, therefore, there can be many causes of price increases, there cannot be as many causes of inflation because it is itself an origin of price increases. It would be much more adequate and intellectually honest to say that the decrease in purchasing power can result from several factors including inflation, i.e. the printing of money.</p><h2>Money Flooding</h2><p>So how has the European Central Bank behaved in terms of monetary issuance in recent years? The most effective figure to understand this is the ECB balance sheet, which shows the countervalue of assets held: those assets for which the Eurotower does not pay but acquires by creating new currency. As of October 2022, the ECB held almost EUR 9 trillion. Before the pandemic, at the beginning of 2019, it had around EUR 4.75 trillion. Frankfurt has almost doubled its money supply in three and a half years.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>If we measure the amount of euros circulating in the form of banknotes and deposits - the figure defined as M1 - the number is slightly more reassuring, but not much: at the beginning of 2019 there were almost EUR 8.5 trillion in circulation, today there are 11.7 trillion. A growth of 37.6%.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Are we really sure, then, that this price growth - or as it is wrongly called by everyone, inflation - comes from nowhere? Or that it is just a consequence of the war in Ukraine? Given the amount of money supply injected into the market in the last three years, we should count ourselves lucky that the average price growth of goods and services is still stuck at 10%, due to the restrictions of the pandemic and the subsequent economic crisis we are entering.</p><p>What does Bitcoin have to do with all this? Bitcoin has everything to do with it because it was born as an alternative to the economic catastrophes for which central banks continue to make themselves responsible. An alternative to the bubbles of unsustainable growth alternating with ruinous crises caused by the market manipulation of the interventionist utopia. Bitcoin cannot tell the world that “<em>inflation came from nowhere,</em>” because its code is public and everyone can check its monetary policy. A policy that does not change and cannot be manipulated. It is fixed and will remain so. 2.1 quadrillion satoshis. Not one more.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Federico Rivi.

Over the long term, those who don't have good money management skills could get into financial trouble if they don’t repay their debts in time, as interest rates can be excessive.</p><p>Until <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">a Bitcoin standard</a> incentivizes credit card users to tear apart that piece of plastic forever and adopt a debt-free living, people will keep spending money they don’t have in their possession. Many bitcoiners would argue (sarcastically or otherwise) that a credit card's only meaningful utility is to buy more bitcoin.” Joke or not, you should be aware of the trade-offs involved in using a credit card to buy bitcoin, as the added costs to the transaction might not be worth it. </p><p>This article will shed some light on the advantages and disadvantages of using a credit card to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin">buy bitcoin</a> and whether an alternative option should be considered. </p><h2>Pros &amp; Cons of Using a Credit Card to Buy Bitcoin</h2><p>Pros:  </p><ul><li>Convenience: You can buy bitcoin even if you don’t hold the cash. </li><li>Speed: If the bitcoin exchange you’re using allows it, you can buy bitcoin with a credit card. While bank transfers may take up to two days to be processed, the purchase is instant with a credit card.</li><li>Funds: Credit cards are an easy way to purchase bitcoin; however, you’re entering into debt with a financial institution and you should consider that the interest rates and fees involved for the transaction might be very high.</li><li>Rewards: You can accrue credit card rewards such as cash back, travel points or miles if your provider allows it with cryptocurrency.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Debt: When you purchase goods or services with a credit card, other than high transaction fees, you are also entering a debt with a bank or a financial institution and agreeing to pay interest rates that could be very high.</li><li>Cash advance: Think of cash withdrawals from an ATM with a credit card: they are more costly than debit cards. Payment with a credit card to buy bitcoin can be regarded as a cash advance by the card issuer and you should consider the following fees applied to such a service: </li></ul><ol><li>Fees could be as high as 3-5% of the transaction amount;</li><li>APR on the interest can get very high if you don’t pay off your entire monthly credit card bill;</li><li>loss of a grace period of usually 21 days before you are charged interest;</li><li>loss of rewards, as your card issuer likely won’t apply rewards to crypto purchase as it’s considered cash equivalent;</li></ol><ul><li>KYC: “Know your customer” procedures are heavily applied to buying bitcoin with a credit card, to the point that the card issuer might block your purchase, based on bitcoin volatility and fraud potential. </li><li>Credit score: Depending on your jurisdiction and credit card provider, your credit score might be affected.</li><li>High fees: The overall amount of fees you’d have to incur for buying bitcoin with a credit card could be considerable. </li></ul><p>In the next section, you can find details on the types of fees to be considered for both the credit card provider and the exchange you use to buy bitcoin. Remember to consider these when buying bitcoin with a credit card because they can make a great difference in the final bill.</p><h2>Types of Fees to be Expected</h2><h3>Credit Card Company Fees</h3><p>Provided the financial institution or a bank allows customers to buy bitcoin with a credit card, they will charge a number of fees that are usually higher than other payment methods. This is because credit card issuers treat buying bitcoin as a cash advance rather than a regular purchase:</p><ul><li>Cash advance: fees could be as high as 3-5% of the transaction amount. </li></ul><ul><li>Cash advance interest rate: APR on the interest can get very high, often over 25%, and starts accruing the day you purchase bitcoin until you pay the credit off. This is in contrast with regular card purchase interest rates that start getting charged after a period of three to four weeks, depending on the card provider.</li></ul><h3>Cryptocurrency Exchange Fees</h3><p>While most cryptocurrency exchanges and brokers will let you buy bitcoin with a credit card, you should not take it for granted. Many Bitcoin services won’t allow credit card purchases because of their chargeback time limit, considering it may take up to six months for a credit card transaction to be finalized. </p><p>For those services that offer credit card purchases of bitcoin, here are the fees outlined below:</p><ul><li>Commission or service fee: Applied for using a credit card to buy bitcoin. For example, U.S. cardholders may have to pay the exchange a commission fee of around 3% for buying bitcoin with a credit card.</li><li>Foreign exchange fee: If the exchange is based outside of your jurisdiction, you might have to pay a foreign exchange fee of typically 3%.</li></ul><div>  </div><h2>How to Buy Bitcoin With a Credit Card</h2><p>Depending on the jurisdiction or the type of cryptocurrency exchange, you may have to go through a verification process before buying bitcoin with a credit card. </p><p>Before connecting your credit card to your exchange or broker account, you’ll have to open an account with the service provider and verify an identification method, usually a passport or driver’s license. </p><p>Find below the usual steps to follow to buy bitcoin with a credit card:</p><ol><li>Sign up: Most platforms will require you to go through KYC procedures and verify your identity. Only after that will you be able to buy bitcoin with a credit card or any other type of payment available.</li><li>Link the credit card: After signing up and verifying your account, you can link the credit card from the payment setting page. </li><li>Set the amount to buy instantly: Some platforms will require you to use your credit card to buy fiat currency and deposit it onto your exchange or broker account before executing any transaction. Others will allow you to deposit directly onto your private wallet with a credit card purchase. Check with the exchange which options you have available and make sure you have a wallet address available for the purchase. </li><li>Choose the option “Buy with credit card.” and click “buy”.</li></ol><h2>Are There Better Options Than Using a Credit Card?</h2><p>There are better <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin">ways to buy bitcoin</a>, less expensively and more anonymously. Undoubtedly, buying with a credit card is the most convenient way. Still, if you can take your time, you should consider alternatives like bank transfers and even gift cards, prepaid cards and cash if you want to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/how-to-buy-bitcoin-anonymously">buy bitcoin anonymously</a>.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How long does a credit card bitcoin transaction take to complete? </h3><p>Depending on your credit card issuer, it may take from 30 minutes to a couple of hours on average, but up to 12 hours in case the financial company needs to check additional ID and banking information. </p><h3>Is it safe to buy bitcoin with credit cards? </h3><p>Other than the typical issues related to the risks of using your bank details online, it is safe to use a credit card to buy bitcoin.</p><h3>Can I fund my bitcoin wallet with a credit card?</h3><p>Yes, non-custodial brokers like Coinmama, Coingate and Paybis allow you to buy bitcoin and send it directly to your wallet.</p><h3>Which apps can I use to buy bitcoin instantly with a credit card?</h3><p>Most apps require that you have a balance with their platform before buying bitcoin. However, that balance can be filled with a credit card instantly, giving you a chance to buy bitcoin immediately after.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Regular purchases of bitcoin should not be executed with a credit card. It should be a one-off purchase if you’re in a hurry to buy or it’s the first time you’re trying to buy bitcoin. It is a convenient way to execute a transaction and allows you to buy bitcoin even if you don’t have the cash available. Still, its disadvantages outweigh the positives, as you may have realized from this article.</p><p><br>Given the number of options available to buy bitcoin nowadays, we recommend exploring them and choosing the most suitable for you.

Contrary to the prevalent political narrative that bitcoin mining destroys the planet, the efforts of these landfill miners demonstrate that nothing could be further from the truth. </p><p>In fact, the net positive effects of these mining teams are enough to silence environmental critics forever. This article explores the early stages of companies building mining operations at landfills and looks at the potential opportunities that this resource — read: trash — presents for Bitcoin.</p><h2>Bitcoin’s Emerging Trash Trend</h2><p>Most instances of discussing landfills and bitcoin together usually involve very early adopters who mined absurd amounts of cheap bitcoin on their computers and subsequently lost or discarded their hard drives that contained fortunes. One early bitcoin miner is even planning an<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/hard-drive-lost-bitcoin-landfill/"> expensive landfill excavation project</a> to retrieve half a billion dollars in misplaced digital gold. Another landfill made headlines because of its response to an inordinately large amount of “<a href="https://www.cherokeescout.com/local-newsletter/landfill-cracking-down-foam-crypto-mining">incompressible foam</a>” that one bitcoin mining company tried to dump.</p><p>These crazy stories aside, today’s bitcoin miners target landfills for power to earn new bitcoin, not as targets for retrieving old ones. <a href="https://vespene.energy/">Vespene Energy</a> and<a href="https://xcelplusint.com/crypto-mining/"> XcelPlus International</a> are two of the earliest entrants into this new segment of the bitcoin mining industry. I have heard of other similar projects currently building in stealth will join them following public announcements coming in the next year or two. In a recent study on the environmental effects of bitcoin mining, the White House<a href="https://twitter.com/Vespene_Energy/status/1567956516300537858"> directly mentioned</a> landfill-focused bitcoin mining efforts. </p><p>But not all approaches to landfill-powered bitcoin mining are the same. Vespene, for example, “uses landfill methane to fuel bitcoin mining,” according to its<a href="https://vespene.energy/"> website</a>. This business model can quickly affect a non-trivial amount of methane emissions reduction at scale since landfill waste is responsible for about<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/landfills-around-world-release-lot-methane-study-2022-08-10/"> 11% of global methane emissions</a>. XcelPlus, by comparison, uses<a href="https://xcelplusint.com/crypto-mining/"> plasma gasification</a> machines to<a href="https://xcelplusint.com/landfills/"> generate thermal energy</a> and also earn disposal fees for the trash it receives from landfills on top of bitcoin mining rewards — a nice two-for-one deal!</p><h2>Quantifying The Global Garbage Supply</h2><p>So, exactly how abundant is trash as a resource for bitcoin mining? The short answer is: very.</p><p>Here’s a bit of data to detail just how plentiful the world’s supply of garbage is:</p><ul><li>Humans produce<a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/trends_in_solid_waste_management.html"> 4.5 trillion pounds</a> of trash each year.</li><li>The size of an average landfill is roughly<a href="https://www.waste360.com/mag/waste_mapping_landfill_space"> 600 acres</a>.</li></ul><p>Getting an accurate tally of how many landfills exist in the world is almost impossible (Google certainly isn’t any help). But there’s a garbage clock that provides<a href="https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/state-of-the-planet/world-waste-facts"> a real-time count</a> of how much trash is created each day. Landfills can be an energy bonanza for bitcoin miners.</p><p>North America has <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/u-s-becomes-worlds-biggest-bitcoin-miner-beating-china">made headlines</a> for becoming an emerging Mecca to bitcoin mining companies. So, for the purpose of this article, it’s worth noting that the U.S. alone is home to more than<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ecenter/2021/04/15/hidden-damage-landfills"> 3,000 active landfills</a> and roughly 10,000 inactive ones. Canada has roughly<a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/eccc/documents/pdf/cepa/2022reducingmethaneDD-eng.pdf"> 3,000 landfills</a> of its own, according to a discussion paper published earlier this year. Both countries were listed in the top-five total<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090716/5-countries-produce-most-waste.asp"> trash producing nations</a>. And both countries ranked as the top two countries by<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/689809/per-capital-msw-generation-by-country-worldwide"> per capita waste generation</a>.</p><p>The line chart below visualizes annual growth in the world’s total garbage supply from estimates published by Smithsonian Magazine in an<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/when-will-we-hit-peak-garbage-7074398"> article</a> asking when the world will hit “peak garbage.” The answer? Not any time soon.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Advantages Of Landfill Bitcoin Mining</h2><p>Garbage has some unique advantages as a fuel source that readers should not overlook. For one thing, its abundance opens a massive opportunity for potential hash rate growth as landfill methane capture and plasma gasification infrastructure is installed. And the data cited in the previous section more than corroborates the plentifulness of trash. For another, landfills are globally distributed — trash is everywhere. Similar to the distribution of the Bitcoin network itself, miners can go almost anywhere to turn trash into energy for bitcoin mining. Also, this form of energy is truly stranded and wasted, making miners not just a buyer of last resort for this resource, but also one of the only buyers. Landfill methane reduction by other means is<a href="https://www.wastedive.com/news/opinion-ierm-landfill-methane-reduction-biden/609693/"> limited</a>.</p><p>Lastly, and most importantly, bitcoin mining at landfills supercharges the environmentally-friendly narratives around bitcoin mining that counteract seemingly non-stop climate activist criticisms. Some reports label landfills as “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/methane-menace-aerial-survey-spots-super-emitter-landfills-2021-06-18/">super emitters</a>.” Landfills are the world’s<a href="https://www.globalmethane.org/documents/landfill_fs_eng.pdf"> third-largest</a> anthropogenic source of methane. And of the trillions of pounds of trash produced each year, some “<a href="https://datatopics.worldbank.org/what-a-waste/trends_in_solid_waste_management.html">extremely conservative</a>” estimates suggest barely 33% of that waste is handled in any sort of environmentally-conscious manner.</p><p>The stage could not be better set for bitcoin miners to consume literal trash and reduce methane emissions. XcelPlus, for example, flatly states the pollution-reduction advantages of its form of bitcoin mining. According to its<a href="https://xcelplusint.com/crypto-mining/"> website</a>, “The amount of energy consumed by the Bitcoin mining process is vast, expensive and polluting… By funneling waste coal, garbage and other hazardous waste streams through our XcelPlus Plasma gasifier, it can convert 50 tons of waste per day into energy.”</p><p>It's not hyperbolic to say this could be game over for environmental criticisms of bitcoin mining.</p><h2>The Future Of Trash And Bitcoin</h2><p>Most of the headlines from the past few years about miners using stranded energy resources have focused on conventional fuels like<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-will-explode-in-africa"> solar</a>,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/oil-companies-partner-with-bitcoin-miners"> natural gas</a> and others. But garbage production is almost unending, to the point that some analysts say we are “<a href="https://www.roadrunnerwm.com/blog/landfills-were-running-out-of-space">running out of room</a>” to store it all. And now, bitcoin mining companies are building and deploying technology to harness literal trash as an energy source for mining. Not only is this a somewhat infinitely renewable resource (using the term in an unconventional but not inaccurate way), but powering the Bitcoin network with trash also undercuts environmental criticisms of bitcoin since the benefits of limiting trash emissions are indisputable.</p><p>Landfill mining puts the resourcefulness and creativity of bitcoin mining on full display as magic internet money entrepreneurs use energy resources that no one else will or can exploit. Soon, infrastructure for the honey badger of money will be supported by actual garbage, making the world’s largest decentralized financial network more resistant than ever. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Zack Voell.

To be among the first to receive these insights and other on-chain bitcoin market analysis straight to your inbox, </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/"><em>subscribe now</em></a><em>.</em></strong></p><h2>Speculation And Yields</h2><p>This cycle has been super charged by speculation and yield, leading all the way back to the initial Grayscale Bitcoin Trust premium arbitrage opportunity. That opportunity in the market incentivized hedge funds and trading shops from all over the world to lever up in order to capture the premium spread. It was a ripe time for making money, especially back in early 2021 before the trade collapsed and switched to the significant discount we see today. </p><p>The same story existed in the perpetual futures market where we saw 7-day average annualized funding rates reach up to 120% at peak. This is the implied annual yield that long positions were paying in the market to short positions. There were an abundance of opportunities in the GBTC and futures markets alone for yield and quick returns to be had — without even mentioning the bucket of DeFi, staking tokens, failed projects and Ponzi schemes that were generating even higher yield opportunities in 2020 and 2021. </p><p>There’s an ongoing, vicious feedback loop where higher prices drive more speculation and leverage, which, in turn, drive higher yields. Now, we’re dealing with this cycle in reverse. Lower prices wipe out more speculation and leverage while washing out any “yield” opportunities. As a result, yields everywhere have collapsed. </p><p>“Total value locked” in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem surpassed over $100 billion in 2021 during the speculative mania, and is now a mere $23.9 billion today. This leverage-fueled mania in the crypto ecosystem fueled the growth of the “yield” products offered by the market, most of which have all collapsed now that the figurative tide has drawn out.&nbsp;</p><figure>

        <figcaption>The total value locked in Ethereum DeFi ecosystem has mostly disappeared</figcaption>
    </figure><p>This dynamic brought about the rise of bitcoin and cryptocurrency yield-generating products, from Celsius to BlockFi to FTX and many more. Funds and traders capture a juicy spread while kicking back some of those profits to the retail users who keep their coins on exchanges to get a small amount of interest and yield. Retail users know little about where the yield comes from or the risks involved. Now, all of those short-term opportunities in the market seem to have evaporated. </p><p>With all of the speculative trades and yield gone, how can companies still offer such high-yielding rates that are well above traditional “risk-free” rates in the market? Where does the yield come from? Not to single out or FUD any specific companies, but take Nexo for example. Rates for USDC and USDT are still at 10% versus 1% on other DeFi platforms. The same goes for bitcoin and ethereum rates, 5% and 6% respectively, while other rates are largely nonexistent elsewhere. </p><p>These high borrow rates are collateralized with bitcoin and ether offering a 50% LTV (loan-to-value ratio) while a number of other speculative tokens can be used as collateral as well at a much lower LTV. Nexo <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1597268175598813186?s=20&amp;t=iP6FkpMJc9XZKIkUNaSRDw">shared a detailed thread</a> on their business operations and model. As we’ve found out time and time again, we can never know for sure which institutions to trust or not to trust as this industry de-leveraging continues. However, the main questions to ask are: </p><ol><li>Will a 13.9% loan demand be a sustainable business model going forward into this bear market? Won’t rates have to come down further? </li><li>Regardless of Nexo’s risk management practices, are there heightened counterparty risks currently for holding customer balances on numerous exchanges and DeFi protocols?&nbsp;</li></ol><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1596948568329588736"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><figure>

    </figure><p>It's been exactly 11 months and two days since we <a href="https://tftc.io/tag/discreet-log-contracts/">wrote about discreet log contracts</a> (DLCs) in this rag. For those of you who are a bit rusty or completely ignorant in regards to what a Discreet Log Contract is, it is a special type of bitcoin transaction that executes a smart contract with information provided by an oracle.</p><p>For example, if two people want to bet on the outcome of Saturday's NBA contest between the 76ers and Grizzlies they could create a DLC by locking up funds in a multisig address, pre-constructing outcome transactions — if the 76ers win send the sats to this address, if the Grizzlies win send the sats to this address — and choosing an oracle, a company that publishes final scores, e.g., <a href="https://www.statmuse.com/">Statmuse</a>. The oracle provides a hash of the outcome of the game. When the game is over on Saturday the DLC could be closed out by the winner of the bet by signing the transaction that moves the sats in the smart contract to their address using the hash of the outcome provided by Statmuse.</p><p>A sports bet is but one example. Individuals could decide to wager on the price of bitcoin, the hash rate at a certain block height, the temperature on a particular day, or even create peer-to-peer derivatives like the team from <a href="https://comit.network/blog/2022/01/11/cfd-protocol-explained/">ItchySats</a> has done. If you freaks have been following our coverage of DLCs throughout the years, you probably know that your Uncle Marty is pretty bullish about the potential for DLCs to disrupt a number of industries. However, to date, one of the things limiting DLCs from hitting a critical tipping point is the fact that they have only been conducted on chain. Considering how many potential applications that could leverage DLCs and how many end users they could potentially touch, the thought of scaling this use case on chain seems untenable, especially if one considers the possibility of periods of elevated transaction fees that make certain DLCs uneconomical. To me, it makes sense for DLCs to operate on Layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network or Fedimint, which have relatively cheap fees.</p><p>Well, the Crypto Garage team <a href="https://medium.com/crypto-garage/dlc-on-lightning-cb5d191f6e64">announced</a> that they successfully opened and closed a Lightning channel with an embedded DLC channel on mainnet. Per their blogpost, it looks like the Crypto Garage team forked the Lightning Development Kit to add support for splitting a Lightning channel, which has enabled them to create a DLC channel within a Lightning channel. From there, they were able to create special transactions — a split transaction and a glue transaction — that would enable the different parties engaged in a DLC to update the state of their contract within the Lightning channel and the DLC channel without giving one of the parties an unfair advantage, which was one of the big design challenges that was previously unsolved. This is a massive step in the right direction.</p><p>With that being said, the Crypto Garage team is warning that this implementation is in its very early days and should not be considered stable. In fact, they warn that you are likely to lose your sats if you try to execute this on mainnet. Nonetheless, this is incredible to see. Shoutout to the Crypto Garage team and those that helped them out for pushing this forward.</p><p>Slowly but surely, as every naysayer on the planet is claiming bitcoin a failed Ponzi scheme, those who recognize the revolutionary nature of the protocol are building the tools that make bitcoin more useful for individuals the world over.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5MzcyODY3/bitcoin-over-altcoins.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTE1NjkxNDEyOTg5NjE3/dlcs.png" height="630" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTE1NjkxOTQ5OTI1ODkz/dlc-tldr.png" height="302" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maturation Of The Lightning Network: Growing Up By Going Vertical]]></title><description><![CDATA[Like our hunter-gatherer ancestors, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is maturing toward mass adoption through specialization and sophistication.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-lightning-network-matures</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-lightning-network-matures</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightning network]]></category><category><![CDATA[Adoption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Roy Sheinfeld]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2022 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5ODc3NDQ5NjI5MTE2MTU4/20220531_btcfinal_best-make-your-ln-node-mobile---anthony-feliciano.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Like our hunter-gatherer ancestors, Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is maturing toward mass adoption through specialization and sophistication.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Roy Sheinfeld, the cofounder and CEO of Breez, a Lightning Network mobile app. A version of this article was originally published on </em><a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/the-maturation-of-lightning-growing-up-by-going-vertical-c5cffd0c98ea"><em>Medium</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>It’s almost tautologically true that specialization within a social system increases with sophistication. In fact, increasing specialization could be one way to define social sophistication.</p><p><strong>Example One:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our global society is pretty sophisticated. I know how to create products, ace a trivia contest about “The Wire” and find the best shawarma joints in Tel-Aviv, but I have no idea how to knit, design an efficient photovoltaic cell or where to go rock climbing around Maputo.

Everyone can weave a basket, catch a fish, light a fire, sing a song, recite the rules of the tribe, make a shelter, etc. Though their worlds are complex, their societies are simple, with very little internal differentiation or specialization.</p><p><strong>Example Two:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the early days of the web, companies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe">CompuServe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL">AOL</a> were basically one-stop online shops. They were ISPs providing basic connectivity: email; social media (i.e., chat rooms); content in the form of news, weather and so on; and search, often in the form of an actual curated directory. </p><p>As the web has become so much more complex, we engage with multiple companies for each of those functions. Including all the writing, editing, commenting, revising and so on — even a simple post like this one will involve the services of a few ISPs, a few email providers, a few cloud storage platforms, a few cloud text editors, a few image repositories and who knows how many background services.</p><p>And now it’s happening to the Lightning Network. Like any social system, our network is constantly evolving, and it looks very different now compared to how it looked in the beginning. Activity related to Lightning is becoming more specialized, and that specialization is both a symptom of and catalyst for the growth of the network.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>And Then There Was Lightning, And It Was Good</h2><p>Back in the early days of Lightning (we’re talking, like, 2018), there were basically only two kinds of company. First were the infrastructure companies that built the early implementations of the network. <a href="https://lightning.engineering/blog/3">Lightning Labs</a> got started early with lnd. Further north on the same coast, <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/">Blockstream</a> was working on c-lightning, which it has since rebranded as <a href="https://blog.blockstream.com/en-c-lightning-is-now-core-lightning/">Core Lightning</a>. Half a world and a hop or two away, <a href="https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair">Eclair</a> was emerging in France. </p><p>Then there were the “<a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-lightning-wallet-dc9ac46d32?source=collection_home---2------0-----------------------">wallets</a>,” which came in roughly three flavors. The early custodial wallets, like <a href="https://www.walletofsatoshi.com/">Wallet of Satoshi</a> and <a href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a>, offered relatively-simple UXs, but they took custody of users' funds. The early non-custodial wallets, like <a href="https://medium.com/@ACINQ/announcing-eclair-wallet-a8d8c136fc7e">Eclair</a>, <a href="https://jimmymow.medium.com/announcing-zap-a-lightning-network-wallet-47622acd89fb">Zap</a> and <a href="https://sbw.app/">SBW</a>, presented the opposite tradeoff: full user custody with a sometimes rocky UX. </p><p>Fortunately, the second-generation wallets, like <a href="https://medium.com/@ACINQ/introducing-phoenix-5c5cc76c7f9e">Phoenix</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/breez-open-beta-lightning-fast-bitcoin-payments-no-compromises-14fabca76396">Breez</a> followed close behind, and they started treating the user experience holistically, considering both users’ desire to self-custody their bitcoin and to move it without manually opening, funding and balancing channels.</p><p>This was Lightning’s proof-of-concept phase. We proponents of Lightning were claiming that it was peer-to-peer money — bitcoin for everyday purchases — and these were the basic technologies needed to transfer bitcoin from one peer to another over the network. If the wallets and protocol implementations had proved unfeasible, there would have been little point in continuing. </p><p>In effect, it was a community of dozens, maybe hundreds of people, everyone knew everyone else, and we were all working on the same, relatively fundamental problems. It was a simple social system, and there was little internal differentiation. We hunted. We gathered. </p><h2>Domesticating The Nodes</h2><p>Around 10,000 years ago, our hunter-gatherer ancestors got sick of chasing the animals and plants they needed to survive. And who could blame them? Talk about exhausting. So they switched tack and started domesticating plants and animals to have them closer to home. It must have been a great idea because it happened independently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution#/media/File:Centres_of_origin_and_spread_of_agriculture.svg">in several locations</a> around the world. And this change had momentous consequences: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_demography#/media/File:World_population_growth_(log-log_scale).png">steepest growth in population</a> ever, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization#Urban_Revolution">advent of civilization</a> (in the sense of a city-based society) and an explosion of technologies from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel#History">wheel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_architecture#Neolithic">architecture</a> to centralized political systems and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing#History">writing</a>.</p><p>The basic idea is that when people tame their environments, they have more time to work on complicated things like tax codes, fad diets and open protocols. </p><p>Lightning users’ environment consists of nodes because nodes mediate all the inter/transactions on the network. Domesticating them was the next step in Lightning’s evolution.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Just as those early wallets were picking up steam, node-management tech for full nodes started to appear. Some, like <a href="https://thunderhub.io/">ThunderHub</a> and <a href="https://www.ridethelightning.info/">Ride The Lightning</a>, among others, were effectively second-layer, node-management tech, helping users execute operations and adjust the configuration of their nodes. Others, like <a href="https://raspiblitz.org/">RaspiBlitz</a> and <a href="https://umbrel.com/">Umbrel</a>, were designed to help users install and configure nodes. </p><p>Such node-management tech is easy to overlook in the evolution of Lightning, but it’s important because it fosters <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/sources-of-centralization-on-lightning-and-why-they-matter-b7aa3352231f?source=collection_home---2------24-----------------------">decentralization</a>, which is a value in itself and a vital means of maintaining the network’s robustness.</p><p>And the next phase of that evolution has already emerged. <a href="https://voltage.cloud/">Voltage</a>, for example, offers scalable, enterprise-grade cloud nodes. Instead of a handy tool to run a node, companies can now rent a fully operational node with the capacity and connectivity they need on demand.</p><p>Note that the benefits of node-management tech are largely unintended. Just like whoever invented the wheel did not have high-speed rails and Swiss watches in mind, those who started working on node-management tech probably just wanted more features for their own use. However, they’re facilitating new network features that are vital to Lightning’s robustness and growth (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheLightningNetwork/comments/m4xnqp/idea_liquidity_swap_triangles/">liquidity triangles</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/introducing-lightning-service-providers-fe9fb1665d5f?source=collection_home---4------7-----------------------">LSPs</a>), not to mention how they flatten the learning curve for incoming users.</p><p>Just like hunter-gatherers achieved a quantitative and qualitative leap in the complexity of their societies when they tamed the things their societies depended on (plants and animals), the second phase in the evolution of Lightning was a process of domesticating the nodes upon which our network depends.</p><h2>Going Vertical</h2><p>Early in the agrarian revolution, and in many places in the world today, farmers actually refine their own products. That is, a shepherd family might make and sell yarn, leather, milk, cheese, meat, sausages and so on that they make themselves. Generally though, the best sausage maker and the best cheese maker specialized to better serve their respective markets. After a few generations, neither can shear a sheep, but together they can compose a charcuterie board that would have shocked their ancestors with its decadence and refinement.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>The fruits (and meats! and cheeses!) of vertical differentiation and specialization. (Image: </em><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/vwcampin/43356503252"><em>Shelby L. Bell</em></a><em>).</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>After a few more generations, we have the current scenario where I cannot make cheese or sausage, but I can debug in seven different languages.</p><p>Just as civilization inevitably underwent (and is always undergoing) a process of vertical differentiation and specialization, which makes it more sophisticated, the current, expected and vital trend in Lightning is that companies are specializing in ever-smaller niches to provide ever-better user experiences. These niches are both functional and geographical.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.opennode.com/">OpenNode</a> quickly added a Lightning point-of-sale (PoS) mode to its existing on-chain offering. We followed soon after with <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/breezs-point-of-sale-mode-a-new-tool-for-the-day-after-tomorrow-fb8c0ba660a5?source=collection_home---2------23-----------------------">our non-custodial, point-of-sale mode</a> back in early 2020, and a few months later there was <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/mainstreaming-lightning-3-practical-options-for-merchants-7cc21826dc0d?source=collection_home---2------19-----------------------">a small cadre of point-of-sale solutions</a> for merchants who wanted to accept bitcoin over Lightning. </p><p>After a little more sophistication, the second phase of building infrastructure began, and ever-more infrastructure companies arose in ever-more vertical niches. For example, some offer PoS with fiat on-ramps (e.g., <a href="https://strike.me/global/">Strike</a>) and fiat off-ramps (e.g., <a href="https://www.cryptoconvert.co.za/">CryptoConvert</a>, <a href="https://www.poweredbyibex.io/?trk=organization-update_share-update_update-text">IBEX</a>, etc.). There are also self-hosted, bitcoin-only, PoS solutions operated locally (e.g., <a href="https://lnbits.com/">lnbits</a>, <a href="https://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay</a>, <a href="https://www.lnpay.co/">LNPay</a>, etc.).</p><p>To serve the variable amounts of liquidity that merchants and users might need (think Spirit Halloween in April versus in September), liquidity marketplaces have opened up. <a href="https://www.bitrefill.com/thor-lightning-network-channels/?hl=en">Bitrefill’s Thor</a> began selling channels quite early on. Now, liquidity management and channel funding have become a cottage industry in their own right, counting such participants as <a href="https://lightningnetwork.plus/">lightning network+</a>, <a href="https://docs.amboss.space/space/magma">Magma from Amboss</a> and <a href="https://lightning.engineering/pool/">Lightning Pool</a>. <a href="https://synonym.to/blocktank">Synonym’s Blocktank</a> is on track to become a multi-purpose Lightning service provider (LSP) with a broad palette of services. And <a href="https://bolt.observer/">bolt.observer</a> is a service tailored to LSPs that helps them to monitor the state of their nodes.</p><p>The same thing is happening to:</p><ul><li>Gaming (e.g., <a href="https://zebedee.io/">Zebedee,</a> <a href="https://www.thndr.games/">THNDR Games</a>)</li><li>Streaming media (e.g., <a href="https://medium.com/breez-technology/podcasts-on-breez-streaming-sats-for-streaming-ideas-d9361ae8a627?source=collection_home---2------15-----------------------">Breez</a>, <a href="https://wavlake.com/">Wavlake</a>, <a href="https://www.fountain.fm/">Fountain</a>)</li><li>Financial trading (e.g., <a href="https://lnmarkets.com/en">LN Markets</a>, <a href="https://kollider.xyz/">Kollider</a>, <a href="https://loft.trade/">Loft</a>)</li><li>Chat and social media (e.g., <a href="https://sphinx.chat/">Sphinx</a>, <a href="https://www.zion.fyi/">Zion</a>, <a href="https://starbackr.com/">Starbackr</a>)</li><li>News and commentary (e.g., <a href="https://stacker.news/">Stacker News</a>)</li></ul><p>Beyond the functional differentiation, there is also geographical specialization, which makes sense given regulatory differences and localization needs. <a href="https://www.bitcoinbeach.com/">Bitcoin Beach</a>, though not exactly a company, famously helped to foster the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador by priming the local <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/scaling-lighting-el-zonte">circular economy in El Zonte</a>. <a href="https://bitnob.com/">Bitnob </a>is helping Africans stack sats and accept remittances. <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-global-crypto-adoption-index/">Vietnam is leading the world</a> in bitcoin adoption for the second year in a row, and one reason is that <a href="https://neutronpay.com/">Neutronpay</a> has been feeding the market with Lightning-based solutions. Also in South East Asia, <a href="https://pouch.ph/">Pouch.ph</a> has been bringing Lightning to the Filipino masses.</p><p>So where is this trend of increasing specialization leading?</p><p>It’s no exaggeration to say that there are now more <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalmarket.asp">vertical markets</a>, each containing several companies, in the Lightning ecosystem than there were Lightning companies only five years ago. As a social system — a technology and organizational structure through which we interact with each other — Lightning is becoming far more sophisticated.</p><h2>The Future Of Functional Differentiation</h2><p>Specialization is so widespread in social structures because it increases <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/quote/adam-smith-on-the-greater-productivity-brought-about-by-the-division-of-labor-and-technological-innovation-1760s">efficiency and productivity</a>, which in turn fosters growth. Although the web of 1995 was structurally far simpler than the web of 2005 or 2015, it became easier to use with each passing decade. As a result, the pool of 16 million early adopters grew by an even billion in a decade, and now nearly 70% of the world’s population <a href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/emarketing.htm">use it regularly</a>. </p><p>It might sound counterintuitive, but greater specialization and sophistication feeds growth.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>And it’s how Lightning will grow too. As more and more experts from more and more different fields of activity discover Lightning and integrate it into the solutions they’re providing anyway, more and more users will be onboarded — often without even knowing about it. </p><p>Take <a href="https://www.synota.io/">Synota</a> for example. They connect Lightning payment apps to smart meters to help make energy payments instantaneous, final and based on real-time prices. Gas and electricity flow in one direction, sats flow in the other. It’s a great idea, whatever means of exchange it uses, and it just happens to make more sense with Lightning. If they can deliver efficiency gains to their users, then they’ll be onboarding people onto the network who may have never heard of Lightning and not care in the least about multipath payments or anchor channels.</p><p>For us on the Lightning side, the challenge is going to be making adoption easy without sacrificing the technological integrity of our solutions and to keep the barriers as low as possible for all incoming users, be they LSPs, merchants, consumers, Lightning wizards or complete n00bs. Of course, one way to meet this challenge is with more specialization — different offerings for different user groups. If we get this right, growth will come organically, naturally and inevitably.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Roy Sheinfeld.

The Shrimp Fields</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Everything is gone.”</em></p><p><em>–Kolyani Mondal</em></p><p><em> </em></p></blockquote><p>Fifty-two years ago, Cyclone Bhola killed an<a href="https://www.preventionweb.net/blog/whats-changed-1970-great-bhola-cyclone"> estimated</a> 1 million people in coastal Bangladesh. It is, to this day, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970_Bhola_cyclone#:~:text=The%201970%20Bhola%20cyclone%20(Also,the%20world's%20deadliest%20natural%20disasters.">deadliest tropical cyclone in recorded history</a>. Local and international authorities knew well the catastrophic risks of such storms: in the 1960s, regional officials <a href="https://water104website.weebly.com/bangladesh-flooding-and-impacts.html">had built a massive array of dikes</a> to protect the coastline and open up more territory for farming. But in the 1980s after the assassination of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, foreign influence pushed a new autocratic Bangladeshi regime to change course. Concern for human life was dismissed and the public’s protection against storms was weakened, all in order to boost exports to repay debt.</p><p>Instead of reinforcing the local mangrove forests which naturally protected the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/climate-change-drives-migration-crisis-in-bangladesh-from-dhaka-sundabans">one-third of the population that lived near the coast</a>, and instead of investing in growing food to feed the quickly growing nation, the government took out loans from the <a href="http://madadoc.irenala.edu.mg/documents/9353_Shrimp%20report-WorldBank.pdf">World Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=55&amp;date1key=2013-11-30">International Monetary Fund</a> in order to expand shrimp farming. The aquaculture process — controlled by a <a href="https://puccifoods.com/hidden-human-cost-part-1-abuse-injustice-bangladesh-shrimp-farming-industry/">network</a> of wealthy elites linked to the regime — involved pushing farmers to take out loans to “upgrade” their operations by drilling holes in the dikes that protected their land from the ocean, filling their once-fertile fields with saltwater. Then, they would work back-breaking hours to hand-harvest young shrimp from the ocean, drag them back to their stagnant ponds, and sell the mature ones to the local shrimp lords.</p><p>With <a href="http://madadoc.irenala.edu.mg/documents/9353_Shrimp%20report-WorldBank.pdf">financing</a> from the World Bank and IMF, countless farms and their surrounding wetlands and mangrove forests were engineered into shrimp ponds known as <em>ghers</em>. The area’s Ganges river delta is an incredibly fertile place, home to the <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/798/">Sundarbans</a>, the world’s biggest stretch of mangrove forest. But as a result of commercial shrimp farming becoming the region’s main economic activity, <a href="https://www.wrm.org.uy/bulletin-articles/bangladesh-losing-mangroves-to-shrimp-farming-leads-to-food-loss-and-environmental-insecurity">45%</a> of the mangroves have been cut away, leaving millions of people exposed to the 10-meter waves that can crash against the coast during major cyclones. Arable land and river life has been slowly destroyed by excess salinity leaking in from the sea. Entire forests have <a href="https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/desert_in_the_delta.pdf">vanished</a> as shrimp farming <a href="https://www.cdpbd.org/images/files/Working%20together%20for%20eco-friendly%20responsible%20shrimp%20farming.pdf">has</a> killed much of the area’s vegetation, "rendering this once bountiful land into a watery desert,” according to Coastal Development Partnership.</p><figure>

The nation’s export-driven profits came at the expense of the shrimp laborers, whose wages were deflated and whose environment was destroyed.</p><p>In a report by the Environmental Justice Foundation, a coastal farmer named Kolyani Mondal <a href="https://ejfoundation.org/resources/downloads/desert_in_the_delta.pdf">said</a> that she “used to farm rice and keep livestock and poultry,” but after shrimp harvesting was imposed, “her cattle and goats developed diarrhea-type disease and together with her hens and ducks, all died.” </p><p>Now her fields are flooded with salt water, and what remains is barely productive: years ago her family could generate “18-19 mon of rice per hectare,” but now they can only generate one. She remembers shrimp farming in her area beginning in the 1980s, when villagers were promised more income as well as lots of food and crops, but now “everything is gone.” The shrimp farmers who use her land promised to pay her $140 per year, but she says the best she gets are “occasional installments of $8 here or there.” In the past, she says, “the family got most of the things they needed from the land, but now there are no alternatives but going to the market to buy food.”</p><p>In Bangladesh, billions of dollars of World Bank and IMF “structural adjustment” loans — named for the way they force borrowing nations to modify their economies to favor exports at the expense of consumption — grew national shrimp profits from $2.9 million in 1973 to $90 million in 1986 to<a href="https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/livelihoods/bangladeshs-shrimp-industry-drives-freshwater-crisis/"> $590 million</a> in 2012. As in most cases with developing countries, the revenue was used to service foreign debt, develop military assets, and line the pockets of government officials. As for the shrimp serfs, they have been impoverished: less free, more dependent and less able to feed themselves than before. To make matters worse, studies show <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/04/090414172924.htm">that</a> “villages shielded from the storm surge by mangrove forests experience significantly fewer deaths” than villages which had their protections removed or damaged.</p><p>Under public pressure in 2013 the World Bank loaned Bangladesh <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2022/08/24/helping-bangladish-protect-its-coastal-communities-from-tidal-flooding-and-storm-surges">$400 million</a> to try and reverse the ecological damage. In other words, the World Bank will be paid a fee in the form of interest to try and fix the problem it created in the first place. Meanwhile, the World Bank has loaned billions to countries everywhere from <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/world-banks-destructive-policies-about-shrimp-farming-endanger-communities-in-developing-countries/">Ecuador</a> to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/23/world-bank-support-for-the-development-of-morocco-s-blue-economy">Morocco</a> to <a href="https://base.d-p-h.info/en/fiches/premierdph/fiche-premierdph-4016.html">India</a> to replace traditional farming with shrimp production.</p><p>The World Bank <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/bangladesh/overview">claims</a> that Bangladesh is “a remarkable story of poverty reduction and development.” On paper, victory is declared: countries like Bangladesh tend to show economic growth over time as their exports rise to meet their imports. But exports earnings flow mostly to the ruling elite and international creditors. After <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=55&amp;date1key=2013-11-30">10 structural adjustments</a>, Bangladesh’s debt pile has grown exponentially from <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/BGD/bangladesh/external-debt-stock">$145 million</a> in 1972 to an all-time high of<a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/bangladesh/external-debt#:~:text=Bangladesh%20External%20Debt%20reached%2095.9,USD%20bn%20in%20Mar%202012."> $95.9 billion</a> in 2022. The country is currently facing yet another balance of payments crisis, and just this month agreed to take its 11th loan from the IMF, this time a <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/11/08/pr22375-bangladesh">$4.5 billion</a> bailout, in exchange for more adjustment. The Bank and the Fund claim to want to help poor countries, but the clear outcome after more than 50 years of their policies is that nations like Bangladesh are more dependent and indebted than ever before.</p><p>During the 1990s in the wake of the Third World Debt Crisis, there was a swell of global public scrutiny on the Bank and Fund: critical studies, street protests, and a widespread, bipartisan belief (even in the <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/the_american_campaign_for_environmental_reforms_at_the_world_bank.pdf">halls</a> of the U.S. Congress) that these institutions ranged from wasteful to destructive. But this sentiment and focus has largely faded. Today, the Bank and the Fund manage to keep a low profile in the press. When they do come up, they tend to be written off as increasingly irrelevant, accepted as problematic yet necessary, or even welcomed as helpful.</p><p>The reality is that these organizations have impoverished and endangered millions of people; enriched dictators and kleptocrats; and cast human rights aside to generate a multi-trillion-dollar flow of food, natural resources and cheap labor from poor countries to rich ones. Their behavior in countries like Bangladesh is no mistake or exception: it is their preferred way of doing business.</p><h2>II.

    </figure><p>The sister organizations — physically joined together at their headquarters in Washington, DC — <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/archive/history/exhibits/Bretton-Woods-and-the-Birth-of-the-World-Bank">were created at the Bretton Woods Conference</a> in New Hampshire in 1944 as two pillars of the new U.S.-led global monetary order. Per tradition, the World Bank is headed by an American, and the IMF by a European.</p><p>Their initial purpose was to help rebuild war-torn Europe and Japan, with the Bank to focus on specific loans for development projects, and the Fund to address balance-of-payment issues via “bailouts” to keep trade flowing even if countries couldn’t afford more imports.</p><p>Nations are required to join the IMF in order to get access to the “perks” of the World Bank. Today, there are <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/memdir/memdate.htm">190 member states</a>: each one deposited a mix of their own currency plus “harder currency” (typically dollars, European currencies or gold) when they joined, creating a pool of reserves.</p><p>When members encounter chronic balance-of-payments issues, and cannot make loan repayments, the Fund offers them credit from the pool at varying multiples of what they initially deposited, on increasingly expensive terms.</p><p>The Fund is technically a supranational central bank, as since 1969 it has minted its own currency: the special drawing rights (SDR), whose value is based on a basket of the world’s top currencies. Today,<a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_sdrv.aspx"> the SDR</a> is backed by 45% dollars, 29% euros, 12% yuan, 7% yen and 7% pounds. The total lending capacity of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/16/imf-says-its-ready-to-mobilize-its-1-trillion-lending-capacity-to-fight-coronavirus.html">IMF today stands at $1 trillion</a>.</p><p>Between 1960 and 2008, the Fund largely focused on assisting developing countries with short-term, high-interest-rate loans. Because the currencies issued by developing countries are not freely convertible, they usually cannot be redeemed for goods or services abroad. Developing states must instead earn hard currency through exports. Unlike the U.S., which can simply issue the global reserve currency, countries like Sri Lanka and Mozambique often run out of money. At that point, most governments — especially authoritarian ones — prefer the quick fix of borrowing against their country’s future from the Fund.</p><p>As for the Bank, it <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/history/the-world-bank-group-and-the-imf">states</a> that its job is to provide credit to developing countries to “reduce poverty, increase shared prosperity, and promote sustainable development.” The Bank itself is split up into five parts, ranging from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which focuses on more traditional “hard” loans to the larger developing countries (think Brazil or India) to the International Development Association (IDA), which focuses on “soft” interest-free loans with long grace periods for the poorest countries. The IBRD makes money in part through the Cantillon effect: by borrowing on favorable terms from its creditors and private market participants who have more direct access to cheaper capital and then loaning out those funds at higher terms to poor countries who lack that access.</p><p>World Bank loans <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X">traditionally</a> are project- or sector-specific, and have focused on facilitating the raw export of commodities (for example: financing the roads, tunnels, dams, and ports needed to get minerals out of the ground and into international markets) and on transforming traditional consumption agriculture into industrial agriculture or aquaculture so that countries could export more food and goods to the West.</p><p>Bank and Fund member states do not have voting power based on their population. Rather, influence was crafted seven decades ago to favor the U.S., Europe and Japan over the rest of the world. That dominance has only weakened mildly in recent years.</p><p>Today the U.S. still owns far and away the largest vote share, at 15.6% of the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/leadership/votingpowers">Bank</a> and 16.5% of the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/executive-board/members-quotas">Fund</a>, enough to single-handedly veto any major decision, which requires 85% of votes at either institution. Japan owns 7.35% of the votes at the Bank and 6.14% at the Fund; Germany 4.21% and 5.31%; France and the U.K. 3.87% and 4.03% each; and Italy 2.49% and 3.02%.</p><p>By contrast, India with its 1.4 billion people only has 3.04% of the Bank’s vote and just 2.63% at the Fund: less power than its former colonial master despite having a population 20 times bigger. China’s 1.4 billion people get 5.7% at the Bank and 6.08% at the fund, roughly the same share as the Netherlands plus Canada and Australia. Brazil and Nigeria, the largest countries in Latin America and Africa, have about the same amount of sway as Italy, a former imperial power in full decline.</p><p>Tiny Switzerland with just 8.6 million people has 1.47% of votes at the World Bank, and 1.17% of votes at the IMF: roughly the same share as Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia combined, despite having <em>90 times</em> fewer people.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>These voting shares are supposed to approximate each country’s share of the world economy, but their imperial-era structure helps color how decisions are made. Sixty-five years after decolonization, the industrial powers led by the U.S. continue to have more or less total control over global trade and lending, while the poorest countries have in effect no voice at all.</p><p>The G-5 (the U.S., Japan, Germany, the U.K. and France) dominate the IMF executive board, even though they make up a relatively small percent of the world’s population. The G-10 plus Ireland, Australia, and Korea make up more than 50% of the votes, meaning that with a little pressure on its allies, the U.S. can make <a href="https://www.amazon.com/International-Monetary-Fund-Global-Economy/dp/0521194334">determinations</a> even on specific loan decisions, which require a majority.</p><p>To complement the IMF’s<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/infographics/imf-firepower-lending"> trillion-dollar</a> lending power, the World Bank group claims more than <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/08/08/world-bank-group-releases-fy22-audited-financial-statements">$350 billion</a> in outstanding loans across more than 150 countries. This credit has spiked over the past two years, as the sister organizations have <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/international-financial-institutions/imf-covid-19-financing-and-fiscal-tracker">lent</a> hundreds of billions of dollars to governments who locked down their economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Over the past few months, the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/07/19/world-bank-group-s-157-billion-pandemic-surge-is-largest-crisis-response-in-its-history">Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/FAQ/imf-response-to-covid-19">Fund</a> began orchestrating billion-dollar deals to “save” governments endangered by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes. These clients are often human rights violators who borrow without permission from their citizens, who will ultimately be the ones responsible for paying back principal plus interest on the loans. The IMF is currently bailing out Egyptian dictator Abdel Fattah El-Sisi — responsible for the largest <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2019/08/egypt-bitter-legacy-of-rabaa-massacre-continues-to-haunt-egyptians/">massacre</a> of protestors since Tiananmen Square — for example, with<a href="https://arabcenterdc.org/resource/egypt-and-the-imf-greater-foreign-debt-and-deeper-economic-decline/"> $3 billion</a>. Meanwhile, the World Bank was, during the past year, disbursing a<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ethiopia-world-bank-sign-300-mln-grant-agreement-reconstruction-2022-05-17/"> $300 million</a> loan to an Ethiopian government that was committing <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/world/genocide-in-tigray/">genocide</a> in Tigray.</p><p>The cumulative effect of Bank and Fund policies is much larger than the paper amount of their loans, as their lending drives bilateral assistance. It is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">estimated</a> that “every dollar provided to the Third World by the IMF unlocks a further four to seven dollars of new loans and refinancing from commercial banks and rich-country governments.” Similarly, if the Bank and Fund refuse to lend to a particular country, the rest of the world typically follows suit.</p><p>It is hard to overstate the <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">vast</a> impact the Bank and Fund have had across developing nations, especially in their formative decades after World War II. By 1990 and the end of the Cold War, the IMF had extended credit to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Lost-Foreign-Credit-Development/dp/0862329531">41 countries</a> in Africa, 28 countries in Latin America, 20 countries in Asia, eight countries in the Middle East and five countries in Europe, affecting 3 billion people, or what was then <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/">two-thirds of the global population</a>. The World Bank has extended loans to more than <a href="https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-country?lang=en&amp;page=">160</a> countries. They remain the most important international financial institutions on the planet.</p><h2>III. Structural Adjustment</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Adjustment is an ever new and never-ending task”</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/04/obituaries/otmar-emminger-75-west-german-banker.html"><em>Otmar Emminger</em></a><em>, former IMF director and creator of SDR</em></p></blockquote><p>Today, financial headlines are filled with stories about IMF visits to countries like <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eab481e5-9841-43a5-a072-f09124e7167d">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-11-23-2022/card/ghana-plans-debt-exchange-as-economic-crisis-mounts-HCIOCltDEPELXPNx7E7u">Ghana</a>. The outcome is that the Fund loans billions of dollars to countries in crisis in exchange for what is known as structural adjustment.</p><p>In a structural-adjustment loan, borrowers not only have to pay back principal plus interest: they also have to agree to <a href="https://www.elibrary.imf.org/display/book/9781557753021/ch05.xml?language=en">change</a> their economies according to Bank and Fund demands. These requirements almost always stipulate that clients maximize exports at the expense of domestic consumption.</p><p>During research for this essay, the author learned much from the work of the development scholar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cheryl-Payer/e/B001KIKTLQ%3Fref=dbs_a_mng_rwt_scns_share">Cheryl Payer</a>, who wrote landmark books and papers on the influence of the Bank and Fund in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This author may disagree with Payer’s “solutions” — which, like those of most critics of the Bank and Fund, tend to be socialist — but many observations she makes about the global economy hold true regardless of ideology.</p><p>“It is an explicit and basic aim of IMF programs,” she <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">wrote</a>, “to discourage local consumption in order to free resources for export.”</p><p>This point cannot be stressed enough.</p><p>The official narrative is that the Bank and Fund were <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/imf-worlds-controversial-financial-firefighter?amp">designed</a> to “foster sustainable economic growth, promote higher standards of living, and reduce poverty.” But the roads and dams the Bank builds are not designed to help improve transport and electricity for locals, but rather to make it easy for multinational corporations to extract wealth. And the bailouts the IMF provides aren’t to “save” a country from bankruptcy — which would probably be the best thing for it in many cases — but rather to allow it to pay its debt with even more debt, so that the original loan doesn’t turn into a hole on a Western bank’s balance sheet.</p><p>In her books on the Bank and Fund, Payer describes how the institutions claim that their loan conditionality enables borrowing countries “to achieve a healthier balance of trade and payments.” But the real purpose, she says, is “to bribe the governments to prevent them from making the economic changes which would make them more independent and self-supporting.” When countries pay back their structural adjustment loans, debt service is prioritized, and domestic spending is to be “adjusted” downwards.</p><p>IMF loans were often allocated through a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">mechanism</a> called the “stand-by agreement,” a line of credit that released funds only as the borrowing government claimed to achieve certain objectives. From Jakarta to Lagos to Buenos Aires, IMF staff would fly in (always first or business class) to meet undemocratic rulers and offer them millions or billions of dollars in exchange for following their economic playbook.</p><p>Typical IMF demands would <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">include</a>:</p><ol><li>Currency devaluation</li><li>Abolition or reduction of foreign exchange and import controls</li><li>Shrinking of domestic bank credit</li><li>Higher interest rates</li><li>Increased taxes</li><li>An end to consumer subsidies on food and energy</li><li>Wage ceilings</li><li>Restrictions on government spending, especially in healthcare and education</li><li>Favorable legal conditions and incentives for multinational corporations</li><li>Selling off state enterprises and claims on natural resources at fire sale prices</li></ol><p>The World Bank had its own playbook, too. Payer gives <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X">examples</a>:</p><ol><li>The opening up of previously remote regions through transportation and telecommunications investments</li><li>Aiding multinational corporations in the mining sector</li><li>Insisting on production for export</li><li>Pressuring borrowers to improve legal privileges for the tax liabilities of foreign investment</li><li>Opposing minimum wage laws and trade union activity</li><li>Ending protections for locally-owned businesses</li><li>Financing projects that appropriate land, water and forests from poor people and hand them to multinational corporations</li><li>Shrinking manufacturing and food production at the expense of the export of natural resources and raw goods</li></ol><p>Third World governments have historically been forced to agree to a mix of these policies — sometimes known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">“Washington Consensus”</a> — in order to trigger the ongoing release of Bank and Fund loans.</p><p>The former colonial powers tend to focus their “development” lending on former colonies or areas of influence: France in West Africa, Japan in Indonesia, Britain in East Africa and South Asia and the U.S. in Latin America. A notable example is the CFA zone, where 180 million people in 15 African countries are still <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-a-currency-of-decolonization">forced to use</a> a French colonial currency. At the suggestion of the IMF, in 1994 France devalued the CFA by 50%, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/23/world/french-devaluation-of-african-currency-brings-wide-unrest.html">devastating</a> the savings and purchasing power of tens of millions of people living in countries ranging from Senegal to Ivory Coast to Gabon, all to make raw goods exports <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fabric/backgrnd.htm">more competitive</a>.</p><p>The outcome of Bank and Fund policies on the Third World has been remarkably similar to what was experienced under traditional imperialism: wage deflation, a loss of autonomy and agricultural dependency. The big difference is that in the new system, the sword and the gun have been replaced by weaponized debt.</p><p>Over the last 30 years, structural adjustment has intensified with regard to the average number of conditions in loans extended by the Bank and Fund. Before 1980, the Bank did not generally make structural adjustment loans, most everything was project- or sector-specific. But since then, “spend this however you want” bailout loans with economic quid pro quos have become a growing part of Bank policy. For the IMF, they are its lifeblood.</p><p>For example, when the IMF <a href="https://www.amazon.com/International-Monetary-Fund-Global-Economy/dp/0521194334">bailed out</a> South Korea and Indonesia with $57 billion and $43 billion packages during the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, it imposed heavy conditionality. Borrowers had to sign agreements that “looked more like Christmas trees than contracts, with anywhere from 50 to 80 detailed conditions covering everything from the deregulation of garlic monopolies to taxes on cattle feed and new environmental laws,” according to political scientist Mark S. Copelvitch.</p><p>A 2014 <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-conditions/imf-loan-conditions-grow-despite-vows-to-limit-them-study-idUSBREA311SZ20140402">analysis</a> showed that the IMF had attached, on average, 20 conditions to each loan it gave out in the previous two years, a historic increase. Countries like Jamaica, Greece and Cyprus have borrowed in recent years with an average of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-conditions/imf-loan-conditions-grow-despite-vows-to-limit-them-study-idUSBREA311SZ20140402">35</a> conditions each. It is worth noting that Bank and Fund conditions have never included protections on free speech or human rights, or restrictions on military spending or police violence.</p><p>An added twist of Bank and Fund policy is what is known as the “double loan”: money is lent to build, for example, a hydroelectric dam, but most if not all of the money gets paid to Western companies. So, the Third World taxpayer is saddled with principal and interest, and the North gets paid back double.</p><p>The context for the double loan is that dominant states extend credit through the Bank and Fund to former colonies, where local rulers often spend the new cash directly back to multinational companies who profit from advising, construction or import services. The ensuing and required currency devaluation, wage controls and bank credit tightening imposed by Bank and Fund structural adjustment disadvantage local entrepreneurs who are stuck in a collapsing and isolated fiat system, and benefit multinationals who are dollar, euro or yen native.</p><p>Another key source for this author has been the masterful book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">The Lords of Poverty</a>” by historian Graham Hancock, written to reflect on the first five decades of Bank and Fund policy and foreign assistance in general. </p><p>“The World Bank,” Hancock writes, “is the first to admit that out of every $10 that it receives, around $7 are in fact spent on goods and services from the rich industrialized countries.”</p><p>In the 1980s, when Bank funding was expanding <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/archive/history">rapidly</a> around the world, he noted that “for every US tax dollar contributed, 82 cents are immediately returned to American businesses in the form of purchase orders.” This dynamic applies not just to loans but also to aid. For example, when the U.S. or Germany sends a rescue plane to a country in crisis, the cost of transport, food, medicine and staff salaries are added to what is known as ODA, or “official development assistance.” On the books, it looks like aid and assistance. But most of the money is paid right back to Western companies and not invested locally.</p><p>Reflecting on the Third World Debt Crisis of the 1980s, Hancock noted that “70 cents out of every dollar of American assistance never actually left the United States.” The U.K., for its part, spent a whopping 80% of its aid during that time directly on British goods and services. </p><p>“One year,” Hancock writes, “British tax-payers provided multilateral aid agencies with 495 million pounds; in the same year, however, British firms received contracts worth 616 million pounds.” Hancock said that multilateral agencies could be “relied upon to purchase British goods and services with a value equivalent to 120% of Britain’s total multilateral contribution.”</p><p>One starts to see how the “aid and assistance” we tend to think of as charitable is really quite the opposite.</p><p>And as Hancock points out, foreign-aid budgets always increase no matter the outcome. Just as progress is evidence that the aid is working, a “lack of progress is evidence that the dosage has been insufficient and must be increased.”</p><p>Some development advocates, he writes, “argue that it would be inexpedient to deny aid to the speedy (those who advance); others, that it would be cruel to deny it to the needy (those who stagnate). Aid is thus like champagne: in success you deserve it, in failure you need it.”</p><h2>IV. The Debt Trap</h2><blockquote><p><em>“The concept of the Third World or the South and the policy of official aid are inseparable. They are two sides of the same coin.

This was ostensibly done to help them develop. Payer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Lost-Foreign-Credit-Development/dp/0862329531">writes</a> that it was long considered “natural” for capital to “flow in one direction only from the developed industrial economies to the Third World.”</p><figure>

This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Lost-Foreign-Credit-Development/dp/0862329531">began</a> as an average of $30 billion per year flowing from South to North in the mid-to-late 1980s, and is <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">today</a> in the range of trillions of dollars per year. Between 1970 and 2007 — from the end of the gold standard to the Great Financial Crisis — the total debt service paid by poor countries to rich ones was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-IMF-World-Bank-Questions/dp/1583672222">$7.15 trillion</a>.</p><figure>

But that same year, more than $3.3 trillion flowed out. In other words, <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries">according</a> to anthropologist Jason Hickel, “developing countries sent $2 trillion more to the rest of the world than they received.” </p><p>When all the flows were added up from 1960 to 2017, a grim truth emerged: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">$62 trillion</a> was drained out of the developing world, the equivalent of 620 Marshall Plans in today’s dollars.</p><p>The IMF and World Bank were supposed to fix balance of payments issues, and help poor countries grow stronger and more sustainable. The evidence has been the direct opposite.</p><p>“For every $1 of aid that developing countries receive,” Hickel writes, “they lose $24 in net outflows.” Instead of ending exploitation and unequal exchange, studies <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">show</a> that structural adjustment policies grew them in a massive way.</p><p>Since 1970, the external public debt of developing countries has increased from $46 billion to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/10/11/low-income-country-debt-rises-to-record-860-billion-in-2020">$8.7 trillion</a>.

    </figure><p>Even Payer — whose 1974 book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">The Debt Trap</a>” used economic flow data to show how the IMF ensnared poor countries by encouraging them to borrow more than they could possibly pay back — would be shocked at the size of today’s debt trap.</p><p>Her observation that “the average citizen of the US or Europe may not be aware of this enormous drain in capital from parts of the world they think of as being pitifully poor” still rings true today. To this author’s own shame, he did not know about the true nature of the global flow of funds and simply assumed that rich countries subsidized poor ones before embarking on the research for this project. The end result is a literal Ponzi scheme, where by the 1970s, Third World debt was so big that it was only possible to service with new debt. It has been the same ever since.</p><p>Many critics of the Bank and Fund assume that these institutions are working with their heart in the right place, and when they do fail, it is because of mistakes, waste or mismanagement.</p><p>It is the thesis of this essay that this is not true, and that the foundational goals of the Fund and Bank are not to fix poverty but rather to enrich creditor nations at the expense of poor ones.</p><p>This author is simply not willing to believe that a permanent flow of funds from poor countries to rich ones since 1982 is a “mistake.” The reader may dispute that the arrangement is intentional, and rather may believe it is an unconscious structural outcome. The difference hardly matters to the billions of people the Bank and Fund have impoverished.</p><h2>V. Replacing the Colonial Resource Drain</h2><blockquote><p><em>“I am so tired of waiting. Aren’t you, for the world to become good and beautiful and kind? Let us take a knife and cut the world in two — and see what worms are eating at the rind.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3303749-i-am-so-tired-of-waiting-aren-t-you-for-the"><em>Langston Hughes</em></a></p></blockquote><p>By the end of the 1950s, Europe and Japan had largely recovered from war and resumed significant industrial growth, while Third World countries ran out of funds. Despite having healthy balance sheets in the 1940s and early 1950s, poor, raw-material-exporting countries ran into balance-of-payments <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">issues</a> as the value of their commodities tanked in the wake of the Korean War. This is when the debt trap began, and when the Bank and Fund started the floodgates of what would end up becoming trillions of dollars of lending.</p><p>This era also marked the official end of colonialism, as European empires drew back from their imperial possessions. The establishment <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">assumption</a> in international development is that the economic success of nations is due “primarily to their internal, domestic conditions. High-income countries have achieved economic success,” the theory goes, “because of good governance, strong institutions and free markets. Lower-income countries have failed to develop because they lack these things, or because they suffer from corruption, red tape and inefficiency.” </p><p>This is certainly true. But another major reason why rich countries are rich and poor countries are poor is that the former looted the latter for hundreds of years during the colonial period.</p><p>“Britain’s industrial revolution,” Jason Hickel <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">writes</a>, “depended in large part on cotton, which was grown on land forcibly appropriated from Indigenous Americans, with labor appropriated from enslaved Africans. Other crucial inputs required by British manufacturers — hemp, timber, iron, grain — were produced using forced labor on serf estates in Russia and Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, British extraction from India and other colonies funded more than half the country’s domestic budget, paying for roads, public buildings, the welfare state — all the markets of modern development — while enabling the purchase of material inputs necessary for industrialization.”</p><p>The theft dynamic was described by Utsa and Prabhat Patnaik in their book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Imperialism-Theory-History-Present/dp/1583678913"> “Capital And Imperialism</a>”: colonial powers like the British empire would use violence to extract raw materials from weak countries, creating a “colonial drain” of capital that boosted and subsidized life in London, Paris and Berlin. Industrial nations would transform these raw materials into manufactured goods, and sell them back to weaker nations, profiting massively while also crowding out local production. And — critically — they would keep inflation at home down by suppressing wages in the colonial territories. Either through outright slavery or through paying well below the global market rate.</p><p>As the colonial system began to falter, the Western financial world faced a crisis. The Patnaiks argue that the Great Depression was a result not simply of changes in Western monetary policy, but also of the colonial drain slowing down. The reasoning is simple: rich countries had built a conveyor belt of resources flowing from poor countries, and when the belt broke, so did everything else. Between the 1920s and 1960s, political colonialism became virtually extinct. Britain, the U.S., Germany, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Belgium and other empires were forced to give up control over more than half of the world’s territory and resources.</p><p>As the Patnaiks write, imperialism is “an arrangement for imposing income deflation on the Third World population in order to get their primary commodities without running into the problem of increasing supply price.” </p><p>Post 1960, this became the new function for the World Bank and IMF: recreating the colonial drain from poor countries to rich countries that was once maintained by straightforward imperialism.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Officials in the U.S., Europe and Japan wanted to achieve “internal equilibrium” — in other words, full employment. But they realized they could not do this via subsidy inside an isolated system, or else inflation would run rampant. To achieve their goal would require external input from poorer countries. The <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/if-you-want-decolonisation-go-to-the-economics-of-samir-amin">extra surplus value</a> extracted by the core from workers in the periphery is known as “imperialist rent.” If industrial countries could get cheaper materials and labor, and then sell the finished goods back at a profit, they could inch closer to the technocrat dream economy. And they got their wish: as of 2019, wages paid to workers in the developing world were <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">20%</a> the level of wages paid to workers in the developed world.</p><p>As an example of how the Bank recreated the colonial drain dynamic, Payer gives the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">case</a> of 1960s Mauritania in northwest Africa. A mining project called MIFERMA was signed by French occupiers before the colony became independent. The deal eventually became “just an old-fashioned enclave project: a city in a desert and a railroad leading to the ocean,” as the infrastructure was solely focused on spiriting minerals away to international markets. In 1969, when the mine accounted for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">30%</a> of Mauritania’s GDP and 75% of its exports, 72% of the income was sent abroad, and “practically all the income distributed locally to employees evaporated in imports.” When the miners protested against the neocolonial arrangement, security forces savagely put them down.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>MIFERMA is a stereotypical example of the kind of “development” that would be imposed on the Third World everywhere from the Dominican Republic to Madagascar to Cambodia. And all of these projects rapidly expanded in the 1970s, thanks to the petrodollar system.</p><p>Post-1973, Arab OPEC countries with enormous surpluses from skyrocketing oil prices sank their profits into deposits and treasuries in Western banks, which needed a place to lend out their growing resources. Military dictators across Latin America, Africa and Asia made great targets: they had high time preferences and were happy to borrow against future generations.</p><p>Helping expedite loan growth was the “IMF put”: private banks started to believe (correctly) that the IMF would bail out countries if they defaulted, protecting their investments. Moreover, interest rates in the mid-1970s were often in negative real territory, further encouraging borrowers. This — combined with World Bank president Robert McNamara’s insistence that assistance expand dramatically — resulted in a debt frenzy. U.S. banks, for example, increased their Third World loan portfolio by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">300%</a> to $450 billion between 1978 and 1982.</p><p>The problem was that these loans were in large part floating interest rate agreements, and a few years later, those rates exploded as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised the global cost of capital close to 20%. The growing debt burden combined with the 1979 oil price shock and the ensuing global <a href="https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Publications/Book/Book-commodites-crisis.pdf">collapse</a> in the price of commodities that power the value of developing country exports paved the way for the Third World Debt Crisis. To make matters worse, very little of the money borrowed by governments during the debt frenzy was actually invested in the average citizen.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>In their aptly named book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Squads-America-English-Portuguese/dp/0862327903">Debt Squads</a>,” investigative journalists Sue Branford and Bernardo Kucinski explain that between 1976 and 1981, Latin governments (of which 18 of 21 were dictatorships) borrowed $272.9 billion. Out of that, 91.6% was spent on debt servicing, capital flight and building up regime reserves. Only 8.4% was used on domestic investment, and even out of that, much was wasted.</p><p>Brazilian civil society advocate Carlos Ayuda vividly<a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/50_Years_is_Enough.html?id=XK6Egbw4-PcC"> described</a> the effect of the petrodollar-fueled drain on his own country:</p><blockquote><p>“The military dictatorship used the loans to invest in huge infrastructure projects — particularly energy projects… the idea behind creating an enormous hydroelectric dam and plant in the middle of the Amazon, for example, was to produce aluminum for export to the North… the government took out huge loans and invested billions of dollars in building the Tucuruí dam in the late 1970s, destroying native forests and removing massive numbers of native peoples and poor rural people that had lived there for generations. The government would have razed the forests, but the deadlines were so short they used Agent Orange to defoliate the region and then submerged the leafless tree trunks underwater… the hydroelectric plant’s energy [was then] sold at $13-20 per megawatt when the actual price of production was $48. So the taxpayers provided subsidies, financing cheap energy for transnational corporations to sell our aluminum in the international market.”</p></blockquote><p>In other words, the Brazilian people paid foreign creditors for the service of destroying their environment, displacing the masses and selling their resources.</p><p>Today the drain from low- and middle-income countries is staggering. In 2015, it <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13563467.2021.1899153">totaled</a> 10.1 billion tons of raw materials and 182 million person-years of labor: 50% of all goods and 28% of all labor used that year by high-income countries.</p><h2>VI. A Dance With Dictators</h2><blockquote><p><em>“He may be a son of a bitch, but he’s our son of a bitch.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2021/02/24/rascal/"><em>Franklin Delano Roosevelt</em></a></p></blockquote><p>Of course, it takes two sides to finalize a loan from the Bank or Fund. The problem is that the borrower is typically an unelected or unaccountable leader, who makes the decision without consulting with and without a popular mandate from their citizens.</p><p>As Payer writes in “The Debt Trap,” “IMF programs are politically unpopular, for the very good concrete reasons that they hurt local business and depress the real income of the electorate. A government which attempts to carry out the conditions in its Letter of Intent to the IMF is likely to find itself voted out of office.”</p><p>Hence, the IMF prefers to work with undemocratic clients who can more easily dismiss troublesome judges and put down street protests. According to Payer, the military coups in Brazil in 1964, Turkey in 1960, Indonesia in 1966, Argentina in 1966 and the Philippines in 1972 were examples of IMF-opposed leaders being forcibly replaced by IMF-friendly ones. Even if the Fund wasn’t directly involved in the coup, in each of these cases, it arrived enthusiastically a few days, weeks or months later to help the new regime implement structural adjustment.</p><p>The Bank and Fund share a willingness to support abusive governments. Perhaps surprisingly, it was the Bank that started the tradition. According to development <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">researcher Kevin Danaher</a>, “the Bank’s sad record of supporting military regimes and governments that openly violated human rights began on August 7, 1947, with a $195 million reconstruction loan to the Netherlands. Seventeen days before the Bank approved the loan, the Netherlands had unleashed a war against anti-colonialist nationalist in its huge overseas empire in the East Indies, which had already declared its independence as the Republic of Indonesia.”</p><p>“The Dutch,” Danaher writes, “sent 145,000 troops (from a nation with only 10 million inhabitants at the time, economically struggling at 90% of 1939 production) and launched a total economic blockade of nationalist-held areas, causing considerable hunger and health problems among Indonesia’s 70 million inhabitants.”</p><p>In its first few decades the Bank funded many such colonial schemes, including <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/240201586262870698/pdf/Announcement-of-Loan-Granted-to-Southern-Rhodesia-on-February-27-1952.pdf">$28 million</a> for apartheid Rhodesia in 1952, as well as loans to Australia, the United Kingdom, and Belgium to “develop” colonial possessions in Papua New Guinea, Kenya and the Belgian Congo.</p><p>In 1966, the Bank <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">directly defied</a> the United Nations, “continuing to lend money to South Africa and Portugal despite resolutions of the General Assembly calling on all UN-affiliated agencies to cease financial support for both countries,” according to Danaher. </p><p>Danaher writes that “Portugal’s colonial domination of Angola and Mozambique and South Africa’s apartheid were flagrant violations of the UN charter. But the Bank argued that Article IV, Section 10 of its Charter which prohibits interference in the political affairs of any member, legally obliged it to disregard the UN resolutions. As a result the Bank approved loans of $10 million to Portugal and $20 million to South Africa after the UN resolution was passed.”</p><p>Sometimes, the Bank’s preference for tyranny was stark: it cut off lending to the democratically-elected Allende government in Chile in the early 1970s, but shortly after began to lend huge quantities of cash to Ceausescu’s Romania, one of the world’s worst police states. This is also an example of how the Bank and Fund, contrary to popular belief, didn’t simply lend along Cold War ideological lines: for every right-wing Augusto Pinochet Ugarte or Jorge Rafael Videla client, there was a left-wing Josip Broz Tito or Julius Nyerere.</p><p>In 1979, Danaher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">notes</a>, 15 of the world’s most repressive governments would receive a full third of all Bank loans. This even after the U.S. Congress and the Carter administration had stopped aid to four of the 15 — Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Ethiopia — for “flagrant human rights violations.” Just a few years later, in El Salvador, the IMF made a <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=280&amp;date1key=2017-04-30">$43 million</a> loan to the military dictatorship, just a few months after its forces committed the largest massacre in Cold War-era Latin America by annihilating the village of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/12/06/the-truth-of-el-mozote">El Mozote</a>.</p><p>There were several books written about the Bank and the Fund in 1994, timed as 50-year retrospectives on the Bretton Woods institutions. “<a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">Perpetuating Poverty</a>” by Ian Vàsquez and Doug Bandow is one of those studies, and is a particularly valuable one as it provides a Libertarian analysis. Most critical studies of the Bank and Fund are from the left: but the Cato Institute’s Vásquez and Bandow saw many of the same problems.</p><p>“The Fund underwrites any government,” they write, “however venal and brutal… China owed the Fund $600 million as of the end of 1989; in January 1990, just a few months after the blood had dried in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, the IMF held a seminar on monetary policy in the city.” </p><p>Vásquez and Bandow mention other tyrannical clients ranging from military Burma, to Pinochet’s Chile, Laos, Nicaragua under Anastasio Somoza Debayle and the Sandinistas, Syria, and Vietnam. </p><p>“The IMF,” they say, “has rarely met a dictatorship that it did not like.”</p><p>Vásquez and Bandow <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">detail</a> the Bank’s relationship with the Marxist-Leninist Mengistu Haile Mariam regime in Ethiopia, where it provided for as much as 16% of the government’s annual budget while it had one of the worst human rights records in the world. The Bank’s credit arrived just as Mengistu’s forces were “herding people into concentration camps and collective farms.” They also point out how the Bank gave the Sudanese regime $16 million while it was driving 750,000 refugees out of Khartoum into the desert, and how it gave hundreds of millions of dollars to Iran — a brutal theocratic dictatorship — and Mozambique, whose security forces were infamous for torture, rape and summary executions.</p><p>In his 2011 book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Defeating-Dictators-Fighting-Tyranny-Africa/dp/0230341624">Defeating Dictators</a>,” the celebrated Ghanaian development economist George Ayittey detailed a long list of “aid-receiving autocrats”: Paul Biya, Idriss Déby, Lansana Conté, Paul Kagame, Yoweri Museveni, Hun Sen, Islam Karimov, Nursultan Nazarbayev and Emomali Rahmon. He pointed out that the Fund had dispensed $75 billion to these nine tyrants alone.</p><p>In 2014, a <a href="https://publicintegrity.org/accountability/leaked-report-says-world-bank-violated-own-rules-in-ethiopia/">report</a> was released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, alleging that the Ethiopian government had used part of a $2 billion Bank loan to forcibly relocate 37,883 indigenous Anuak families. This was 60% of the country’s entire Gambella province. Soldiers “beat, raped, and killed” Anuak who refused to leave their homes. Atrocities were <a href="https://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/worldbank-evicted-abandoned/new-evidence-ties-worldbank-to-human-rights-abuses-ethiopia">so bad</a> that <em>South Sudan</em> granted refugee status to Anuaks streaming in from neighboring Ethiopia. A Human Rights Watch <a href="https://projects.huffingtonpost.com/projects/worldbank-evicted-abandoned/new-evidence-ties-worldbank-to-human-rights-abuses-ethiopia">report</a> said that the stolen land was then “leased by the government to investors” and that the Bank’s money was “used to pay the salaries of government officials who helped carry out the evictions.” The Bank approved new funding for this “villagization” program even after allegations of mass human rights violations emerged.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>It would be a mistake to leave Mobutu Sese Soko’s Zaire out of this essay. The recipient of billions of dollars of Bank and Fund credit during his bloody 32-year reign, Mobutu pocketed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">30%</a> of incoming aid and assistance and let his people starve. He complied with <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=197&amp;date1key=2002-06-30">11</a> IMF structural adjustments: during one in 1984, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">46,000</a> public school teachers were fired and the national currency was devalued by 80%. Mobutu called this austerity “a bitter pill which we have no alternative but to swallow,” but didn’t sell any of his 51 Mercedes, any of his 11 chateaus in Belgium or France, or even his Boeing 747 or 16th century Spanish castle. </p><p>Per capita income declined in each year of his rule on average by<a href="https://peri.umass.edu/images/Congo_s_Odious_Debts.pdf"> 2.2%</a>, leaving more than 80% of the population in absolute poverty. Children routinely died before the age of five, and swollen-belly syndrome was rampant. It is estimated that Mobutu personally stole<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-05-17-mn-59626-story.html"> $5 billion</a>, and presided over another <a href="https://peri.umass.edu/images/Congo_s_Odious_Debts.pdf">$12 billion</a> in capital flight, which together would have been more than enough to wipe the country’s $14 billion debt clean at the time of his ouster. He looted and terrorized his people, and could not have done it without the Bank and Fund, which continued to bail him out even though it was clear he would never repay his debts.</p><p>That all said, the true poster boy for the Bank and Fund’s affection for dictators might be Ferdinand Marcos. In 1966, when Marcos came to power, the Philippines was the second-most prosperous country in Asia, and the country’s <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">foreign debt</a> stood at roughly $500 million. By the time Marcos was removed in 1986, the debt stood at $28.1 billion.</p><p>As Graham Hancock <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">writes</a> in “Lords Of Poverty,” most of these loans "had been contracted to pay for extravagant development schemes which, although irrelevant to the poor, had pandered to the enormous ego of the head of state… a painstaking two-year investigation established beyond serious dispute that he had personally expropriated and sent out of the Philippines more than $10 billion. Much of this money — which of course, should have been at the disposal of the Philippine state and people — had disappeared forever in Swiss bank accounts.”</p><p>“$100 million,” Hancock writes, “was paid for the art collection for Imelda Marcos… her tastes were eclectic and included six Old Masters purchased from the Knodeler Gallery in New York for $5 million, a Francis Bacon canvas supplied by the Marlborough Gallery in London, and a Michelangelo, ‘Madonna and Child’ bought from Mario Bellini in Florence for $3.5 million.”</p><p>“During the last decade of the Marcos regime,” he says, “while valuable art treasuries were being hung on penthouse walls in Manhattan and Paris, the Philippines had lower nutritional standards than any other nation in Asia with the exception of war-torn Cambodia.”</p><p>To contain popular unrest, Hancock writes that Marcos banned strikes and “union organizing was outlawed in all key industries and in agriculture. Thousands of Filipinos were imprisoned for opposing the dictatorship and many were tortured and killed. Meanwhile the country remained consistently listed among the top recipients of both US and World Bank development assistance.”</p><p>After the Filipino people pushed Marcos out, they <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">still</a> had to pay an annual sum of anywhere between 40% and 50% of the entire value of their exports “just to cover the interest on the foreign debts that Marcos incurred.”</p><p>One would think that after ousting Marcos, the Filipino people would not have to owe the debt he incurred on their behalf without consulting them. But that is not how it has worked in practice. In theory, this concept is called “odious debt” and was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/odious-debt/">invented</a> by the U.S. in 1898 when it repudiated Cuba’s debt after Spanish forces were ousted from the island. </p><p>American leaders determined that debts “incurred to subjugate a people or to colonize them” were not legitimate. But the Bank and Fund have never followed this precedent during their 75 years of operations. Ironically, the IMF has an article on its website <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2002/06/kremer.htm">suggesting</a> that Somoza, Marcos, Apartheid South Africa, Haiti’s “Baby Doc” and Nigeria’s Sani Abacha all borrowed billions illegitimately, and that the debt should be written off for their victims, but this remains a suggestion unfollowed.</p><p>Technically and morally speaking, a large percentage of Third World debt should be considered “odious” and not owed anymore by the population should their dictator be forced out. After all, in most cases, the citizens paying back the loans didn’t elect their leader and didn’t choose to borrow the loans that they took out against their future.</p><p>In July 1987, the revolutionary leader Thomas Sankara gave a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/sankara/1987/july/29.htm">speech</a> to the Organistion of African Unity (OAU) in Ethiopia, where he refused to pay the colonial debt of Burkina Faso, and encouraged other African nations to join him. </p><p>“We cannot pay,” he said, “because we are not responsible for this debt.” </p><p>Sankara famously boycotted the IMF and refused structural adjustment. Three months after his OAU speech, he was <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/what-sankara-assassination-trial-means-west-africa">assassinated</a> by Blaise Compaoré, who would install his own 27-year military regime that would receive <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=95&amp;date1key=2002-06-30">four</a> structural adjustment loans from the IMF and borrow <a href="https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/projects-list?lang=en&amp;countrycode_exact=BF&amp;os=100&amp;countryshortname_exact=Burkina%20Faso">dozens of times</a> from the World Bank for various infrastructure and agriculture projects. Since Sankara’s death, few heads of state have been willing to take a stand to repudiate their debts.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>One big exception was Iraq: after the U.S. invasion and ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003, American authorities managed to get some of the debt incurred by Hussein to be considered “odious” and <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/odious-debts/">forgiven</a>. But this was a unique case: for the billions of people who suffered under colonialists or dictators, and have since been forced to pay their debts plus interest, they have not gotten this special treatment.</p><p>In recent years, the IMF has even acted as a counter-revolutionary force against democratic movements. In the 1990s, the Fund was widely criticized on the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/03/22/1087654279/how-shock-therapy-created-russian-oligarchs-and-paved-the-path-for-putin">left</a> and the <a href="https://www.heritage.org/europe/report/russias-meltdown-anatomy-the-imf-failure">right</a> for helping to destabilize the former Soviet Union as it descended into economic chaos and congealed into Vladimir Putin’s dictatorship. In 2011, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Spring#:~:text=The%20Arab%20Spring%20(Arabic%3A%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B9,to%20corruption%20and%20economic%20stagnation.">Arab Spring protests</a> emerged across the Middle East, the <a href="https://star.worldbank.org/deauville-partnership-arab-countries-transition">Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition</a> was formed and met in Paris. </p><p>Through this mechanism, the Bank and Fund <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/imf-tunisia-people-rioting-2011-economic-reforms">led</a> massive loan offers to Yemen, Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco and Jordan — “Arab countries in transition” — in exchange for structural adjustment. As a result, Tunisia’s foreign debt skyrocketed, triggering <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=970&amp;date1key=2019-06-30">two</a> new IMF loans, marking the first time that the country had borrowed from the Fund since 1988. The austerity measures paired with these loans forced the devaluation of the Tunisian dinar, which <a href="http://www.economie-tunisie.org/sites/default/files/fmi_impact_of_tunisias_currency_devaluation_en.pdf">spiked</a> prices. National protests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/imf-tunisia-people-rioting-2011-economic-reforms">broke out</a> as the government continued to follow the Fund playbook with wage freezes, new taxes and “early retirement” in the public sector.</p><p>Twenty-nine-year-old protestor Warda Atig <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jan/17/imf-tunisia-people-rioting-2011-economic-reforms">summed up</a> the situation: “As long as Tunisia continues these deals with the IMF, we will continue our struggle,” she said. “We believe that the IMF and the interests of people are contradictory. An escape from submission to the IMF, which has brought Tunisia to its knees and strangled the economy, is a prerequisite to bring about any real change.”</p><h2>VII.

Growing one’s own food is important, in retrospect, because in the post-1944 financial system, commodities are not priced with one’s local fiat currency: they are priced in the dollar.</p><p>Consider the price of wheat, which <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/wheat">ranged</a> between $200 and $300 between 1996 and 2006. It has since skyrocketed, peaking at nearly $1,100 in 2021. If your country grew its own wheat, it could weather the storm. If your country had to import wheat, your population risked starvation. This is one reason why countries like <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/pakistan-imf-begin-talks-7-bln-loan-review-2022-11-28/">Pakistan</a>, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/09/01/pr22295-imf-reaches-staff-level-agreement-on-an-extended-fund-facility-arrangement-with-sri-lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/10/26/pr22363-egypt-imf-reaches-staff-level-agreement-on-an-extended-fund-facility-arrangement#:~:text=October%2027%2C%202022,Arrangement%20of%20US%243%20billion.">Egypt</a>, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/10/20/pr22363-imf-staff-statement-on-ghana">Ghana</a> and <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2022/11/08/pr22375-bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> are all currently turning to the IMF for emergency loans.</p><p>Historically, where the Bank did give loans, they were <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X">mostly</a> for “modern,” large-scale, mono-crop agriculture and for resource extraction: not for the development of local industry, manufacturing or consumption farming. Borrowers were encouraged to focus on raw materials exports (oil, minerals, coffee, cocoa, palm oil, tea, rubber, cotton, etc.), and then pushed to import finished goods, foodstuffs and the ingredients for modern agriculture like fertilizer, pesticides, tractors and irrigation machinery. The result is that societies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">Morocco</a> end up importing wheat and soybean oil instead of thriving on native couscous and olive oil, “fixed” to become dependent. Earnings were typically used not to benefit farmers, but to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Squads-Banks-Latin-America/dp/0862327911">service</a> foreign debt, purchase weapons, import luxury goods, fill Swiss bank accounts and put down dissent.</p><p>Consider some of the world’s poorest countries. As of 2020, after 50 years of Bank and Fund policy, Niger’s exports were <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/niger/exports">75%</a> uranium; Mali’s <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/mali/exports">72%</a> gold; Zambia’s <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/zambia/exports">70%</a> copper; Burundi’s <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/burundi/exports">69%</a> coffee; Malawi’s <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/malawi/exports#:~:text=In%20the%20long%2Dterm%2C%20the,according%20to%20our%20econometric%20models.&amp;text=Malawi's%20main%20export%20is%20tobacco,%2C%20sugar%2C%20tea%20and%20coffee.">55%</a> tobacco; Togo’s <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/togo/exports">50%</a> cotton; and on it goes. At times in past decades, these single exports supported virtually all of these countries’ hard currency earnings. This is not a natural state of affairs. These items are not mined or produced for local consumption, but for French nuclear plants, Chinese electronics, German supermarkets, British cigarette makers, and American clothing companies. In other words, the energy of the labor force of these nations has been engineered toward feeding and powering other civilizations, instead of nourishing and advancing their own.</p><p>Researcher Alicia Koren <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/50_Years_is_Enough.html?id=XK6Egbw4-PcC">wrote</a> about the typical agricultural impact of Bank policy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">in</a> Costa Rica, where the country’s “structural adjustment called for earning more hard currency to pay off foreign debt; forcing farmers who traditionally grew beans, rice, and corn for domestic consumption to plant non-traditional agricultural exports such as ornamental plants, flowers, melons, strawberries, and red peppers… industries that exported their products were eligible for tariff and tax exemptions not available to domestic producers.”</p><p>“Meanwhile,” Koren wrote, “structural adjustment agreements removed support for domestic production… while the North pressured Southern nations to eliminate subsidies and ‘barriers to trade,’ Northern governments pumped billions of dollars into their own agricultural sectors, making it impossible for basic grains growers in the South to compete with the North’s highly subsidized agricultural industry.”</p><p>Koren extrapolated her Costa Rica analysis to make a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">broader point</a>: “Structural adjustment agreements shift public spending subsidies from basic supplies, consumed mainly by the poor and middle classes, to luxury export crops produced for affluent foreigners.” Third World countries were not seen as body politics but as companies that needed to increase revenues and decrease expenditures.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">testimony</a> of a former Jamaican official is especially telling: “We told the World Bank team that farmers could hardly afford credit, and that higher rates would put them out of business. The Bank told us in response that this means ‘The market is telling you that agriculture is not the way to go for Jamaica’ — they are saying we should give up farming altogether.” </p><p>“The World Bank and IMF,” the official said, “don’t have to worry about the farmers and local companies going out of business, or starvation wages or the social upheaval that will result. They simply assume that it is our job to keep our national security forces strong enough to suppress any uprising.” </p><p>Developing governments are stuck: faced with insurmountable debt, the only factor they really control in terms of increasing revenue is deflating wages. If they do this, they must provide basic food subsidies, or else they will be overthrown. And so the debt grows.</p><p>Even when developing countries try to produce their own food, they are crowded out by a centrally-planned global trade market. For example, one would think that the cheap labor in a place like West Africa would make it a better exporter of peanuts than the United States. But since Northern countries pay an estimated <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-IMF-World-Bank-Questions/dp/1583672222">$1 billion</a> in subsidies to their agriculture industries every single day, Southern countries often struggle to be competitive. What’s worse, 50 or 60 countries are often <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X">directed</a> to focus on the very same crops, crowding each other out in the global marketplace. Rubber, palm oil, coffee, tea and cotton are Bank favorites, as the poor masses can’t eat them.</p><p>It is true that the <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1970/borlaug/biographical/">Green Revolution</a> has created more food for the planet, especially in China and East Asia. But despite advances in agricultural technology, much of these new yields go to exports, and vast swathes of the world remain chronically malnourished and dependent. To this day, for example, African nations import about <a href="https://unctad.org/news/covid-19-threat-food-security-africa">85%</a> of their food. They pay more than <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2020/12/14/unpacking-the-misconceptions-about-africas-food-imports/">$40 billion</a> per year — a number estimated to reach <a href="https://unctad.org/news/covid-19-threat-food-security-africa">$110 billion</a> per year by 2025 — to buy from other parts of the world what they could grow themselves. Bank and Fund policy helped transform a continent of incredible agricultural riches into one reliant on the outside world to feed its people.</p><p>Reflecting on the results of this policy of dependency, Hancock challenges the widespread belief that the people of the Third World are “fundamentally helpless.”</p><p>“Victims of nameless crises, disasters, and catastrophes,” he writes, suffer from a perception that “they can do nothing unless we, the rich and powerful, intervene to save them from themselves.” But as evidenced by the fact that our “assistance” has only made them more dependent on us, Hancock rightfully unmasks the notion that “only we can save them” as “patronizing and profoundly fallacious.”</p><p>Far from playing the role of good samaritan, the Fund does not even follow the timeless human tradition, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">established</a> more than 4,000 years ago by Hammurabi in ancient Babylon, of forgiving interest after natural disasters. In 1985, a devastating earthquake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1985_Mexico_City_earthquake">hit Mexico City</a>, killing more than 5,000 people and causing $5 billion of damage. Fund staff — who claim to be saviors, helping to end poverty and save countries in crisis — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">arrived</a> a few days later, demanding to be repaid.</p><h2>VIII. You Can’t Eat Cotton</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Development </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X"><em>prefers</em></a><em> crops that can’t be eaten so the loans can be collected.”</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X"><em>Cheryl Payer</em></a></p><p><em> </em></p></blockquote><p>The Togolese democracy advocate Farida Nabourema’s own personal and family experience tragically matches the big picture of the Bank and Fund laid out thus far.</p><p>The way she puts it, after the 1970s oil boom, loans were poured into developing nations like Togo, whose unaccountable rulers didn’t think twice about how they would repay the debt. Much of the money went into giant infrastructure projects that didn’t help the majority of the people. Much was embezzled and spent on pharaonic estates. Most of these countries, she says, were ruled by single party-states or families. Once interest rates started to hike, these governments could no longer pay their debts: the IMF started “taking over” by imposing austerity measures.</p><p>“These were new states that were very fragile,” Nabourema says in an interview for this article. “They needed to invest strongly in social infrastructure, just as the European states were allowed to do after World War II. But instead, we went from free healthcare and education one day, to situations the next where it became too costly for the average person to get even basic medicine.” </p><p>Regardless of what one thinks about state-subsidized medicine and schooling, eliminating it overnight was traumatic for poor countries. Bank and Fund officials, of course, have their own private healthcare solutions for their visits and their own private schools for their children whenever they have to live “in the field.”</p><p>Because of the forced cuts in public spending, Nabourema says, the state hospitals in Togo remain to this day in “complete decay.” Unlike the state-run, taxpayer-financed public hospitals in the capitals of former colonial powers in London and Paris, things are so bad in Togo’s capital Lomé that even water has to be prescribed.</p><p>“There was also,” Nabourema said, “reckless privatization of our public companies.” She explained how her father used to work at the Togolese steel agency. During privatization, the company was sold off to foreign actors for less than half of what the state built it for. </p><p>“It was basically a garage sale,” she said.</p><p>Nabourema says that a free market system and liberal reforms work well when all participants are on an equal playing field. But that is not the case in Togo, which is forced to play by different rules. No matter how much it opens up, it can’t change the strict policies of the U.S. and Europe, who aggressively subsidize their own industries and agriculture. Nabourema mentions how a subsidized influx of cheap used clothes from America, for example, ruined Togo’s local textile industry. </p><p>"These clothes from the West,” she said, “put entrepreneurs out of business and littered our beaches.”</p><p>The most horrible aspect, she said, is that the farmers — who made up 60% of the population in Togo in the 1980s — had their livelihoods turned upside down. The dictatorship needed hard currency to pay its debts, and could only do this by selling exports, so they began a massive campaign to sell cash crops. With the World Bank’s help, the regime invested heavily in cotton, so much so that it now dominates 50% of the country’s exports, destroying national food security.</p><p>In the formative years for countries like Togo, the Bank <a href="https://newint.org/features/1979/11/01/modernisation-game">was</a> the “largest single lender for agriculture.” Its strategy for fighting poverty was agricultural <a href="https://newint.org/features/1979/11/01/modernisation-game">modernization</a>: “massive transfers of capital, in the form of fertilizers, pesticides, earth-moving equipment, and expensive foreign consultants.” </p><p>Nabourema’s father was the one who revealed to her how imported fertilizers and tractors were diverted away from farmers growing consumption food, to farmers growing cash crops like cotton, coffee, cocoa and cashews. If someone was growing corn, sorghum or millet — the basic foodstuffs of the population — they didn’t get access. </p><p>“You can’t eat cotton,” Nabourema reminds us.</p><p>Over time, the political elite in countries like Togo and Benin (where the dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrice_Talon">was literally a cotton mogul</a>) became the buyer of all the cash crops from all of the farms. They’d have a monopoly on purchases, Nabourema says, and would buy the crops for prices so low that the peasants would barely make any money. This entire system — called “sotoco” in Togo — was based on funding provided by the World Bank. </p><p>When farmers would protest, she said, they would get beaten or their farms would get burned to rubble. They could have just grown normal food and fed their families, like they had done for generations. But now they could not even afford the land: the political elite has been acquiring land at an outrageous rate, often through illegal means, jacking up the price.</p><p>As an example, Nabourema explains how the Togolese regime might seize 2,000 acres of land: unlike in a liberal democracy (like the one in France, which has built its civilization off the backs of countries like Togo), the judicial system is owned by the government, so there is no way to push back. So farmers, who used to be self-sovereign, are now forced to work as laborers on someone else’s land to provide cotton to rich countries far away. The most tragic irony, Nabourema says, is that cotton is overwhelmingly grown in the north of Togo, in the poorest part of the country. </p><p>“But when you go there,” she says, “you see it has made no one rich.”</p><p>Women bear the brunt of structural adjustment. The misogyny of the policy is “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">quite clear</a> in Africa, where women are the major farmers and providers of fuel, wood, and water,” Danaher writes. And yet, a recent retrospective says, “the World Bank prefers to blame them for having too many children rather than reexamining its own policies.”</p><p>As Payer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis/dp/0853456011/ref=sr_1_4?crid=1SVIK9ZZSSP7B&amp;keywords=cheryl+payer&amp;qid=1665444162&amp;qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&amp;sprefix=cheryl+paye%2Caps%2C139&amp;sr=8-4">writes</a>, for many of the world’s poor, they are poor “not because they have been left behind or ignored by their country’s progress, but because they are the victims of modernisation. Most have been crowded off the good farmland, or deprived of land altogether, by rich elites and local or foreign agribusiness. Their destitution has not ‘ruled them out’ of the development process; the development process has been the cause of their destitution.”</p><p>“Yet the Bank,” Payer says, “is still determined to transform the agricultural practices of small farmers. Bank policy statements make it clear that the real aim is integration of peasant land into the commercial sector through the production of a ‘marketable surplus’ of cash crops.”</p><p>Payer observed how, in the 1970s and 1980s, many small plotters still grew the bulk of their own food needs, and <a href="https://newint.org/features/1979/11/01/modernisation-game">were not</a> “dependent on the market for the near-totality of their sustenance, as ‘modern’ people were.” These people, however, were the target of the Bank’s policies, which transformed them into surplus producers, and “often enforced this transformation with authoritarian methods.”</p><p>In a testimony in front of U.S. Congress in the 1990s, George Ayittey <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">remarked</a> that “if Africa were able to feed itself, it could save nearly $15 billion it wastes on food imports. This figure may be compared with the $17 billion Africa received in foreign aid from all sources in 1997.”</p><p>In other words, if Africa grew its own food, it wouldn’t need foreign aid. But if that were to happen, then poor countries wouldn’t be buying billions of dollars of food per year from rich countries, whose economies would shrink as a result. So the West strongly resists any change.</p><h2>IX. The Development Set</h2><blockquote><p><em>Excuse me, friends, I must catch my jet</em></p><p><em>I'm off to join the Development Set</em></p><p><em>My bags are packed, and I've had all my shots</em></p><p><em>I have traveller's checks and pills for the trots!</em></p><p><em>The Development Set is bright and noble</em></p><p><em>Our thoughts are deep and our vision global</em></p><p><em>Although we move with the better classes</em></p><p><em>Our thoughts are always with the masses</em></p><p><em>In Sheraton Hotels in scattered nations</em></p><p><em>We damn multinational corporations</em></p><p><em>Injustice seems easy to protest</em></p><p><em>In such seething hotbeds of social rest.</em></p><p><em>We discuss malnutrition over steaks</em></p><p><em>And plan hunger talks during coffee breaks.</em></p><p><em>Whether Asian floods or African drought</em></p><p><em>We face each issue with open mouth.</em></p></blockquote><p>And so begins “<a href="http://shores-system.mysite.com/development_set.html">The Development Set</a>,” a 1976 poem by Ross Coggins that hits at the heart of the paternalistic and unaccountable nature of the Bank and the Fund.</p><p>The World Bank pays high, tax-free salaries, with very generous benefits. IMF staff are paid even better, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">traditionally</a> were flown first or business class (depending on the distance), never economy. They stayed in five-star hotels, and even had a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">perk</a> to get free upgrades onto the supersonic Concorde. Their salaries, unlike wages made by people living under structural adjustment, were <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">not capped</a> and always rose faster than the inflation rate.</p><p>Until the mid-1990s the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">janitors</a> cleaning the World Bank headquarters in Washington — mostly immigrants who fled from countries that the Bank and Fund had “adjusted” — were not even allowed to unionize. In contrast, Christine Lagarde’s tax-free salary as head of the IMF was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2012/05/30/imfs-christine-lagarde-i-dont-pay-taxes-but-you-should/?sh=1dad4c877cbd">$467,940</a>, plus an additional $83,760 allowance. Of course, during her term from 2011 to 2019, she oversaw a variety of structural adjustments on poor countries, where taxes on the most vulnerable were almost always raised.</p><p>Graham Hancock <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">notes</a> that redundancy payments at the World Bank in the 1980s “averaged a quarter of a million dollars per person.” When 700 executives lost their jobs in 1987, the money spent on their golden parachutes — $175 million — would have been enough, he notes, “to pay for a complete elementary school education for 63,000 children from poor families in Latin America or Africa.”</p><p>According to former World Bank head James Wolfensohn, from 1995 to 2005 there were more than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-IMF-World-Bank-Questions/dp/1583672222">63,000</a> Bank projects in developing countries: the costs of “feasibility studies” and travel and lodging for experts from industrialized countries alone absorbed as much as 25% of the total aid.</p><p>Fifty years after the creation of the Bank and Fund, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-IMF-World-Bank-Questions/dp/1583672222">90%</a> of the $12 billion per year in technical assistance was still spent on foreign expertise.” That year, in 1994, George Ayittey noted that 80,000 Bank consultants worked on Africa alone, but that “<a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">less than .01%</a>” were Africans.</p><p>Hancock writes that “the Bank, which puts more money into more schemes in more developing countries than any other institution, claims that ‘it seeks to meet the needs of the poorest people;’ but at no stage in what it refers to as the ‘project cycle’ does it actually take the time to ask the poor themselves how they perceive their needs… the poor are entirely left out of the decision-making progress — almost as if they don’t exist.”</p><p>Bank and Fund policy is forged in meetings in lavish hotels between people who will never have to live a day in poverty in their lives. As Joseph Stiglitz <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Globalization-Its-Discontents-Norton-Paperback/dp/0393324397">argues</a> in his own criticism of the Bank and Fund, “modern high-tech warfare is designed to remove physical contact: dropping bombs from 50,000 feet ensures that one does not ‘feel’ what one does. Modern economic management is similar: from one’s luxury hotel, one can callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew the people whose lives one was destroying.”</p><p>Strikingly, Bank and Fund leaders are sometimes the very same people who drop the bombs. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara">Robert McNamara</a> — probably the most transformative person in Bank history, famous for <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/archive/history/past-presidents/robert-strange-mcnamara#:~:text=McNamara%20expanded%20the%20geographical%20range,Bank's%20most%20important%20country%20programs.">massively expanding its lending</a> and sinking poor countries into inescapable debt — was first the CEO of the Ford corporation, before becoming U.S. defense secretary, where he sent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/09/us/pentagon-papers-vietnam-war.html">500,000 American troops to fight in Vietnam</a>. After leaving the Bank, he went straight to the board of Royal Dutch Shell. A more recent World Bank head was Paul Wolfowitz, one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Wolfowitz">key architects of the Iraq War</a>.</p><p>The development set makes its decisions far away from the populations who end up feeling the impact, and they hide the details behind mountains of paperwork, reports and euphemistic jargon. Like the old British Colonial <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">Office</a>, the set conceals itself “like a cuttlefish, in a cloud of ink.”</p><p>The prolific and exhausting histories written by the set are hagiographies: the human experience is airbrushed out. A good example is a study <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2016/12/30/Balance-of-Payments-Adjustment-1945-to-1986-The-IMF-Experience-21">called</a> “Balance of Payments Adjustment, 1945 to 1986: The IMF Experience.” This author had the tedious experience of reading the entire tome. Benefits from colonialism are entirely ignored. The personal stories and human experiences of the people who suffered under Bank and Fund policy are elided. Hardship is buried under countless charts and statistics. These studies, which dominate the discourse, read as if their main priority is to avoid offending Bank or Fund staff. Sure, the tone implies that perhaps mistakes were made here or there, but the intentions of the Bank and Fund are good. They are here to help.</p><p>In one example from the aforementioned <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2016/12/30/Balance-of-Payments-Adjustment-1945-to-1986-The-IMF-Experience-21">study</a>, structural adjustment in Argentina in 1959 and 1960 is described as such: “<em>While the measures had initially reduced the standard of living of a vast sector of the Argentine population</em>, in relatively short time these measures had resulted in a favorable trade balance and balance of payments, an increase in foreign exchange reserves, a sharp reduction in the rate of increases in the cost of living, a stable exchange rate, and increased domestic and foreign investment.” </p><p>In layman’s terms: Sure, there was enormous impoverishment of the entire population, but hey, we got a better balance sheet, more savings for the regime, and more deals with multinational corporations.</p><p>The euphemisms keep coming. Poor countries are consistently described as “test cases.” The lexicon and jargon and language of development economics is designed to hide what is actually happening, to mask the cruel reality with terms and process and theory, and to avoid stating the underlying mechanism: rich countries siphoning resources from poor countries and enjoying double standards that enrich their populations while impoverishing people elsewhere.</p><p>The apotheosis of the Bank and Fund’s relationship with the developing world is their annual meeting in Washington, D.C.: a grand festival on poverty in the richest country on earth. </p><p>“Over mountainous piles of beautifully prepared food,” Hancock writes, “huge volumes of business get done; meanwhile staggering displays of dominance and ostentation get smoothly blended with empty and meaningless rhetoric about the predicament of the poor.”</p><p>“The 10,000 men and women attending,” he writes, “look extraordinarily unlikely to achieve [their] noble objectives; when not yawning or asleep at the plenary sessions they are to be found enjoying a series of cocktail parties, lunches, afternoon teas, dinners, and midnight snacks lavish enough to surfeit the greenest gourmand. The total cost of the 700 social events laid on for delegates during a single week [in 1989] was estimated at $10 million — a sum of money that might, perhaps, have better ‘served the needs of the poor’ had it been spent in some other way.” </p><p>This was 33 years ago: one can only imagine the cost of these parties in today’s dollars.</p><p>In his book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fiat-Standard-Slavery-Alternative-Civilization/dp/1544526474">The Fiat Standard</a>,” Saifedean Ammous has a different name for the development set: the misery industry. His description is worth quoting at length:</p><p>“When World Bank planning inevitably fails and the debts cannot be repaid, the IMF comes in to shake down the deadbeat countries, pillage their resources, and take control of political institutions. It is a symbiotic relationship between the two parasitic organizations that generates a lot of work, income and travel for the misery industry’s workers — at the expense of the poor countries that have to pay for it all in loans.”</p><p>“The more one reads about it,” Ammous writes, “the more one realizes how catastrophic it has been to hand this class of powerful yet unaccountable bureaucrats an endless line of fiat credit and unleash them on the world’s poor. This arrangement allows unelected foreigners with nothing at stake to control and centrally plan entire nations’ economies…. Indigenous populations are removed from their lands, private businesses are closed to protect monopoly rights, taxes are raised, and property is confiscated… tax-free deals are provided to international corporations under the auspices of the International Financial Institutions, while local producers pay ever-higher taxes and suffer from inflation to accommodate their governments’ fiscal incontinence.”</p><p>“As part of the debt relief deals signed with the misery industry,” he continues, “governments were asked to sell off some of their most prized assets. This included government enterprises, but also national resources and entire swaths of land. The IMF would usually auction these to multinational corporations and negotiate with governments for them to be exempt from local taxes and laws. After decades of saturating the world with easy credit, the IFIs spent the 1980s acting as repo men. They went through the wreckage of third-world countries devastated by their policies and sold whatever was valuable to multinational corporations, giving them protection from the law in the scrap heaps in which they operated. This reverse Robin Hood redistribution was the inevitable consequence of the dynamics created when these organizations were endowed with easy money.”</p><p>“By ensuring the whole world stays on the U.S. dollar standard,” Ammous concludes, “the IMF guarantees the US can continue to operate its inflationary monetary policy and export its inflation globally. Only when one understands the grand larceny at the heart of the global monetary system can one understand the plight of developing countries.”</p><h2>X. White Elephants</h2><blockquote><p><em>“What Africa needs to do is grow, grow out of debt.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–George Ayittey</em></p></blockquote><p>By the mid-1970s, it was clear to Western policymakers, and especially to Bank president Robert McNamara, that the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Lost-Foreign-Credit-Development/dp/0862329531">only way</a> poor countries would be able to pay back their debt was with more debt.</p><p>The IMF had always paired its lending with structural adjustment, but for its first few decades, the Bank would give project-specific or sector-specific loans with no additional conditions attached. This changed during McNamara’s tenure, as less specific structural adjustment loans became <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">popular</a> and then even dominant at the Bank during the 1980s.</p><p>The reason was simple enough: Bank workers had a lot more money to lend out, and it was easier to give away large sums if the money was not tied to specific projects. As Payer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/World-Bank-Critical-Analysis-Monthly/dp/085345602X">notes</a>, “twice as many dollars per staff week of work” could be disbursed through structural adjustment loans.</p><p>The borrowers, Hancock <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">says</a>, couldn’t be happier: “Corrupt ministers of finance and dictatorial presidents from Asia, Africa and Latin America tripped over their own expensive footwear in their unseemly haste to get adjusted. For such people money was probably never easier to obtain: with no complicated projects to administer and no messy accounts to keep, the venal, the cruel and the ugly laughed literally all the way to the bank. For them structural adjustment was like a dream come true. No sacrifices were demanded of them personally. All they had to do — amazing but true — was screw the poor.”</p><p>Beyond “general use” structural adjustment loans, the other way to spend large amounts of money was to finance massive, individual projects. These would become known as “white elephants,” and their carcasses still dot the deserts, mountains and forests of the developing world. These behemoths were notorious for their human and environmental devastation.</p><p>A good example would be the billion-dollar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inga_dams">Inga dams</a>, built in Zaire in 1972, whose Bank-funded architects electrified the exploitation of the mineral-rich Katanga province, without installing any transformers along the way to help the vast numbers of villagers who were still using oil lamps. Or the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/sipa/martin/chad-cam/overview.html">Chad-Cameroon pipeline in the 1990s</a>: this $3.7 billion, Bank-funded project was built entirely to siphon resources out of the ground to enrich the Deby dictatorship and its foreign collaborators, without any benefits for the people. Between 1979 and 1983, Bank-financed hydroelectric <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">projects</a> “resulted in the involuntary resettlement of at least 400,000 to 450,000 people on four continents.”</p><p>Hancock details many such white elephants in “Lords Of Poverty.” One example is the Singrauli Power and Coal Mining Complex in India’s Uttar Pradesh state, which received nearly a billion dollars in Bank funding.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“Here,” Hancock writes, “because of ‘development,’ 300,000 poor rural people were subjected to frequent forced relocations as new mines and power stations opened… the land was totally destroyed and resembled scenes out of the lower circles of Dante’s inferno. Enormous amounts of dust and air and water pollution of every conceivable sort created tremendous public health problems. Tuberculosis was rampant, potable water supplies destroyed, and chloroquine-resistant malaria afflicted the area. Once prosperous villages and hamlets were replaced by unspeakable hovels and shacks on the edges of huge infrastructure projects… some people were living inside the open pit mines. Over 70,000 previously self-sufficient peasant farmers — deprived of all over possible sources of income — had no choice but to accept the indignity of intermittent employment at Singrauli for salaries of around 70 cents a day: below survival level even in India.”</p><p>In Guatemala, Hancock describes a giant hydroelectric dam called the Chixoy, built with World Bank support in the Mayan highlands. </p><p>“Originally budgeted at $340 million,” he writes, “the construction costs had risen to $1 billion by the time the dam was opened in 1985… the money was lent to the Guatemalan government by a consortium [led] by the World Bank… General Romero Lucas Arica’s military government, in power during the bulk of the construction phase and which signed the contract with the World Bank, was recognized by political analysts as having been the most corrupt administration in the history of a Central American country in a region that has been afflicted by more than its fair share of venal and dishonest regimes… members of the junta pocketed about $350 million out of the $1 billion provided for Chixoy.”</p><p>And finally in Brazil, Hancock details one of the Bank’s most harmful projects, a “massive colonization and resettlement scheme” known as Polonoroeste. By 1985, the Bank had committed $434.3 million to the initiative, which ended up transforming “poor people into refugees in their own land.” </p><p>The scheme “persuaded hundreds of thousands of needy people to migrate from Brazil’s central and southern provinces and relocate themselves as farmers in the Amazon basin” to generate cash crops. “The Bank’s money,” Hancock wrote, “paid for the speedy paving of Highway BR-364 which runs into the heart of the north-western province of Rondonia. All the settlers traveled along this road on their way to farms that they slashed and burned out of the jungle… Already 4% deforested in 1982, Rondonia was 11% deforested by 1985. NASA space surveys showed that the area of deforestation was doubled approximately every two years.” </p><p>As a result of the project, in 1988 “tropical forests covering an area larger than Belgium were burnt by settlers.” Hancock also notes that “more than 200,000 settlers were estimated to have contracted a particularly virulent strain of malaria, endemic in the north-west, to which they had no resistance.”</p><p>Such grotesque projects were the result of the massive growth of lending institutions, a detachment of the creditors from the actual places they were lending to, and management by unaccountable local autocrats who pocketed billions along the way. They were the outcome of policies that tried to lend as much money as possible to Third World countries to keep the debt Ponzi going and to keep the flow of resources from south to north moving. The grimmest example of all might be found in Indonesia.</p><h2>XI. A Real-Life Pandora: The Exploitation Of West Papua</h2><blockquote><p><em>“You want a fair deal, you’re on the wrong planet.”</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://www.magicalquote.com/moviequotes/you-want-a-fair-deal-youre-on-the-wrong-planet/"><em>Jake Sully</em></a></p></blockquote><p>The island of New Guinea is resource-rich beyond imagination. <a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/3118/AAA420ESW0WHIT110papureport1english.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">It contains</a>, just for starters: the third-largest expanse of tropical rainforest in the world, after the Amazon and the Congo; the world’s largest gold and copper mine at Grasberg, in the shadow of the 4,800 meter “Seven Summit” peak of Puncak Jaya; and, offshore, the Coral Triangle, a tropical sea known <a href="https://png.wcs.org/Wildlife/Corals.aspx">for</a> its “unparalleled” reef diversity.</p><p>And yet, the people of the island, especially those living in the California-sized Western half under Indonesian control, are some of the poorest in the world. Resource colonialism has long been a curse for the residents of this territory, known as West Papua. Whether the pillage was committed by the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">Dutch</a>, or, in more recent decades, the Indonesian government, imperialists have found generous support from the Bank and the Fund.</p><p>This essay already mentioned how one of the World Bank’s first loans was to the Dutch, which it used to try and sustain its colonial empire in Indonesia. In 1962, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution">Imperial Holland was finally defeated</a>, and gave up control over West Papua to the Sukarno government as Indonesia became independent. However, the Papuans (also known as the Irianese) wanted their own freedom.</p><p>In the course of that decade — as the IMF credited the Indonesian government with more than <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=440&amp;date1key=2014-11-30">$100 million</a> — Papuans were purged from positions of leadership. In 1969, in an event that would make George Orwell’s Oceania blush, Jakarta held the “Act of Free Choice,” a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2644481">poll</a> where 1,025 people were rounded up and forced to vote in front of armed soldiers. The results to join Indonesia were unanimous, and the vote was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679900049">ratified</a> by the UN General Assembly. After that, locals had no say in what “development” projects would proceed. Oil, copper and timber were all <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2011/10/19/west-papua-a-history-of-exploitation">harvested</a> and removed from the island in the following decades, with no involvement by Papuans, except as forced labor.</p><p>The mines, highways and ports in West Papua were not built with the wellbeing of the population in mind, but rather were built to loot the island as efficiently as possible. As Payer was able to observe even in 1974, the IMF helped transform Indonesia’s vast natural resources into “mortgages for an indefinite future to subsidize an oppressive military dictatorship and to pay for imports which supported the lavish lifestyle of the generals in Jakarta.”</p><p>A 1959 <a href="http://wpik.org/Src/NYT/19590306newExplor.pdf">article</a> on the discovery of gold in the area is the beginning of the story of what would later become the Grasberg mine, the world’s lowest-cost and largest producer of copper and gold. In 1972, the Phoenix-based Freeport signed a deal with Indonesian dictator Suharto to extract gold and copper from West Papua, without any consent from the indigenous population. Until 2017, Freeport controlled 90% of the project’s shares, with 10% in the hands of the Indonesian government and 0% for the Amungme and Kamoro tribes who actually inhabit the area.</p><figure>

For more than a century, the powers in control of Java (home to most of Indonesia’s population) dreamed of moving large chunks of Javanese to farther-flung islands in the archipelago. Not just to spread things out, but also to ideologically “unify” the territory. In a 1985 speech, the Minister of Transmigration <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">said</a> that “by way of transmigration, we will try to … integrate all the ethnic groups into one nation, the Indonesian nation… The different ethnic groups will in the long run disappear because of integration … there will be one kind of man.”</p><p>These efforts to resettle Javanese — known as “Transmigrasi” — began during colonial times, but in the 1970s and 1980s the World Bank began financing these activities in an aggressive way. The Bank allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to the Suharto dictatorship to allow it to “transmigrate” what were hoped to be millions of people to places like East Timor and West Papua in what <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">was</a> “the world’s largest-ever exercise in human resettlement.” By 1986, the Bank <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">had</a> committed no less than $600 million directly to support transmigration, which entailed “a breathtaking combination of human rights abuses and environmental destruction.”</p><p>Consider the story of the <a href="https://www.nadir.org/nadir/initiativ/agp/free/imf/asia/papua.htm">Sago palm</a>, one of the main traditional foodstuffs of Papuans. One tree alone was able to supply food for a family for six to 12 months. But the Indonesian government, at the encouragement of the Bank, came and said no, this is not working: you need to eat rice. And so the Sago gardens were cut down to grow rice for export. And the locals were forced to buy rice in the market, which simply made them more dependent on Jakarta.</p><p>Any resistance was met with brutality. Especially under Suharto — who held as many as<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679900049"> 100,000</a> political prisoners — but even today in 2022, West Papua is a police state almost without rival. Foreign journalists are virtually banned; free speech does not exist; the military operates without any accountability. NGOs like <a href="https://www.tapol.org/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/pdfs/West_Papua_2021_Freedom_of_Expression_Assembly_Report.pdf">Tapol</a> document a legion of human rights violations ranging from mass surveillance of personal devices, restrictions on when and for what reason people can leave their homes and even rules on how Papuans can wear their <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/03/indonesia-gold-mine-papua/">hair</a>.</p><p>Between 1979 and 1984, some 59,700 transmigrants were taken to West Papua, with “large scale” support from the World Bank. More than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">20,000</a> Papuans fled the violence into neighboring Papua New Guinea. Refugees reported to international media that “their villages were bombed, their settlements burned, women raped, livestock killed, and numbers of people indiscriminately shot while others were imprisoned and tortured.”</p><p>A subsequent project backed by a $160 million Bank loan in 1985 was called “<a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/451151468269127930/text/multi-page.txt">Transmigration V</a>”: the seventh Bank-funded project in support of settler colonialism, it aimed to finance the relocation of 300,000 families between 1986 and 1992. The regime’s governor of West Papua at the time described the indigenous people as “living in a stone-age era” and called for a further two million Javanese migrants to be sent to the islands so <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">that</a> “backwards local people could intermarry with the newcomers thus giving birth to a new generation of people without curly hair.”</p><p>The original and final versions of the Transmigration V loan agreement were leaked to Survival International: the original version <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679900049">made</a> “extensive reference to the bank’s policies on tribal peoples and provides a list of measures that would be required to comply with these,” but the final version made “no reference to the bank’s policies.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Transmigration V ran into budget issues, and was cut short, but ultimately 161,600 families were moved, at a cost of 14,146 Bank staff months. The Bank was clearly financing cultural genocide: today, Ethnic Papuans make up no more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/nov/02/100-bn-dollar-gold-mine-west-papuans-say-they-are-counting-the-cost-indonesia">30%</a> of the territory’s population. But social engineering wasn’t the only goal of taking money from the Bank: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679900049">17%</a> of funds for transmigration projects were estimated to have been stolen by government officials.</p><p>Fifteen years later on December 11, 2001, the World Bank approved a <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00903F/WEB/PDF/PR121101.PDF">$200 million loan</a> to “improve road conditions'' in West Papua and other parts of Eastern Indonesia. The project, known as EIRTP, aimed to “improve the condition of national and other strategic arterial roads in order to reduce transport costs and provide more reliable access among provincial centers, regional development and production areas, and other key transport facilities. Reducing road transport costs,” the Bank said, “will help to lower input prices, raise output prices and increase the competitiveness of local products from the affected areas.” In other words: the Bank was helping to extract resources as efficiently as possible.</p><p>The Bank and Fund’s history in Indonesia is so outrageous that it seems like it must be from another time, ages ago. But that’s simply not true. Between 2003 and 2008, the Bank <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/08/19/19climatewire-how-the-world-bank-let-deal-making-torch-the-33255.html">funded</a> palm oil development in Indonesia to the tune of nearly $200 million and hired private companies who were alleged to have “used fire to clear primary forests and seize lands belonging to indigenous people without due process.”</p><p>Today, the Indonesian government remains on the hook for the EIRTP loan. In the past five years, the Bank has collected <a href="https://projects.worldbank.org/en/projects-operations/project-detail/P040578">$70 million</a> in interest payments from the Indonesian government and taxpayer, all for its efforts to accelerate the extraction of resources from islands like West Papua.</p><h2>XII. The World’s Biggest Ponzi</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Countries don’t go bankrupt.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1301&amp;context=til#:~:text=The%20most%20charismatic%20and%20influential,doesn't%20go%20away%2C%20the"><em>Walter Wriston</em></a><em>, former chairman of Citibank</em></p></blockquote><p>One might consider bankruptcy an important and even essential part of capitalism. But the IMF basically exists to prevent the free market from working as it normally would: it bails out countries that normally would go bankrupt, forcing them instead deeper into debt.</p><p>The Fund makes the impossible possible: small, poor countries hold so much debt that they could never pay it all off. These bailouts corrupt the incentives of the global financial system. In a true free market, there would be serious consequences for risky lending: the creditor bank could lose its money.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>When the U.S., Europe or Japan made their deposits at the Bank and Fund, it was similar to purchasing insurance on their ability to extract wealth from developing nations. Their private banks and multinational corporations are protected by the bailout scheme, and on top of it, they earn handsome, steady interest (paid for by poor countries) on what is widely perceived to be humanitarian assistance.</p><p>As David Graeber writes in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-First-5-000-Years/dp/1612191290">Debt</a>,” when banks “lent money to dictators in Bolivia and Gabon in the late ’70s: [they made] utterly irresponsible loans with the full knowledge that, once it became known they had done so, politicians and bureaucrats would scramble to ensure that they’d still be reimbursed anyway, no matter how many lives had to be devastated and destroyed in order to do it.”</p><p>Kevin Danaher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">describes</a> the tension that began to emerge in the 1960s: “Borrowers began to pay back more annually to the Bank than it disbursed in new loans. In 1963, 1964, and 1969 India transferred more money to the World Bank than the Bank disbursed to it.” Technically, India was paying off its debts plus interest, but the Bank’s leadership saw a crisis.</p><p>“To solve the problem,” Danaher <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">continues</a>, Bank president Robert McNamara increased lending “at a phenomenal rate, from $953 million in 1968 to $12.4 billion in 1981.” The <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21805/w21805.pdf">number</a> of IMF lending programs also “more than doubled” from 1976 to 1983, mostly to poor countries. The Bank and the Fund’s assurances led the world’s titanic money center banks as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">hundreds</a> of regional and local banks in the U.S. and Europe — “most of them with little or no previous history of foreign lending” — to go on an unprecedented lending spree.</p><p>The Third World debt bubble finally burst in 1982, when Mexico announced a default. According to <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2016/12/30/Balance-of-Payments-Adjustment-1945-to-1986-The-IMF-Experience-21">official</a> IMF history, “private bankers envisaged the dreaded possibility of a widespread repudiation of debts, such as had occurred in the 1930s: at that time the debt owed by debtor countries to industrial counties was mostly in the form of securities issued by debtor countries in the US and in the form of bonds sold abroad; in the 1980s the debt was almost entirely in the form of short and medium term loans from commercial banks in the industrial members. Monetary authorities of industrial members instantly realized the urgency of the problem posed for the world’s banking system.”</p><p>In other words: the threat that the banks of the West might have holes on their balance sheet was the danger: <em>not</em> that millions would die of austerity programs in poor countries. In her book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">A Fate Worse Than Debt</a>,” the development critic Susan George charts how the top-nine largest U.S. banks all had placed more than 100% of their shareholders’ equity in “loans to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela alone.” The crisis was averted, however, as the IMF helped credit flow to Third World countries, even though they should have gone bankrupt.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/International-Monetary-Fund-Global-Economy/dp/0521194334">Simply put</a>," according to a technical analysis of the Fund, its programs “provide bailouts for private lenders to emerging markets, thereby allowing international creditors to benefit from foreign lending without bearing the full risks involved: the banks reap significant profits if borrowers repay their debts and avoid losses if financial crisis occur”</p><p>Latin American citizens suffered under structural adjustment, but between 1982 and 1985. George <a href="https://www.tni.org/en/article/a-fate-worse-than-debt-the-world-financial-crisis-and-the-poor">reported</a> that “in spite of over-exposure to Latin America, dividends declared by the big nine banks increased by more than a third during the same period.” Profits in that time <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">rose</a> by 84% at Chase Manhattan and 66% at Banker’s Trust, and stock value rose by 86% at Chase and 83% at Citicorp. </p><p>“Clearly,” she wrote, “austerity is not the term to describe the experiences since 1982 of either the Third World elite or the international banks: the parties that contracted the loans in the first place.”</p><p>The “generosity” of the West enabled unaccountable leaders to plunge their nations into debt deeper than ever before. The system was, as Payer writes in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lent-Lost-Foreign-Credit-Development/dp/0862329531">Lent And Lost</a>,” a straightforward Ponzi scheme: the new loans went straight to paying for the old loans. The system needed to grow to avoid collapse. </p><p>“By keeping financing going,” an IMF managing director said, according to Payer, structural adjustment loans “permitted trade that might otherwise not have been possible.”</p><p>Given that the Bank and Fund will prevent even the most comically corrupt and wasteful governments from going bankrupt, private banks adapted their behavior accordingly. A good example would be Argentina, which has received <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=30&amp;date1key=2019-08-31">22</a> IMF loans since 1959, even trying to default in 2001. One would think that creditors would stop lending to such a profligate borrower. But in fact, just four years ago, Argentina received the largest IMF loan of all time, a staggering <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/argentina-imf-biggest-loan">$57.1</a> billion.</p><p>Payer summed up “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">The Debt Trap</a>” by stating that the moral of her work was “both simple and old-fashioned: that nations, like individuals, cannot spend more than they earn without falling into debt, and a heavy debt burden bars the way to autonomous action.”</p><p>But the system makes the deal too sweet for the creditors: profits are monopolized while losses are socialized.</p><p>Payer realized this even 50 years ago in 1974, and hence concluded that “in the long run it is more realistic to withdraw from an exploitative system and suffer the dislocation of readjustment than it is to petition the exploiters for a degree of relief.”</p><h2>XIII.

Bush</em></a></p></blockquote><p>In a true global free market, the policies that the Bank and Fund impose on poor countries might make sense. After all, the record of socialism and large-scale nationalization of industry is disastrous. The problem is, the world is not a free market, and double standards are everywhere.</p><p>Subsidies — for example, free rice in Sri Lanka or discounted fuel in Nigeria — are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">ended</a> by the IMF, yet creditor nations like the U.K. and U.S. extend state-funded <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/england">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.usda.gov/topics/farming/resources-small-and-mid-sized-farmers">crop subsidies</a> to their own populations.</p><p>One can take a Libertarian or Marxist view and arrive at the same conclusion: this is a double standard which enriches some countries at the expense of others, with most citizens of rich countries blissfully unaware.</p><p>To help build out from the rubble of World War II, IMF creditors <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Books/Issues/2016/12/30/Balance-of-Payments-Adjustment-1945-to-1986-The-IMF-Experience-21">relied heavily</a> on central planning and anti-free market policy for the first few decades after Bretton Woods: for example, import <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/26536/chapter-abstract/195055373?redirectedFrom=fulltext">restrictions</a>, capital outflow limits, foreign exchange caps and crop subsidies. These measures protected industrial economies when they were most vulnerable.</p><p>In the U.S., for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_Equalization_Tax">Interest Equalization Act</a> was passed by John F. Kennedy to stop Americans from buying foreign securities and instead focus them on domestic investing. This was one of many measures to tighten capital controls. But the Bank and Fund have historically prevented poor countries from using the same tactics to defend themselves.</p><p>As Payer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-Trap-International-Monetary-Monthly/dp/0853453764">observes</a>, “The IMF has never played a deciding role in the adjustment of exchange rates and trade practices among the wealthy developed nations… It is the weaker nations which are subjected to the full force of the IMF principles… the inequality of power relationships meant that the Fund could do nothing about market ‘distortions’ (such as trade protection) which were practiced by the rich countries.”</p><p>Cato’s Vásquez and Bandow came to a similar conclusion, <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">noting</a> that “most industrialized nations have maintained a patronizing attitude towards underdeveloped nations, hypocritically shutting out their exports.” </p><p>In the early 1990s, while the U.S. stressed the importance of free trade, it “erected a virtual iron curtain against [Eastern Europe’s] exports, including textiles, steel, and agricultural products.” Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan were all targeted. The U.S. prevented Eastern European nations <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">from</a> selling “a single pound of butter, dry milk, or ice cream in America” and both the Bush and Clinton administrations imposed stiff chemical and pharmaceutical import restrictions on the region.</p><p>It is estimated that protectionism by industrial countries “reduces developing countries’ national income by roughly <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">twice as much</a> as provided by development assistance.” In other words, if Western nations simply opened their economies, they wouldn’t have to provide any development assistance at all.</p><p>There is a sinister twist to the arrangement: when a Western country (i.e., the U.S.) runs into an inflationary crisis — like today’s — and is forced to tighten its monetary policy, it actually <em>gains more control </em>over developing countries and their resources, whose dollar debt becomes much more difficult to pay back, and who fall deeper into the debt trap, and deeper into Bank and Fund conditionality.</p><p>In 2008, <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/education/resources/explainers/the-global-financial-crisis.html">during the Great Financial Crisis</a>, American and European authorities lowered interest rates and juiced up banks with extra cash. During the Third World Debt Crisis and the Asian Financial Crisis, the Bank and Fund refused to permit this kind of behavior. Instead, the recommendation to afflicted economies was to <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/ib/2000/062300.htm">tighten</a> at home and borrow more from abroad.</p><p>In September 2022, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-28/us-treasury-is-alarmed-at-the-uk-economic-chaos-unleashed-by-liz-truss">newspaper headlines</a> stated that the IMF was “worried” about inflation in the United Kingdom, as its bond market teetered on the brink of collapse. This is of course another hypocrisy, given that the IMF did not seem worried about inflation when it imposed currency devaluation on billions of people for decades. Creditor nations play by different rules.</p><p>In a final case of “do as I say, not as I do,” the IMF still holds a whopping 90.5 million ounces — or <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2022/Gold-in-the-IMF">2,814 metric tons</a> — of gold. Most of this was accumulated in the 1940s, when members were forced to pay 25% of their original quotas in gold. In fact, until the 1970s, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2022/Gold-in-the-IMF">members</a> “normally paid all interest owed on IMF credit in gold.”</p><p>When Richard Nixon formally <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/fdr-takes-united-states-off-gold-standard#:~:text=The%20government%20held%20the%20%2435,completely%20abandoning%20the%20gold%20standard.">ended the gold standard in 1971</a>, the IMF did not sell its gold reserves. And yet, attempts by any member countries to fix their currency to gold are forbidden.</p><h2>XIV. Green Colonialism</h2><blockquote><p><em>“If you turned the electricity off for a few months in any developed Western society, 500 years of supposed philosophical progress about human rights and individualism would quickly evaporate like they never happened.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://legalinsurrection.com/2022/09/finnish-economist-i-am-telling-you-people-that-the-situation-in-europe-is-much-worse-than-many-understand/"><em>Murtaza Hussain</em></a></p></blockquote><p>In the past few decades, a new double standard has emerged: green colonialism. This, at least, is what the Senegalese entrepreneur Magatte Wade calls the West’s hypocrisy over energy use in an interview for this article.</p><p>Wade reminds us that industrial countries developed their civilizations by utilizing hydrocarbons (in large part stolen or bought on the cheap from poor countries or colonies), but today the Bank and Fund try to push policies which prohibit the developing world from doing the same.</p><p>Where the U.S. and U.K. were able to use coal and the Third World’s oil, the Bank and Fund want African countries to use solar and wind manufactured and financed by the West.</p><p>This hypocrisy was on display a few weeks ago in Egypt, where world leaders gathered at <a href="https://unfccc.int/cop27">COP 27</a> (the Sharm el-Sheikh Climate Change Conference) to discuss how to reduce energy use. The location on the African continent was intentional. Western leaders — currently scrambling to import more fossil fuels after their access to Russian hydrocarbons was curtailed — flew in on gas-guzzling private jets to plead with poor countries to reduce their carbon footprint. In typical Bank and Fund tradition, the ceremonies were hosted by the resident military dictator. During the festivities, Alaa Abd Al Fattah, a prominent Egyptian human rights activist, languished nearby on hunger strike in prison.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“Just like back in the day when we were colonized and the colonizers set the rules to how our societies would work,” Wade said, “this green agenda is a new form of governing us. This is master now dictating to us what our relationship with energy should be, telling us what kind of energy we should use, and when we can use it. The oil is in our soil, it is part of our sovereignty: but now they are saying we cannot use it? Even after they looted incalculable amounts for themselves?”</p><p>Wade points out that as soon as the core countries have an economic crisis (as they now face heading into the winter of 2022), they go right back to using fossil fuels. She observes that poor countries aren’t allowed to develop nuclear energy, and notes that when Third World leaders tried to push in this direction in the past, some of them — notably in <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/books/the-story-of-pakistan-s-improbable-pursuit-of-nuclear-weapons-1.581758">Pakistan</a> and <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/monograph/chapter/3049886/pdf">Brazil</a> — were assassinated.</p><p>Wade says her life’s work is prosperity building in Africa. She was born in Senegal, and moved to Germany at age seven. She still remembers her first day in Europe. She was used to a shower being a 30-minute affair: get the coal stove going, boil the water, put some cold water in it to cool it down, and drag the water to the shower area. But in Germany, all she had to do was turn a handle.</p><p>“I was shocked,” she says. “This question defined the rest of my life: How come they have this here but we don’t over there?”</p><p>Wade learned over time that reasons for Western success included the rule of law, clear and transferable property rights, and stable currencies. But, also, critically, reliable energy access.</p><p>“We can’t have limitations on our energy use imposed on us by others,” Wade said. And yet, the Bank and Fund continue to put pressure on energy policy in poor countries. Last month, Haiti followed pressure from the Bank and Fund to end its fuel subsidies. “The result,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2022/09/22/haiti-riots-triggered-by-imf-advice-to-cut-fuel-subsidies/?sh=3cf8be9b5169">wrote</a> energy reporter Michael Schellenberger, “has been riots, looting, and chaos.”</p><p>“In 2018,” Schellenberger says, “the Haitian government agreed to IMF demands that it cut fuel subsidies as a prerequisite for receiving $96 million from the World Bank, European Union, and Inter-American Development bank, triggering protests that resulted in the resignation of the prime minister.”</p><p>“In over 40 nations since 2005,” he says, “riots have been triggered after cutting fuel subsidies or otherwise raising energy prices.”</p><p>It is the height of hypocrisy for the West to achieve success based on robust energy consumption and on energy subsidies, and then try to limit the type and amount of energy used by poor countries and then raise the price that their citizens pay. This amounts to a Malthusian scheme in line with former Bank chief Robert McNamara’s <a href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/mcnamara-shoots-from-the-hip-29861">well-documented</a> belief that population growth was a threat to humanity. The solution, of course, was always to try and reduce the population of poor countries, not rich ones.</p><p>“They treat us like little experiments,” Wade says, “where the West says: we might lose some people along the way, but let’s see if poor countries can develop without the energy types we used.”</p><p>“Well,” she says,” “we are not an experiment.”</p><h2>XV. The Human Toll Of Structural Adjustment</h2><blockquote><p><em>“To the World Bank, development means growth… But … unrestrained growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XK6Egbw4-PcC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=%22To+the+World+Bank,+development+means+growth%22+yunus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0vCUaKbbGb&amp;sig=ACfU3U2Q3JkzChXs7o-SJkpdvPs8JekJag&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjF9vipydH7AhUMADQIHZr8DeMQ6AF6BAgLEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22To%20the%20World%20Bank%2C%20development%20means%20growth%22%20yunus&amp;f=false"><em>Mohammed Yunus</em></a></p></blockquote><p>The social impact of structural adjustment is immense, and barely ever gets mentioned in traditional analysis of the Bank and Fund’s policy. There have been plenty of exhaustive studies done on their economic impact, but very little comparatively on their global health impact.</p><p>Researchers like Ayittey, Hancock and Payer give a few jarring examples from the 1970s and 1980s:</p><ul><li>Between 1977 and 1985, Peru <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">undertook</a> IMF structural adjustment: the average per capita income of Peruvians fell 20%, and inflation soared from 30% to 160%. By 1985, a worker’s pay was only worth 64% of what it had been worth in 1979 and 44% of what it had been in 1973. Child malnutrition rose from 42% to 68% of the population.</li><li>In 1984 and 1985 the Philippines under Marcos implemented yet another round of IMF structural reform: after one year, GNP per capita regressed to 1975 levels. Real earnings fell by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">46%</a> among urban wage earners.</li><li>In Sri Lanka, the poorest <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lords-Poverty-Prestige-Corruption-International/dp/0871134691">30%</a> suffered an uninterrupted decline in calorie consumption after more than a decade of structural adjustment.</li><li>In Brazil, the number of citizens suffering from malnutrition <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">jumped</a> from 27 million (one third of the population) in 1961 to 86 million (two thirds of the population) in 1985 after <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/tad/extarr2.aspx?memberKey1=90&amp;date1key=2013-08-31">10 doses</a> of structural adjustment.</li><li>Between 1975 and 1984 in IMF-guided Bolivia, the number of hours the average citizen had to work to purchase <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">1,000 calories</a> of bread, beans, corn, wheat, sugar, potatoes, milk or quinoa increased on average by five times.</li><li>After structural adjustment in Jamaica in 1984, the nutritional purchasing power of one Jamaican dollar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">plummeted</a> in 14 months from being able to buy 2,232 calories of flour to just 1,443; from 1,649 calories of rice to 905; from 1,037 calories of condensed milk to 508; and from 220 calories of chicken to 174.</li><li>As a result of structural adjustment, Mexican real wages declined in the 1980s by more than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">75%</a>. In 1986, about 70% of lower-income Mexicans had “virtually stopped eating rice, eggs, fruit, vegetables, and milk (never mind meat or fish)” at a time when their government was paying $27 million per day — $18,750 per minute — in interest to its creditors. By the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">1990s</a>, “a family of four on the minimum wage (which made up 60% of the employed labor force) could only buy 25% of its basic needs.</li><li>In <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, GNP per capita “dropped steadily from $624 in 1980 to $513 in 1998… food production per capita in Africa was 105 in 1980 but 92 for 1997… and food imports rose an astonishing 65% between 1988 and 1997.”</li></ul><p>These examples, though tragic, only give a small and patchwork picture of the deleterious impact that Bank and Fund policies have had on the health of the world’s poor.</p><p>On average, every year from 1980 to 1985, there were <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">47 countries</a> in the Third World pursuing IMF-sponsored structural adjustment programs, and 21 developing countries pursuing structural or sector adjustment loans from the World Bank. During this same period, 75% of all countries in Latin America and Africa experienced declines in per capita income and child welfare.</p><p>The decline in living standards make sense when one considers that Bank and Fund policies sculpted societies to focus on exports at the expense of consumption while gutting food security and healthcare services.</p><p>During IMF structural adjustment, real wages in countries like Kenya declined by more than <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fate-Worse-Than-Debt/dp/0802131212">40%</a>. After billions in Bank and Fund credit, per capita food production in Africa <a href="https://www.cato.org/books/perpetuating-poverty">fell by nearly 20%</a> between 1960 and 1994. Meanwhile, health <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">expenditures</a> in “IMF-World Bank programmed countries” declined by 50% during the 1980s.</p><p>When food security and healthcare collapse, people die.</p><p>Papers from <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1086026611413931?journalCode=oaec">2011</a> and <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/45131936">2013</a> showed that countries that took a structural adjustment loan had higher levels of child mortality than those that did not. A 2017 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5810102/">analysis</a> was “virtually unanimous in finding a detrimental association between structural adjustment and child and maternal health outcomes.” A 2020 study <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953619304897">reviewed</a> data from 137 developing countries between 1980 and 2014 and found that “structural adjustment reforms lower health system access and increase neonatal mortality.” A paper from 2021 <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.12.21253458v1.full">concluded</a> that structural adjustment plays “a significant role in perpetuating preventable disability and death.”</p><p>It is impossible to do a full accounting of just how many women, men and children were killed as a result of Bank and Fund austerity policies.</p><p>Food security advocate Davidson Budhoo <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fifty-Years-Enough-International-Monetary/dp/0896084957">claimed</a> that six million children died each year in Africa, Asia and Latin America between 1982 and 1994 as a result of structural adjustment. This would put the Bank and Fund’s death toll in the same ballpark as the deaths caused by Stalin and Mao.</p><p>Is this remotely possible? No one will ever know. But by looking at the data, we can begin to get a sense.</p><p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25790017">Research</a> from Mexico — a typical country in terms of consistent involvement historically from the Bank and Fund — shows that for every 2% decrease in GDP, the mortality rate increased by 1%.</p><p>Now consider that as a result of structural adjustment, the GDP of dozens of countries in the Third World between the 1960s and 1990s suffered double-digit contractions. Despite massive population growth, many of these economies stagnated or shrank over 15-25 year periods. Meaning: the Bank and the Fund’s policies likely killed tens of millions of people.</p><p>Whatever the final death toll, there are two certainties: one, these are crimes against humanity, and two, no Bank or Fund officials will ever go to prison. There will never be any accountability or justice.</p><p>The inescapable reality is that millions died too young in order to extend and improve the lives of millions elsewhere. It is of course true that much of the success of the West is because of enlightenment values like rule of law, free speech, liberal democracy and domestic respect for human rights. But the unspoken truth is that much of the West’s success is also the result of resource and time theft from poor countries.</p><p>The stolen wealth and labor of the Third World will go unpunished but remains visible today, forever encrusted in the developed world’s architecture, culture, science, technology and quality of life. The next time one visits London, New York, Tokyo, Paris, Amsterdam or Berlin, this author suggests going for a walk and pausing at a particularly impressive or scenic view of the city to reflect on this. As the old saying goes, “We must pass through the darkness to reach the light.”</p><h2>XVI. A Trillion Dollars: The Bank And Fund In The Post-COVID World</h2><blockquote><p><em>“We are all in this together.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/international-monetary-fund-european-central-bank-head-christine-lagarde-60-minutes-interview-2019-10-20/"><em>Christine Lagarde</em></a><em>, former IMF managing director</em></p></blockquote><p>Bank and Fund policy towards developing countries has not changed much over the past few decades. Sure, there have been a few superficial tweaks, like the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/16/11/Debt-Relief-Under-the-Heavily-Indebted-Poor-Countries-Initiative">“Highly-Indebted Poor Countries” (HIPC) initiative</a>, where some governments can qualify for debt relief. But underneath the new language, even these poorest of the poor countries still need to do structural adjustment. It’s just been rebranded to “Poverty Reduction Strategy.”</p><p>The same rules still apply: in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-IMF-World-Bank-Questions/dp/1583672222">Guyana</a>, for example, “the government decided in early 2000 to increase the salaries of civil servants by 3.5%, after a fall in purchasing power of 30% over the previous five years.” The IMF immediately threatened to remove Guyana from the new list of HIPCs. “After a few months, the government had to backpedal.”</p><p>The same large-scale devastation still occurs. In a 2015 International Consortium Of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) report, for instance, it was estimated that <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/04/17/399816448/when-the-world-bank-does-more-harm-than-good">3.4 million people</a> were displaced in the previous decade by Bank-funded projects. The old accounting games, meant to exaggerate the good done by assistance, are joined by new ones. </p><p>The U.S. government applies a 92% discount to the debt of Highly-Indebted Poor Countries, and yet U.S. authorities include the <em>nominal</em> value of the debt relief in their “ODA” (official development assistance) numbers. Meaning: they significantly exaggerate the volume of their aid. The Financial Times has<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debt-IMF-World-Bank-Questions/dp/1583672222"> argued</a> that it is “the aid that isn’t” and has argued that “writing off official commercial debt should not count as aid.”</p><p>While it’s true that there have actually been large transformations at the Bank and Fund in recent years, those changes have not been in the way that the institutions try to shape the economies of borrowing countries, but rather in that they have focused their efforts on nations closer to the world’s economic core. </p><p>“By practically any metric,” a NBER study <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21805/w21805.pdf">observes</a>, “the post-2008 IMF programs to several European economies are the largest in the IMF’s 70-year history.”</p><figure>

    </figure><p>“IMF commitments as a share of world GDP,” the study explains, “hit an all-time high as the European Debt Crisis began to unravel.” Iceland <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w21805/w21805.pdf">began</a> an IMF program in 2008, followed by Greece, Ireland and Portugal.</p><p>The IMF-led bailout of Greece was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/business/economy/greece-europe-bailout.html">a staggering $375 billion</a>. In July 2015, “popular discontent led to a ‘no’ vote in a referendum on whether to accept the IMF’s loan conditions, <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/imf-worlds-controversial-financial-firefighter?amp">which included</a> raising taxes, lowering pensions and other spending, and privatizing industries.” </p><p>In the end, however, the Greek people’s voice wasn’t heard since “the government subsequently ignored the results and accepted the loans.”</p><p>The Fund used the same playbook in Greece and other lower-income European countries as it has used all over the developing world for decades: breaking democratic norms to provide billions to the elites, with austerity for the masses.</p><p>In the past two years, the Bank and Fund have pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into countries following government lockdowns and COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. More loans were <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2021/07/19/world-bank-group-s-157-billion-pandemic-surge-is-largest-crisis-response-in-its-history">given out</a> in a shorter time than ever before.</p><p>Even in late 2022 as interest rates continue to rise, the debt of poor countries keeps rising, and the amount they owe to rich countries keeps growing. History rhymes, and IMF visits to dozens of countries remind us of the early 1980s, when a massive debt bubble was popped by Federal Reserve policies. What followed was the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/29790240">worst</a> depression in the Third World since the 1930s.</p><p>We can hope that this does not happen again, but given the Bank and the Fund’s efforts to load up poor countries with more debt than ever before, and given that the cost of borrowing is going up in a historic way, we can predict that it will happen again.</p><p>And even where the Bank and Fund’s influence shrinks, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is beginning to step in. In the past decade, China has tried to emulate the dynamics of the IMF and World Bank through its own development institutions and through its <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative">“Belt and Road” initiative.</a></p><p>As the Indian geostrategist Brahma Chellaney <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-one-belt-one-road-loans-debt-by-brahma-chellaney-2017-01?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=1220154768&amp;hsa_cam=12374283753&amp;hsa_grp=117511853986&amp;hsa_ad=499567080219&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=aud-963711450924%3Adsa-19959388920&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9qKbBhAzEiwAS4yeDcc_HIqA1ZIctFh3fVFlICVBExxzh3kZk4p8xNK5J40IkrKhMVBOuRoCwnsQAvD_BwE&amp;barrier=accesspay">writes</a>, “Through its $1 trillion ‘one belt, one road’ initiative, China is supporting infrastructure projects in strategically located developing countries, often by extending huge loans to their governments. As a result, countries are becoming ensnared in a debt trap that leaves them vulnerable to China’s influence… the projects that China is supporting are often intended not to support the local economy, but to facilitate Chinese access to natural resources, or to open the market for its low-cost and shoddy export goods. In many cases, China even sends its own construction workers, minimizing the number of local jobs that are created.”</p><p>The last thing the world needs is another Bank and Fund drain dynamic, only pulling resources from poor countries to go to the genocidal dictatorship in Beijing. So it is good to see the CCP having trouble in this area. It is trying to grow its Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank by more than <a href="https://chinaglobalsouth.com/2022/10/31/china-based-development-bank-to-ramp-up-lending-by-10-billion-a-year/">$10 billion</a> per year, but it is encountering a variety of issues with projects that it financed across the developing world. Some governments, like in Sri Lanka, simply cannot pay back. Since the CCP cannot mint the world reserve currency, it actually has to eat the loss. Because of this, it won’t likely be able to come anywhere close to approximating the lending volume of the U.S.-Europe-Japan-led system.</p><p>Which is certainly a good thing: CCP loans may not come with onerous structural adjustment conditions, but they certainly don’t have any considerations for human rights. In fact, the CCP helped <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/china-one-belt-one-road-loans-debt-by-brahma-chellaney-2017-01?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=1220154768&amp;hsa_cam=12374283753&amp;hsa_grp=117511853986&amp;hsa_ad=499567080219&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=aud-963711451324%3Adsa-19959388920&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA9qKbBhAzEiwAS4yeDQ5TzKaWJ6-3NjKS-iCnXJZZEolq6l77xpX3Z2wbdyXZJ07BYWBU8xoC5k8QAvD_BwE&amp;barrier=accesspay">shield</a> one belt and road client — Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa — from war crimes allegations at the UN. Looking at its projects in Southeast Asia (where it is <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/rareearths-08092022183340.html">depleting Burmese minerals and timber</a> and <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/how-china-and-pakistan-forged-close-ties">eroding Pakistani sovereignty</a>) and sub-Saharan Africa (where it is <a href="https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/chinas-scramble-for-africas-rare-earth-elements/">extracting an enormous amount of rare earths</a>), it largely amounts to the same kind of resource theft and geopolitical control tactics practiced by colonial powers for centuries, just dressed up in a new kind of clothing.</p><p>It’s not clear that the Bank and Fund even view the CCP as a bad actor. After all, Wall Street and Silicon Valley tend to be quite friendly with the world’s worst dictators. China remains a creditor at the Bank and Fund: its membership has never been in question, despite the genocide of the Uyghur people. As long as the CCP does not get in the way of the big picture goals, the Bank and Fund probably don’t mind. There’s enough loot to go around.</p><h2>XVII. From Arusha To Accra</h2><blockquote><p><em>“Those who wield power control money.”</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691191072/the-currency-of-politics"><em>Arusha Delegates</em></a><em>, 1979</em></p><p><em> </em></p></blockquote><p>In 1979, developing nations <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arusha_Declaration">gathered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha</a> to devise an alternative plan to the IMF- and World Bank-led structural adjustment that had left them with mountains of debt and very little say as to the future of the world economy. </p><p>“Those who wield power control money,” the delegates <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691191072/the-currency-of-politics">wrote</a>: “Those who manage and control money wield power. An international monetary system is both a function and an instrument of prevailing power structures.”</p><p>As Stefan Eich writes in “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691191072/the-currency-of-politics">The Currency Of Politics</a>,” “the Arusha Initiative’s emphasis on the international monetary system’s burden of hierarchical imbalances was a powerful attempt to insist on money’s political nature by countering claims to neutral technical expertise asserted by the Fund’s money doctors.”</p><p>“The IMF may have claimed a neutral, objective, scientific stance,” Eich writes, “but all scholarly evidence, including the Fund’s internal documentation, pointed the other way. The Fund was, in fact, deeply ideological in the way it framed underdevelopment as a lack of private markets but systematically applied double standards in ignoring similar market controls in ‘developed’ countries.”</p><p>This resonates with what Cheryl Payer <a href="https://nyupress.org/9780853453765/the-debt-trap/">observed</a>, that Bank and Fund economists “erected a mystique around their subject which intimidated even other economists.” </p><p>“They represent themselves,” she said, “as highly trained technicians who determine the ‘correct’ exchange rate and ‘proper’ amount of money creation on the basis of complex formulas. They deny the political significance of their work.”</p><p>Like most of the leftist discourse on the Bank and Fund, the criticisms made at Arusha were mostly on target: the institutions were exploitative, and enriched their creditors at the expense of poor countries. But Arusha’s solutions missed the mark: central planning, social engineering and nationalization.</p><p>The Arusha delegates advocated for the Bank and Fund to be abolished, and for odious debts to be canceled: perhaps noble but entirely unrealistic goals. Beyond that, their best plan of action was “shift power into the hands of local governments” — a poor solution given that the vast majority of Third World countries were dictatorships.</p><p>For decades, the public in developing countries suffered as their leaders wavered between selling out their country to multinational corporations and socialist authoritarianism. Both options were destructive.</p><p>This is the trap that Ghana has found itself in since independence from the British Empire.

One of the biggest outcomes of structural adjustment has been, like elsewhere around the world, expedition of the extraction of Ghana’s natural resources. Between 1990 and 2002, for example, the government only received <a href="https://therealnews.com/ghanas-unions-and-left-reject-bailout-talks-with-the-imf-as-economic-crisis-spirals">$87.3 million</a> from the $5.2 billion worth of gold mined out of Ghanaian soil: in other words, 98.4% of the profits from gold mining in Ghana went to foreigners.</p><p>As Ghanaian <a href="https://therealnews.com/ghanas-unions-and-left-reject-bailout-talks-with-the-imf-as-economic-crisis-spirals">protestor</a> Lyle Pratt says, “The IMF is not here to bring down prices, they are not here to ensure that we construct roads — it is not their business and they simply don’t care… The IMF’s primary concern is to make sure that we build the capacity to pay our loans, not to develop.”</p><p>2022 feels like a rerun. The Ghanaian cedi has been one of the world’s worst-performing currencies this year, losing <a href="https://dailytrust.com/ghanaian-cedi-loses-48-5-ranks-among-worst-performing-currencies/">48.5</a>% of its value since January. The country is facing a debt crisis, and, like in decades past, is forced to prioritize paying back its creditors over investing in its own people.</p><p>In October, just a few weeks ago, the country received its latest IMF visit. If a loan is finalized, it would be the 17th IMF loan for Ghana since the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1978/05/09/archives/cia-said-to-have-aided-plotters-who-overthrew-nkrumah-in-ghana.html">CIA-backed</a> military coup of 1966. That is <em>17 layers</em> of structural adjustment.</p><p>A visit from the IMF is a bit like a visit from the Grim Reaper — it can only mean one thing: more austerity, pain, and — without exaggeration — death. Perhaps the wealthy and well-connected can escape unscathed or even enriched, but for the poor and working classes, the currency devaluation, rising interest rates and disappearance of bank credit is devastating. This is not the Ghana of 1973 that Cheryl Payer first wrote about in “The Debt Trap”: it is 50 years later, and the trap is <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/GHA/ghana/external-debt-stock#:~:text=Ghana%20external%20debt%20for%202020,a%205.48%25%20increase%20from%202016.">40 times</a> deeper.</p><p>But perhaps there is a glimmer of hope.</p><p>On December 5 to 7, 2022 in the Ghanaian capital of Accra, there will be a different kind of visit. Instead of creditors looking to charge interest on the people of Ghana and dictate their industries, the speakers and organizers of the <a href="https://www.afrobitcoin.org/">Africa Bitcoin Conference</a> are gathering to share information, open-source tools and decentralizing tactics on how to build economic activity beyond the control of corrupt governments and foreign multinational corporations. </p><p>Farida Nabourema is the lead organizer. She is pro-democracy; pro-poor; anti-Bank and Fund; anti-authoritarian; and pro-Bitcoin.</p><p>“The real issue,” Cheryl Payer once wrote, “is <em>who controls</em> the capital and technology that is exported to the poorer countries.” </p><p>One can argue that Bitcoin as capital and as technology is being exported to Ghana and Togo: it certainly didn’t arise there. But it’s not clear where it arose. No one knows who created it. And no government or corporation can control it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>During the gold standard, the violence of colonialism corrupted a neutral monetary standard. In the post-colonial world, a fiat monetary standard — upheld by the Bank and Fund — corrupted a post-colonial power structure. For the Third World, perhaps a post-colonial, post-fiat world will be the right mix.</p><p>Proponents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_theory">dependency theory</a> like Samir Amin gathered at conferences like Arusha and called for a “delinking” of poor countries from rich ones. The idea was: the wealth of rich countries was not just attributable to their liberal democracies, property rights and entrepreneurial environments, but also to their resource and labor theft from poor countries. Sever that drain, and poor countries could get a leg up. Amin <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08935698808657801?journalCode=rrmx20">predicted</a> that “the construction of a system beyond capitalism will have to begin in the peripheral areas.” If we agree with Allen Farrington that today’s fiat system is <a href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/this-is-not-capitalism-5ed0a9d5dfa9">not capitalism</a>, and that the current dollar system is deeply flawed, then perhaps Amin was right. A new system is more likely to emerge in Accra, not Washington or London.</p><p>As Saifedean Ammous <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fiat-Standard-Slavery-Alternative-Civilization/dp/1544526474">writes</a>, “The developing world consists of countries that had not yet adopted modern industrial technologies by the time an inflationary global monetary system began replacing a relatively sound one in 1914. This dysfunctional global monetary system continuously compromised these countries’ development by enabling local and foreign governments to expropriate the wealth produced by their people.”</p><p>In other words: rich countries got industrialized before they got fiat: poor countries got fiat before they got industrialized. The only way to break the cycle of dependency, according to Nabourema and other organizers of the Africa Bitcoin Conference, might be to transcend fiat.</p><h2>XVIII. A Glimmer of Hope</h2><blockquote><p><em>“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>–</em><a href="https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/quotes/economics/"><em>Satoshi Nakamoto</em></a></p></blockquote><p>Whatever the answer is to poverty in the Third World, we know it is not more debt. “The poor of the world,” Cheryl Payer <a href="https://monthlyreviewarchives.org/mr/article/view/MR-046-11-1995-04_3">concludes</a>, “don’t need another ‘bank,’ however benign. They need decently paid work, responsive government, civil rights, and national autonomy.”</p><p>For seven decades, the World Bank and IMF have been enemies of all four.</p><p>Looking forward, says Payer, “the most important task for those in the wealthy countries who are concerned with international solidarity is to actively fight to end the flow of foreign aid.” The problem is that the current system is designed and incentivized to keep this flow going. The only way to make a change is through a total paradigm shift.</p><p>We already know that Bitcoin can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Check-Your-Financial-Privilege-Gladstein/dp/B09V2NM9VJ/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1663822844&amp;sr=8-1">help</a> individuals inside developing countries gain personal financial freedom and escape the broken systems imposed on them by their corrupt rulers and international financial institutions. This is what will be accelerated in Accra next month, contra the designs of the Bank and Fund. But can Bitcoin actually change the core-periphery dynamics of the world’s power and resource structure?</p><p>Nabourema is hopeful, and doesn’t understand why leftists in general condemn or ignore Bitcoin. </p><p>“A tool that is capable of allowing people to build and access wealth independent from institutions of control can be seen as a leftist project,” she says. “As an activist that believes that citizens should be paid in currencies that actually value their life and sacrifices, Bitcoin is a people’s revolution.”</p><p>“I find it painful,” she says, “that a farmer in sub-Saharan Africa only earns 1% of the price of coffee on the global market. If we can get to a stage where farmers can sell their coffee without so many middle institutions more directly to the buyers, and get paid in bitcoin, you could imagine how much of a difference that would make in their lives.”</p><p>“Today,” she says, “our countries in the Global South still borrow money in U.S. dollars, but over time our currencies depreciate and lose value and we end up having to make twice or three times the payment we initially promised in order to reimburse our creditors.”</p><p>“Now imagine,” she says, “if we get to a stage in 10 or 20 years where bitcoin is the global money that is accepted for business worldwide, where every nation has to borrow in bitcoin and spend bitcoin and every nation has to pay their debts in bitcoin. In that world, then foreign governments cannot demand that we repay them in currencies that we need to earn but they can simply print; and just because they decide to increase their interest rates, it won’t automatically jeopardize the lives of millions or billions of people in our countries.”</p><p>“Of course,” Nabourema says, “Bitcoin is going to come with issues like any innovation. But the beauty is that those issues can be improved with peaceful, global collaboration. No one knew 20 years ago what amazing things the internet allows us to do today. No one can tell what amazing things Bitcoin will allow us to do in 20 years.”</p><p>“The way forward,” she says, “is an awakening of the masses: for them to understand the ins and outs of how the system works and to understand that there are alternatives. We have to be in a position where people can reclaim their liberty, where their lives aren’t controlled by authorities that can confiscate their freedom at any time without consequences. Gradually we are getting closer to this goal with Bitcoin.”</p><p>“Since money is the center of everything in our world,” Nabourema says, “the fact that we are now able to obtain financial independence is so important for people in our countries, as we seek to reclaim our rights in every field and sector.”</p><p>In an interview for this article, deflation advocate Jeff Booth explains that as the world approaches a bitcoin standard, the Bank and the Fund will be less likely to be creditors, and more likely to be co-investors, partners, or simply grantors. As prices fall over time, this means debt gets more expensive and more difficult to repay. And with the U.S. money printer turned off, there would be no more bailouts. At first, he suggests, the Bank and Fund will try to continue to lend, but for the first time they’ll actually lose big chunks of money as countries freely default as they move onto a bitcoin standard. So they may consider co-investing instead, where they might become more interested in the real success and sustainability of the projects they support as the risk is more equally shared.</p><p>Bitcoin mining is an additional area of potential change. If poor countries can exchange their natural resources for money without dealing with foreign powers, then maybe their sovereignty can strengthen, instead of erode. Through mining, the vast amounts of river power, hydrocarbons, sun, wind, ground warmth, and offshore OTEC in emerging markets could be converted directly to the world reserve currency <em>without permission</em>. This has never before been possible. The debt trap seems truly inescapable for most poor countries, continuing to grow every year. Maybe investing in anti-fiat Bitcoin reserves, services and infrastructure is a way out and a path to striking back.</p><p>Bitcoin, Booth says, can short-circuit the old system that has subsidized wealthy countries at the expense of wages in poor countries. In that old system, the periphery had to be sacrificed to protect the core. In the new system, the periphery and core can work together. Right now, he says, the U.S. dollar system keeps people poor through wage deflation in the periphery. But by equalizing the money and creating a neutral standard for everyone, a different dynamic is created. With one monetary standard, labor rates would be necessarily pulled closer together, instead of kept apart. We don’t have words for such a dynamic, Booth says, because it has never existed: he suggests “forced cooperation.”</p><p>Booth describes the U.S. ability to instantly issue any amount of more debt as “theft in base money.” Readers may be familiar with the Cantillon effect, where those who are closest to the money printer benefit from fresh cash while those farthest away suffer. Well, it turns out there is a global Cantillon effect, too, where the U.S. benefits from issuing the global reserve currency, and poor countries suffer. </p><p>“A bitcoin standard,” Booth says, “ends this.”</p><p>How much of the world’s debt is odious? There are<em> trillions </em>of dollars of loans created at the whim of dictators and unelected supranational financial institutions, with zero consent from the people on the borrowing side of the deal. The moral thing to do would be to cancel this debt, but of course, that will never happen because the loans exist ultimately as assets on the balance sheets of the creditors of the Bank and Fund. They will always prefer to keep the assets and simply create new debt to pay the old.</p><p>The IMF “put” on sovereign debt creates the biggest bubble of all: bigger than the dot-com bubble, bigger than the subprime mortgage bubble, and bigger even than the stimulus-powered COVID bubble. Unwinding this system will be extremely painful, but it’s the right thing to do. If debt is the drug, and the Bank and Fund are the dealers, and the developing country governments are the addicts, then it’s unlikely either party will want to stop. But to heal, the addicts need to go to rehab. The fiat system makes this basically impossible. In the Bitcoin system, it may get to the point where the patient has no other choice.</p><p>As Saifedean Ammous says in an interview for this article, today, if Brazil’s rulers want to borrow $30 billion and the U.S. Congress agrees, America can snap its fingers and allocate the funds through the IMF. It’s a political decision. But, he says, if we get rid of the money printer, then these decisions become less political and start to resemble the more prudent decision-making of a bank that knows no bailout will come.</p><p>In the last 60 years of Bank and Fund dominance, countless tyrants and kleptocrats were bailed out — against any financial common sense — so that their nations’ natural resources and labor could continue to be exploited by core countries. This was possible because the government at the very heart of the system could print the reserve currency.</p><p>But in a bitcoin standard, Ammous wonders, who is going to make these high risk, billion-dollar loans in exchange for structural adjustment?</p><p>“You,” he asks, “and whose bitcoins?”</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Alex Gladstein.

friendlier interface.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Arman The Parman, a Bitcoin educator passionate about privacy.</em></p><p>Over many years, I have tinkered with various Bitcoin wallets and mentored many people to hold their private keys securely. I settled on "<a href="https://electrum.org/#home">Electrum Desktop Wallet</a>" as my favorite and most versatile software wallet. </p><p>In this essay, I will outline some of Electrum's features, and my likes and dislikes. This is not a detailed guide on how to use it and get the most out of it. I also won't be going into why you should hold your own Bitcoin keys; it's assumed you know and desire to do this, but if you need to know why it's essential, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/reasons-withdraw-bitcoin-from-exchanges">please take a look at "Six Reasons To Withdraw Your Bitcoin From Exchanges."</a></p><p>I have experienced first-hand Electrum's idiosyncrasies and worked out solutions to overcome them - if used correctly, it is the most powerful wallet I have come across.</p><p>Electrum is for the person who is, or aspires to be, a “power” user. Because it allows so much control, and because of my familiarity with the software, I choose to teach this wallet to most of the students as part of my Bitcoin privacy/security <a href="https://armantheparman.com/mentorship/">mentorship course</a> (although some people need something simpler to use). The experience of teaching how to use it has certainly helped me understand what people find intuitive and what they find tricky.</p><p>For the new Bitcoiner going at it alone, Electrum would be totally safe to use, provided they take their time and use it in a testing environment with only a small number of sats at first. </p><h2>Operating System</h2><p>Electrum can be installed on a Windows PC, Mac computer, or a Linux PC, and importantly for some, on ARM chip computers (i.e. Raspberry Pi’s). </p><p>It can also be installed on a phone, but the mobile version's functionality is poor, and its connection to nodes has been erratic, so I don’t recommend that version. BlueWallet is a good alternative for a phone wallet.</p><h2>Downloading And Verifying</h2><p>Downloading and installing the program is straightforward for Windows and Mac, and a little tricky for Linux users, particularly those who are still learning to use Linux.</p><p>For those just testing the program out, simply downloading and using it without verifying the software is fine - I just wouldn’t do that for large amounts, or if privacy is a big concern (i.e. if you have KYC free bitcoin, you need to practice good privacy to keep the coins unidentifiable).</p><p>If you are in fact going to end up using this wallet for a significant sum, then you should learn to verify the software with gpg. You can build your skills around this <a href="https://armantheparman.com/gpg-articles/">here</a>. You can do that while waiting for my guide on how to use Electrum safely/privately.</p><h2>The Environment</h2><p>One problem with Electrum is that if you run the program in the most intuitive way (i.e. just double click the icon) rather than the command line (with certain flags), you will almost certainly connect to a random Bitcoin node which will expose your wallet and all its potential 8.6 billion addresses to the owner of the random node - the owner could be a surveillance company, and there goes your privacy (they will get all your used and unused addresses, and your IP address).</p><p>To overcome this, I will teach you, in the next installment, how to load up a disposable wallet first, optimise your network settings (connect to your own node, or one you trust), and only then load your real wallet into Electrum.</p><p>Some people may be lost on what I mean by network settings or nodes. You can learn more about that here if you feel like going on a very important <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/six-reasons-you-should-run-bitcoin-node">tangent</a>.</p><p>The Electrum Wallet has a very clean layout displaying your addresses, although you have to know to go to the menu and select “show addresses” to see it. Then you’ll get a list of your first 20 receiving addresses highlighted green (you have 4.6 billion of these but obviously not all shown), and a list of your first 10 receiving addresses highlighted yellow (again, you have 4.6 billion of this type). </p><p>Many other software wallets don’t show you a list of addresses and only provide an address when requested to send coins to the wallet. This hides information from the user to keep things simple, but the user tends to remain ignorant, as the opportunity to learn is not presented. I have met many people who use Ledger Live or the Trezor suite, or Blue Wallet on their phone, and don’t realize they have limitless addresses, let alone something called “change” addresses.</p><p>Electrum also shows you a list of all your <a href="https://armantheparman.com/utxo/">UTXOs</a> (but you have to select “show coins”) to enable that. </p><h2>Electrum Server Is Necessary</h2><p>Electrum Wallet can not connect to your Bitcoin Core node directly. This is annoying, but it does make electrum run faster. Much faster. You still need Bitcoin Core, but you will also need software called Electrum Server (of which there are different varieties each with their advantages and disadvantages, which I won’t go into here). Installing Bitcoin Core is hard enough for some people. Installing Electrum Server is MUCH harder, you really need to be fairly techy. </p><p>For ease and positive reinforcement, I recommend people install, for their first node, a node-package like MyNode (<a href="https://armantheparman.com/mynode-bitcoin-node-easy-setup-guide-raspberry-pi/">see my guide</a>) or Raspiblitz (<a href="https://armantheparman.com/raspiblitz/">see my guide</a>), before moving on to installing a node and associated software on a regular PC. </p><p>These packages have some weaknesses but are excellent to begin with because with a single installation process on a Raspberry Pi 4, you get many applications (like Electrum Server, Lightning, BTCPay Server, Mempool viewer - which you’d otherwise have to install one by one, and potentially verify) and the cost is only about $300 for all the equipment (the software is free). As your skills and interest progresses, then I recommend people look into more advanced node setups (none of which get expensive). In case you’re wondering why you should run a node at all, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/six-reasons-you-should-run-bitcoin-node">here are six excellent reasons</a>.</p><h2>Wallet Creation</h2><p>I think it’s useful to define the two types of wallets before going much further:</p><ol><li>Software wallet - this is the program that manages your Bitcoin private keys and addresses. Eg Electrum, Sparrow, Blue Wallet.</li></ol><ol><li>Bitcoin wallet - by this, I mean the collection of unique addresses that are created deterministically (and reproducibly) from your mnemonic seed phrase (usually 12 or 24 words) - each seed phrase has 8.6 billion unique addresses that it can access/create.</li></ol><p>Electrum, by default, creates wallets that are not standard which is very annoying. The most common protocol is called BIP39 (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) that nearly all wallets will use. </p><p>That means that the 12 or 24 words that your BIP39 wallet created will be compatible with other BIP39 wallets, such that if you lose your software (or hardware) wallet, then you can get it back by entering your seed words into any compatible BIP39 wallet - it doesn’t have to be the same brand. </p><p>The Electrum developer, however, has his own plans and thinks the industry standard is unsafe (he has an outrageously unrealistic concern about BIP39). Instead of BIP39, Electrum creates wallets based on its own protocol - which no other wallet uses by default. Unfortunately, if you create an Electrum seed phrase, you can only use that seed phrase with Electrum.</p><p>Importantly, Electrum will allow you to restore a BIP39 wallet into it, but you have to know how. It will not, however, <em>create</em> a BIP39 wallet for you. But there are ways around this.</p><p>You can also simply load a single address into Electrum to observe its balance - it doesn’t even have to be yours (although, don’t get ideas about spending the balance, that’s not possible unless you load in the private key, in which case the address would be yours).</p><p>When creating or restoring a Bitcoin wallet with Electrum, you can choose what address type to have:</p><ul><li>Legacy - these addresses start with 1 - the original Bitcoin addresses. </li><li>Pay-to-Script-Hash - these addresses all start with ‘3’.</li><li>Segwit - From 2017 after the Segwit soft fork, you could create “Pay-to-witness-public-key-hash” (also called “Native Segwit”, or “Bech32”). These are the most commonly used now. They all start with "bc1q."</li><li>Taproot. This is new and not yet supported by Electrum. Taproot was a soft fork in 2021. Addresses start with "bc1p."</li></ul><p>The first three address types listed have extended public keys that look a little different from each others'. They start with xPub, yPub, and zPub, respectively. I believe taproot is tPub but I'm still getting familiar with that. For more education material about Bitcoin public and private keys, you can <a href="https://armantheparman.com/public-and-private-keys/">read here.</a></p><h2>Labels</h2><p>This feature is not unique, but very important to have if you want to maintain privacy through good coin control. By labeling your UTXOs, you'll know which ones you might want to avoid spending together with others. For example, if you have a KYC-free or mixed coin, and you select it together with a KYC coin and send the combined total somewhere, then the private coin can be identified as belonging to whoever owns the KYC coin (since someone had the ability to spend both together). Don't do that. The labels can be saved to a file so they can be uploaded to a different computer should you have duplicate wallets.</p><h2>Coin Selection</h2><p>Coin selection is a great feature. You can go to your address windows, and pick the coin you want to spend - or group several of them for spending. If you don’t select which coin you want to spend, like any other software, Electrum will choose the "best" coin to spend for you - but the software doesn’t always know what's best. It doesn’t know which coins not to merge, which ones are dust attacks, and which ones are mixed. <em>You</em> know this, because you’ve labeled them, and then you can decide how to manage it.</p><h2>Sending/Receiving</h2><p>The process of sending bitcoin payments is very "fine tunable." You can keep it simple, but there’s also an advanced button which I encourage people to always use - at least learn to get familiar. Here you can see exactly the important elements of the Bitcoin transaction - the inputs (with Tx IDs and addresses), the outputs, whether any listed addresses are found in your own wallet or not (through colour-coding), the mining fee and an ability to fine-tune it, the size of the transaction (in bytes), if there is a lock time, and if replace-by-fee is enabled. You don’t need to know right away what all these things mean, but at least they are there and as you get experienced, you’ll know what things to learn about.</p><p>When receiving, you can go to the receiving tab and the next unused address will be provided - with that you can copy/paste as needed or generate a QR code. Alternatively, you can go to the address window and select any address you see to create an invoice. You can right-click, select details, and you’ll see a button to create a QR code of the address or you can just copy the address text. </p><p>As soon as a payment is made to an address, and is waiting in the mempool, Electrum will show you the payment sitting with the address, which is handy - you don’t need to wait for a miner to mine the coin for you to know the payment is coming. Electrum also allows you to <em>spend</em> such an unconfirmed coin. </p><p>If a sender has set a very low fee and confirmation is taking a while, you can hurry up the payment by spending the unconfirmed transaction to another one of your addresses. In that second (downstream) transaction, you could add a high mining fee. To collect the fee, a miner would have to include the first transaction (not lucrative) and the downstream transaction you created (lucrative) - why? Because the second transaction is invalid until the first transaction is valid (as you can’t spend coins that theoretically don’t exist). This technique is called “child pays for parent.”</p><p>Another technique possible with Electrum, to speed up payments, is called RBF (replace by fee). This is not possible for the <em>receiver</em> to do as described above with “child pays for parent.” Instead, an impatient receiver must ask the <em>sender</em> to perform a RBF. The sender will resend the original UTXO which has been “spent” but not yet mined to the blockchain. That UTXO can be put in an alternative transaction (spending to the same address as the first transaction, or another), and with a higher mining fee. Whichever of the two transactions gets mined first will be valid and the other becomes invalid.</p><p><em>As a side note, RBF allows the potential for fraud. If a receiver (merchant) accepts an unconfirmed transaction as "payment received" and delivers the goods to the sender of the payment, the sender has an opportunity to perform a RBF transaction before the original payment gets mined. They would use their own address as the recipient of the payment, and add a high fee. When that gets mined, the original transaction becomes invalid, is dropped by all the nodes from the mempool, and the balance from the merchant's wallet disappears. This is why you'll notice that Bitcoin exchanges, when you deposit bitcoin, will wait for confirmation on the blockchain before crediting your account.</em></p><h2>Multisignature wallets</h2><p>Electrum manages multisignature wallets really well, and for a time I believe it was the only software wallet you could use. You can have cosigners with hot keys (software wallets) or cold keys (connect hardware wallets). The multisignature public keys can be made one at a time, on different days, in different places on different computers (or hardware wallets) - spreading it out reduces the risk of a single point of failure/attack. How far you take the precautions is up to you.</p><p>Extra details about multisig wallets and keys <a href="https://armantheparman.com/msigkeys/">can be found here</a>, and I’ll have a guide on making these wallets in the future. The wallet creation process is excellent but with some quirks which become irrelevant once you know about them. </p><p>I really like how Electrum handles partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs), an important feature of multisig wallets, discussed next.</p><h2>PSBTs</h2><p>An Electrum bitcoin transaction is represented by just a bunch of text (which themselves represent binary numbers, as all computer data is). You have the ability to save that text to a file, a QR code, or to the clipboard (as text, for copy/paste into an email for example). That text can be sent anywhere, and however you want. If you are so inclined, you can extract the text and send it by email, a physical letter, Morse code, smoke signals, gravitational waves back in time via a black hole, or interpretive dance - that’s up to you.</p><p>Electrum gives you the ability to extract that text and save it, <em>before</em> it’s signed, <em>after</em> it’s signed, or in a multisignature setting when it’s <em>partially</em> signed.</p><p>Multisignature is particularly interesting. If there are for example 3 key holders around the world, you can sign a transaction on your computer, extract the partially signed Bitcoin transaction, email it (or QR code over a video call) to another participant overseas, they can import it, sign it, then send it to the 3rd person for signing and broadcasting. No, this is not unique to Electrum, I just like how Electrum handles it. The workflow is not intuitive though, and takes practice.</p><h2>Pay To Many (PayJoin And CoinJoin)</h2><p>There is a hidden feature (search the menus) where you can choose multiple destinations (multiple outputs) when spending. For example you can take 6.15 bitcoin, and send 0.01 bitcoin to 615 different employees, all in one transaction. This feature allows you to create PayJoins manually - something only a minority of people would do, or even understand, but it’s cool nonetheless.</p><p>Pay to Many also allows you to create your own manual CoinJoins. For more information on what that is and how to do it, <a href="https://armantheparman.com/cj/">see this guide</a>. </p><h2>Gap Limit</h2><p>An important feature that not all wallets have is the ability to set the gap limit. As I mentioned earlier, every wallet is a collection of 8.6 billion addresses. The software wallet must connect to a node and ask if an address has bitcoin associated with it. It’s not going to check all 8.6 billion of them. Electrum asks for the first 20 addresses. If they are uded, it will ask for another 20, and so on. It will keep this up until the node returns 20 unused addresses in a row. </p><p>This is a way to explain that the default gap limit is 20, but you can change that. Why would you? Because sometimes merchants allow customers to produce bitcoin addresses themselves through a payment app (like my <a href="https://armantheparman.com/donations/">donation page</a>, hint-hint). If the first 20 customers make invoices (one address each, sequentially given by the app), and then the 21st customer generates an invoice and pays, then the Electrum wallet will appear empty. This happens because the first 20 addresses will be queried, found to be unused, and then Electrum will stop searching. Electrum allows you to change the gap limit, eg to 500 but there are no instructions, you’d have to research online, or find it right here:</p><p><em>You’ll have to first go to the menu: view→show console, and then type this command in the console (of course the "500" can be changed to another number):</em></p><p><em>wallet.change_gap_limit(500)</em></p><p><em>With this command, you’ll see 500 new addresses in the address window.</em></p><h2>Watching Wallets</h2><p>These are wallets without private keys, necessary for hardware wallets to connect to. Most people with a hardware wallet use the software on the computer that "came with" the device, but they are not usually open source. Electrum is an alternative that can be used with any hardware device.</p><h2>Air-Gapped Computers</h2><p>It’s possible to install Electrum on a computer that can’t ever connect to the internet (Air-gapped computer). That computer can be used to check that the seed phrase a hardware wallet gives, created the correct addresses from the seed.</p><p>For example, you might buy a BitBox02 hardware wallet, and it creates a 24 word seed for you, and from that, create addresses (with associated private keys hidden from view). Depending on the level of paranoia you have (and the amount of bitcoin you are storing), you might choose not to trust the embedded software, and assume at first that the addresses it creates belong to the CEO to start with.</p><p>To check the addresses are genuine, you need to put the seed words into (restore) a different wallet - eg Electrum; and make sure Electrum generates identical addresses. That’s easy enough, but you can’t just type seeds into any old computer with Electrum on it. Well, you <em>can</em> but you really really shouldn’t - malware can potentially extract your keystrokes and steal your bitcoin.</p><p>One solution is to enter the seeds into Electrum on a clean and secure air-gapped computer (or a different brand hardware wallet).</p><p>The cheapest way is with a Raspberry Pi Zero - They used to cost about $10 before pandemic-induced shortages. The ARM chip on these devices means not all software wallets are compatible. Electrum is and works magnificently. </p><p><a href="https://armantheparman.com/how-to-set-up-a-raspberry-pi-zero-air-gapped-with-electrum-desktop-wallet/">Here's how to build your own</a>. It's like a seed signer but has the full functionality of Electrum.</p><h2>Sign/Verify A Message</h2><p>A Bitcoin transaction is a payment that contains a coin that was previously "locked" by an address. To unlock the coin (with respect to the rules of Bitcoin) and be allowed to spend it, using public/private key cryptography, one must prove they own the private key to the address contained within. That is done with a signature (using the private key, but not revealing it).</p><p>The signed transaction is itself a message; a bit of computer data, although following a strict protocol.</p><p>Using public/private key cryptography, outside of Bitcoin, you can actually sign ANY message. For example, here is a message I signed after I selected an address (and therefore its private key). Below is the message, the address and the signature (nonsense-looking text), which was produced after I clicked “sign.”</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTAwOTM2ODU4MTUwNTc3/image3.png" height="525" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Now you or anyone can take the address, the message, and the signature, put it in Electrum (or other software), and <em>verify</em> that it really was the correct private key (matching the address) that produced that message (this is actually the same type of verification that Bitcoin nodes do for any Bitcoin transaction). I’ll open another wallet that hasn’t got the relevant private key, to demonstrate verification. I went into the “verify message” window, then entered all the details as you see above, and then clicked Verify:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTAwOTM2ODU4MjE1OTQx/image1.png" height="511" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Encrypt/Decrypt A Message</h2><p>Instead of <em>signing</em> a message with public/private key cryptography, the output can be an <em>encrypted</em> version of the message (i.e. jumbled up and unreadable) using someone else's public key/address. The encrypted version can then be sent to anyone who has the corresponding private key, because the text can only be read when the private key is used to reverse the process.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MTAwOTM2ODU4MTUwNDA1/image2.png" height="516" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>For example, you could have been given my bitcoin public key, encrypted this message as above, emailed me the cyphertext (the random-looking text in the bottom field), and because I have the private key to the public key, I can reverse the encrypted message to the original form and read your wrong-think message. In this way, you can send text to me across an insecure communication channel, and only I can read it.</p><p>This is the magic of public/private key cryptography, and one of the main components that made Bitcoin possible. We should all be thankful that the cypherpunks fought hard, and won, against the US government who tried to ban it in the 1990s.</p><h2>Summary </h2><p>This was a long review of the Electrum Desktop Wallet. Hopefully, that has piqued your interest to learn how to use it - I will release a guide on this very soon. In the meantime, it may be worth practicing very basic Bitcoin transactions by following <a href="https://armantheparman.com/level2/">this exercise</a>.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Arman The Parman.

It does not make bitcoin or any cryptocurrency a legal tender in the country.</p><p>The bill tasks the executive branch with selecting government bodies to oversee the market. The expectation is that the Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) will be in charge when bitcoin is used as payment, while the country’s securities and exchange commission (CVM) will be the watchdog when it is used as an investment asset. Both the BCB and the CVM, along with the federal tax authority (RFB), helped lawmakers craft the overhaul legislation.</p><p>Home to a vibrant cryptocurrency economy, Brazil has at times seen more citizens trade coins such as bitcoin than invest in the stock market.

Cryptocurrency service providers will only be able to operate in the country after explicit authorization by the federal government.</p><p>One rule sought to demand that such companies explicitly separate their patrimony from capital owned by customers –– for example, bitcoin the firm custodies for users. The clause sought to prevent events such as the recently seen with FTX, where user funds were commingled with the company’s funds, and help the recovery of user assets in the event of bankruptcy. It was rejected on Tuesday’s vote.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MTAxMTcwMzk2OTk3Mjk3/26812213289_f460d63e07_k.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Visiting El Salvador, It’s Clear That Bukele’s Bitcoin Country Is Neither Utopian, Nor Totalitarian]]></title><description><![CDATA[After a week in El Salvador, it’s clear that state-run Bitcoin adoption is a slow but critical foundation for revitalizing the country.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/reality-of-bukeles-bitcoin-el-salvador</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/reality-of-bukeles-bitcoin-el-salvador</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nayib Bukele]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[Adopting Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Shinobi]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2022 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMDU2OTk4MzIxMDA2MjM4/20220608_btcfinal_best-paxful-_-bitcoin-for-the-100-x-bitcoin-magazine-_-series-2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">After a week in El Salvador, it’s clear that state-run Bitcoin adoption is a slow but critical foundation for revitalizing the country.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Shinobi, a self-taught educator in the Bitcoin space and tech-oriented Bitcoin podcast host.</em></p><p>I recently spent a week in El Salvador to attend <a href="https://adoptingbitcoin.org/2022/">Adopting Bitcoin</a> and decided it might be worthwhile to summarize my perception of things having actually had the chance to visit the country myself. </p><p>Since the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender">announcement of the Bitcoin legal tender law in 2021</a>, the topic of El Salvador has been a deeply divisive one in this space. On one hand, you have people blindly cheering on President Nayib Bukele and treating all criticism as FUD and misinformation generated simply to attack Bitcoin and the use of it. On the other hand, you have people blindly decrying him as a dictator and violator of human rights and treating anything positive he is accomplishing for his country as irrelevant in the face of his disregard for law. </p><p>Obviously, I am not a Salvadoran. I have never lived in the country and the short amount of time I have now spent there is by no means enough to truly acquire a deep insight into what life is like in El Salvador, or to really appreciate the nature of the problems people face there. Nevertheless, seeing things for that short time in person has given me a very different perspective than the one I had purely informed by reading things over the internet. </p><h2>Adoption Has Been Slow, But The Seed Is Planted</h2><p>I was very skeptical of the Bitcoin law when it was first proposed. My <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/does-el-salvador-really-benefit-bitcoin">first article</a> for Bitcoin Magazine was actually about my worries over ways the law could cause negative consequences and effectively implode on itself if adoption of Bitcoin took off too fast early on. I saw the promise of conversion to USD by the government of El Salvador as something that could fail catastrophically if Bitcoin became a major vehicle for remittance payments, effectively bankrupting the trust established for conversion on the dollar side. Thankfully, that did not happen. </p><p>Adoption seems to be a very slow-moving wave in the country, and according to many people I talked to when I was there, many businesses that used to accept bitcoin have actually stopped accepting it over the last year or so. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-fixing-chivo-bitcoin-wallet">Chivo</a> is still dealing with problems, to the point that even today there are still issues with the ATMs during attempts to sell, and horrible UX flows make paying at the few businesses that accept BTC an annoying experience. It is by no means "Bitcoin country," as people constantly call it, in the sense of being able to use Bitcoin everywhere. But the opportunities to use it in El Salvador do far exceed those of any other physical locality I have ever traveled to myself. The plant hasn't quite sprouted yet, but the seed is clearly in the ground. </p><h2>Bukele Is Going Beyond Bitcoin</h2><p>Beyond the debates over Bitcoin use and adoption though, Bukele has done quite a lot in the last year. I feel like people in this space pontificating on the internet lose sight of this in arguing over the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador, but what is being done in the country goes beyond just Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a part of the plan, yes, but this is a nation of <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">more than six million people</a> for whom President Bukele is responsible. His concern isn't, and should not be, purely to benefit Bitcoin with his actions in office. He has the citizens of El Salvador and their wellbeing to concern himself with. That is his primary concern. </p><p>When I was in El Salvador for Adopting Bitcoin, I met someone who has been living in the country for the last 10 years who only recently got into Bitcoin because of the Bitcoin Law passed by Bukele a year ago. He had almost a decade of experience living in El Salvador as it was before Bukele, and the reality of it as he described was much more brutal than any statistics could paint: street merchants being murdered over not being able to afford 16 cents of protection money, widespread racketeering and robbery, corruption all across the government. Gang members would commit a murder, get arrested, and be out on the street within a few months due to how easy it was to bribe officials. He would regularly go to sleep listening to gunshots from rival gangs fighting over territory the block over from his house. It was completely unbridled anarchy. </p><p>I cannot even truly imagine living in such an environment, and I have lived my entire life in one of the most dangerous cities in the United States. All of that changed this year with President Bukele's <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/26/1125172960/el-salvadors-president-has-taken-over-the-government-and-installed-martial-law#:~:text=President%20Nayib%20Bukele%20has%20taken,is%20against%20El%20Salvador's%20constitution.">declaration of martial law</a> and an all-out war on the gangs of the country. <a href="https://cuencahighlife.com/with-almost-60000-suspected-gang-members-already-in-custody-el-salvador-goes-after-more/">Almost 60,000 gang members</a> have been arrested during the course of the year, and the results have been pronounced. </p><p>The murder rate <a href="https://elsalvadorinfo.net/homicide-rate-in-el-salvador/">has plummeted</a>, people are going out at night where before most people would not consider that a risk worth taking and <a href="https://elsalvadorinenglish.com/2022/06/01/el-salvador-received-521000-tourists-in-the-first-quarter-of-2022/">tourism is growing</a>. I am no stranger to living places where you have to keep your head on a swivel and pay attention to your surroundings, but not even for an instant in my week there did I feel like there was even a slight chance of something bad happening. As an outsider, it felt perfectly safe to me, and the man I met who has lived there for a decade described the El Salvador of today as an entirely different country compared to the one he moved to 10 years ago. </p><p>Have there been cases of false arrests? <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/06/el-salvador-president-bukele-human-rights-crisis/">Yes</a>. Is there an existential issue in sweeping aside due process to deal with the problem of violence in the country? Yes. But what would be the alternative solution anyone else would offer? </p><p>It was a common occurrence for people to be murdered over sums of money so small that here in the United States, many would just tell a cashier to keep it because they don't want to carry that small amount of change in their pockets. Yes, due process is a core tenant of a stable society, but isn't the ability to live without worry over being murdered for pocket change more important? I think it is very easy for people far removed from a situation to lecture those who aren't about how to handle them, to treat the situation as some intellectual exercise that should be approached with the goal of a perfect solution. But the real world doesn't work like that. Life is messy, and perfect solutions are almost never attainable. </p><p>Removing the massive gang presence in the country is a prerequisite to actually enabling economic growth. You can't have a growing economy if gangs are going to swoop in and extort money from people every day. No one from outside of the country is rationally going to want to take their money and invest it in such an environment. However imperfect the solution being implemented is right now, it is a solution, and it is showing results. NOTUS Energy from Germany <a href="https://newsinamerica.com/en/business/2022/a-german-company-plans-to-invest-100-million-in-energy-projects-in-el-salvador/#:~:text=Heiner%20R%C3%B6ger%2C%20CEO%20of%20NOTUS,Minister%20Alexandra%20Hill%20last%20Tuesday.">stated its intent</a> to invest $100 million in energy infrastructure in the country, specifically citing improvements in security in recent years as a factor. If Bukele and the current government continue the path they are on, it is very likely interest in similar investments will continue to grow. </p><h2>Not An Intellectual Exercise</h2><p>The Bitcoin Law has not led to instant prosperity in El Salvador, but it is laying the foundations of that to come. Chivo still has its issues, but given time, those can be improved and private solutions can be built and tailored to meet the needs of people in El Salvador. The use of Bitcoin hasn't exploded through the entire country, but the seeds of it have been planted. Similarly, the crackdown on gangs this year has not magically turned the economy and country around, but it has planted the seeds of something. Removing the gangs from the street has created room for that economic growth to happen where it otherwise would not have had the space. Things are moving in the right direction. </p><p>People looking in from the outside have tried to paint Bukele and his efforts as either unspeakable totalitarianism or an already-complete process of sculpting a utopian dream. In my opinion, they are neither. He is a man laying the foundations to allow Salvadorans the room and freedom to create their own economic prosperity. </p><p>Will it happen overnight? No. Is it guaranteed to have a positive outcome? No. But he is trying as best he can to clean up the mess left over from 30 years of corruption and violence after a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvadoran_Civil_War">brutal civil war</a>. Bitcoiners need to step back and realize that this is a real country with real people and not some intellectual exercise to argue about on the internet. </p><p>Things seem to me to be moving in a positive direction, and I hope they continue to do so. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Shinobi.

They help the poor. They provide for the needy. They reduce suffering. They make society better... right?</p><p><a href="https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/#:~:text=General%20Philanthropy,a%204%25%20increase%20from%202020.&amp;text=Corporate%20giving%20in%202021%20increased,a%2023.8%25%20increase%20from%202020.&amp;text=Foundation%20giving%20in%202021%20increased,a%203.4%25%20increase%20from%202020.">Billions of dollars go toward all sorts of charities every year</a> and most people view charities as a clear win for society. Yet, like getting your genomes analyzed, if you dig a little deeper, you might not like what you find.</p><p>The idea of charity is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_(Christian_virtue)">deeply Christian notion</a>. Charity is love for your neighbor, the idea that you provide for them when they are in need. Some of the first hospitals, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_hospitals">were Christian charity institutions</a>. The principle that the poor and needy should be treated with love and dignity was an alien notion to most philosophies, from those developed by the Romans to those of Nietzsche. Charity is one of the markers of Western civilization.</p><p>Unfortunately, charity has been debased. As a Christian virtue, charity is a much greater notion of love than just almsgiving. Sadly, the word "charity" has changed to mean pretty much only almsgiving as a result of fiat money. Instead of meaning helping the poor and vulnerable neighbor when they are in need, it now means giving money to some central organization to help people on your behalf. Charity has transitioned from a concrete action helping someone to a monetary gift to a central party. Charity has devolved like an absentee dad making up for a lack of relationship by buying his kids toys.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, fiat money has contributed greatly to this debasement.</p><h2>Charity In The Past</h2><p>Charity used to be very local. You had a relationship with your neighbor and helping them out was a part of the communal experience. There was already a web of relationships that connected you and charity was received with gratitude. The giver and the recipient both knew that the help wasn't something you could take for granted. Abusing charity had harsh consequences. Taking advantage of charity would be breaking the very relationships that provided that charity and would damage more relationships besides. Abusing charity would be like sawing off the branch you're standing on and few people would be foolish enough to do so.</p><p>Nowadays, relationships are treated as disposable. People don't have an incentive to act well because ultimately, the bad reputation that it should engender doesn't really come back to bite them. Most people are dependent on their employers or governments, so as long as those relationships are good, they're fine letting other relationships go. </p><p>Thus, relationship dynamics are much more high time preference. A relationship with a person is very different than a relationship with an organization. Organizations, quite frankly, are much easier to fool and they rely on bureaucratic procedures to determine your neediness. The centralization of our relationships around large organizations has made abuse of charity much easier.</p><p>As a result, charity has become less effective and mostly economic. What used to be fulfillment of all sorts of human needs has been reduced to monetary help. Fiat mentality is thinking that money can solve any and all problems, and charities are infected.</p><p>As with all virtues, practicing real charity is hard. It not only requires sacrifice on the part of the giver, but also their effort, whether it's time or relationship capital that's spent, or your personal skills that are used to help. What charitable organizations have done is to outsource all of that in an economic transaction with themselves in the middle.</p><p>The fiat mentality that money can solve everything has placed these large organizations in the middle and unsurprisingly, the money often isn't used very effectively, nor in a way that actually helps.</p><h2>Cantillonaire Almsgiving</h2><p>Fiat money has made charity pretty impersonal. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/lists/top-charities/?sh=fe8fc675f501">Giant organizations</a> sit in the middle of the almsgiving. These organizations are very convenient for the would-be altruist. The hard work of virtue is outsourced to someone else. Love for a neighbor can be bought for some money.</p><p>The money, if earned under a sound money economy, likely produced a lot of goods and services. In a fiat money economy, however, that money may have been earned through Cantillon effects, that is, through theft. The reputations of Cantillon winners are generally pretty bad. Think about the typical investment banker and what sort of reputation they have. Many people want to be investment bankers, it's true, but they're not exactly beloved.</p><p>Rent seekers don't really add anything to society and that's why their reputations are terrible. They need some level of reputation repair and charity gives them a convenient way to do that. They can buy a good reputation through charity.</p><p>This is a tried and true strategy for many billionaires. By focusing on "charity," they get a tremendous reputational boost and many of their fiat abuses are put on the back burner. The incentives of fiat money are such that it encourages almsgiving, especially as a way to whitewash your fiat abuses.</p><p>At this point, you might be thinking, isn't that good? Don't we want charities to be funded well? Don't we want good things that a charity provides? Allow me to disabuse you of that notion.</p><h2>Charities Have Terrible Incentives</h2><p>Certainly, the goals of most charities are noble. They want to end world hunger and reduce pollution and cure diseases and promote the arts. Their goals are noble, but do they actually achieve them?</p><p>The charities would have you believe that they do. Unfortunately, the incentives are such that they only tell you about their successes. After all, if they told you that they wasted millions of dollars on a scheme that didn't work, would you donate to them? Yet there must be lots of failures. If charities were all successes, wouldn't all of their noble goals be achieved already given the enormous amounts of funding? Wouldn't we have world peace, lifted billions out of poverty and have cured all kinds of diseases?</p><p>This should sound familiar. These same incentives exist in a decidedly different area: government. It's in their interest to tout only their successes. It’s in their interest to make it seem like they're not wasting money, even if they are. We know that government wastes a tremendous amount of money. The market incentives aren't there and funding comes through political means. As a result, we get a lot of rent seeking.</p><p>Similarly, charities tend to also have a lot of rent seeking. In Barack Obama's autobiography, “Dreams From My Father,” he talks about his <a href="https://www.litcharts.com/lit/dreams-from-my-father/chapter-7">experience as a community organizer</a>. He was frustrated at how many of the charities that were supposed to help these communities were staffed by people who didn't do anything. This behavior was so common that whenever he was associated with a charity, people in these neighborhoods would hit him up for jobs at that charity. In other words, charities are known to be a haven for rent seeking.</p><p>Charities have a structural problem and unfortunately good intentions, or noble goals, are not enough. Too many people trust charities to do the right thing and that trust unfortunately gets abused.</p><h2>Very Little Verification</h2><p>People like charity. It's the original virtue signaling. Donate some money to some cause and it makes you look altruistic. I say this somewhat cynically, because so many of the people who donate to charity don't actually follow up and verify whether the money is being spent well. If people really cared about the results, most of their effort would be on the verification aspect of these charitable endeavors.</p><p>Sadly, the only verification you receive are from the charities themselves and of course they have a huge incentive to make it seem as though they're doing massive good. Sadly, the accountability is lacking in most charities. If we really cared about the good they were doing, then each charity would be much more scrutinized.</p><p>But, as we saw with fiat monetary systems, there's much less scrutiny in general. VC due diligence is a complete joke. We've seen this over and over again, whether it be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/dec/20/why-wework-went-wrong">WeWork</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22858603/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-blood-testing-future">Theranos</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>. The money isn't real anyway, so the more important job for a VC is to get in on investments that everyone else is getting into and dump. They give lip service, but don't really care all that much about dull things like profit and loss. Sound money systems have much more scrutiny because there's no endless spigot of money coming in. </p><p>And indeed, this pattern of much less scrutiny extends to charities. In a sound-money economy, charities are deeply scrutinized for actual good that's done because the money is scarce. There's more verification and less trust. In a fiat money economy, there's way more money, so there's more dependence on trust.</p><p>A charity is, in some sense, an investment. The investment is not for your own profit, obviously, but for the good of civilization. And those need to have at least as much accountability as normal investments. Instead, most people outsource that verification to others, often the charity itself. Do you honestly expect someone taking your money to tell you about how they spent it badly?</p><h2>The Politicization Of Charity</h2><p>One of the reasons why charity has become so political and rent seeking is because of the special player in the fiat money economy: the money printer. Charities don't just get money from rich people, they often get money from government coffers. </p><p>Since 2018, <a href="https://sfstandard.com/public-health/the-standard-top-25-san-franciscos-top-paid-homeless-nonprofits/">San Francisco has given over $1 billion in grants to nonprofits to fight homelessness</a>. That's a single issue in a single city. I will note with prejudice that the homelessness problem in San Francisco since 2018 has gotten much worse, not better. Would you stick with a workout regimen if it made you weaker? What are all these nonprofits doing, anyway?</p><p>As you might expect with fiat money, the charities that survive are the ones that are connected politically. Outcomes are secondary to getting access to government coffers. Further, government funding of these charities serves as an informal verification system to donors that can't be bothered.</p><p>Charities are perceived to be not driven by money. Yet if you look at their organizational structure, what becomes very clear is that money is at the center of everything they do. Instead of earning money through useful goods and services provided to the market, they go straight to donors like city governments to provide them with money. They sound noble, forsaking the dirty game of capitalism, but in its place is a dirtier game of playing politics to get the money they need to operate. </p><p>Further, because these charities aren't dependent on outcomes or markets, the people that are in these organizations generally aren't very good with money. Which is to say, that they're not good at achieving the goals of the charity or making things more efficient. Their specialization is politics, marketing and publicity. Many are very good at throwing $20,000-per-person parties to raise money, but not so good at actually building wells. A lot of money going into charities gets wasted.</p><p>Because of fiat money, charities tend to leverage political skills rather than economic ones. They're good at getting the high esteem of others and being viewed a certain way. They are in a sense a market good. The donors get a status boost for their donation. Charities survive despite their ineffectiveness, because of their political positioning.</p><h2>So, What Now?</h2><p>My view of charities is a bit depressing. I've just told you that many charities run on trading money for virtue signaling. How can we turn this around? Should charities even exist? Can we prevent bad organizations from taking advantage of our desire to virtue signal?</p><p>There is hope. There is a good way to do charity and, given that I expect many of you reading this to be in positions to give a lot of money away in the future, I have some thoughts.</p><p>First, verify. The sad reality of today's charitable giving is that there's too little verification and way too much trust. Giving away money for the greater good is not easy. I daresay that it's often harder than earning it. Fiat money created this culture of trusting the slick salesman instead of verifying things for yourself. Much like with our money, we need to verify the charities we give to. Your money isn't enough, your effort is required to give effectively.</p><p>The easiest way to verify is to have a close relationship with the person you're giving your money to. This doesn't mean that you're in the same country club as the president of the non-profit, but doing some due diligence on the actual people that the charity is helping. Humans are built for relationships and that should be at the center of charity, not the money. The money is supposed to be secondary to the real virtue of charity, which is loving others. </p><p>Another possibility is to cut out the middleman and reduce the politicization of charitable giving. The giant charitable organization makes the monetary giving very easy, but in many other ways adds a lot of cost. By cutting out the middleman, we reduce the possibility of rent-seeking. </p><p>Middlemen are less necessary than ever. Giving direct contributions to the people that need it is much easier with Bitcoin. Verification, again, is difficult without some real relationship. Thus, if you really care about charity, go and make some relationships with the people that you want to help. Instead of waxing poetically about some oppressed group somewhere, go become friends with members of that group. I'm not saying this will be easy, but actually having a relationship with the people you're helping will go a long way toward verification. Incidentally, this is one of the many reasons I really like going to the Oslo Freedom Forum. You can meet and interact with the people that need the help.</p><p>Second, look at the incentives. Charities like to think that they're above economic incentives, but that's not the case. Who's in charge and how can you be sure that the money is going to the right place and done so in a way that's efficient? If the charity pays more than the market rate for some good, that's going to have second- and third-order effects. For example, many local clothing makers in developing countries go out of business when a charity gives clothes away for free. Yes, it feels good to help people get clothed, but you're also stifling entrepreneurship in the region. You may be causing more harm than good. Make the calculation yourself instead of outsourcing it to the charity.</p><p>Third, beware of your own motivations. There are numerous altcoins which use charities as a way to whitewash the fraud they're engaged in. They virtue signal because what they're doing is so clearly scammy. This is so prevalent, in fact, that I see it as a horrible signal. If you feel the need to whitewash your gains through charity, those gains are likely ill gotten.</p><p>In the same way, we often give to charity as a way to boost our social standing, ease our conscience or to feel good about ourselves. Our motivation matters because it's going to affect how much we verify. Give without telling other people that you're giving. And give to people who you already know. If you don't know anyone in need, go and make more friends outside of your bubble. Having the right motivation isn't a cure-all, but it certainly helps you to put your money in the right place.</p><h2>Bitcoin Fixes This</h2><p>Thankfully, charity is strengthened by Bitcoin. Fiat money makes trusting other people to do the right thing the norm and of course, that trust gets abused. With Bitcoin, we can cut out the middleman and have direct relationships with the people we want to help.</p><p>Fiat money has made charity much shallower. Charity shouldn't end with a donation, it should continue until the actual people that it's supposed to help are actually helped. As such, we need a much deeper understanding of what helping the poor and vulnerable is. In that sense, charity demands not just money but also our time, effort and energy.</p><p>Fiat charity has been debased through fiat money. Exercising real charity is much harder than the current fiat version, which is outsourcing virtue to some monolithic organization. </p><p>Giving money away in an effective way is very hard. It's as hard or more difficult than earning money from the marketplace. The same level of rigor needs to be applied to giving as earning, otherwise, you're just going to enable a bunch of rent seekers.</p><p>Verify, don't trust. Verify the organization, yourself and the people that you're helping. Charity requires more from you and anything less may very well be paving a road to hell.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jimmy Song.

I selected three areas where bitcoin has helped me. Bitcoin helped me take my entrepreneurial endeavors to the next level by allowing me to easily and efficiently manage my money and build savings.</em><em> In </em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/every-real-estate-investor-should-own-bitcoin"><em>part one</em></a><em>, I explained what opportunities bitcoin offers for real estate investors.</em><em> </em><em>In </em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-for-a-more-optimistic-future"><em>part two</em></a><em>, I described how bitcoin can help us find optimism for a brighter future.</em></p><p>Evolutionary psychologists believe that the ability to preserve wealth gave modern humans the decisive edge in evolutionary competition with other humans. Nick Szabo included an interesting anecdote in his essay “<a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">Shelling Out: The Origins of Money</a>.” When <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> displaced <em>Homo neanderthalensis</em> in Europe roughly 35,000 years ago, a population explosion followed. It’s difficult to explain why, because the newcomers, H. s. sapiens had similar-sized brains, weaker bones and smaller muscles than the Neanderthals. The biggest difference may have been wealth transfers made more effective or even possible by collectibles. H. s. sapiens took pleasure from collecting shells, making jewelry out of them, showing them off and trading them. Neanderthals did not. </p><p>It follows that the capability to preserve wealth is one of the foundations of human civilization. Historically, there have been a variety of wealth preservation technologies that have constantly changed and adapted to the technological possibilities of the time. All wealth preservation technologies serve a specific function: to store value. Chief among the early forms is handmade jewelry. Below I will compare bitcoin to the four most commonly used wealth preservation technologies today — gold, bonds, real estate and equities — to show why they underperform and how efficiently bitcoin can help us save and plan for our future. For equities, I focus specifically on ETFs as equity instruments used as a means of long-term savings.</p><h2>What Makes A Good Store Of Value?</h2><p>As explained by <a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">Vijay Boyapati</a>, when stores of value compete against each other, it is the unique attributes that make a good store of value that allows one to outcompete another. The properties of a good store of value are durability, portability, fungibility, divisibility and especially scarcity. These properties determine what is used as a store of value; for example, jewelry may be scarce, but it’s easily destroyed, not divisible and certainly not fungible. Gold <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/fintech-startup-rupeek-gives-out-1-billion-in-gold-backed-loans-122011101614_1.html">fulfills these properties</a> much better. Over time, gold has replaced jewelry as humankind’s preferred technology for wealth preservation, serving as the most effective store of value for 5,000 years. However, since the introduction of bitcoin in 2009, gold has faced digital disruption. Digitization optimizes almost all value-storing functions. Bitcoin serves not only as a store of value but is also an inherently digital money, ultimately defeating gold in the digital age. </p><h3>Bitcoin Versus Gold</h3><h4>Durability</h4><p>According to Boyapati, “<a href="https://vijayboyapati.medium.com/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1">Gold is the undisputed king of durability</a>.” Most of the gold that has been mined remains extant today. Bitcoin is a ledger of digital records. Thus, it is not bitcoin’s physical manifestation whose durability should be considered, but the durability of the institution that issues them. Bitcoin, having no issuing authority, may be considered durable so long as the network that secures it remains intact. It is too early to draw conclusions about its durability. However, there are signs that, despite instances of nation-states attempting to regulate Bitcoin and years of attacks, the network has continued to function, displaying a remarkable degree of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility">antifragility</a>. In fact, with nearly <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-downtime/#:~:text=Conclusion,has%20maintained%20very%20stable%20uptime.">99.99% uptime</a>, it is one of the most reliable computer networks ever. </p><h4>Portability</h4><p>Bitcoin’s portability is far superior to that of gold, as information can move at the speed of light — thanks to telecommunication. Gold has lost its appeal in the digital age. You can’t send gold over the internet. Online gold portability simply doesn’t exist. For decades, the inability to digitize gold created problems in our monetary system. With the digitization of money whether national currencies were actually backed by gold was not clear. Additionally, it is difficult to transport gold across borders because of its weight. This has created problems for globalized trade. Our fiat-based monetary system exists today because of gold’s weakness in terms of portability. Bitcoin is a solution to this problem as it is a natively digital, scarce commodity that is easily transportable.</p><figure>

        <figcaption>Storing gold versus storing bitcoin (<a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmagazine/status/1586771463637532673?s=46&amp;t=mRE1bFAp_h6jTpaKMDw1Jw">source</a>)</figcaption>
    </figure><h4>Divisibility</h4><p>Bitcoin is <a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04">purely digital</a>, so its divisibility is much better than gold. Information can be subdivided and recombined almost infinitely at almost zero cost. A bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units called satoshis. Gold on the other hand is difficult to divide. It requires special tools and carries the risk of losing gold in the process.</p><h4>Fungibility </h4><p>Gold can be distinguished in many ways, i.e., with an engraved logo, but when it is melted down it becomes fully fungible. With bitcoin, fungibility is tricky. Bitcoin is digital information, which is the most <a href="https://breedlove22.medium.com/money-bitcoin-and-time-part-1-of-3-b4f6bb036c04">objectively discernible substance</a> in the universe. However, since all Bitcoin transactions are transparent, governments could ban the use of bitcoin that has been used for activities deemed illegal. This would negatively impact bitcoin’s fungibility and its use as a medium of exchange, because when money is not fungible, each unit of the money has a different value and the money has lost its medium-of-exchange property. This does not affect bitcoin’s store-of-value function, but rather its acceptance as money, which can negatively impact its price. Gold’s fungibility is superior to bitcoin’s, but gold’s portability disadvantages make it useless as a medium of exchange or a digital store of value.</p><h4>Scarcity </h4><p>Gold is relatively scarce, with an annual inflation rate of <a href="https://www.seabridgegold.com/the-case-for-gold/basic-facts-about-gold-prices-elasticity-and-uses">1.5%</a>. However, the supply is not capped. There are always new discoveries of gold and there is a possibility that we will come across <a href="https://www.mining.com/web/the-golden-asteroid-that-could-make-everyone-on-earth-a-billionaire/">large deposits in space</a>. Gold’s price is not perfectly inelastic. When gold prices rise, there is an incentive to mine gold more intensively, which can increase supply. In addition, ​​physical gold can be diluted with less precious metals, which is difficult to verify. Furthermore, gold held in online accounts via exchange-traded commodities or other financial products is difficult to control and negatively impacts the price by artificially increasing supply. On the other hand, the supply of bitcoin is hard-capped: There will never be more than 21,000,000. It is designed to be deflationary, meaning there will be less of it over time. Bitcoin’s annual inflation rate is currently <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-inflation/">1.75%</a> and will continue to decrease. Bitcoin mining rewards are halved roughly every four years, in accordance with the protocol’s code. In 10 years, bitcoin’s inflation rate will be negligible. The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140; after that, the annual inflation rate of bitcoin will be zero.</p><h4>Auditability </h4><p>This is not a unique proposition for a store of value, but it is still important because it provides information about whether a store of value is suitable for a fair and transparent financial system. Bitcoin is perfectly audible to the smallest unit. No one knows how much gold exists in the world and no one knows how many U.S. dollars exist in the world. As pointed out by Sam Abbassi, bitcoin is the first perfectly public, globally auditable asset. This prevents rehypothecation risk, a practice whereby banks and brokers use assets posted as collateral by their clients for their own purposes. This takes an enormous amount of risk out of the financial system. It allows for proof of reserves, where a financial institution must provide their Bitcoin address or transaction history in order to show their reserves.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Bitcoin Versus Bonds </h3><p>In 1949, Benjamin Graham, a British-born American economist, professor and investor, published “The Intelligent Investor,” which is considered one of the foundational books of value investing and a financial literature classic. One of his tenets is that a balanced portfolio should consist of 60% stocks and 40% bonds, as he believed bonds would protect investors from significant risk in the stock markets.<br></p><p>While much of what Graham described still makes sense today, I argue that bonds — particularly government bonds — have lost their place as a hedge in a portfolio. Bond yields cannot keep up with monetary inflation and our monetary system is systematically at risk. This is because the financial health of many governments that form the heart of our monetary and financial system are also at risk. When government balance sheets were in decent shape, the implied risk of default by a government was almost zero because of two main reasons: their ability to tax and, more importantly, their ability to print money to pay down debt. In the past, that bond allocation made sense, but eventually printing money has become a “<a href="https://rockstarinnercircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Why-Every-Fixed-Income-Investor-Needs-To-Consider-Bitcoin-As-Portfolio-Insurance.pdf">credit boogie man</a>,” as explained by Greg Foss. </p><p>Governments are circulating more money than ever before. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that a broad measure of the stock of dollars, known as M2, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Onyz">rose from $15.4 trillion</a> at the start of 2020, to $21.18 trillion by the end of December 2021. The increase of $5.78 trillion equates to 37.53% of the total supply of dollars. This means that the dollar’s monetary inflation rate has averaged well over 10% per year over the last three years. Treasury bonds are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us">yielding less.</a></p><figure>

    </figure><p>The return that one could earn on money tomorrow by parting with that money today should theoretically be positive in order to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-SFTaJw00Y">compensate for risk and opportunity cost</a>. However, when inflation is accounted for, bonds have become a contractual obligation to lose money. In addition, there is the risk of a systematic failure. The global financial system is <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/de/podcast/read-516-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle/id1359544516?i=%201000517163396">irreversibly broken</a> and bonds are at high risk.</p><p>There is an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjGd9jHDy3a/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D">irresponsible amount of credit</a> in the markets. In recent decades, central banks have had very loose debt policies and nation-states have incurred large amounts of debt. Argentina and Venezuela have already defaulted. There is a possibility that more countries will default on their debt. This default does not mean they can’t pay back their debt by printing more money. However, this would <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FusKoeWmDzY">devalue the national currency</a>, causing inflation and making most bonds ever less attractive, with their comparatively low yields. </p><p>For the past 50 years, when equities sold off, investors fled to the “safety” of bonds which would appreciate in “risk off” environments. This dynamic built the foundation of the infamous 60/40 portfolio — <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/united-states-will-back-dollar-with-bitcoin">until that reality finally collapsed</a> in March 2020, when central banks decided to flood the market with money. The attempt to stabilize bonds will only lead to an increased demand for bitcoin over time. </p><p>Graham’s philosophy was to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/07/grahamprinciples.asp">preserve capital</a> first and foremost, and then to try to make it grow. With bitcoin, it is possible to store wealth in a self-sovereign way with absolutely zero counterparty or credit risk. </p><h3>Bitcoin Versus Real Estate </h3><p>Given the high levels of monetary inflation in recent decades, keeping money in a savings account is not enough to preserve the value of that money. As a result, many people hold a significant portion of their wealth in <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the,to%20a%20consulting%20firm%2C%20McKinsey.">real estate</a>, which has become one of the preferred stores of value. In this capacity, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-digital-real-estate#:~:text=As%20digital%20property%2C%20bitcoin%20has,can%20buy%20and%20hold%20bitcoin.">bitcoin competes with real estate</a>. The properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value: The supply is finite, it is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship resistant and noncustodial. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move and harder to confiscate. It can be sent anywhere in the world at almost no cost and at the speed of light. On the other hand, real estate is easy to confiscate and very difficult to liquidate in times of crisis, as recently illustrated in Ukraine, where <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html">many turned to bitcoin to protect their wealth</a>, accept transfers and donations and meet their daily needs. </p><p>In a recent interview, Michael Saylor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=mP0f2s39GDs">detailed the downsides of real estate</a> as a store-of-value asset. As explained by Saylor, real estate in general needs a lot of attention when it comes to maintenance: rent, repairs, property management and other high costs arise. Commercial real estate is very capital-intensive and therefore uninteresting for most people. Furthermore, attempts to make the asset more accessible have also failed, with second-tier investments, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs) falling short of actually holding the asset.</p><p>As bitcoin (digital property) continues its adoption cycle, it may replace physical property as the preferred store of value. As a result, the value of physical property may collapse to its utility value and no longer carry the monetary premium of being used as a store of value. Going forward, bitcoin’s returns will be many times greater than real estate, as bitcoin is just at the <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/bitcoin-adoption-curve-w-croesus/">beginning of its adoption cycle</a>. In addition, we will most likely not see the same type of returns on real estate investments as we have in the past. Since 1971, house prices have already <a href="https://frisby.substack.com/p/what-really-causes-inflation-heres?r=1o6vt&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">increased nearly 70 times</a>. Beyond that, as Dylan LeClair points out in his article, “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-conclusion-of-the-long-term-debt-cycle-and-the-rise-of-bitcoin">The Conclusion of the Long-Term Debt Cycle And The Rise Of Bitcoin</a>,” governments tend to tax citizens at times like this. Real estate is easily taxed and difficult to move outside of one jurisdiction. Bitcoin cannot be arbitrarily taxed. It is seizure resistant and censorship resistant outside of the domain of any one jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Bitcoin Versus ETFs</h3><p>Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) emerged from index investing, which utilizes a passive investment strategy that requires a manager to only ensure that the fund’s holdings match those of a benchmark index. In 1976, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_bogle.asp">Jack Bogle</a>, founder of the Vanguard Group, launched the first index fund, the Vanguard 500, which tracks the returns of the S&amp;P 500. Today, ETFs manage well over $10 trillion. Bogle had a single tenet: Active stock picking is a pointless exercise. I recall him stating in his interviews that over a lifespan, there is only a 3% chance that a fund manager can consistently outperform the market. He concluded that average investors would find it difficult or impossible to beat the market, which led him to prioritize ways to reduce expenses associated with investing and to offer effective products that enable investors to participate in economic growth and save. Index funds require fewer trades to maintain their portfolios than funds with more active management schemes and therefore tend to produce more tax-efficient returns. The concept of an ETF is good, but bitcoin is better. You can cover a lot of ground through an ETF, but you still have to limit yourself to one index, industry or region. However, when you buy bitcoin, you buy a human productivity index. Bitcoin is like an “ETF on steroids.” </p><p>Let me explain: The promise of Bitcoin should at least be on everyone’s minds by now. Bitcoin is a decentralized computer network with its own cryptocurrency (bitcoin). As a peer-to-peer network, this enables the exchange and, above all, the storing of value. It is the best money we have and is the base protocol for the Lightning Network — the most efficient transaction network there is. It is very likely that Bitcoin will become the dominant network for transactions in the not too distant future. At that point, it will act as an index of global productivity. The more productive we are, the more value we create, the more transactions are executed, the more value needs to be stored, the higher the demand for bitcoin, the higher the bitcoin price. I’ve come to the conclusion that instead of using an ETF to track specific indices, I can use bitcoin to participate in the productivity of all of humanity. As you might expect, bitcoin’s returns have outperformed all ETFs since its inception.</p><p>The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust is the largest and oldest ETF in the world. It is designed to track the S&amp;P 500 stock market index. The performance over the last decade was 168%, which translates to an average annual return of 16.68%. Not bad, especially given that all an investor had to do was hold.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk0MDc5MzAwOTYwNDYyMzQx/sdpr-etf-performance.png" height="424" width="620">

    </figure><p>However, over the same period, bitcoin’s performance was 158,382.362%. More than 200% per annum. We’ve all heard the phrase that past performance is no indicator of future results. That may be true, but that is not the case with bitcoin. The higher a stock goes the riskier it becomes, because of the P/E ratio. Not bitcoin. When bitcoin increases in price, it becomes less risky to allocate to because of liquidity, size and global dominance. The Bitcoin network has now reached a size where it will last, due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect#:~:text=The%20Lindy%20effect%20(also%20known,proportional%20to%20their%20current%20age.">Lindy effect</a>. We can therefore conclude that bitcoin is likely to continue to outperform ETFs going forward. </p><p>Bitcoin has other advantages over an ETF. First, it has a lower cost structure. Second, ETFs are a basket of securities held by a third party. You are not free to dispose of your ETFs. If for whatever reason, your bank decides to close your account, your ETFs are gone too, but bitcoin cannot be taken away from you so easily. Additionally, bitcoin can be moved across the internet at will at the speed of light, making confiscation nearly impossible.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Bitcoin is the best wealth preservation technology for the digital age. It is an absolutely scarce, digitally native bearer asset with no counterparty risk, it cannot be inflated and it is easily transportable. A digital store of value, transferable on the world’s most powerful computer network. Considering that the Bitcoin network could theoretically store all of the <a href="https://www.bcg.com/press/9june2022-global-wealth-grew-double-digits-to-530-trillion">world’s $530 trillion of wealth</a>, it may well be the most efficient way we humans have ever found to store value. By holding bitcoin your wealth is going to be protected, and likely increased during this early monetization process — if you hold out for the next few decades. </p><p>In closing, I’d like to revisit Jack Bogle, who had a huge influence on me. As described by <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/the-express-podcast-episode-87-5322901">Eric Balchunas</a>, Bogle’s lifework is addition by subtraction: getting rid of the management fees, getting rid of the turnover, getting rid of the brokers, getting rid of the human emotion and the bias. I think bitcoin fits well with his investment ethos. Bogle’s primary philosophy was “common sense” investing. In 2012 he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-taylor-bogle/me-and-my-money-jack-bogle-idUSBRE88A0LI20120911">told Reuters</a>, “Most of all, you have to be disciplined and you have to save, even if you hate our current financial system. Because if you don’t save, then you’re guaranteed to end up with nothing.”</p><p>Bitcoin is very similar to what Bogle envisioned with passive mutual funds: a long-term savings vehicle for investors to place their disposable income with low cost and little risk. Don’t be distracted by bitcoin’s volatility or negative press; Jack Bogle says to “<a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/John-C-Bogle/dp/1119404304">stay the course</a>.” We’re just getting started. Stay humble and stack sats. Your future self will thank you.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

Like it or not, Bitcoiners are political by default. If you believe in sound money and act upon that belief through investing financial resources, time, energy, intellect, emotion and will into space, you are in direct political opposition to the current world system. But are we <em>relatively homogeneous</em>? Yes! If we allow that homogeneity can be an abstraction rather than limited to physical genetic origins. What binds us as a nation is our shared allegiance to such eternal values as love, peace, fairness and liberty. What preserves us as a nation is that we voluntarily submit to the rule of law embodied in the Bitcoin protocol — a code of honor that rewards the practice of those values and punishes breaches of the contract written in that code. Do we <em>inhabit a sovereign state</em>? Again, I believe that in the abstract the answer is “yes.” Bitcoiners, by definition, are sovereign individuals. We <a href="https://declarationofmonetaryindependence.org/">declare ourselves sovereigns</a> over our own wealth and destinies by eschewing the Keynesian economics model and its fiat money system enshrined in Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) that corrupts everything it touches.</p><p>We are what Abraham Lincoln describes in the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/liho/learn/historyculture/gettysburgaddress.htm">Gettysburg Address</a> as “…a <em>new</em> nation, <em>conceived</em> in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.” This kind of talk is “fightin’ words” when it reaches the ears of the King Georges of the world, who declare themselves sovereign over us. We are revolutionaries in the true sense of the word and are at war with those who seek to enslave us. Though we commit no physical violence, our very existence and our thought crimes are anathema to the fiat elites. We can point to January 3, 2009, as the day the nation was conceived with the Genesis block. Since then, we have been gestating and developing as body and soul, hidden in the womb of cryptographic code and protected from prying eyes. But the day of birth is coming soon with the requisite labor pains. It looks like we have escaped the abortionist, but will we succumb to fear at the crisis of birth as enemies unleash all the weapons at their disposal? The ESG disinformation peddlers, the global banking establishment, their minions in governments and their vicious enforcers are not going to simply declare victory and let us be on our way in peace. </p><p>There are some who talk of forming a Bitcoin political party, which may sound good at first, but Bitcoiners are international, citizens of the world. If you follow the logical progression, you could even say we already have a world government, one that isn’t beholden to any other government with aspirations of world domination. “Bitcoinia” is genuinely sovereign, and that bestows on us the potential to be sovereign individuals as well. We have, if you will, plural citizenship. I’m a citizen of the USA, of Bitcoinia, and the Kingdom of God (a.k.a., the Kingdom of Heaven). One is natural, one is digital and one is spiritual — a trifecta of sovereign allegiances.</p><p>As we all know, Bitcoin is something new, unique, and powerful enough to change the world for the better. I would declare the same for “Bitcoinians.” As a nation, we are also utterly unique — and yet we are the most diverse union of peoples in history. There are many things we disagree on, i.e., how to evangelize nocoiners, what swear words to use as adjectives when describing altcoin scammers, and just how much privacy we are willing to give up for institutional adoption and hyperbitcoinization. We are an unlikely collection of some of the wealthiest, most well-educated of every race and creed, together with some of the unbanked poorest of the poor — all yearning to breathe the fresh air of freedom and drink the pure water of our God-given liberty. We long to make our own life choices, and not to be treated as chattel by a cabal of amoral self-anointed overlords.</p><p>But who, until now, ever thought there could be a functioning decentralized government with no dictator, president, or prime minister? Even in a libertarian’s wildest dreams this might seem an impossibility. And yet, here we are. The possibilities are endless, and the potential for good in this world “simply” by fixing the money are beyond measuring. This isn’t to say that this miraculous protocol is a panacea for all the world’s ills but is a great base from which to launch ‘till Christ returns.</p><p>We have abundant reasons to be optimistic and even giddy at the prospects of all that can and will be accomplished in this revolution. We are witnesses and participants in an unprecedented historical turning with promises of ending endless wars, worldwide productivity, and fully unleashed economic prosperity. How does that look in real life? Enjoy the show, folks!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Phil Snyder.

Coming off the heels of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and the bursting of the dot-com bubble nearly a decade prior, it’s healthy to be skeptical of novel financial products. Bitcoin is commonly filed in the same category of bunk investments that have spun out of control. It’s a fair question to ask: How is bitcoin similar or different from prior speculative booms? In each case, there are constellations of narratives around the new asset class that generate ecstatic attention from investors. </p><p>There is a strand of scholarship that seeks to make sense of these narratives, but largely fails because they do not take the technical foundations of Bitcoin’s incentive structure seriously. They also mostly ignore the most active participants and texts that lie at the core of Bitcoin culture. In this essay I take a look at two such analyses, demonstrate some of the weaknesses in each of their arguments, and work toward a set of guidelines for nuanced investigations of Bitcoin narratives. </p><p>In Robert Shiller’s book “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691182292/narrative-economics">Narrative Economics</a>,” he uses Bitcoin as a case study to illustrate how sticky economic stories arise within contemporary culture. “The Bitcoin narrative,” he suggests, “involves stories about inspired cosmopolitan young people, contrasting with the uninspired bureaucrats; a story of riches, inequality, advanced information technology, and involving mysterious impenetrable jargon.” Like Jon Baldwin, whose article “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-018-0065-0">In Digital We Trust</a>” I evaluated in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/responding-to-discounting-of-bitcoin-benefits">part one of this essay</a> series, his main avenue of critique is the “technobabble” or hype that characterizes Bitcoin discourse. </p><p>The issue is that neither of these authors give much consideration to <em>how the technical features of the code shape these narratives</em>. These features might include the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, the difficulty adjustment algorithm and the supply distribution schedule that produce Bitcoin’s incentive structure and shape its market rhythms. On the few occasions that Shiller does consider the role of its technical aspects in his analysis, he only does so to demonstrate how little “Bitcoin enthusiasts” seem to actually know about the technology:</p><p>“I will make no attempt here to explain the technology of Bitcoin, except to note that it is the result of decades of research. Few people who trade Bitcoins understand this technology. When I encounter Bitcoin enthusiasts, I often ask them to explain some of its underlying concepts and theories, such as the Merkle tree or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, or to describe Bitcoin as an equilibrium of a congestion-queuing game with limited throughput. Typically the response is a blank stare. So, at very least, the theory is not central to the narrative, except for the basic understanding that some very smart mathematicians or computer scientists came up with the idea.” </p><p>There are multiple weaknesses in this line of argument. Foremost, this assessment is based on anecdotal evidence of “Bitcoin enthusiasts” he’s encountered. Throughout the book, it never becomes clear who these “enthusiasts” are, where he encountered them, or what sort of knowledge or personal investment they have in Bitcoin. </p><p>Second of all, he prompts his anecdotal subjects to explain complex cryptographic features that are fundamental to Bitcoin’s protocol, yet rarely play prominent roles in Bitcoin discourse, even within some of the most dedicated circles of Bitcoiners. It is a curious choice of technical features given that he appears to borrow these terms from an article focused on the “<a href="https://moallemi.com/ciamac/papers/bitcoin-2017.pdf">Economic Analysis of the Bitcoin Payment System</a>.” This article primarily focuses on the way Bitcoin’s protocol adjusts its rewards to incentivize participation. These features are fundamental to understand when considering narratives around the plausibility of Bitcoin’s perpetuity and projected ability to remain in a state of price discovery. In other words, he deflects the key technical features that affect Bitcoin’s narratives and selects features that are likely to stump his research subjects. </p><p>In my experience of almost daily immersion in Bitcoin's digital ecology, the primary technical features that drive its narratives are the proof-of-work consensus mechanism and difficulty adjustment algorithm. These protocol features are central to understanding Bitcoin mining and the reward schedule of newly created coins. A basic grasp of this process helps explain the basic incentive structure that motivates people to mine and accumulate Bitcoins. In simple terms: miners earn Bitcoin in proportion to the computational energy they supply to the network. More computer power contributed to the network means higher difficulty for mining coins. If miners perceive their rewards will appreciate, the incentive persists. Every four years, the size of the rewards is cut in half. Therefore, there are consistent adjustments in the difficulty and rewards to sustain interest in the process of mining. This serves as the underlying material process for assuring Bitcoin’s continued operation and for converting energy into digital assets. The provable scarcity of the asset and the sustainable incentive structure for participation is a centerpiece to the narrative of bitcoin’s possibility of appreciating into perpetuity. </p><p>Had Shiller searched “proof-of-work” or “halving” rather than “digital signature algorithm” in his ProQuest News and Newspaper query, I anticipate he may have discovered a relative heap of results compared to the handful that turned up. Although, it is also noteworthy to mention that Shiller queries mainstream news and newspapers — unlikely outlets to find content where you might find originally sourced content from Bitcoiners. I would suggest that actual “Bitcoin enthusiasts” would more likely be found on Twitter and reading publications like Bitcoin Magazine<em> </em>rather than mainstream newspapers. On top of that, his footnotes only reference two news articles from Bitcoin.com, four mainstream news articles, one academic article, and the Bitcoin white paper. In short: Shiller seemingly ignores the forums you’d likely find Bitcoiners congregating on the web, despite the fact that his book highlights the importance of social media’s role in narrative virality. His analysis lacks grounding, or at least makes the mistake of confusing mainstream news sources as a primary body of texts in which Bitcoin narratives form and proliferate. </p><p>Another instance of Shiller’s loosely grounded generalizations appears in his assertion that “There are brilliant computer scientists who are fascinated by cryptocurrencies but who won’t say whether the captivating ideas that generate public excitement are ultimately right or wrong.” Who are these brilliant scientists he speaks of and what does it mean for them to apparently avoid commenting on the validity of the hyped narrative around Bitcoin? Again, readers are left guessing who Shiller’s shadowy research subjects are and what texts he’s referring to as grounds for these claims. </p><p>Later in the book, Shiller suggests that the younger generation’s superior ability to understand Bitcoin while older generations struggle with it also has narrative appeal:</p><p>“Maybe part of the appeal is that understanding Bitcoin requires some effort and talent. There is an air of mystery around Bitcoin, just as there is conventional money. Few people understand how paper money gets its value and sustains it either… The idea that savvy young people understand Bitcoin, but that old fogies never will, appeals to many.”</p><p>Perhaps there is some of this generational appeal to Bitcoin narratives, but Shiller merely speculates that it exists. If Shiller were to explore the discourse of actual Bitcoiners, which he never demonstrates that he does, he might have found thousands of pages of books and articles and countless hours of videos and podcasts that take deep dives into Bitcoin’s philosophy, economics and social theory. Indeed, there is an air of mystery around Bitcoin. But there is also a robust body of knowledge that Bitcoiners have contributed to relentlessly for a decade and have shaped the stories that Shiller largely writes off as misguided. And if the stories are deemed pure hype, a logical conclusion is that Bitcoin lacks real value. </p><p>Baldwin and Shiller seem to agree that Bitcoin represents a speculative bubble with no underlying material value. In investing parlance, it lacks “fundamentals,” at least in the traditional sense of production reports, revenue streams and earning per stakeholder shares. Whereas Baldwin denounces Bitcoin as a Ponzi scheme that “must constantly be talked up” to appreciate, Shiller does not explicitly make this charge. However, he does consider how disparate, often mutating stories around Bitcoin continue to sustain its perceived value by contagiously leaping from person to person. </p><p>His narrative framework seeks nuanced explanations as to why people would believe it has value at all. Some of the key factors in these stories are fear of missing out; celebrity endorsements; mysteries about the value of conventional money; the mystery of Satoshi’s identity (or identities); the notion that Bitcoin is “the future”; economic empowerment; and its potential function as “membership token in the world economy.” He argues that these narrative constellations make Bitcoin’s value self-referential: “people are interested in Bitcoin precisely because so many other people are interested in it. They are interested in new stories about Bitcoin because they believe that other people will be interested in them too”. In short, <em>he contends that Bitcoin’s value traces the potency and virality of its narratives at any given time</em>. The narratives of Bitcoin’s success become self-fulfilling prophecies. </p><p>The assumption baked into this conclusion is that Bitcoin doesn’t have any real social value. An important question that seems to be left of both Shiller and Baldwin’s analyses is: To <em>whom</em> does Bitcoin have value for from a use case standpoint? Both authors are so focused on the narratives that they believe are untethered from reality that neither of them look beyond the use cases such as Silk Road for how people are using Bitcoin and what user demands are driving Bitcoin development. Bitcoiners, who develop, and theorize about the network are largely abstracted out of their analyses. Academic studies of Bitcoin would benefit greatly from taking a concrete look at Bitcoin culture and assessing where the narrative sync up with reality and which narrative elements are mere hype. </p><p> For example, in his article “<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2020.1788620?journalCode=rcus20">Magical Capitalism, Gambler Subjects: South Korea’s Bitcoin Investment Frenzy</a>,” Seung Cho Lee offers an empirical account of Korean bitcoin investors during the 2017-2018 bull run. Unlike Baldwin and Shiller, Lee is refreshingly clear about who his subjects are and the cultural context they are participating within. During the 2018-2017 bitcoin bull run, Koreans made up roughly 21% of the global bitcoin investors. Lee observed two of the most popular Bitcoin social media forums, one in which the user profiles were anonymous and the other not. He characterizes these participants as “lay bitcoin investors” who appear to walk a thin line between investing and gambling. </p><p>The one caveat to this analytic clarity appears in his first footnote where he writes “I will use bitcoin as a sort of synecdoche for all the cryptocurrencies discussed throughout this article”. As a general rule, I would argue it is analytically stronger to make a clear distinction here between bitcoin and altcoins. The different consensus mechanisms and capacities of these blockchains inspire differing and sometimes contradictory visions for the future of crypto and money. For instance, Bitcoin maximalists exclusively advocate for bitcoin and view all other cryptocurrencies as unviable, or worse, scams. The cryptocurrency space at large is characterized by intense tribalism. It is also noteworthy to point out this bitcoin buying frenzy coincided with the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, in which billions of dollars rushed into hundreds of new altcoins. That said, it is reasonable to believe the lay investors represented here may not have made many critical distinctions between coins they invested in. </p><p>He frames this frenzy as taking place against a post-developmental, neoliberal cultural backdrop. South Korea had gone through a pivotal economic transformation marked by growing wealth inequality, low wages, precarious employment and riskier investing fueled by loosely regulated consumer credit. Lee describes a scene of disenchanted youth with high hopes to strike economic success in booming capital markets. The advent of online exchanges, mobile investing apps and global crypto markets opened the possibility for mass retail investment in these “magical” markets. “The magic of financial capitalism,” Lee argues, “is deeply rooted in a mechanism that functions through self-referential valuation and self-fulfilling performativity.” Within these markets, participants perform a repertoire of rituals that justify their economic behaviors and collectivize their hopes and fears, all while calling into question the rationality of market fluctuations. As Baldwin and Shiller also argued, this creates mimetic spirals of valuation narratives that are seemingly untethered to material realities. Nevertheless, these markets offer enchanting possibilities of success during a time when disciplined labor no longer seemed to offer as much promise for material success as it had in past generations. </p><p> What stands out about this cultural context is the economic scene that Lee describes. He argues that the post-developmental era began with a South Korean financial crisis followed by a government bailout by the IMF and a deteriorated labor market. While Lee is focusing on lay investors with seemingly absent political investment in Bitcoin, it is striking to highlight that Bitcoin was introduced as a critique of the very conditions that contributed to South Korea’s economic condition. Bitcoin was positioned as a critique of failing banks and fragile monetary policy. It’s also notable to point out that the IMF has become one of the Bitcoin community’s top institutional enemies. His analysis suggests that bailed out banks and deregulated markets have created the conditions for Bitcoin to receive mass retail attention, even if its investors are unaware of the flawed monetary system that helped shape these post-developmental conditions. Bitcoin is therefore both a product of and response to poorly managed global economies by existing institutions. </p><p>Lee demonstrates how social media helps facilitate the ritualistic incantations of market participants. Lay Bitcoin investors openly questioned the rationality of the market and frequently circulated memetic expressions that helped them navigate the largely unexplainable market volatility. This is the distinguishing factor between the gambler and investor: for the gambler, “expertise consists in dealing with chance and uncertainty. Unlike the laborer, who builds an organic and continual relation with the world, the gambler embraces uncertainty and seeks to find the right moment to quickly seize opportunities”. This notion of expertise is crucial to emphasize. I would argue this includes network-specific conventions of intelligence and emotional control. Since Bitcoin is still a relatively new asset with novel metrics for its fundamentals, the social network becomes especially important for guidance on how to navigate the market. As Lee shows, this entails a repertoire of memetic behaviors that instill hope, confidence, and trust while quelling fear, uncertainty, and doubt. When it comes to prediction tools, technical analysis is heavily relied upon. Although, many participants within the market community openly cast doubt on the efficacy of technical indicators that are frequently invalidated by abrupt and exaggerated moves on the price charts. These conventions of participation make it possible for investors to form meaningful relationships to the market. </p><p>Similar to Baldwin and Shiller, Lee is burdened to make sense of Bitcoin’s value that is generally agreed to have no objective, intrinsic anchor. Like the previous authors, he concludes that ultimately bitcoin’s value is a matter of self-reference: “What determines the price of a financial commodity is thus people’s beliefs about what other people believe, or collective belief on collective belief.” Notably, Lee generalizes this principle to all financial markets. Yet, Bitcoin remains a prime example because it lacks clear fundamentals and is an altogether new financial product that is hard to make meaningful comparisons to. Due to its self-referential nature, any information that circulates about Bitcoin or events that may affect its price are interpreted through its community’s conventions for valuation. News is framed in such a way that it constantly fits the desired valuation narratives. He argues that “every piece of information and every statement about Bitcoin is supposed to be subject to this self-fulfilling valuation process in which the ‘constative’ meaning [its nature of being true or false] of a certain statement is deciphered based only on its ‘performative’ effect”. In this regard, the Bitcoin valuations can be based on faith in the potency of its narrative to continually inspire confidence in more market participants. </p><p> Out of the three authors, Lee offers the most compelling case for how Bitcoin’s narrative is shaped by its actual market participants. By situating actual investors within a cultural context, it becomes increasingly clear what motivations might be involved in financial risk taking, how this participation can function as enchantment, and how news about Bitcoin is filtered into ever-bullish narratives. While Shiller appears to look at newspapers for instances of these narratives, Lee argues that news information is poached, interpreted, and circulated between market participants. This is of course an information feedback loop itself. The community filters news and fortifies the bullish case for Bitcoin. This increases interest in the asset. The news reports on the fluctuations of this market because it proves to be a popular asset. However, Lee only offers a small set of examples regarding how different messages are performatively interpreted. Baldwin and Shiller’s focus on the political and techno-utopian discourse offer clues as to what interpretive conventions may be at play. In the following essay of this series, I will consider how aspects of each of these authors may inform a vernacular theory framework for studying the culture of Bitcoin’s most ardent supporters. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Maximilian Brichta.
