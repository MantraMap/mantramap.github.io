<p>The exchange stated that the listing was released with the same Bitstamp policy that applies to other assets, which is that there are no trading fees for total trading volumes up to $1,000 for the previous 30 days.</p>

<p><strong>Bitstamp was established in 2011, 2013 and 2014, it obtained registrations in the UK and Luxembourg.</strong> Its offices are in the UK, Luxembourg, USA, Singapore, and Slovenia, and it boasts &#8220;a global team of about 400 individuals.&#8221; There are already more than four million users using it globally in more than 100 countries.</p>



<p>Notably, <strong>the exchange added $DOGE months after adding Shiba Inu ($SHIB)</strong>, a competitor cryptocurrency inspired by memes, in June. However, Middle Eastern cryptocurrency trading firm Rain finally overtook Bitstamp to become the 100th cryptocurrency trading platform to list the SHIB.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Bitstamp&#8217;s new listing coincides with Coinbase&#8217;s </h2>



<p>The timing of Bitstamp&#8217;s new listing coincides with Coinbase&#8217;s (NASDAQ: COIN), a Nasdaq-listed cryptocurrency exchange, losing market capitalization to Dogecoin. <strong>The exchange&#8217;s market cap is currently below $8 billion, while DOGE&#8217;s market cap is close to $10 billion.</strong></p>



<p>Earlier this week, the most enormous whale on Dogecoin&#8217;s network transferred more than $280 million in cryptocurrency to a new address, which has subsequently risen to the position of 5th largest address on the network.</p>

<p>According to the allegations, the company has put the three executives mentioned in charge of raising money for a new fund called Mythical Ventures. The company alleges a Game of Myths investor introduced the trio to Cypher Capital, which is based in the United Arab Emirates.</p>



<p>Then, <strong>instead of securing an investment from Cypher Capital for Mythical Ventures, the three executives used Mythical Games&#8217; business plan and persuaded Cypher Capital to invest in a new platform for blockchain games that had the name is <a href="https://magnitt.com/news/fenix-games-150m-investment-53781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fenix Games</a></strong>. The foundation was founded a few weeks after three former executives left.</p>

<p>Binance issued a <a href="https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/blog/community/%E7%9B%B4%E9%9D%A2fud%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E5%8F%8A%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E8%B4%A8%E7%96%91%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94-6174048639837904159" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/blog/community/%E7%9B%B4%E9%9D%A2fud%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E5%8F%8A%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E8%B4%A8%E7%96%91%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94-6174048639837904159" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> in Chinese on December 22 that clarified seven essential points. There was no English-language version accessible at the time this article was written.</p>



<p>The temporary halt to USDC withdrawals earlier this month was the first of them. The exchange consolidated its stablecoin reserves into BUSD, it said and did this during a &#8220;token swap&#8221; conversion period.</p>



<p>The availability of sufficient reserves for withdrawals was the next issue it addressed. It affirmed that <strong>&#8220;all users&#8217; assets in Binance are supported 1:1&#8221; and that the company&#8217;s financial situation was sound due to the substantial earnings it derives from transaction fees. </strong>CryptoQuant examined Binance&#8217;s reserves on December 16 and found no evidence of &#8220;FTX-like&#8221; behavior.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Binance will not embezzle users’ funds for any transactions or investments, nor does it have any debts, nor is it on the list of creditors of any company that has recently gone bankrupt.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the report, encrypted on-chain verification is a new industry that these corporations might not be able to handle, which is why Mazars and the &#8220;big four&#8221; auditing firms have refused to engage with crypto companies.</p>



<p>It was noticed that these audits often focus on the listed company&#8217;s financial status rather than confirming reserve assets.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Mazars has taken the Binance audit reports off its website</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mazars-has-taken-the-Binance.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="864" height="485" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mazars-has-taken-the-Binance.png" alt="Mazars has taken the Binance" class="wp-image-154678" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mazars-has-taken-the-Binance.png 864w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mazars-has-taken-the-Binance-300x168.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mazars-has-taken-the-Binance-768x431.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Mazars-has-taken-the-Binance-750x421.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px" title="Binance Addresses 7 Incidents Of Recent FUD 11"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Binance added that since it was a private firm rather than a publicly traded one, it was exempt from disclosure requirements.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“In many jurisdictions where we operate, we have shared or are sharing operational and financial information as required by local regulators.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Binance, the company has been the target of sensational reporting from the mainstream media for quite some time in response to a Reuters report asserting that the <strong>U.S. Department of Justice was looking into the business.</strong> In addition, it stated that it spent the most money battling cryptocurrency crime and had the most compliance licenses globally.</p>



<p>The blog post concluded by restating CEO Changpeng Zhao&#8217;s assertion that Binance not only destroyed FTX but also did it of its own volition. Binance stated before adding, &#8220;We are more focused on continually promoting and extending industry adoption,&#8221; that it does not view other exchanges as competitors.</p>



<p>There you have it, then. Although the <strong>FUD has been debunked, investors have left the exchange in recent weeks as they shifted to the self-custody of their cryptocurrency assets.</strong></p>

<p>The Proof of Reserve smart contract from blockchain oracle Chainlink received over 99% support from the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that powers Aave, the well-known DeFi protocol on Ethereum. It will cover <strong>Aave versions (v)2 and (v3) on the Avalanche blockchain particularly</strong>.</p>



<p>DeFi uses bridged assets to transfer value between blockchains that would otherwise not be able to connect. A copy of the asset is then created on the target network after it is locked in a smart contract on its original chain. Among other tokens, Aave v3 on Avalanche has bridged versions of DAI, USDT, and USDC.</p>



<p>But because of the numerous security flaws this system produces, token bridges have frequently been used by hackers. This year, <strong>breaches on the token bridges of Web3 game Axie Infinity&#8217;s Ronin network and cross-chain protocol Nomad resulted in exploits totaling more than $800 million.</strong></p>



<p>The proposal&#8217;s creator, Bored Ghost Developing, claims that its PoR smart contracts will add another layer of protection to Aave&#8217;s Avalanche implementation and can also lessen attacks on network assets that are bridged.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“The focus is more on automatically detecting and acting whenever any symptom of security issues on a bridge appears,” said Ernesto Boado, the former chief technology officer at Aave and co-founder at Bored Ghost Developing, which wrote the proposal. “We think that obviously, transparency goes first, in this case, our development goes a step further.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the plan, Aave will employ ChainLink PoR&#8217;s aggregator smart contract to secure tokens on both the target network and the original Ethereum network (Avalanche).</p>



<p>According to Max Melcher, head of go-to-market for proof of reserves at Chainlink Labs, decentralized solutions may now reliably report reserve levels without relying on a single party thanks to proof of reserves.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Leveraging Chainlink Proof of Reserve, Aave can verify that bridged assets accepted on the platform are fully collateralized before allowing users to borrow against them,” said Melcher.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since <strong>FTX collapsed, proof of reserves has been in the news because the sector calls for centralized exchanges to be more transparent (CEX)</strong>. Popular exchange Crypto.com&#8217;s reserve ratios from earlier this month demonstrate that investors&#8217; assets are securely guaranteed. The auditor for Binance, Mazars, severed connections with the exchange last week, casting doubt on the exchange&#8217;s reserves—or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Core Scientific was approved for a $37.5 million loan in January 2023.</em></li>



<li><em>The new loan providers still believe in the long-term growth of the company.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>On December 23, the Court announced that US bitcoin miner Core Scientific was approved on Thursday for a $37.5 million loan from a group of existing creditors to fund the company&#8217;s Chapter 11 bankruptcy, according to Reuters.</strong></h5>

<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones approved Core Scientific&#8217;s temporary bankruptcy loan during a court hearing in Houston, Texas. <strong>The company will seek final approval for the loan and be allowed to borrow another $37.5 million in January</strong>, although the company&#8217;s attorneys say they&#8217;re open to better financing options from other lenders.</p>



<p>Kris Hansen, who provided the new loan on behalf of creditors, said in court that despite Core Scientific&#8217;s recent challenges and the falling bitcoin price, <strong>existing stakeholders still have confidence in the company&#8217;s long-term viability.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of the news on December 21, <strong>Core Science<a href="https://news.coincu.com/154063-core-scientific-filed-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</strong>. The reason it was filed was due to the sharp drop in the price of bitcoin, the high cost of bitcoin mining energy, in addition to the $7 million in outstanding debt from its Celsius Network and plans to convert most of the debt into equity.</p>

<p>The largest cryptocurrency mining company in the United States has announced that Core Scientific <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/154306-core-scientific-can-sell-mine-1-gigawatt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can sell</a> some facilities under construction with a capacity of up to 1 Gigawatt after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on December 21.</strong></p>



<p>Core Scientific is currently the largest in the industry with around 800 to 850 megawatts of mining capacity. The mine it can sell is expected to come online in 2023, with a mining capacity of up to 1 billion watts.</p>



<p>The company warned in October that it could run out of money at the end of the year and bankruptcy was an option, but things seemed to have changed last week, with B. Riley offering the miners the package $72 million in financing to extend Core Science’s life by two years and save the company from bankruptcy.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Do Kwon is looking for cash in Serbia.</em></li>



<li><em>He transferred 9.64 BTC (worth almost $190,000) from LFG wallet to Bitcoin wallet.</em></li>



<li><em>Arrests are still difficult because Serbia and South Korea also do not have extradition records.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Do Kwon is looking for cash in Serbia during the run. On-chain data noted there was a movement of 9.64 BTC ($190,000 at the time) from LFG wallets to Bitcoin wallets, <a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South Korean media </a>reported.</strong></h5>



<p>According to the data, this displacement appeared from November 8 after <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151058-do-kwon-newly-discovered-hiding-in-serbia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>he was identified to have entered Serbia</strong></a>. This is the first time he has come across the situation of exchanging bitcoins for cash like dollars while on the run.</p>

Source: Digital Asset</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Reportedly, South Korean prosecutors believe that Do Kwon recently entered Serbia, where it is relatively <strong>easy to deposit and withdraw cryptocurrencies, and withdrew the absconding amount and is currently investigating.</strong></p>



<p>Serbia and South Korea also have no extradition records. In the prosecution industry, if the bitcoin being laundered is transferred to a Binance wallet, it is considered converted into legal tender, such as US dollars.</p>



<p>It is known that Serbia has installed ATMs that can exchange bitcoins in the capital Belgrade and elsewhere.</p>



<p>Previously, Digital Asset reported on November 30 that <strong>&#8220;CEO Kwon transferred approximately 6983 BTC (about $121.5 million at the time) from Binance&#8217;s LFG wallet to an unknown wallet.&#8221;</strong> At this point, withdrawal status is not disclosed.</p>

<p>The arrest of the founder of Terra is still difficult despite the Government opening a lengthy investigation a few months ago. Reportedly, the Korean Ministry of Justice <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151058-do-kwon-newly-discovered-hiding-in-serbia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is requesting cooperation</a> from the Serbian government, and investigating agencies are investigating whether there are special facilitators in Serbia.</p>



<p>Do Kwon has repeatedly denied most of the allegations in interviews with other media,&nbsp;<strong>claiming via channels like Twitter that he “didn’t run away”</strong>. The Securities and Financial Crimes Unit of the Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office received an arrest warrant for Kwon on charges of providing false information to investors in September.</p>

<p>Besides, <strong>Banff 5</strong> extends the ability of Avalanche developers to not only write custom blockchains or subnets for different use cases in the Go and Rust programming languages, <strong>but subnets can also communicate with each other</strong>.</p>



<p>To validate messages and data across chains, <strong>the subnet messaging system uses a cutting &#8211; edge cryptographic technology called &#8220;BLS multi signatures.&#8221;</strong> To use the protocol, any subnet&#8217;s security validators can create a BLS signature that verifies a request to transfer assets or data to another subnet.</p>



<p>The upgrade <strong>eliminates the need for individual subnet projects to deploy and manage their own bridges</strong>. While, the mechanism also holds the potential to open the door for new use cases such as cross-chain staking of tokens, according to the team.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">Avalanche Warp Messaging (AWM) is the catalyst that will spark a Cambrian explosion of Avalanche subnet development, With this release, you can launch your own Go- or Rust-based blockchain and reward any node that stakes your own token for validating it, all while natively interoperating with an ecosystem of other builders doing the same thing.</p>
<cite>&nbsp;said Patrick O’Grady, head of engineering at Ava Labs</cite></blockquote>



<p>Additionally,<strong> AWM developers can either establish their own message specifications or use already standards from other teams</strong>. There are more chances for the development community to use AWM and release more advanced communications formats because there are no predefined standards to adhere to.</p>

<p>According to the filing, three parties attempted to gain control of those shares: <strong>BlockFi (a lending company that FTX backed earlier this year), Yonathan Ben Shimon (a creditor of FTX appointed as the recipient in Antigua and authorized to sell shares under the supervision of the courts there) and Bankman-Fried himself (who has the legal bill).</strong></p>



<p>When the bankruptcy began on November 11, FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy asset managers asked ED&amp;F Man Capital Markets, the brokerage firm where the shares were held, to freeze the shares.</p>

<p><strong>FTX has determined that Emergent owns only &#8220;in name&#8221; these shares</strong>, which actually belong to their company. The bankrupt cryptocurrency company said in the filing that &#8220;Emergent is a special-purpose holding company and appears to have no other business.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hence the argument in the filing that the judge overseeing the bankruptcy should freeze the stock while FTX is trying to find a way to pay back all of its creditors.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Blockfi has claimed ownership of these shares. As was updated in an earlier Coincu News article, on November 28, <strong>Sam Bankman-Fried <a href="https://news.coincu.com/147201-blockfi-sue-sbf-after-filing-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was sued</a> by BlockFi over ownership of Robinhood</strong>. The report was released shortly after BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection hours earlier. BlockFi&#8217;s complaint seeks Robinhood shares because the SBF allegedly maintained them as collateral.</p>

<p><strong>Orthogonal Trading </strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/149186-orthogonal-defaults-loans-on-maple-finance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recognized</a> earlier this month that the demise of <strong>FTX</strong> had a significant impact on business. It had been making strong progress in its tight collaboration with a possible strategic partner regarding new funds to pay off all outstanding bills. However, the funds didn&#8217;t arrive in time to cover a <strong>$10 million payment</strong> that was due.</p>



<p><strong>Orthogonal</strong> <strong>Credit</strong> representatives <a href="https://medium.com/@orthogonal_trading/statement-from-the-orthogonal-credit-team-december-5th-2022-1b0ba93335ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> in a Medium article that they were not informed of the full extent of Orthogonal Trading&#8217;s financial difficulties.</p>



<p>According to M11, <strong>Orthogonal Trading</strong>, which managed a lending pool and served as a borrower in the <strong>FTX</strong> <strong>collapse</strong>, concealed its losses and operated for weeks insolvently before failing to make payments.</p>

<p><strong>M11 Credit </strong>and <strong>Maple</strong> requested an <strong>urgent ex parte application</strong> on <strong>December 15 </strong>in the <strong>British Virgin Islands High Court</strong> to appoint a provisional liquidator for <strong>Orthogonal</strong> <strong>Trading</strong>. The request was approved.</p>



<p><strong>Orthogonal Trading</strong> has been removed from the platform by <strong>Maple</strong>. Depositors in affected lending pools could lose up to<strong> 80%</strong> of their funds.</p>
