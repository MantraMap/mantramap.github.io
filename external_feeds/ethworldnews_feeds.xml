<ul><li>The FBI has reportedly carried out a search at the residence of former FTX executive Ryan Salame. </li><li>The purpose of the raid is unclear at this time. </li><li>Salame was a part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s inner circle during his stint at the bankrupt exchange. </li><li>The former executive has not been charged or accused of a crime in relation to the collapse of FTX. </li></ul>



<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly carried out a raid at the residence of former FTX executive Ryan Salame. Salame was a part of <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-lost-50-million-joked/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>’s inner circle and served as one of his top advisors before the collapse of his crypto exchange in November last year. The raid has become the latest development in the U.S. Justice Department’s investigation into FTX’s collapse.</p>



<p></p>



<h2>Purpose Of Raid At Former FTX Exec’s Home Unclear</h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-sam-bankman-fried.html" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Times</a>, FBI agents reached Salame’s house in Potomac, Maryland earlier today to carry out a search. People familiar with the matter revealed that Salame&#8217;s legal representative had handed over information related to his political campaign finance activity ahead of today&#8217;s raid. The purpose of the raid is unclear at this time. Salame, who served as Co-Chief Executive Officer of FTX Digital Markets, has not yet been charged or accused of any wrongdoing, unlike other former executives like Caroline Ellison and Gary Wang who were charged in connection with the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire. </p>



<p>Ryan Salame came under scrutiny last year after his firm filed for bankruptcy. Regulators and lawmakers paid particular attention to the millions of dollars he spent on political contributions during his stint at the crypto exchange. Salame reportedly spent more than $24 million during last year’s midterm elections. The majority of these funds were contributed to Republican candidates, unlike Bankman-Fried who spent well over $50 million to back Democratic candidates and PACs. Prosecutors have claimed the funds for these political contributions were misappropriated from customers of the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Coinbase has formally responded to the Wells Notice issued by the SEC last month.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Brian Armstrong has urged the regulator to not choose litigation and find a path forward through dialogue.&nbsp;</li><li>Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal categorically rejected the allegations made by the SEC regarding breach of securities laws.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange is willing to defend itself vigorously in court if the SEC chooses to litigate.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase has formally responded to the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-stock-drops-11-wells-notice-sec/">Wells notice</a> issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of the American crypto giant, has urged the securities regulator to work together to find a path forward through dialogue instead of choosing to litigate. Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal reiterated that the crypto exchange does not list securities. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Will Defend Itself Vigorously In Litigation</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase submitted its <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-responds-to-the-secs-wells-notice" rel="nofollow noopener">response</a> to the SEC in the form of a video and a 73-page <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/2pW56ln6rPJ7koLHlu2L8G/5041e0166c408698b621fde543539d76/2023-04-19_Coinbase_Wells_Submission.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">document</a>. The Wells notice was issued by the regulator to allow the exchange to offer its explanation for the allegations of securities law violations. In the response, Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal categorically rejected the allegations made by the regulator. He also stressed on the fact that the exchange’s fundamental business hadn’t changed since 2021 when the SEC reviewed it before allowing the company to become publicly listed. </p>



<p>Grewal also questioned the basis on which the securities regulator asserted jurisdiction over the crypto exchange, given that SEC Chair Gary Gensler himself testified in 2021 that his agency did not have regulatory authority over crypto exchanges. The Chief Legal Officer highlighted that since Congress had introduced no new legislation between the testimony and the Wells notice, there was no basis for the SEC to claim jurisdiction and charge Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>A Wells notice to the company at this stage is not constructive and its not in America’s interest. There are many aspects of the current rules which are not clear for operating a crypto business in the U.S.” </p><cite>Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase. </cite></blockquote>



<p>Both executives made it clear that the company is prepared to defend itself vigorously in court if the SEC chooses to go the litigation path. CEO Brian Armstrong warned that litigation would put the agency’s own actions on trial. The executives agreed that the constructive solution would be to address all regulatory concerns through dialogue in order to find a path forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ad data and on-chain analytics show that crypto phishers use websites promoted on Google to steal value for unsuspecting users.</li><li>A report from analytics firm ScamSniffer said over $4 million has been stolen from more than 3000 victims, with phishing URLs more rampant in recent weeks from advertisers in Canada and Ukraine.</li><li>The firm followed the money to wallets on trading venues like Binance and Kucoin.</li><li>These scammers also leverage crypto tumblers like sanctioned Ethereum-based service Tornado Cash.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto criminals have <a href="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1651452380385509377?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/realScamSniffer/status/1651452380385509377?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stolen</a> over $4 million in crypto funds from users that have fallen victim to phishing sites promoted through Google ads following a recent surge in crypto phishing efforts.</p>



<p>The metadata analysis of the phishing websites in question has been linked to advertisers in Ukraine and Canada.  Also, more than 3000 users have been targeted by these crypto phishers, a report from on-chain analytics outfit ScamSniffer said on Thursday. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>These scammers use various techniques like manipulating Google click ID parameters, allowing the attackers to show a normal webpage during Google&#8217;s standard ad review. The crypto phishers also leverage anti-debugging techniques which redirect users with developer tools to a normal website, enabling the scammers to bypass user security and system firewalls. </p>



<p>ScamSniffer&#8217;s report noted that crypto phishers are able to access sensitive user information with these phishing links and use these credentials to compromise digital wallets. </p>



<h2>Crypto Phishers Make A Killing From Scamming DeFi Users</h2>



<p>Google keyword data showed that scammers have targetted users interested in DeFi protocols and services like DeFi Llama, Lido Finance, Orbiter Finance, Radiant, and Zapper to name a few. These keywords topped the search list for malicious ads. </p>



<p>The cost of promoting crypto-related phishing websites is lucrative since the average cost per click for associated keywords is between $1 to $2, ScamSniffer&#8217;s report said.  Crypto phishers made more than 260% in ROI while spending as much as $15,000 promoting these phishing links. </p>

<h2>Web 2 Platforms Leveraged For Web 3 Theft</h2>



<p>This is not the first time crypto criminals have used Web 2 tools and services to steal funds from Web 3 users. In 2020, crypto phishers <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cryptoconfidential/2020/07/19/massive-twitter-hack-attempts-bitcoin-scam-does-defi-make-ether-a-better-bet/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/cryptoconfidential/2020/07/19/massive-twitter-hack-attempts-bitcoin-scam-does-defi-make-ether-a-better-bet/" rel="noreferrer noopener">hijacked</a> the Twitter accounts of several prominent personalities including Elon Musk, the billionaire who now owns the popular bird arm. </p>



<p>Verified accounts like Musk&#8217;s tweeted out phishing links asking users to claim free crypto tokens. Reports said that users lost unconfirmed amounts in Bitcoin (BTC). </p>



<p>Last month, the Twitter account of Circle CSO Dante Disparte <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circles-cso-disparte-hacked-twitter-usdc/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circles-cso-disparte-hacked-twitter-usdc/" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a phishing link with a fake USDC airdrop. The case highlighted again, how cybercriminals use Web 2 platforms to perpetrate Web 3 theft. </p>

<ul><li>Bit4you has announced the suspension of its activities following the insolvency of a major service provider.&nbsp;</li><li>The Brussels-based firm was Belgium’s first and only crypto lending platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The insolvent service provider held more than $8 million worth of crypto assets for the lender.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Belgian crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/maple-finance-us-treasury-management-pool/">lender</a> Bit4you has announced the suspension of all activities on its platform. The Brussels-based crypto lender’s decision came after one of its main service providers, CoinLoan, was declared insolvent earlier this week. Bit4you is the first and only crypto lending platform in Belgium. </p>



<h2><strong>CoinLoan Holds $8 Million Of Bit4you&#8217;s Crypto Assets</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://bit4you.medium.com/en-suspension-of-activities-b0cd3ef54587" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Bit4you, CoinLoan no longer has a registration to operate as a custodian of virtual currencies. A court in Estonia reportedly declared the service provider insolvent earlier this week. Bit4you stated that the decision to suspend activities on its platform was in the interest of its customers. The platform is reportedly taking all necessary steps to protect clients’ crypto assets. </p>



<p>CoinLoan paused all operations, including withdrawals, on its platform following a Notice of restraint on disposition from the court on April 24, 2023. The firm recently published a message which stated that its legal team had made available sufficient documents to CoinLoan’s ability to fulfill its obligations. However, the court has appointed an interim trustee, which will independently verify the firm’s financials. To that end, any obligation to Bit4you may take “several business days” to get approval from the Trustee. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We understand that this situation may cause concern, but we want to assure you that we are doing our utmost to resolve this situation diligently and to protect the interests of our clients.”</p></blockquote>



<p>As per a list published by Bit4you, CoinLoan held crypto assets worth over $8 million belonging to the Belgian crypto lender at the time of its solvency. These include 145 BTC, 1097 ETH, 501 BNB, 279 XMR, 638,630 ADA, and 4822 LINK, among several other cryptocurrencies. The crypto lender stated that there was no indication that these assets will not be recovered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>CAKE token declined on the week as the PancakeSwap community voted for an &#8220;aggressive reduction&#8221; in staking rewards.</li><li>The DAO proposed slashing the number of tokens stakers earn as interest for locking up their coins.</li><li>If passed, the reworked tokenomics would drastically reduce CAKE&#8217;s current unsustainable inflation rate and stem the token&#8217;s emission rate.</li><li>Stakers have unlocked over 400 million CAKE since the DAO floated the proposal while 70% of the community backs the move.</li></ul>



<p>On the weekly chart, PancakeSwap&#8217;s native asset CAKE declined by over 20%. The dip in CAKE&#8217;s price coincides with an exodus of staked tokens and a community vote to tweak tokenomics. </p>

<h2>PancakeSwap Team To Cut Emissions By Over 90%</h2>



<p>Core developers <a href="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x707643dd2c2b941c7274f26a0362922198912e8549050ae9f2d1d9d71ada04bb" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published</a> a proposal to this effect and voting kicked off earlier this week, although members of the protocols DAO started debating the proposal since early April. The proposal aims to cut down CAKE&#8217;s interest to around 3-5%. The current rate above 20% was deemed &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; by some community members. </p>



<p>To achieve this, the core team will change CAKE emissions from 6.65 CAKE per block to 3 CAKE per block if the proposal is voted for. 70% of community members already voted in favor of this &#8220;aggressive reduction&#8221;.  Emissions refer to the rate new crypto coins are released or added to the total supply. </p>



<p>The first emission reduction will be immediate. Afterward, developers will slash token emissions by 0.5 CAKE per month. This reduction will happen every month for five months till emissions occur at a 0.35 CAKE per month rate. </p>



<p>If passed, the team will implement a token emission slash of over 90%. The CAKE Tokenomics v2.5 proposal would essentially take PancakeSwap&#8217;s token into a deflationary supply. Almost 20% of the community voted against the proposal. </p>



<p>An alternative option to gradually reduce emissions received support from 10% of the voters. </p>

<ul><li>Celsius’ creditors are seeking a judge’s help to get info on FTX users involved in a series of suspicious trades.&nbsp;</li><li>The Unsecured Creditors Committee believes that the trades manipulated the price of the CEL token.&nbsp;</li><li>The creditors want to subpoena FTX to demand information related to the users behind the wallets that executed the suspicious trades.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Celsius Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors is seeking the help of a New York bankruptcy judge to get information related to a series of suspicious trades made by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-announces-ledgerx-sale-for-50-million/">FTX</a> users last year. The creditors believe that the trades manipulated the price of the bankrupt crypto lender’s native token CEL. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius Creditors Want Info On FTX Users</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/celsius-creditors-seek-to-unmask-suspicious-ftx-crypto-trades#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the latest bankruptcy hearing of Celsius saw its creditor committee enter an application in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking permission to issue subpoenas to FTX, the Bahamas-based crypto exchange which collapsed in November last year. As per the <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174904262380000000129.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a>, the subpoenas are to get information about the FTX users who made suspicious trades last year. </p>



<p>The defunct lender’s creditors stated in court that ten crypto wallets belonging to said FTX users executed a series of suspicious CEL trades between April and August last year, which led to a considerable fluctuation in the token’s price. The trades carry significant value for Celsius’ bankruptcy case because some of them were made between the date on which the platform’s withdrawals were paused and the date when the lender filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Subpoenas request information on the identities and user accounts of the entities or individuals associated with the Identified FTX Wallets associated with all short positions with respect to CEL Tokens on the FTX Exchange from April 1, 2022, to August 30, 2022.” </p><cite>Court filing by Celsius Creditors Committee</cite></blockquote>



<p>The trades bring under question the fair market value of the CEL token on bankruptcy day. The current bankruptcy plan by the company valued CEL at 20 cents on the petition date. The creditors have disputed the value of CEL, citing the suspicious trades that may have manipulated the token’s price. </p>

<p>Franklin Templeton has launched its OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/uniswap-launch-v3-polygon-zkevm/">Polygon</a>, arguably the most popular Ethereum scaling solution. The New York-based investment giant, which boasts a whopping $1.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM), announced earlier today that its OnChain market fund was supported on Ethereum via Polygon. </p>



<h2><strong>Franklin Templeton May Extend To Networks Beyond Polygon</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230426005743/en/Franklin-Templeton-Money-Market-Fund-Launches-on-Polygon-Blockchain" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> earlier today, Franklin Templeton described Polygon as a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain with a proven track record which will help it further the distribution of its OnChain money market fund. The expansion is part of the investment firm’s efforts to increase its operational efficiency through blockchain-integrated systems. The aim is to bring more value for the fund’s shareholders by enhancing security, reducing costs, and enabling faster transaction processing. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Extending the reach of the Franklin OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund to Polygon enables the Fund to be further compatible with the rest of the digital ecosystem, specifically through an Ethereum-based blockchain.” </p><cite>Roger Bayston, Head of Digital Assets at Franklin Templeton.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Going live on Polygon will help Franklin Templeton tap into the Ethereum ecosystem which gives access to a $260 billion market. The fund’s first blockchain debut came in 2021 when it was launched on the Stellar network. The OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund is the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process transactions and record share ownership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One share of the fund is represented by one BENJI token. BENJI token holders can gain exposure to the money market fund in digital wallets using the Benji investments application. Meanwhile, Franklin Templeton CEO Jenny Johnson believes that the future of the crypto industry will be regulated and that industry players need to accept it. Her comments came during the Consensus Festival earlier today.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The CEO of Bittrex Global has revealed his company’s plans to fight the charges filed by the U.S. SEC. </li><li>CEO Oliver Linch believes that the securities regulator is mistaken in charging the crypto exchange with the violation of securities laws.</li><li>Linch has maintained that his company never served any customers in the United States.  </li></ul>



<p>The latest crypto firm <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-sues-bittrex-violation-federal-laws/">sued</a> by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly planning to fight back in court. Oliver Linch, the Chief Executive of Bittrex Global, has stated his company’s plans to fight against the allegations leveled by the securities regulator last month. </p>



<h2><strong>Bittrex CEO: The SEC Is Mistaken</strong></h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/26/bittrex-global-ceo-says-firm-will-fight-sec-charges-did-not-serve-us-customers/" rel="nofollow noopener">CoinDesk</a>, Bittrex CEO Oliver Linch revealed that his company plans to vigorously defend against the charges brought by the SEC. According to Linch, the securities regulator is mistaken in its decision to charge Bittrex, its former CEO and an associated platform, with violation of local securities law. </p>



<p>The SEC sued Bittrex, its former CEO Bill Shihara, and Bittrex Global earlier this month, for allegedly operating an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The regulatory agency also charged the exchange’s foreign affiliate Bittrex Global, for failing to register as a national securities exchange. The SEC alleged that the foreign affiliate catered to clients in the United States by operating a single shared order book with the U.S. exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking on the alleged shared order book, Linch believes that the SEC hasn’t offered a sufficient explanation as to what the underlying issue is. “We think that they&#8217;re mistaken in the way they conceive of it legally and in terms of facts,” he added. The CEO further revealed that the regulator did not allow his company to explain the facts of the matter before getting sued.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Bittrex was an entirely separate legal entity and only provided services in the U.S. and only served U.S. customers. And they&#8217;re the ones that have had to shut down their operations… Global continues on providing the services to rest-of-world clients as it ever has.” </p><cite>Oliver Linch, <strong><strong>CEO</strong></strong> of <strong>Bittrex Global </strong></cite></blockquote>



<p>The complaint filed by the SEC on April 17, 2023, alleged that between 2017 and 2022, the crypto exchange generated at least $1.3 billion in revenues through transaction fees from investors while offering services as an unregistered exchange. Furthermore, the SEC alleged that the former CEO worked with crypto asset issuers who wanted to get their tokens listed, to scrub “problematic statements” from their offering materials to avoid attention from regulators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Circle announced its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol or CCTP to allow asset transfers between Ethereum’s blockchain and the Avalanche network.</li><li>USDC users will be able to move stablecoins across Ethereum and Avalanche using CCTP, increasing Circle’s utility across multiple chains.</li><li>The stablecoin issuer released its latest market structure upgrade weeks after a U.S. banking crisis rocked USDC’s market cap but CEO Jeremy Allaire said the company came out stronger.</li></ul>



<p>USDC issuer Circle <a href="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1651212222973071362?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/circle/status/1651212222973071362?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unveiled</a> its Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol or CCTP to allow stablecoin token transfers between Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain and Avalanche. CCTP is the latest market structure upgrade from the crypto payments company after a U.S. banking crisis shook confidence in USD Coin (USDC), crypto&#8217;s second largest stablecoin by market cap.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2>CCTP: No Bridge, No Problem</h2>



<p>CCTP works by burning USDC tokens on one chain, Ethereum for instance, and minting the equivalent token amount on another chain like Avalanche. This allows users to move USDC between blockchains, essentially increasing Circle&#8217;s multi-chain utility. </p>



<p>The protocol improves security by opting for a more crypto-native mechanism of burning and minting. Prior to the protocol&#8217;s release, users would have to rely on cross-chain bridges that leverage &#8220;wrapping&#8221;, a method with loopholes that cyber criminals exploit in some cases.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>CCTP removes the need to bridge USDC via traditional lock-and-mint approaches, improves liquidity across the blockchain ecosystem, and enables developers to provide their users a seamless and secure experience moving USDC natively across chains.</p></blockquote>



<p>USDC is a crucial off-ramp tool that allows crypto users to cash out from their virtual currencies into fiat like the U.S. dollar. Stablecoins like USDC and USDT also provide a cushion to soften market volatility, making it possible to users and traders to retain monetary value in the case of market meltdowns. </p>



<h2>Circle Upgrade&#8217;s Structure After US Banking Crisis</h2>



<p>Investor confidence in Circle and its USDC stablecoin dipped after Silicon Valley Bank suffered a bank run in March, trapping around <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-may-recover-3-3-billion-from-svb/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-may-recover-3-3-billion-from-svb/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$3.3 billion in USDC reserves</a> over a weekend. The matter was later resolved although Circle&#8217;s token temporarily its peg to the U.S. dollar.</p>



<p>USDC&#8217;s reserve fell some $10 billion since the debacle but Circle CEO Jeremey Allaire insists that the company has come out stronger. Allaire shared these remarks during the CoinDesk Consensus conference in Austin, Texas. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We&#8217;ve successfully navigated this crisis, and have actually upgraded the market infrastructure behind USDC to be by far the strongest, safest digital dollar on the internet today, hands down, there&#8217;s no question.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Authorities in the Bahamas are working on drafting and implementing improved laws to govern crypto businesses in the country.</li><li>The move comes months after FTX, a major crypto exchange domiciled in the Bahamas, collapsed and wiped out tens of millions in investments.</li><li>FTX’s crash became a lightning rod for regulators who favor regulations that boot out crypto from the broader financial system.</li></ul>



<p>Bahamas regulators are in the process of redrafting crypto regulations to impose stricter policies and protect investors in the aftermath of FTX&#8217;s crash, the crypto exchange founded by Sam Bankman-Fried. </p>



<p>In 2020, the country unveiled its Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges or DARE regulation to promote digital innovation and encourage crypto businesses to set up shop locally. </p>



<p>These regulations were revisited after SBF&#8217;s FTX crashed last November and incinerated hundreds of millions of investor funds. According to a <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SCB-Opens-Consultation-Period-for-DARE-Bill-2023-PR.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">consultation paper</a> released on Tuesday, the new law would bring in a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for overseeing stablecoin, staking services, and mining businesses.</p>



<p>Also, operators of a digital asset exchange must ensure the systems used in its activities are appropriate for the scale of its business under the new proposed laws. </p>



<p>Executive director of the Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB), Christina Rolle, said the bill would be “among the most advanced pieces of digital asset legislation in the world,”  if it passes. </p>



<h2>Bahamas On Alert After FTX</h2>



<p>The collapse of Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX has seemingly sparked concern and has galvanized the Bahamas to tighten their crypto laws. Charges from U.S. authorities allege that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried along with <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-nishad-singh-pleads-guilty/" rel="noreferrer noopener">other executives</a> defrauded users, and investors and violated U.S. campaign donation policies. </p>



<p>After filing for bankruptcy in November, Bankman-Fried was arrested in December and then extradited to the U.S. for criminal prosecution. </p>



<p>The FTX collapse is said to be one of the biggest financial frauds in American history. At a press conference in Manhattan, the US attorney for the southern district of new york, Damian Williams, alleged that the former chief executive and others stole billions of dollars from the company&#8217;s customers to make personal investments and to finance expenses and debts of his private trading firm, Alameda Research.</p>



<p>SBF could face a lifetime behind bars if found guilty on charges from the 13-count indictment levied by federal prosecutors. Bankman-Fried has notably pleaded &#8220;<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/not-guilty-sam-bankman-fried-charges-ftx/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/not-guilty-sam-bankman-fried-charges-ftx/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Not guilty</a>&#8221; to the charges. </p>
