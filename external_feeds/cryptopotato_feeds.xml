			            <description><![CDATA[William Shatner has a new NFT collection -- and a bullish outlook on both crypto and the United States.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">William Shatner – the famous actor who played Captain Kirk in Star Trek – appeared at Consensus 2023 on Thursday to announce an NFT project, succeeding his hit collection from 3 years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The 92-year-old spoke on why he’s excited about Web 3 in entertainment, and where he sees crypto by the time humanity reaches the Star Trek era. </span></p>
<h2>William Shatner: Infinite Connections</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shatner explained that his first experience dealing with NFTs was in 2020 when 125,000 William Shatner trading cards </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/famous-actor-william-shatner-sold-125000-blockchain-based-nfts/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sold out</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> immediately on the Wax blockchain. One of the NFTs was an X-ray of his tooth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was later contacted by the Web 3 gaming company Orange Comet to launch his new collection “Infinite Connections,” a set of 2500 3-dimensional renditions of Shatner which reflect his view that “everything is connected.”</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know nothing about how to program… but what I do understand is emotions, and drama, and beautiful things,” he said. “That kind of area is my expertise.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shatner later learned that NFTs can be “malleable” and “creative,” and ultimately gained an interest in Web 3 because the technology is evolving, and moving fast. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s the romance, its the future, its things that are happening to young people that I wanted to be a part of,” he added.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_248320" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-248320" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-248320 size-large" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52-50x28.jpg 50w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/photo_2023-04-27_23-13-52.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-248320" class="wp-caption-text">William Shatner 2 (Consensus 2023)</figcaption></figure></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto in the Distant Future</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked if Captain Kirk himself would be into crypto, Shatner said that crypto will be “way, so high,” by the time we reach the time period of his universe. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’ll be so many thousands of dollars in value – the crypto coins” – that I would think that the people today that are gonna live two or three hundred years are gonna buy crypto now before it explodes!” he said. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, however, Shatner rejected some popular ideas among crypto </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/former-coinbase-cto-balaji-srinivasans-1m-bitcoin-gambit-sparks-hyperinflation-debate/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">“doomsayers”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that fiat currency is going to collapse, believing the United States will thrive in a crypto-based future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shatner himself does not invest in crypto but is open to it having value to others. “If enough people think it&#8217;s something, then it is,” he added. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The update and Galaxy Z Fold devices will provide users with an empowered Crypto.com App experience.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Popular digital asset trading platform Crypto.com has partnered with technology giant Samsung to offer an optimized version of its app for Samsung Galaxy Z Fold devices, including the recently launched Z Fold4.</p>
<p class="p1">In a statement <a href="https://crypto.com/company-news/crypto-com-and-samsung-to-enhance-the-crypto-com-app-experience-for-the-galaxy-z-fold/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">released</a> Thursday, Crypto.com announced the new update, Version 3.158.1, which features an enhanced trading and analysis experience specifically for Galaxy Z Fold devices.</p>
<h2 class="p2"><b>Tailored Trading Experience for Galaxy Z Fold </b></h2>
<p class="p1">The new features will allow users to compare a range of tokens simultaneously and more efficiently than on any other mobile device. This latest development makes Crypto.com the first digital asset platform to offer a tailored experience for Galaxy Z Fold devices.</p>
<p class="p1">The partnership was formed due to the shared vision of both companies to deliver a more engaging mobile experience to their customers. The update and Galaxy Z Fold devices will provide users with an empowered Crypto.com App experience, offering more tools and resources on a single screen.</p>
<p class="p1">Eric Anziani, President and Chief Operating Officer of Crypto.com, expressed his excitement about the alliance and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">&#8220;This collaboration with Samsung will allow users to experience our app like never before. Together, Samsung and Crypto.com have optimized the Crypto.com App for the large screen experience, taking advantage of the foldable form factor, to bring a more productive way of using the app for the trading and analysis of cryptocurrencies.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 class="p1">Samsung&#8217;s Crypto Endeavors</h2>
<p class="p1">Samsung has become an active player in the crypto and blockchain market. The multinational conglomerate has been exploring opportunities in the nascent industry for the past several years.</p>
<p class="p1">In 2021, the company released a blockchain-based smartphone called the Galaxy A series, which featured a built-in hardware wallet for secure cryptocurrency storage.</p>
<p class="p1">Last month, Samsung <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/samsung-and-nifty-gateway-launch-the-worlds-first-smart-tvs-compatible-with-nft/" data-wpel-link="internal">partnered</a> with popular NFT marketplace Nifty Gateway to launch the world&#8217;s first Smart TV compatible with non-fungible tokens.</p>
<p class="p1">In January, the company&#8217;s investment arm&#8217;s subsidiary, Samsung Asset Management Hong Kong (SAMHK), <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/samsung-bitcoin-future-active-etf-to-hit-hong-kong-stock-market-on-jan-13/" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> plans to offer its Bitcoin Future ETF to retail and institutional investors in Hong Kong.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The scaling solution aims to solve the blockchain trilemma - decentralization, scalability, and security - crucial for the Web3 sector. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Polygon announced that Polygon Bridge is now available for Polygon zkEVM. The development comes a month after the launch of the zero-knowledge rollup on Mainnet Beta.</p>
<p>The symbolic first transaction on Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta was performed by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta is designed to be an all-purpose Ethereum scaling protocol that allows developers means to build on it with the usage being similar to Ethereum, without modifying languages or tooling.</p>
<h2>Polygon zkEVM</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/announcing-polygon-bridge-for-polygon-zkevm-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a>, Polygon Bridge for zkEVM will feature several improvements that incorporate feedback received from the community and include a more visible progress bar, transaction history, and recent transaction panel with color-coded completion status, time estimates for pending transactions and the ability to filter.</p>
<p>&#x200d;Polygon Bridge for zkEVM is powered by zero-knowledge technology, meaning &#8211; they are governed entirely by smart contracts &#8211; one on Ethereum and one on Polygon zkEVM. Moreover, users will be able to withdraw funds from the Ethereum mainnet within 30-60 minutes. It will also support ERC-20 tokens and the extended features of ERC-777 tokens.</p>
<p>The launch of Polygon zkEVM eliminates the mapping requirement &#8211; a process that can take hours or even days. As such, the token being bridged will automatically be mapped once a user triggers the bridging transaction. This is being touted as a &#8220;major UX improvement&#8221; compared to other chains, which require users to map tokens before bridging.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Permissionless, open source, and public &#8211; anyone can use it to transact and build. An impressive array of teams is already building on the Mainnet Beta, including premier dApps such as Lens and Balancer, blue-chip gaming projects such as Midnight Society and Oath of Peak, and trusted infrastructure providers such as ANKR, Alchemy, Sequence, and The Graph.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Turning Point in Ethereum Scaling</h2>
<p>Since its launch last month, Polygon’s zkEVM has <a href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/polygonzkevm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">attracted</a> $5.4 million in TVL. Polygon&#8217;s zero-knowledge rollup also got a boost from Uniswap earlier this month as the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/lido-staked-matic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">proposal</a> to authorize Polygon Labs to deploy the DEX protocol to zkEVM was passed with zero opposition.</p>
<p>Polygon zkEVM deposits also increased considerably. Quickswap, the leading DEX on the Polygon PoS Chain, and long-time Uniswap rival, Sushi are live on the network.</p>
<p>Zooming out, Polygon has shown <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/messari-researcher-outlines-polygons-growth-path/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">significant</a> growth this year in terms of developer count and attracting some major institutions. Despite this, the company behind the development of the layer 2 blockchain &#8211; Polygon Labs &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/polygon-labs-becomes-latest-company-to-slash-workforce-with-100-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> slashing its workforce by 20% in February this year.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Anthony Scaramucci recaps the week of FTX's collapse, his encounter with Sam Bankman-Fried, and Skybridge's performance ever since. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">SkyBridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci spoke at Consensus 2023 on Thursday about the state of affairs at FTX in the weeks and days before its collapse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The former rejected the notion that Changpeng Zhao (CZ) – CEO of Binance – was responsible for the exchange’s failure, pinning the blame solely on former FTX boss Sam Banknman-Fried. </span></p>
<h2>How SkyBridge Fairs After FTX</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scaramucci began by clarifying that his relationship with FTX has not harmed his company to such a great deal as many make it out to be. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think we’re holding up quite nicely, and I think we’ve got the benefit of the whole last quarter… it&#8217;s probably the best quarter we’ve had at our firm in ten years.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">SkyBridge </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftx-ventures-to-acquire-30-stake-in-anthony-scaramuccis-skybridge-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">sold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a 30% stake in its company to FTX Ventures just 8 weeks before the exchange went bust. Scaramucci said SkyBridge has been in contact with bankruptcy lawyers related to that stake, but will ultimately be ok whether or not they can buy the stake back later. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Regarding SBF, the executive said that he “likes Sam,” even though he recognizes what he did as a betrayal. Thankfully, many of the influential figures he introduced Bankman-Fried to – including Tony Blair and the Clinton family  – had not finished their due diligence processes nor made large investments in FTX before it collapsed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scaramucci said he got word of FTX’s troubles on November 7th. Bankman-Fried’s father told him that the company faced an “asset-liability mismatch” of roughly $1 billion and that they merely needed time to liquidate some of their illiquid assets to continue meeting redemptions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later in the evening, however, that number blew up to $4.5 billion. This prompted Scaramucci to book a flight to the Bahamas to personally meet with Bankan-Fried and questions him about what was happening. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The war room looked despondent,” he said. “It was clear to a few people that there was a very small group of people that had done something that they didn’t let the other group of people into.”</span></p></blockquote>

<h2>SBF Killed His Own Exchange</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The founder hasn’t spoken with Bankman-Fried directly since that day but has had talks with CZ about the situation. “Some people are of the belief that CZ put Sam out of business – that is not the case,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kevin O’Leary – a former paid spokesperson for FTX – has testified before Congress blaming Binance for causing the market instability and panic that led to FTX’s collapse. He’s also said that he’d be willing to </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/despite-ftx-bankruptcy-kevin-oleary-would-still-invest-in-sbf/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">reinvest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Bankman-Fried if the conditions were right. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Scaramucci was less confident – and expressed doubt about FTX’s potential to make a 2024 </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ftxs-recovered-assets-surge-to-7-3-billion-may-restart-exchange-in-2024/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">revival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. “I think that that’s an impossibility… maybe some type of rebranding, but I don’t see how you get FTX to restart.&#8221; </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Erik Voorhees and Caitlin Long discuss FTX's abandonment of crypto first principles, and the ensuing regulatory response.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The immense fraud and failure throughout crypto in 2022 have regulators hastily and recklessly driving the industry offshore, according to Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The executive sat down with private investor and ShapeShift CEO Erik Voorhees at Consensus 2023 to discuss the many ways in which crypto has lost its way, and how it can still help remedy the problems that centralized mismanagement has caused. </span></p>
<h2>Is Crypto Straying From Its Purpose?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During a Thursday Panel titled, “Remember Why We’re Here: Crypto’s True Purpose”, Voorhees and Long both said they were first driven into crypto after being disenchanted by the great financial crisis and learning the failures of the current monetary system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In particular, Long realized that the current financial system doesn’t run on an “honest ledger”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“If we have an honest ledger then the fruits of our labor can be saved in a way that someone else is not stealing it,” she explained. Bitcoin, for her, represented a ledger that could be trusted and which had “no counterparty risk.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The panelists reflected on <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/canadas-largest-pension-fund-to-stay-away-from-crypto-after-writing-off-ftx-investment/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX’s collapse</a> in 2022 as a prime example of the very centralized fraud that Bitcoin was supposed to provide safety from. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long said that the recent crackdowns against crypto companies by regulators are an overreaction to that, with the companies attempting to be the most compliant getting punished the hardest.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I lament that the United States is throwing out the entire reasonable regulation approach out with the bathwater, because they’re literally shoving everything offshore and into the unregulated shadow markets, and rejecting those trying to create a reasonable regulatory regime.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long added that the Securities and Exchange Commission’s “wack-a-mole” approach to regulating will only allow people to continue getting scammed.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It seems that they are deliberately saying ‘stay the fuck away’&#8230; by those of us who did approach them for permission,” she said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Long’s Custodia Bank, designed to be a compliant bridge between crypto and US dollar payments – </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-bank-custodia-sues-fed-delaying-master-account-application/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sued</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the Federal Reserve in June 2022 for improperly handling its decision to grant the company a master account with the central bank.</span></p>

<h2>Open Source is the Answer</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voorhees believes there’s a solution to future scammers – but it doesn’t need to involve more regulation. “Open source software is the solution to scams perpetrated by people,” he said, arguing that the naturally transparent approach of Bitcoin is simpler and more effective than transparency enforced by the government. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wish some of these regulators would say thank you to these incredible, talented engineers around the world who are actually building transparent, immutable financial software,” he said.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The libertarian-minded crypto fan, while against scammers, doesn’t necessarily object to the speculative bubbles in which they emerge. FTX, for instance, while having blown up, is now a thing of the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that I’m happy that people lost money on failed projects, but it also created things like Ethereum itself,” he said, referring to the 2017 ICO bubble. “The return on capital on just Ethereum pays off all ICO investment 10x – easily.&#8221; </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Circle said that CCTP is a highly secure and capital-efficient way for USDC transfers in an increasingly multi-chain environment. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fintech firm Circle announced the mainnet availability of Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) for developers building on Ethereum and Avalanche networks. The protocol will essentially allow USDC to flow natively across supported chains by burning the native stablecoin on a source chain and minting the same amount on a destination chain.</p>
<p>The &#8220;burn and mint&#8221; process results in USDC &#8220;teleporting&#8221; from one blockchain to another by eliminating the complications and risks of traditional &#8220;lock and mint&#8221; approaches.</p>
<h2>USDC Interoperability</h2>
<p>Some of the bridges and protocols that are already live with CCTP on the mainnet are &#8211; Multichain, Celer, LayerZero, LI.FI, MetaMask, Hyperlane, Router, Socket, Rarimo, Wormhole, and Wanchain. Circle further intends to expand CCTP to additional chains in the second half of 2023.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-delivers-usdc-interoperability-across-ecosystems-with-mainnet-launch-of-cross-chain-transfer-protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> on April 26th, Joao Reginatto, Circle&#8217;s VP of Product, explained that Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol gives USDC native interoperability across Web3. He added that the liquidity and capital inefficiency issues in decentralized finance (DeFi) due to the risks and fragmented nature of bridged assets can be solved by the protocol.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With CCTP, developers can simplify the user experience, and their users can trust that they are always transacting with a highly liquid, safe, and fungible asset in native USDC. This milestone makes USDC a natively multi-chain digital dollar.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Stablecoins are a crucial element of the DeFi economy. With the new tool, Circle <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circle-cross-chain-protocol-approaches-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">aims</a> to unify liquidity across the ecosystem and simplify the user experience.</p>
<p>To use the protocol, users will have to begin by initiating a transfer of USDC on a source chain. The burn event will then be observed and attested by Circle on the source chain. The firm is then tasked with providing authorization to mint the specified amount of USDC on the destination chain. Finally, the attestation is used to trigger the minting of USDC on the destination chain and then sent to the recipient&#8217;s wallet address.</p>
<h2>FUD and Expansion</h2>
<p>USDC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/circles-usdc-outflows-surpassed-10b-since-svb-collapse-tether-dominance-rises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">saw</a> massive outflows following the momentary de-pegging event. The US regulatory crackdown and banking crisis nearly slashed the stablecoin&#8217;s market cap by half over the past six months alone.</p>
<p>Despite the FUD last month, Circle has been pushing for USDC’s expansion across several blockchains.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xapo-bank-partners-with-circle-to-integrate-usdc-payment-rails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnered</a> with Bitcoin custodian and licensed private bank Xapo in March to integrate USDC payment rails. Circle has also applied for regulatory approvals in France as it doubled down in European expansion amid heavy regulatory scrutiny.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s price was rejected from a key resistance level a few weeks ago, highlighting indecisiveness. Even so, there is still hope for the bulls that the rally is not over.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By:<a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"> Edris</a></p>
<h3>XRP/USDT Daily Chart</h3>
<p>XRP&#8217;s price failed to break through the $0.55 resistance level and has been dropping since. The 50-day moving average is currently providing support near the $0.46 mark and is closely followed by the 200-day moving average at around $0.41.</p>
<p>This confluence of support elements makes the $0.40 level significantly important, and a break below would likely lead to a rapid drop toward the $0.3 mark in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a rebound from this area would pave the way for another test of the $0.5 resistance zone, with a higher probability for a bullish breakout this time around.</p>
<figure id="attachment_248262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-248262" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-248262 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_2704231" width="2560" height="1441" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/XRPUSDT-Daily-Apr-27-2023-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-248262" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>XRP/BTC Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Things do not look much better against BTC, as the price has been rejected from the higher boundary of the large descending channel on multiple occasions. The 0.000015 area is being tested at the moment, and a break below it would prove disastrous for the bulls, as there is not much support below before the 0.000013 mark.</p>
<p>The RSI is also indicating bearish momentum dominance by demonstrating values below 50%. Therefore, a bearish continuation seems highly likely for Ripple on the BTC paired chart.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American politician serving as the junior United States Senator for Texas – Ted Cruz &#8211; thinks bitcoin could be a lifeboat amid the inflationary environment supposedly created by Washington&#8217;s irrational decisions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He revealed holding slightly more than 2 BTC and having a standing order to buy more of the primary cryptocurrency every Monday morning, regardless of its price. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">BTC: A Hedge Against Inflation and So Much More</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In a recent </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Dw0K66tKHA&amp;t=17688s" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">appearance</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> at The Bitcoin Policy Summit, Cruz explained why he is such a keen supporter of the asset and why a potential launch of a central bank digital currency would not benefit Americans. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He admitted being &#8220;incredibly excited and bullish&#8221; on the asset, describing it as &#8220;the alfa in the crypto sphere.&#8221; The politician also put his name on the list of people who view BTC as digital gold.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Cruz believes its main merit is its ability to serve as a hedge against the worrying inflation that has spread across the US and many other countries. He backed the thesis that BTC&#8217;s hard cap of 21 million coins ever to exist could give the asset anty-inflationary characteristics. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The fixed supply contracts with the limitless printing of fiat currency that central banks could and have executed (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic). Cruz criticized the American authorities for allowing this policy and thus lifting inflation to unseen levels in years:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We see inflation all across the country driven by this spending binge that happened in the last two years in Washington that unleashed significant inflation.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another reason why the Republican adores BTC is that it can&#8217;t be controlled by governments, saying this is why China prohibited all operations involving cryptocurrencies:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I like bitcoin for the same reason that the Chinese communist government doesn&#8217;t like bitcoin. They don&#8217;t like bitcoin, and they banned it because they can&#8217;t control it.&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, Cruz admitted being a bitcoin investor, having a little more than 2 BTC. He also has a standing purchase order every Monday to increase his exposure, regardless of the momentum valuation.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CBDC Should not Pop up in the US</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Besides highlighting his support for bitcoin, Cruz argued that the potential launch of a digital dollar could harm the local monetary system:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I&#8217;m very concerned about the risk of a CBDC. I think that is exceptionally dangerous; we see China moving forward with the intention of using a CBDC to destroy all the value of bitcoin, to destroy anonymity, to destroy decentralization.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Senator </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/sen-ted-cruz-introduces-a-bill-to-prevent-the-fed-from-issuing-a-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">introduced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> a bill last year that aims to restrain the Federal Reserve from issuing such a financial product. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;This bill goes a long way in making sure big government doesn&#8217;t attempt to centralize and control cryptocurrency so that it can continue to thrive and prosper in the United States. We should be empowering entrepreneurs, enabling innovation, and increasing individual freedom – not stifling it,&#8221; he stated back then.</span></p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[Merlin’s exploit was carried out by its bank-end developer team after they manipulated the protocol’s contracts and web host.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security firm CertiK and zk-Sync decentralized exchange (DEX) Merlin are working towards a plan to reimburse users affected by a recent exploit that drained almost $2 million from the latter.</p>
<p>Merlin revealed on Thursday that the incident, which was widely believed to be an exploit, was, in fact, a rug pull by several rogue members of its back-end developer team, who manipulated the protocol’s code to achieve their goal.</p>
<h2>CertiK and Merlin to Compensate Victims</h2>
<p>Recall that Merlin’s liquidity pool was drained on Wednesday, hours after CertiK audited the protocol’s code. The DEX was conducting the public sale of its native token, MAGE, when an attacker executed the hack.</p>
<p>As <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/zksync-dex-merlin-exploited-for-over-1-8m-after-code-audit/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a>, CertiK said an analysis of the event suggested a private key management issue may have led to the incident. The security firm disclosed that it had pointed out a centralization risk in the audit conducted on Monday and recommended that Merlin switches to decentralized mechanisms to avoid single points of key failure.</p>
<p>Upon further analysis, Merlin and CertiK discovered that the hack was an insider job from the protocol’s team. The back-end team implemented a call-action function that gave them power over the contracts and all trading pairs in the liquidity pools.</p>
<p>The developers were also able to manipulate Merlin’s front-end contracts and web host, allowing them to execute several on-chain transactions that drained the public sale.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our unwavering priority is to return all funds to effected parties and participants on the Merlin platform at the earliest opportunity. To that end, we are working alongside <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@Certik</a> (Team DOXX by both Prospero &amp; Alatar Recovery Plan) to reimburse all effected users.</p>
<p>— Merlin (@TheMerlinDEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheMerlinDEX/status/1651281824285376513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">April 26, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>A 20% White Hat Bounty</h2>
<p>While Merlin and CertiK are working out a compensation plan, they have also informed relevant authorities about the incident and the whereabouts of the rogue technical team. The back-end team has been traced to Serbia, Europe, and local authorities have been notified.</p>
<p>The protocol has also recruited on-chain analysts to monitor the movement of the funds. The stolen assets have been <a href="https://debank.com/profile/0xa7d481944730a88b862eb57248cb1b2c8aa358ad" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tracked</a> to two wallets and were still there at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, CertiK has <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiK/status/1651276441949028373?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">offered</a> the developers a 20% white hat bounty, urging them to accept it to avoid the wrath of the law.</p>
