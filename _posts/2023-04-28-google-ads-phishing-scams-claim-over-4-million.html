DeFi is Once Again the Target of Scams
<p>ScamSniffer says major DeFi projects, websites and brands have recently been targeted. Notably, scammers have focused on Lido, Zapper.fi, Stargate, DefiLlama, Orbiter Finance and Radiant.</p>
<p>An analysis of ScamSniffer&rsquo;s metadata indicates that many phishing websites have been linked to scammers in Canada and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Fraudsters bypass Google&rsquo;s ad review process using several different methods. This includes tricking Google Click ID, which enables scammers to display a legitimate website while Google conducts its review process of an advertisement.</p>
<p>Harmful advertisements proved to be a very profitable endeavour for scammers. ScamSniffer reveals that the average cost per click for related keywords ranges from $1 to $2. With a conversion rate of 40% from 7,500 consumers clicking on malicious ads, scammers have invested nearly $15,000 in advertising. A total of $4 million has been stolen thus far, translating into a return rate of 276%.</p>

Technological Developments Result in More Sophisticated Scams
<p>While scams targeting cryptocurrency users are by no means a recent occurrence, technological advancements in the field of artificial intelligence mean that scams are becoming ever more sophisticated.</p>
<p>California regulators recently revealed that scammers are profiting from the AI hype by duping investors into investing in companies with AI-generated CEOs. The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) sent cease and desist letter to at least five firms claiming to make profits using AI-assisted trading techniques.</p>
