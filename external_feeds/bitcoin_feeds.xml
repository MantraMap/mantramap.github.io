The top diplomats, who met in South Africa, also emphasized the importance of financial inclusion, welcoming new technologies that support it.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS to Stimulate Trade Transactions in Local Currencies</h2>
<p>The BRICS group of the largest emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), will encourage the use of local currencies in international trade. The plan was announced during the meeting of their foreign ministers in Cape Town, Russian news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti reported.</p>
<p>The first diplomats of the nations in the union met in South Africa’s oldest city on June 1 &#8211; 2. The hosting country took over the BRICS chairmanship from China earlier this year. In a joint <a href="https://www.dirco.gov.za/2023/06/01/joint-statement-of-the-brics-ministers-of-foreign-affairs-and-international-relations-cape-town-south-africa-1-june-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> published by its foreign ministry, the Department of International Relations and Cooperation, they stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ministers underscored the importance of encouraging the use of local currencies in international trade and financial transactions between BRICS as well as their trading partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>The representatives also put an emphasis on financial inclusion that will allow citizens to “reap the benefits of economic growth and prosperity.” They welcomed the “many new technological instruments for financial inclusion, developed in BRICS countries,” insisting these can help ensure people’s participation in the formal economy.</p>
<p>A number of other <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">countries</a> have so far expressed intentions to join the association, including Argentina, Iran, Indonesia, Turkey, and Egypt. According to a recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-in-membership-talks-with-saudi-arabia-report-reveals/">report</a>, Saudi Arabia is holding membership talks as well.</p>

<p>The heads of state of BRICS nations plan to meet in Johannesburg, on Aug. 22 &#8211; 24. According to Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Overchuk, the creation of an international reserve currency based on the currencies of the BRICS states, is likely to be on the summit’s agenda.</p>
<p>In interview earlier this year, South Africa’s ambassador to the group, Anil Sooklal, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">highlighted</a> efforts to deepen economic and financial ties between the BRICS members, with the aim of creating a common currency. However, he noted that the bloc is currently focused on expanding the use of their national currencies.</p>

<h2>Forex Dealers Must Only Trade With Authorized International Brokers</h2>
<p>The Tanzanian central bank has reminded forex dealers that all transactions exceeding USD 1,000,000.00 per transaction must be &#8220;traded within the interbank foreign exchange market prevailing quoted prices.&#8221; The central bank also reminded foreign currency dealers that they should only trade with licensed international foreign currency brokers.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.bot.go.tz/Adverts/PressRelease/en/2023053114490398.pdf">statement</a> signed by the institution’s governor, Emmanuel M. Tutuba, the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) said it made the decision to issue the reminder after reviewing the operations of the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>&#8220;As part of the undertaking of its statutory mandate, the Bank of Tanzania has reviewed the foreign exchange market operations in consideration of the current market development,&#8221; the BOT explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h2>Safeguarding the Stability of the Financial System</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/dollar-shortages-prompt-tanzania-to-tighten-currency-controls-1.1927499">reported</a> by Bloomberg, Tanzania has seen its foreign exchange reserves drop to $4.9 billion at the end of April. This figure is approximately $600 million less than the $5.5 billion recorded a year earlier. According to the central bank, the latest directives, which became effective on June 1, are intended to &#8220;foster macroeconomic stability and safeguard the stability of the financial system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in addition to requiring dealers to trade with authorized brokers, the BOT reminded them to &#8220;strictly observe the procedures for know your customer (KYC) in their undertakings.&#8221; The central bank also directed dealers to retain a limit of foreign exchange net open position of 10% of core capital. The BOT said any infringement will &#8220;attract penal sanctions as provided for in the Foreign Exchange Act, 1992.&#8221;</p>

The company clarified that Rocket Pool liquid stakers utilizing Zksync Era will enjoy faster speeds and lower transaction costs.</strong></p>
<h2>Liquid Staking Protocol Rocket Pool Joins Forces With Zksync Era</h2>
<p>The liquid staking protocol Rocket Pool, ranked third in size, is set to integrate with Zksync, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Rocket_Pool/status/1664276628468547587?s=20">announced</a> on Twitter. <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">Statistics</a> reveal that Rocket Pool currently holds 733,575 ether, equivalent to $1.3 billion, within its liquid staking protocol. On Thursday, the team tweeted, &#x201C;Rocket Pool is coming to Zksync Era. You&#x2019;ll soon be able to liquid stake your <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> on Zksync Era by simply holding rETH in your wallet. Just like on mainnet and other L2&#x2019;s, rETH will continue to accrue staking rewards automatically.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/liquid-staking-protocol-lidos-defi-dominance-swells-from-7-to-26-in-12-months/">Liquid staking</a> has gained popularity in recent years, and this year has witnessed a significant surge in the number of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> staked in these protocols. Nearly 10 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> are currently locked in the leading liquid staking protocols, with Rocket Pool capturing 7.72% of the market share. Zksync, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solution akin to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ethereum-network-fees-surge-153-in-30-days-while-arbitrum-daily-transactions-outpace-eth-following-shapella-upgrade/">Arbitrum</a> and Optimism, introduced Zksync Era in March, just two months ago. Rocket Pool has outlined that stakers utilizing Zksync will enjoy faster confirmation times and reduced network fees.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Liquid stakers will benefit from faster speeds [and] lower transaction costs, secured by Zksync Era&#x2019;s zero-knowledge proofs,&#x201D; Rocket Pool said. &#x201C;Another step in our mission to reduce barriers to entry [and] ensure everyone can participate in Ethereum&#x2019;s proof-of-stake system.&#x201D; According to data, the present transaction cost on Zksync stands at $0.10 for sending ether and $0.24 per coin swap. In contrast, an onchain <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> transaction incurs a cost of $1.54, while a high-priority token swap onchain transaction costs $13.91.</p>

<p>Rocket Pool has experienced <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/rocket-pool">notable activity</a> in the past two months, and seven-day statistics indicate a 4.87% increase in its total value locked (TVL). Over the previous 30 days, Rocket Pool&#x2019;s TVL has risen by 25.68%. Despite holding the third-largest amount of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> among liquid staking protocols, Rocket Pool falls behind Lido Finance, which commands an impressive 73.90% of the entire Ethereum-based liquid staking market share. Out of the current 9.49 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> held, Lido&#x2019;s protocol accounts for 7.01 million ether.</p>

Reports indicate that Sberbank&#8217;s Comunity, the Ethereum-based blockchain decentralized finance solution, will leave the open testing phase later this year.</strong></p>
<h2>Sberbank Opens Defi Platform for Testing</h2>
<p>Sberbank, one of the leading financial institutions in Russia, has <a href="https://bnn.network/breaking-news/sberbank-expands-developer-access-to-its-revolutionary-defi-platform-paving-the-way-for-digital-asset-innovation-in-russia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be opening developer access for its in-house built decentralized finance solution, called Comunity. Alexander Nam, head of Sberbank&#8217;s Blockchain Lab, stated that now other developers can connect their solutions to the Comunity platform in a testing capacity.</p>
<p>Sberbank&#8217;s Comunity defi platform&#8217;s development was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sberbank-set-to-launch-decentralized-finance-platform-based-on-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in February, when the service was already in closed beta testing phases, according to Sberbank&#8217;s blockchain laboratory product director Konstantin Klimenko. He also stated that Comunity was slated to start its open testing phase in March.</p>
<p>Sberbank&#8217;s Comunity is a Russian Ethereum-based blockchain development that seeks to link traditional banking services with cryptocurrency, allowing its customers to experience these services using Russian rubles and with the support of a regulated financial institution.</p>
<p>The bank <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-17/russia-s-top-bank-sberbank-gets-license-to-issue-digital-assets#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a license to issue digital assets on March 2022 and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russias-sberbank-executes-first-digital-asset-issue-its-platform-2022-07-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">conducted</a> the first digital transaction through its subsidiary Sberfactory. The transaction issued a one billion ruble instrument with a 3-month maturity.</p>

<h2>State of Crypto in Russia</h2>
<p>Sverbank&#8217;s blockchain conference also served to show the progress and popularity of cryptocurrency assets in the country. Data revealed at the event indicated that 17 million Russians, accounting for approximately 12% of the population, possessed cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>Also, in the same way, more than 3 million Russians are actively engaged in cryptocurrency activities like speculation trading and staking tokens, showing that cryptocurrencies have penetrated the Russian market.</p>
<p>In an intervention during the event, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, offered some insight into how the Russian legislative body was dealing with cryptocurrency regulation issues.</p>
<p>Aksakov stated that the oversight of the cryptocurrency market in this regard is expected to be delivered to the Federal Taxation Service, a federal body dedicated to registering legal entities and natural persons as individual entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Aksakov explained that taxing crypto was one of the most critical issues and that the State Duma strived to balance innovation and compliance with the upcoming cryptocurrency regulatory framework being <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-enact-laws-to-regulate-crypto-exchange-action-profiles-use-of-cryptocurrency-to-bypass-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a>.</p>

<h2>Central Bank Says Report Contains &#8216;Destabilising Innuendos&#8217;</h2>
<p>The Nigeria central bank has rejected reports it had devalued the local currency to 630 per dollar and branded the report in the Daily Trust &#8220;fake news.&#8221; In a <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2023/CCD/CBN%20Press%20Release%20%20FX%20Rate%20.pdf">statement</a> issued shortly after news of the naira’s supposed devaluation went viral, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) insisted that the report &#8220;is replete with outright falsehoods and destabilising innuendos.&#8221; The apex bank claimed that the report also exposes the authors’ &#8220;potentially willful ignorance&#8221; of how the Nigerian foreign exchange market works.</p>
<p>The CBN ended its statement by revealing that the naira to U.S. dollar exchange rate at the Investors’ &amp; Exporters’ (I&amp;E) window on the morning of June 1, 2023, was N465 per dollar. In contrast, dealers on the black market were said to be offering as much as N740 for every dollar. As has been reported by Bitcoin.com News, the gap between the rate offered on the official market and the parallel market has widened over the past few years. According to a report, the parallel market rate was at one point <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nigerian-currency-redesign-controversy-naira-slips-by-almost-20-experts-see-exchange-rate-reaching-10001-usd-before-year-end/">almost</a> twice the I&amp;E rate.</p>
<p>Some Nigerian and foreign economic experts have said the CBN&#8217;s current exchange rate overvalues the naira by as much as 20%. Others like Tatonga Rusike, a Bank of America economist, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-bank-of-america-economist-predicts-20-devaluation-of-the-nigerian-currency-in-2023/">predicted</a> that the CBN would eventually devalue the naira&#8217;s exchange rate versus the dollar by as much as 20%.</p>
<h2>Publication Says Its Story Is Based on Facts</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in its earlier <a href="https://dailytrust.com/exclusive-cbn-devalues-naira-to-630-1/">report</a> that prompted the CBN’s furious response, the Daily Trust said the CBN had on May 31 sold U.S. dollars on the I&amp;E market at the rate of N631:USD1. The report insinuated that the devaluation may have been sanctioned by the country’s new president Bola Ahmed Tinubu. In his inauguration speech less than 48 hours earlier, Tinubu <a href="https://punchng.com/full-text-president-tinubus-inaugural-speech/">hinted</a> that his administration would move to unify the naira’s multiple exchange rates.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/aS9Ce4JMgF">pic.twitter.com/aS9Ce4JMgF</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Daily Trust (@daily_trust) <a href="https://twitter.com/daily_trust/status/1664329475457179649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>However, after the central bank issued its terse statement which also questioned the publication&#8217;s professionalism, Daily Trust said in a tweet that it stood by the story. The publication insisted that the story &#8220;contains three facts and one interpretation.&#8221; One of these according to Daily Trust is the fact that the CBN &#8220;sold dollars to banks on behalf of their customers at the said rate [N631:USD1]&#8221; on May 31. President Tinubu’s call for the unification of the naira exchange rates as well as his meeting with the CBN governor on May 30 are the two other uncontested facts, the publication said.</p>
<p>Besides rejecting the central bank’s fake news label, Daily Trust also said it had evidence to back its claims that the CBN had used a different exchange rate on the day in question. The publication said the onus is on the CBN to &#8220;provide any facts to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

<strong>About Volt Inu</strong>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Volt Inu is a game-changing crypto project that aims to revolutionize decentralized finance (DeFi) by offering a comprehensive platform. </span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in December 2021, Volt Inu has quickly gained traction for its unique approach to supporting deflationary tokens. It enables crypto projects to be listed freely and permissionless while promoting deflationary mechanisms through token supply burning. This innovative concept has garnered significant attention and sets Volt Inu apart in the DeFi space.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to its DeFi solutions, Volt Inu has made significant strides in the non-fungible token (NFT) field. The platform introduced the VDSC collection, a 3D NFT series that has captured the interest of the crypto community. Furthermore, Volt Inu has developed two groundbreaking crypto-based games: Volted Racer and VoltIsland. Volted Racer is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that integrates NFTs and offers free and paid game modes for individuals and crypto projects. On the other hand, VoltIsland is an upcoming Battle Royale game incorporating VDSC NFT integration, slated for launch in Q3 2023. These ventures into NFTs and gaming diversify Volt Inu&#x2019;s offerings and attract a broader audience.</span>&#13;<br />

Payrolls in May rose to 339,000, which was significantly higher than the expected sum of 190,000. Solana collided with a key resistance level in today&#x2019;s session.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) was one of Friday&#x2019;s notable gainers, as the token snapped a key resistance level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD rose by as much as 3% in today&#x2019;s session, hitting an intraday high of $0.3777 as a result.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This rally resulted in the 10-day (red) moving average crossing over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Typically such an upwards crossover signals the start of a bull run, and it comes as the relative strength index (RSI) also rose considerably.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 50.91, which is marginally below a resistance level at 52.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In the event this ceiling is broken, there is a strong chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a> will move towards the $0.3800 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Solana (SOL) also climbed higher in today&#x2019;s session, with prices colliding with a key resistance level in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $20.38 on Thursday, SOL/USD surged to a peak at $21.30 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since hitting the aforementioned ceiling at $21.30, momentum has somewhat weakened, due to bulls securing earlier gains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Another reason for this is that the RSI is close to a resistance level of its own at 55.00, leading traders to act more tentatively.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is currently tracking at 53.64, and should it eventually cross the hard line at 55.00, bullish pressure will likely increase.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Some may expect this to happen over the weekend, as traders continue to digest today&#x2019;s economic data.&#13;<br />

This order from the central bank comes in the wake of Silvergate&#8217;s declaration of voluntary liquidation 86 days prior on March 8, and the subsequent collapse of three major banks.</strong></p>
<h2>Fed Orders Silvergate Bank to Produce a Self-Liquidation Plan Within 10 Days</h2>
<p>Approximately three months ago, Silvergate Bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-bank-announces-voluntary-liquidation-as-crypto-industry-woes-persist/">revealed</a> its decision to willfully dissolve the organization&#8217;s assets and cease its operations. Preceding this announcement, the bank grappled with financial troubles causing its shares to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silvergate-bank-terminates-crypto-payments-network-as-shares-plunge-to-record-low/">nosedive in value</a>. Citing &#8220;recent industry and regulatory developments&#8221; as the reason for closing, Silvergate assured that their liquidation strategy would &#8220;include full repayment of all deposits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following Silvergate&#8217;s proclamation, the U.S. banking sector suffered a significant downturn, and soon after, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-regulators-close-silicon-valley-bank-in-one-of-the-largest-bank-failures-since-washington-mutual/">Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed</a>, marking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">second-largest bank</a> failure in U.S. history. This downward trend persisted with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-regulators-seize-control-of-signature-bank-depositors-assured-by-federal-bailout/">Signature Bank</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-chase-assumes-control-of-first-republic-bank-following-seizure-by-california-regulators/">First Republic Bank</a>&#8216;s respective failures rendering them the third and fourth largest American banking collapses ever recorded. Amidst these calamities, news regarding Silvergate&#8217;s deliberate liquidation went overlooked.</p>
<p>On May 23, both the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/enf20230601a1.pdf">instructed</a> Silvergate to devise a liquidation strategy within ten days following the order. The central bank’s directive stipulates that “Within 10 days of approval by the supervisors, the company and the bank, as applicable, shall adopt the self-liquidation plan.”</p>
<p>The statement further adds that upon adoption, they should “promptly implement the self-liquidation plan, and thereafter fully comply with the plan.” Furthermore, the Fed&#8217;s order expounds on Silvergate&#8217;s downfall while highlighting “numerous deficiencies” discovered by regulators. The report also unveils Silvergate&#8217;s association with the now-defunct <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">crypto exchange FTX</a> and its insolvent trading arm, Alameda Research.</p>
<p>As stated, “Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, [Silvergate Bank] experienced significant declines in deposits by its crypto-asset-related customers, triggered in part by the collapse of the crypto-asset exchange FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliated proprietary trading firm Alameda Research LLC, which has resulted in funding and liquidity stress on the bank and a decline in activities that were key sources of revenue.”</p>

The plaintiffs accuse Musk of inflating the price of DOGE by 30% when he changed Twitter&#8217;s blue bird logo &#8220;to the Dogecoin Shiba Inu logo.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Tesla’s CEO Accused of Insider Trading for Swapping Twitter’s Blue Bird for Doge</h2>
<p>On May 31, 2023, a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.581639/gov.uscourts.nysd.581639.74.1.pdf">court filing</a> was submitted in Manhattan alleging that Elon Musk engaged in insider trading and manipulated the price of dogecoin (DOGE). The lawsuit against Musk, titled &#8220;Johnson et al v. Musk et al,&#8221; was initiated last year as a class action in the Southern District of New York. In April of this year, Musk&#8217;s legal team <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-asks-judge-to-dismiss-258b-dogecoin-lawsuit-insists-tweeting-support-for-doge-isnt-unlawful/">attempted</a> to have the case dismissed, with his attorneys arguing that there was no wrongdoing in tweeting about a legitimate currency.</p>
<p>However, investors involved in the class-action lawsuit argue that referring to DOGE as a &#8220;legitimate investment&#8221; is deceptive since they believe it holds no value whatsoever. In their latest amendment, filed on Wednesday, the plaintiffs discuss how Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/twitter-changes-bird-logo-to-picture-of-doge-dogecoin-price-surges-20-after-the-change/">altered</a> the Twitter logo. “The next business day after filing a motion to dismiss in the instant case Musk changed the Twitter blue bird logo to the Dogecoin Shiba Inu logo for three days, spiking the price of Dogecoin 30%,” the recent filing specifies.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit refer to nearly all of Musk&#8217;s actions related to DOGE. Along with highlighting the logo change, the filing also notes that Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1507783547964121088?s=20">discussed</a> altering the logo on March 26, 2022. After contemplating the idea of altering the Twitter logo in 2022, Musk eventually put his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/totally-irresponsible-bitcoin-proponents-express-discontent-over-twitters-doge-logo-change/">plan into action</a>. The class-action complaint also acknowledges the subsequent tweets made by Musk in relation to the logo change.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers state:</p>
<blockquote><p>Musk also sent out a Dogecoin promotional tweet in which a police officer is looking at a driver’s license with the blue Twitter bird logo while the driver, a Shiba Inu dog says, ‘(T)hat’s an old photo,’ implying that the Dogecoin symbol was Twitter’s new logo.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attorneys claim that Musk shared another tweet centered around DOGE on the very same day. They further observe that Twitter reverted back to the blue bird logo on April 6, and insist that it caused dogecoin&#8217;s price to experience a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/biggest-movers-doge-down-8-as-twitter-removes-logo/">sharp decline</a>.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs assert that Musk falsely purports to have altruistic intentions and emphasize in the filing that he has allegedly been advocating for DOGE for a considerable duration. “By June 2022 Musk had already spent more than three years knowingly encouraging the public to invest in dogecoin,” the class-action filing contends.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) snapped a four-day losing streak on Friday, after it was reported that the U.S. Senate had passed the bill to increase the debt ceiling.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This comes ahead of Monday&#x2019;s deadline, which could have resulted in the government running out of cash, had the bill not been approved.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following the news, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to a peak of $27,203.32, which comes a day after dropping to a bottom at $26,574.64.&#13;</p>

Overall, it appears that this move took place after bears were unable to break a long-term floor at $26,500, prompting bulls to reenter the market.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) moved above a floor of its own at 46.00, and is currently tracking at 48.12.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The next test to see if bitcoin can sustain this momentum will come at the $27,500 ceiling. If passed, there is a good chance that price will be above $28,000 this weekend.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved higher in today&#x2019;s session, climbing closer to the $1,900 level in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high at $1,896.62 earlier in the day, less than 24 hours after hitting a low of $1,851.96.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Friday&#x2019;s rally saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency end a two-day downturn, following a bounce from a floor of $1,830 on Thursday.&#13;</p>

From the chart, a bounce on the RSI also took place, with price strength jumping from support at 51.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The next visible point of resistance now appears to be at 59.00, and should <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> reach this point, price will be closer to $1,930.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, ethereum is trading at $1,893.49.&#13;<br />
