<p>Binance US, the United States-based subsidiary of the world’s largest crypto exchange, is reportedly seeking to cut the stake of its owner and founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ). The American crypto exchange is working with Zhao and exploring ways to reduce the crypto billionaire’s controlling stake in the exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance US Hopes To Reduce Regulatory Heat By Reducing CZ’s Stake</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/binance-us-explores-ways-to-cut-founder-changpeng-zhaos-majority-stake" rel="nofollow noopener">The Information</a>, Binance US and Changpeng Zhao have been looking into ways to reduce the latter&#8217;s stake in the crypto exchange for quite some time now. People familiar with the matter revealed that Zhao has been trying to sell part of his stake since as early as last summer. Zhao launched Binance US in 2019, just two years after he founded the more popular international exchange. </p>



<p>The intensifying regulatory scrutiny of Zhao, Binance, and its American arm has prompted the exchange to expedite the divesting process. In light of the recent legal trouble involving <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-doj-probe-russian-sanction/">Binance</a> and Zhao, the executives at Binance US have discussed how limiting the exchange’s relationship with Zhao and the international entity may help take some of the regulatory heat off the American entity. Given that Zhao holds a majority stake in the US exchange, reducing his share may put the exchange in a more favorable position in terms of its relationship with U.S. regulators. </p>



<p>The top management of Binance US believes that Changpeng Zhao’s involvement in the lawsuit that was recently filed by the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may prevent the exchange from securing certain regulatory licenses to ensure smooth operation in the US crypto market. Earlier this year, the CFTC charged Zhao with willful evasion of federal law and operating an illegal digital asset derivatives exchange.</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is helping Ukrainian law enforcement to pursue Russian crypto sanctions evaders.&nbsp;</li><li>Chainalysis is collaborating with agencies from both nations to track individuals suspected of concealing their wealth using crypto.&nbsp;</li><li>Regulators and policymakers in the US have highlighted the potential role of crypto in sanctions evasion and money laundering.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has collaborated with blockchain intelligence firm Chainalysis to guide and train law enforcement agencies in Ukraine to carry out investigations and identify those evading <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-doj-probe-russian-sanction/">crypto sanctions</a> imposed on Russia. News of the international collaboration comes more than a year after Ukraine was invaded by Russia, prompting high-profile Russian nationals to scramble to conceal their assets. </p>



<h2><strong>The U.S. Is Sponsoring Crypto Investigation Tool For Ukraine</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-trains-ukrainian-law-enforcement-to-pursue-russian-crypto-assets-e005ba5?mod=business_minor_pos4" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies and investigators will be part of a week-long training camp that will be held in Frankfurt, Germany. The Internal Revenue Service’s criminal investigation division will provide advanced, in-person training to Ukrainian investigators which will help them track down illicit crypto transactions and financial networks used by sanctioned entities in Russia. </p>



<p>The IRS has been playing an active role in probing potential violations of sanctions imposed in Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February last year. The tax agency is reportedly involved in 23 sanctions-related investigations at the moment. As part of the collaboration with Ukraine, the IRS will provide cyber training to the country’s National Police, the Economic Security Bureau, the Security Service, and the Prosecutor General’s Office.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>One key area is the identification and elimination of centers of support for occupation forces that raise funds for the purchase of things necessary for the war. We often see fundraising campaigns conducted with the use of cryptocurrency.” </p><cite>Yurii Vykhodets, Head of the Cyber Department, National Police of Ukraine</cite></blockquote>



<p>The IRS has revealed that it sponsored Ukraine’s use of Chainalysis Reactor, a crypto investigation tool designed by the blockchain intelligence firm. The agency has provided Ukrainian authorities with licenses to use the product, which will aid in the tracking and identification of those attempting to circumvent Russian sanctions. The collaboration comes in light of multiple warnings issued by regulators and policymakers in the U.S. regarding sanction evasions and money laundering by Russian nationals.</p>

<ul><li>A bankruptcy judge has ruled in favor of returning $300 million to the custodial account holders of BlockFi.&nbsp;</li><li>The judge denied the crypto lender’s customers from laying claim to an additional $375 million in its interest-bearing accounts.&nbsp;</li><li>The ruling comes more than five months after the crypto lender filed for bankruptcy last year.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>A New Jersey Judge ruled earlier today that BlockFi users who held custodial accounts with the crypto lender are entitled to receive nearly $300 million from those custodial accounts. The ruling comes as much-needed positive news for the users who have been stranded since November 2022 when the crypto lender filed for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bittrex-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/">bankruptcy</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>BlockFi Users Can’t Lay Claim To $375 Million From Interest-Bearing Accounts</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/blockfi-crypto-customers-lose-fight-over-disputed-coin-transfers#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Judge Michael Kaplan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey, almost $300 million can be returned to users who held their funds in BlockFi’s custodial wallets. The bankruptcy judge ruled that those assets were not the property of the crypto lender’s bankruptcy estate. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The court finds that all digital assets held by the debtors in custodial omnibus wallets are indeed client property and not the property of the bankruptcy estates, subject, of course, to possible avoidance and clawback rights.”</p><cite>Judge Michael Kaplan, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New Jersey</cite></blockquote>



<p>However, in the matter of the crypto assets worth $375 million lying in BlockFi’s interest-bearing accounts, Judge Kaplan ruled that the bankrupt crypto lender’s customers had no claim to them. The users had tried to transfer those assets to secure digital wallets on November 10, 2023, when BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time the company’s app confirmed the completion of said transfers, but the amount was not reflected in the users&#8217; digital wallets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The user interface did not accurately reflect the transactions,” the judge stated while ruling that all transfers that were initiated by interest-bearing account users after 8:15 pm on November 10, 2022, were completed. Judge Kaplan has permitted BlockFi to cancel all those transactions and retain the crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>DeleteCoinbase trended globally on Twitter following intense backlash from Memecoin Pepe holders.</li><li>Pepe bulls threatening to close their Coinbase accounts trooped out in the thousands on social media.</li><li>The reactions charged out after the company&#8217;s newsletter called Pepe a &#8220;hate symbol&#8221; championed by far-right groups, citing a portion of the Anti-Defamation League’s opinion on Pepe The Frog.</li><li>Speculative traders continue to bask in memecoin mania.</li></ul>



<p>Coinbase <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1656688561742131201?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1656688561742131201?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">apologized</a> to the Pepe memecoin community following roaring social media backlash after a company newsletter painted the frog-themed-meme as a &#8220;hate symbol&#8221;. </p>



<p>The email to users quoted an Anti-Defamation League’s publication on Pepe the Frog and internet symbols propagated by far-right groups. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The [PEPE] token is based on the Pepe the Frog meme, which first surfaced on the internet nearly 20 years ago as a comic-strip character. Over time it has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League,”</p><cite>&#8211; From Coinbase&#8217;s newsletter</cite></blockquote>



<p>Thousands of Pepe bulls flooded crypto Twitter with #DeleteCoinbase posts after the newsletter dropped. Coinbase stock COIN bled as aggrieved Pepe supporters threatened to withdraw their assets and close their accounts on the crypto exchange. Some users also said they would switch to Gemini which supports PEPE trading.</p>



<p>One user highlighted another portion of the same ADL post that contradicts the platform&#8217;s presentation of Pepe meme culture. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why you lying <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@coinbase</a> ?<br>Looks like the only people practicing defamation are you guys by twisting the words of the ADL and I can&#39;t fathom why <a href="https://t.co/UR2AXSpoQE" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/UR2AXSpoQE</a> <a href="https://t.co/VNx2Gnm0yI" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/VNx2Gnm0yI</a></p>&mdash; Agent PEPE 🪙 (@agentgottlieb) <a href="https://twitter.com/agentgottlieb/status/1656458129045962754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>&#8216;We screwed up and we are sorry&#8217; &#8211; Coinbase Chief Attorney</h2>



<p>Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal tweeted to the Pepe community on behalf of the company. &#8220;This did not provide the whole picture of the history of the meme and we apologize to the community.&#8221;, said Grewal about the company&#8217;s newsletter. </p>



<p>The crypto exchange has been the subject of similar backlash on at least two other occasions. </p>



<p>For meme-coiners, the apology is another notch on the belt after a blitzing memecoin mania that has spiked gas fees on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-gas-fees-1-year-high-memecoin/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-gas-fees-1-year-high-memecoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Do Kwon&#8217;s lawyers asked the court to grant supervised bail conditions for both defendants &#8211; the TerraUSD founder and his colleague Han Chang-joon.</li><li>Both Terraform Labs executives were arrested in Montenegro&#8217;s capital of Podgorica while trying to board a private plane bound for Dubai.</li><li>The court will decide on June 16 whether to allow both Kwon and Han to pay $437,000 each as bail.</li><li>Governments from South Korea and the U.S. want to extradite Kwon for financial crimes in Terra&#8217;s $40 billion collapse</li></ul>



<p>&#8220;Not guilty&#8221; TerraUSD designer Do Kwon <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/terrausd-creator-kwon-pleads-not-guilty-to-fake-passport-charges" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-11/terrausd-creator-kwon-pleads-not-guilty-to-fake-passport-charges" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pleaded</a> on Thursday to travel document forgery charges issued by Montenegrin authorities after his arrest. </p>



<p>Kwon was arrested in the country&#8217;s capital city Podgorica while trying to board a private plane bound for Dubai. The Interpol-wanted crypto founder was detained along with Han Chang-joon, another former Terra executive. </p>



<p>Not only did Do Kwon deny <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-indicted-montenegro-for-forgery/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-indicted-montenegro-for-forgery/" rel="noreferrer noopener">charges</a> accusing him of traveling with a fake passport, his lawyers also asked for supervised bail and his release. Branko Andjelic, the defense lawyer, suggested releasing the Terra duo on a bail amount of 400,000 euros which is about $437,240 each.</p>



<p>However, the prosecutor Haris Sabotic, dismissed this proposal, stating that they have sufficient financial resources but no intention of staying in Montenegro.</p>



<p>The court will reconvene on June 16 to decide whether Kwon and Han will be released on bail or not. If denied bail and convicted on forgery charges in a subsequent trial, the pair could face up to five years in prison.</p>



<p>Still, possible Montenegro prison time pales in comparison to the sentence Kwon could serve if tried and convicted in South Korea.</p>



<h2>Korean Prosecutors Argue Jurisdiction For Do Kwon&#8217;s Trial</h2>



<p>Governments from South Korea and the U.S. want to extradite Do Kwon to prosecute him for financial crimes in Terra&#8217;s more than $40 billion collapse. While the U.S. and its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) already declared <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" rel="noreferrer noopener">intent</a> to prosecute, South Korean lead investigators believe it&#8217;s better to try Do Kwon in his home country. </p>



<p>A South Korean court could sentence Do Kwon to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 years behind bars if found guilty of violating the country&#8217;s Capital Markets Acts</a>. </p>



<p>In other news, Kwon might be moving funds around for a lengthy legal showdown with prosecutors from at least three jurisdictions &#8211; Montenegro, South Korea, and the U.S.</p>



<p>Seoul-based Professor Jaewoo Cho who has monitored Kwon&#8217;s wallet activity for over a year noted that one of his <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xda44200196cfb3416bf011eed608f354804337ba" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0xda44200196cfb3416bf011eed608f354804337ba" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">addresses</a> recently moved $7 million in stablecoins. </p>

<p>Already, scammers are moving to leverage Sun&#8217;s public announcement by sending &#8220;shitcoins&#8221; and scam tokens to his wallet, Peckshield alerted users. This creates the false notion that Sun himself is buying these tokens. Scammers often try to ride these situations to deceive users and make off with their tokens or &#8220;rug&#8221; unsuspecting victims by pulling liquidity from these speculative coins. </p>

<h2>Memecoin Frenzy Continues</h2>



<p>Memecoin season is not an uber-rare period for crypto participants and observers. Over the years, tokens like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have taken markets by storm, building billions in market cap and tempting &#8220;degenerate&#8221; traders or degens to chase the next 100x coin. </p>



<p>While trading these tokens is obviously risky and heavy losses can happen, the allure of making substantial profits seems a motivating factor for some traders. PEPE coin on Ethereum for instance which trades for a fraction of a dollar peaked at a $1.5 billion market cap before dipping to around $600 million. </p>



<p>Crypto&#8217;s two largest blockchains &#8211; <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum &#8211; recorded increased on-chain activity in recent weeks amid this year&#8217;s memecoin mania. For both blockchains, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-gas-fees-1-year-high-memecoin/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-gas-fees-1-year-high-memecoin/" rel="noreferrer noopener">transaction fees</a> hit two-year highs. </p>

<ul><li>The Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital.&nbsp;</li><li>The subpoena is in relation to an investigation into Marathon’s data center in Montana, U.S.</li><li>The SEC previously subpoenaed the Montana-based facility to get access to its documents and communications.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-cease-desist-coinme-4-million-fine/">SEC</a>) reportedly subpoenaed Nevada-based Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital Holdings last month. The securities regulator issued the subpoena to the second-largest publicly traded Bitcoin miner in the United States in relation to several matters including transactions between Marathon and its affiliated entities. </p>



<h2><strong>Marathon Digital’s Montana Data Center Under Scrutiny</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/bitcoin-miner-marathon-receives-another-subpoena-from-sec" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Marathon Digital received the subpoena from the SEC on April 10, 2023. The subpoena was in relation to the Bitcoin mining giant’s data center facility based in Hardin, Montana. Marathon said in a statement that the federal regulator’s investigation may be to determine if the Bitcoin miner may have violated federal securities law.  The company is reportedly cooperating with the SEC in this matter. </p>



<p>The latest move from the Securities and Exchange comes more than two years after Marathon Digital received a similar subpoena on September 30, 2021, by way of which the SEC sought to gain access to the bitcoin miner’s internal documents and communications concerning the Hardin, Montana-based data center facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier today, Marathon Digital released the company’s <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1313/marathon-digital-holdings-reports-first-quarter-2023-results" rel="nofollow noopener">financial reports</a> for the quarter ending March 31, 2023. The first quarter of the year saw the Bitcoin miner shrink its net loss to $7.2 million as compared to a net loss of $23 in Q1, 2022. The company’s latest loss per share came in at $0.05, a massive reduction from the $0.12 in the first quarter of last year. </p>



<p>As for BTC revenues, Marathon recorded gains on the sale of bitcoin of $17.6 million in the quarter in line with the previously reported plan of selling bitcoin to fund operating costs. At the time of writing, Marathon Digital’s share price was changing hands at $10.22, up nearly 9% over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Royal Group plans to deploy more capital into the crypto industry and commodities, Bloomberg reported citing people familiar with the matter.</li><li>The investment firm led by United Arab Emirates National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan has poured billions into a short position on US stock on the back of recession concerns.</li><li>Royal Group&#8217;s portfolio shift follows the UAE&#8217;s crypto hub plans and regulatory discussions with entities like Coinbase.</li></ul>



<p>Royal Group, an investment firm led by top a UAE royal, shifted its billion-dollar portfolio toward cryptocurrencies and commodities after accumulating a massive short position in U.S. stocks. </p>



<p>The change in investment strategy comes as Royal Group harbors concerns over a possible recession in America&#8217;s economy, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/uae-s-royal-group-shorts-us-stocks-on-global-recession-fears?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/uae-s-royal-group-shorts-us-stocks-on-global-recession-fears?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> citing individuals familiar with the matter. </p>



<p>America&#8217;s looming recession seems to have dampened the group&#8217;s faith in equities, leading to a big bet against the U.S. economy. This has in turn strengthened the prospect of digital assets and commodities as Abu Dhabi&#8217;s top investment firm plans to deploy more cash in the nascent industry. </p>



<h2>The UAE&#8217;s Crypto Hub Plans </h2>



<p>Digital asset investment plans from Abu Dhabi&#8217;s richest investment venture align with the UAE&#8217;s plans for a global digital asset hub. The United Arab Emirates Prime Minister announced strategic moves towards encouraging crypto businesses and standardizing the industry. </p>



<p>Emirates like Abu Dhabi and Dubai are arguably at the forefront of this campaign. Dubai was one of the first jurisdictions in the world to open a regulatory agency dedicated to crypto rule-making and oversight. </p>



<p>Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) also published a rule book introducing a licensing regime and framework for digital asset service providers, one of the first of its kind. </p>



<p>Entities like Binance and Crypto Dot Com have received provisional permission to set up shop in one of the Emirates. Recently, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase and its CEO Brian Armstrong</a> flew to meet with policymakers amid an exodus in the U.S. thanks to stiffling enforcement action and unclear crypto rules. </p>

<p>The court order issued on behalf of Zhu bars Hayes from communicating with him or his co-founder Davies &#8220;by any means&#8221;. Hayes cannot publish any messages that threaten, abuse, or insult 3AC&#8217;s former executives, per Harassment Court Judge Sandra Looi Ai Lin&#8217;s restraining order. </p>



<p>In April, Hayes demanded his &#8220;f****** money&#8221; after pointing to &#8220;big money&#8221; raised by Zhu and Davies from the Bahrain Sovereign Wealth Fund. The money mentioned is $6 million that Hayes says the Three Arrows founders owe him. </p>

<h2>Hayes Trolls 3AC Execs From Home Detention, OPNX Launches</h2>



<p>Hayes&#8217; 2022 was not absent of controversy on the back of federal prosecution for loose anti-money laundering (AML) checks at BitMEX. In February 2022, Hayes pleaded guilty to the charges and was served six months of home arrest instead of a prison sentence. </p>



<p>It was during this home detention that 3AC collapsed and Hayes began a barrage of social media posts trolling Zhu, Davies, and their hedge fund. </p>



<p>Zhu and Davies also started a new crypto venture in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubai-vara-blasts-3ac-opnx/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dubai-vara-blasts-3ac-opnx/" rel="noreferrer noopener">OPNX</a> despite leading 3AC into a hole $1 billion deep at least. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A trader splurged almost $1 million buying Bitcoin Inscription #5232025 amid growing debates about congestion on the BTC network.</li><li>This particular BTC Inscription holds 50,000 ORDI coins, the native asset of Ordinals Protocol which was created by developer Casey Rodarmor.</li><li>ORDI was introduced earlier this year using the BRC-20 standard after developer Rodarmor designed a protocol for embedding digital data like art on every satoshi and pseudonymous builder Domo unveiled a token format akin to ERC-20 on Ethereum.</li></ul>



<p>A trader spent 35 BTC buying Bitcoin Inscription #5232025 amid growing debates about congestion on the BTC network due to BRC-20 memecoins and a surge in text-based NFTs issued on crypto&#8217;s largest blockchain.</p>



<p>This particular BTC Inscription holds 50,000 ORDI coins, the native asset of Ordinals Protocol which was created by developer Casey Rodarmor.</p>



<p>The scoop <a href="https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1656212409835716608?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/DegenerateNews/status/1656212409835716608?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cost</a> over $960,000 in Bitcoin at current market prices, possibly the highest sale for an Inscription since the asset debuted earlier in January 2023. Since then over 5 million inscriptions have been minted on Bitcoin&#8217;s blockchain, a surge that BTC purists claim has drastically congested the network. </p>



<p>Dune Analytics data showed that over 4 million of these Bitcoin Inscriptions are text-based. Less than half a million contain visual digital data in png format or what some might consider NFT art. These Inscriptions are made possible by using the Ordinals ProtocoL developed and launched by Casey Rodarmor. </p>



<p>Ordinals as they are commonly called by crypto participants have also racked up a fortune in fees. Users have spent over $29 million in fees experimenting with ordinals and attaching data to satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. </p>

<h2>Average Fees Skyrocket On Bitcoin Inscription Activity </h2>



<p>The rise of Ordinals and a token standard akin to ERC-20 on Ethereum seems to have sparked a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/" rel="noreferrer noopener">tussle</a> over block space on Bitcoin&#8217;s network. Indeed, the increased demand on BTC&#8217;s blockchain led to an uptick in transaction fees. Fees on BTC hit over $20 on average, a two-year high per on-chain data. </p>



<p>Rising average fees and a flood of BRC-20 tokens have formed a crescendo around arguments for and against ordinals. On one side, BTC bulls like Michael Saylor &#8211; whose company holds billions in Bitcoin &#8211; insist that Ordinals could serve as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/w1PRsS4SyUc?feature=share" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/live/w1PRsS4SyUc?feature=share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">catalyst</a>&#8221; for adoption. </p>



<p>BTC purists and some developers oppose the view, moving to sink NFTs and altcoins on BTC&#8217;s network. </p>
