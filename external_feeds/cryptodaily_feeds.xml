			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Hovering Around 30716:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 4 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to consolidate recent gains early in the Asian session as the pair traded as high as the 30799 area before yielding some advances, a move that represented a test of the 76.4% retracement of the depreciating range from 31277 to 29417.14.&nbsp; The recent sell-off to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This decline occurred after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30486.99 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30547.43.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Uwerx is a new project seeking to reconceptualize the gig economy with its revolutionary features. This accounts for its presale success and the increased adoption it has been gaining. Due to these, analysts predict a bright future for the project, which has shown strong potential to keep soaring in the crypto winter. </p>
<p class="s7">On the other hand, Monolith (TKN) is struggling to beat bearish sentiments as the bears continue to dominate over the token. This article looks at Monolith&rsquo;s (TKN) predictions, what Uwerx is all about, and why you should quickly become a WERX holder.</p>
<p class="s9">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
What The Charts Say About Monolith (TKN)
<p class="s7">The crypto market considers Monolith (TKN) a near-dead crypto as it has only recorded a few transactions or trading activities for a long time. This has caused Monolith (TKN) to see a huge plunge without signs of recovery. </p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) currently dines with the bear as it has remained at the bottom, with predictions showing it might record only a negligible price increase. Monolith (TKN) has declined by almost 5% in the past week, and further decline is imminent. </p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) is seeing increased selling pressure as most token holders quickly sell their tokens and move to more active platforms.</p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) Launched Its Visa Debit Card</p>
<p class="s7">Monolith (TKN) is a decentralized banking powered by Ethereum (ETH), enabling users to use its Visa debit card to store or spend their tokens globally. Monolith (TKN) provides a DeFicontract wallet where users can store their tokens and use the Visa debit card to make in-app crypto purchases. </p>
<p class="s9">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Continues Smashing Through Its Presale
<p class="s7">Uwerx's surging presale has been marveling, quickly reaching its final stage, stage 5. This exceeded initial predictions, and due to demands, WERX allocation for the presale was increased to 427,500,000 (57%). Stage 5 has 72,500,000 WERX available, and the total supply of WERX is 750,000,000.</p>
<p class="s7">The WERX price increase is more surprising. WERX started trading at $0.005 but is now at $0.047725, with more price increases unavoidable. Also, the WERX launch price was increased to $0.095 - $0.115 due to the token&rsquo;s rising value.</p>
<p class="s7">There is a 15% purchase bonus to increase users&rsquo; profits, and the presale ends on July 31. </p>
Uwerx (WERX) Has Leverage Over Other Freelancing Platforms
<p class="s7">Global gig workers are expected to reach 78 million in 2023. Hence, Uwerx is making significant moves to increase adoption and stand out from centralized platforms. It brings blockchain technology and a 1% service fee, features yet to be seen in freelancing. There is also the UwerxVault which promotes user rewards and engagement.</p>
<p class="s7">Its platform&rsquo;s Alpha version launched a few months back and has been gaining traction with more features added. The platform&rsquo;s features now include the Initial Step of Job Creation, My Activity Page, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Hiring Dashboard Page, Logging In and Sign-Up Pages, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, and Forgot Password.</p>
<p class="s7">The Job Application Page was remodeled to the Post Job and Apply Page to quicken users' job applications. New features like the Tools and Client and Freelancer Dashboards are in the works. </p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx will transition to the Beta version, which is now in the works so users can test the platform themselves. InterFi Network and SolidProof have performed audit approvals on Uwerxto ensure its security. The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups.</p>
<p class="s7">The team's agile methodology to release the project in bits and modify the platform based on users' feedback has also contributed to the project&rsquo;s success. They are eager to hear from the community, and feedback can be emailed to feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
<p class="s7">To show their dedication to users, the team&rsquo;s token allocation is now only 7% following their decision to reduce it. For sustainability, they will forfeit ownership of the smart contract once the project becomes listed on centralized exchanges. Also, they began a nine-month liquidity lock on their tokens to prevent rug pulls. This started on June 7, after the 82.8% vote it received from the community to start immediately. </p>
<p class="s7">A Test Airdrop will be performed to verify wallet addresses for users, for which 98.2% of the community is in support.</p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx will be a force to reckon with in the freelancing industry. To do that, you have to become a WERX holder. It is best to do so now and maximize the 15% purchase bonus. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Central bank digital currencies are due to be rolled out in many countries across the world. The vast majority of people have no idea what is coming and how it will affect them.</p>
From knowledge to ignorance
<p>Poverty and repression make people much more aware politically, and conversations are always taking place in cafes, bars, and back rooms, where the people are accustomed to a government that is in many ways their enemy.</p>
<p>In more recent history this has been the case in countries in Latin America for example, where dictators ruled with a fist of iron, safe in the knowledge that the US with its CIA operatives had their back.</p>
<p>In Western countries today the same surely cannot be said. Ask 1,000 people on the streets in towns and cities across the US, UK, and European countries for their views on central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and their implications for zero privacy and total control, and probably nigh on all of them wouldn&rsquo;t have the foggiest clue what is going on, or that the stakes are as high as they&rsquo;ve ever been.</p>
A dearth of proper debate
<p>It might be an extremely unpopular opinion, but much like alcohol was fed to indigenous peoples to keep them quiet while their land and resources were being pillaged, the same could be said of beer and football in today&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>The problem isn&rsquo;t just this either. Even if the average Joe or Jane thought there was something amiss and wanted to educate themselves on the situation - where would they go?</p>
<p>Television and mainstream media do not contain anything that might be ascribed to be of a serious political nature. With geopolitics and the economic situation in the most desperate state they have been, arguably for decades, no proper mainstream debate is allowed to happen.</p>
Still time to get educated
<p>So CBDCs are going to land onto the least prepared and educated populace on the matter that it&rsquo;s possible to get. The powers that be, governments, and banks, with the help of the mainstream media, have successfully kept things under wraps thus far, and it&rsquo;s only a short matter of time before CBDCs are upon us.</p>
<p>There is even the narrative out there that CBDCs will be good for you. They will speed up settlement and enable easy cross-border payments. But as for taking away your freedom to transact with privacy, or the imposition of a social credit system, well they aren&rsquo;t as important in the eyes of the bankers.</p>
<p>All is not lost though. There are still places to find out and educate oneself on the monetary system, CBDCs, and perhaps the solution to it all, in Bitcoin. This kind of information can still be found on the internet, and on social media channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If CBDCs are allowed to be imposed on citizens then banks will have the power to cut anybody off from their money, much like has already happened recently to Nigel Farage, but this time with just a tap of a central bank keyboard. Time to educate oneself.</p>

<p>So CBDCs are going to land onto the least prepared and educated populace on the matter that it&rsquo;s possible to get. The powers that be, governments, and banks, with the help of the mainstream media, have successfully kept things under wraps thus far, and it&rsquo;s only a short matter of time before CBDCs are upon us.</p>
<p>There is even the narrative out there that CBDCs will be good for you. They will speed up settlement and enable easy cross-border payments. But as for taking away your freedom to transact with privacy, or the imposition of a social credit system, well they aren&rsquo;t as important in the eyes of the bankers.</p>
<p>All is not lost though. There are still places to find out and educate oneself on the monetary system, CBDCs, and perhaps the solution to it all, in Bitcoin. This kind of information can still be found on the internet, and on social media channels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If CBDCs are allowed to be imposed on citizens then banks will have the power to cut anybody off from their money, much like has already happened recently to Nigel Farage, but this time with just a tap of a central bank keyboard. Time to educate oneself.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin mining is an intriguing and complex subject, one that is central to the operations of the burgeoning BTC network. It plays a pivotal role in the generation of new coins as well as it when it comes to the validation of individual transactions. This article provides a detailed overview of the process, the principles on which it operates, different mining methods, its environmental implications, and future prospects.</p>
An Insight into the Process
<p>Bitcoin mining, as detailed in Satoshi Nakamoto's seminal whitepaper, performs two critical roles within the Bitcoin network. Firstly, as mentioned above, it contributes to the creation of new BTC, and secondly, it enables the verification and addition of transactions to the blockchain, i.e. a decentralized digital ledger that records all transactions taking place within the Bitcoin network.</p>
<p>Miners use powerful computing systems to solve complex mathematical problems in a competitive bid to produce a valid block containing a group of confirmed transactions. Once a miner successfully solves a problem, they add the new block to the blockchain and, as a reward, receive newly minted BTC and a portion of the transaction fees. The Bitcoin mining process effectively protects the network from potential fraud or malicious activities by making alterations to transaction history or Bitcoin forgery nearly impossible.</p>
The Fundamentals of Bitcoin Mining
<p>Bitcoin mining operates on the basis of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. Here, miners, with the help of powerful computing systems, carry out intricate calculations to produce a hash. The goal is to generate a hash that meets or falls below a specific target set by the network.</p>
<p>Over the years, the hardware used for Bitcoin mining has evolved significantly. Initially, miners used standard consumer-grade computers, but today, they leverage Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). These specialized devices provide far superior performance and efficiency compared to their predecessors.</p>
<p>Another crucial aspect of Bitcoin mining is the "halving" process. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining a new block is reduced by 50%, which inherently decreases the inflation rate of Bitcoin. This process contributes to Bitcoin's scarcity and, subsequently, its value.</p>
The Different Facets of Bitcoin Mining
<p>As Bitcoin mining continues to evolve, different mining methods have emerged. As pointed out by MaskEX Academy, a one-stop platform for all things crypto devised by cryptocurrency exchange MaskEX, these methods cater to the various needs and preferences of miners &mdash; such as solo mining, mining pools, and mining farms.</p>
<p>To elaborate, solo mining offers miners the advantage of retaining the entire mining reward and transaction fees, but it often requires high computational power. Conversely, mining pools represent a group of miners who come together and bring their resources together. They then share the rewards proportionally based on the computational power contributed by each. Lastly, mining farms are large-scale operations that involve massive capital investment and continuous maintenance.</p>
Environmental Considerations
<p>Bitcoin mining's high energy consumption has garnered much debate regarding its environmental sustainability. The massive computational power required for the PoW mechanism often results in high energy usage, contributing to increased carbon emissions. However, sustainable solutions are being explored to mitigate these impacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, some mining operations are leveraging renewable energy sources, while others use carbon credits to offset emissions. Some innovative approaches even repurpose the waste heat generated by the mining process.</p>
The Profitability Equation
<p>The profitability of Bitcoin mining is dependent on a variety of factors. These include the efficiency of mining hardware, the cost of electricity, and the current Bitcoin market value. As an article by MaskEX Academy notes, the efficiency of mining hardware is a critical factor, as older, less efficient hardware may not justify its operational costs. Furthermore, electricity prices, being a primary operational expense, can significantly impact profitability as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, the hash rate, a measure of a miner's computational power, directly affects the probability of successfully mining a block and receiving the associated rewards. Therefore, balancing these aspects is crucial for the long-term viability of a mining operation.</p>
A Peek into the Future
<p>The future of Bitcoin mining is set to face several challenges. With the Bitcoin network's difficulty level increasing and block rewards decreasing due to halving, profit margins are expected to shrink. As competition intensifies, the industry could see a trend toward centralization, where only well-funded entities can maintain competitiveness. This potential shift could threaten the security and decentralization that Bitcoin upholds, possibly pushing Bitcoin proponents to explore alternative consensus mechanisms.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges, the BTC mining still holds immense potential. As MaskEX Academy points out, the industry's evolution is "a testament to the relentless pursuit of progress and the unwavering belief in the power of decentralization." With continued innovation and growth, Bitcoin mining stands as a beacon of resilience and adaptability in the ever-evolving blockchain landscape.</p>]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[What is an Fang Gang?
<p>Fang Gang are a non-fungible tokens collection built on the Ethereum network launched in 28 August, 2021. 8,886 items of the Fang Gang collection can now be viewed at OpenSea.</p>
How many owners does the Fang Gang collection have?
<p>The total number of owners has reached 4141 within 673 days since its release.</p>
NFT Collection Fang Gang Price and Sales
<p>The market capitalization of Fang Gang NFT collection is 202.56 ETH. Since created the Fang Gang, 23,226 collections sales were made at an average price of 0.27 ETH (~$524.42 at the time of writing). This created a total volume in 6,212.415 ETH. The floor price of Fang Gang is 0.0211 and the 30-day trading volume is kept at 2.50 ETH. The payment tokens of the Fang Gang collection are ETH, DAI, WETH, USDC, APE.</p>
Why are some NFTs expensive and others not?
<p>NFTs are very new to the blockchain ecosystem and are still in their infancy. It is an emerging market meaning there is no historical data or precedence that can assist in determining the value of an NFT. NFT projects that started at the beginning of the market boom have garnered legitimacy purely because they had a first-mover advantage. These &ldquo;established&rdquo; NFT projects have also had the opportunity to improve and learn from the issues that have plagued the NFT market and have, in such a way, made themselves more valuable. When the NFT boom took flight, many people realized profits beyond their wildest dreams, creating a space for opportunists to take advantage of the market growth. While some NFTs can be considered digital art, created by an artist who recognizes the value NFTs can add to the creative space, others have been made purely out of greed and a need to exploit the immense market growth. NFT projects that stem from greed and exploitation often have no value and are ultimately garbage.</p>
Is the Fang Gang Collection Over or Underpriced?
<p>It is difficult to determine whether NFTs from the Fang Gang collection is overpriced or underpriced. Making such an assessment will become clearer when the market for NFTs and metaverses develops more actively. The price is also influenced by how the Fang Gang collection is developed and promoted by its creators and community.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has expressed his sympathy and concerns for Solana and other cryptocurrencies in the context of the SEC&rsquo;s crackdown on the crypto markets.&nbsp;</p>
Buterin Feels Sorry For Rival Solana&nbsp;
<p>In the midst of the ongoing regulatory crackdown on cryptocurrencies by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has extended his sympathy to Solana, a rival blockchain platform, in light of the legal actions taken by the SEC against Binance and Coinbase, both renowned cryptocurrency exchanges globally. Buterin voiced his concerns over what he perceived as an unfair approach to crypto regulation, labeling the SEC's actions as unjust.</p>
Buterin Questions SEC&rsquo;s Moves
<p>Buterin's comments were made during an online discussion with Matt Huang, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Paradigm, a crypto-focused venture capital firm. While the SEC's actions are aimed at protecting investors, Buterin believes that the approach lacks nuance and could impede the progress of the industry as a whole. When asked how he felt about the United States&rsquo;s crypto policy, Buterin expressed his sympathy, saying,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one comment I'll make is that I feel bad that Solana and other projects are getting hit in this way. They don&rsquo;t deserve it, and if Ethereum ends up &lsquo;winning&rsquo; through all other blockchains getting kicked off exchanges, that&rsquo;s not an honorable way to win, and in the long term probably isn&rsquo;t even a victory.&rdquo;</p>

SEC Names SOL As Unregistered Security
<p>Solana, which has gained significant attention and experienced rapid growth in recent times, is among the projects facing increased scrutiny from the SEC. The regulatory agency has been actively investigating projects in the crypto sector to ensure compliance with existing securities laws. It has accused the major crypto firms of Binance and Coinbase of offering unregistered securities to the public. Naturally, these legal actions have also affected other major tokens, like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Algorand (ALGO), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos (ATOM), Sandbox (SAND), Axie infinity (AXS), Decentraland (MANA), BNB (BNB), and others.&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;Centralized World Imposing On Decentralized Space&rdquo;
<p>Buterin's sympathy for Solana reflects a broader sentiment within the crypto community, with many expressing concerns about the regulatory uncertainty faced by various projects. Industry participants are calling for clear guidelines and regulations that promote innovation and safeguard investor interests without stifling technological advancements. Buterin underscores that the crypto firms need to stand united as the true opponent is not each other but the &ldquo;rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on the decentralized space.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

Industry participants are calling for clear guidelines and regulations that promote innovation and safeguard investor interests without stifling technological advancements. Buterin underscores that the crypto firms need to stand united as the true opponent is not each other but the &ldquo;rapidly expanding centralized world that is imposing itself on the decentralized space.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Singapore&rsquo;s Monetary Authority (MAS) announced it would require crypto exchanges to keep customer assets in a trust before the end of the year. </p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said in a statement on Monday that the country will require cryptocurrency exchange to keep customer assets in a trust before the end of the year.</p>
<p>BNN Bloomberg and The Strait Times report the new requirement is part of efforts to ensure funds are safeguarded following the implosion of the FTX crypto exchange in November 2022.</p>
Singapore To Ban Staking and Lending for Retail Investors
<p>The MAS said there is support across the board for digital payment token (DPT) service providers to safeguard customer funds. The Strait Times reports under the proposed rules, firms must conduct daily reconciliation of customers&rsquo; assets, maintain proper records, and must maintain access and operational controls to customers&rsquo; DPTs in the region.</p>
<p>According to reports, Singapore will also continue with a proposal to ban lending and staking activities for retail investors. The monetary authority stated lending and staking activities are unsuitable for the retail public.</p>
<p>The MAS said in a statement:</p>

<p>Regulations alone cannot protect consumers from all losses, given the extremely high risk and speculative nature of digital payment token trading.</p>

<p>The authority said crypto firms could continue to offer such services to their institutional and accredited investors.</p>
Singapore Tightens Crypto Regulations
<p>Singapore&rsquo;s measures to protect retail investors come after its public consultation in October 2022.</p>
<p>The city-state has, for a long time, pushed for strengthened crypto regulations. The MAS announced in 2022 that its plans to consult and revise its proposed regulations which will further tighten retail-investor access to cryptocurrencies.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Another weekly close above $30,000 means bitcoin is still primed to break through the all-important $31,000 resistance.</p>
Bitcoin has more in the tank
<p>Another week passes and bitcoin is still at the locked gate that provides a potential quick passage to $36,000 and beyond. This is the second major attempt at this resistance, and with more in the tank this time, bitcoin could do the business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More in the tank&rdquo; points to the fact that momentum is on bitcoin&rsquo;s side this time. When the king of the cryptocurrencies last came up against the $31,000 barrier it was on the back of a surge from $20,000, and all the momentum had evaporated by the time it reached the most important level.</p>
Momentum indicators move higher
<p>Currently bitcoin is at resistance and is moving sideways before potentially breaking through. On the longer time frame of the weekly, the Stochastic RSI (momentum indicator) is getting to around half way up, and heading higher - an extremely bullish signal.</p>
<p>Going into lower time frames, both the 8-hour and 12-hour have bottomed and are heading higher, and the daily time frame is now on the way down.</p>
<p>Back in April when bitcoin was at these levels all these time frames were at the overbought level and of course, with bitcoin having arrived at resistance in exhaustion, there was only one way to go and that was back down.</p>
<p>Another reason for optimism is that bitcoin has broken through the top of the bull flag it has formed since that last April rejection. Granted, it hasn&rsquo;t shot out of the top and headed higher straight away. Instead, it has followed a process of going back inside the flag and then just sideways action now that it has emerged again.</p>
Is bitcoin such a risk asset?
<p>Perhaps bitcoin is just waiting for that particular bullish news that will break the inertia and send it rocketing upwards. All the same, nothing much has changed in traditional finance, and the much feared recession (that could be worse than recession) is still that black cloud that all can see on the horizon.</p>
<p>Some analysts might say that in a heavy market crash bitcoin is bound to be the first to drop precipitously as investors divest themselves of their risk assets first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it could very much be argued that even if this were the case, bitcoin is the scarcest asset on the planet and the most uncorrelated to all the assets inside of the traditional financial system. In such a chaotic mess with governments going to the money printers to try and prop everything up, bitcoin is likely to be extremely valuable property indeed.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Poly Network has fallen victim to another exploit after hackers manipulated a smart contract function on the cross-chain bridge protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poly Network confirmed the hack, adding that it would be temporarily suspending all services.&nbsp;</p>
57 Crypto Assets Impacted&nbsp;
<p>The attack on Poly Network occurred on the 2nd of July, resulting in the hacker being able to issue billions of tokens seemingly out of thin air to generate a profit. Poly Network confirmed the attack through its official Twitter handle, stating that it had become the latest DeFi entity to fall victim to a hack, adding that it was temporarily suspending services. The update also stated that the exploit had impacted 57 crypto assets based on ten blockchains, including BNB Chain, Ethereum, Avalanche, Polygon, OKx, Heco, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While it isn&rsquo;t clear how much has been stolen in the attack, PeckShield has reported that the attacker had transferred at least $5 million worth of crypto from the cross-chain bridge. In an update issued on the 3rd of July, the Poly Network team stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have already initiated communication with centralized exchanges and law enforcement agencies and sought their assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The team further advised token holders to withdraw liquidity and unlock their liquidity provider tokens.&nbsp;</p>
Poly Network Hack Breakdown&nbsp;
<p>According to DeFi security analyst @0xArhat, the exploit stemmed from a smart contract vulnerability that allowed the hackers to create a malicious parameter that contained a fake validator signature and block header. The smart contract accepted this malicious parameter, allowing the hacker to bypass the verification process and issue tokens from Poly Network&rsquo;s Ethereum pool to their address on other chains such as BNB Chain, Polygon, and Metis. The same procedure was repeated for other chains, resulting in a massive pile-up of tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to @0xArhat, the hacker&rsquo;s wallet held over $42 billion worth of tokens at one point. However, the hacker could only convert and steal a fraction of the tokens. The attackers had minted 24 billion Binance USD (BUSD) and BNB on the Metis blockchain, 999 trillion Shiba Inu (SHIB) on the Heco blockchain, and millions of other tokens on other prominent networks such as Polygon and Avalanche.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way, the hacker was able to mint billions of tokens on various blockchains that did not exist before and transfer them to their own wallet addresses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dedaub has dubbed the latest hack to hit Poly Network as the &ldquo;34 billion Poly Network hack.&rdquo; He also highlighted several weaknesses in the protocol&rsquo;s multi-sig, adding that it only had a simple 3 of 4 multi-signature arrangement for over two years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Getting to the bottom of the &ldquo;34 billion&rdquo; Poly network hack with a technical postmortem. TL;DR Poly network had a simple 3 of 4 multisig arrangement over 2 years! Looking at the final event, we found that the private keys to the addresses marked were compromised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the blockchain security solutions provider, the attack was not complex, as no logic bugs were exploited. Poly Network itself was slow to respond, eventually costing the platform $5.5 million in stolen crypto. However, a lack of liquidity in a majority of the tokens in question prevented further significant losses.&nbsp;</p>
Binance, Polygon Reassure Users&nbsp;
<p>Following the attack on the Poly Network, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao stated that the exploit does not impact Binance users, adding that it did not support deposits from the Poly Network. Polygon&rsquo;s Mudit Gupta stated on Twitter,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poly Network got rekt again, allegedly because of compromised hot keys. It&rsquo;s going to keep happening until our industry changes our approach to security. Smart contract audits only scratch the surface. Ps Poly network has NOTHING to do with Polygon.&rdquo;</p>

Poly Network&rsquo;s Previous Hack&nbsp;
<p>This was the second time a major hack hit the Poly Network. In August 2021, the protocol was hit by attackers who managed to drain a then-record $600 million through the alleged leak of a private key that was used to sign a cross-chain message. As a result, the Poly Network lost $264 million in ETH, $250 million in BSC, and $85 million in MATIC. However, Poly Network later updated that the hacker had returned the stolen funds, with the hacker claiming the attack was orchestrated for fun, and even offered the anonymous hacker a job as the Chief Security Advisor to the protocol, adding that it won&rsquo;t be pressing any charges.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Orbiting 30491 Technicals:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 3 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought fresh technical guidance early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 30491.62 area, representing the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 29539.57 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;The pair&rsquo;s recent depreciation to the 29417.14 area represented a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; The decline occurred after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and increased the possibility of a test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.9%, and the pair is now up approximately 83.4% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Labs has announced plans to introduce Layer 2 (L2) interoperability for its ENS domains during a community call on June 28.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The implementation aims to improve performance, scalability, and cost efficiency for users managing their ENS domains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The decentralized domain name system is set to implement off-chain resolvers, leveraging an ENS off-chain registrar contract and the services of Coinbase&rsquo; cb.id, Lens Protocol, and OptiNames on the Optimism network. This step comes as the L2 ecosystem continues to witness an influx of projects and protocols.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to L2Beat data, the total value of assets locked on L2 service providers has surged by over 190% in the past year, standing at $9.78 billion at the time of writing. Arbitrum leads the market with a 60% share and a total value locked (TVL) of $5.87 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">ENS domain name registrations experienced robust growth in Q2 2021. Dune Analytics data shows monthly ENS domain name registrations totalling 79,463 last quarter. June, marked by a significant drop in gas fees on the Ethereum Network, recorded the highest number of registrations during the quarter with 35,932 ENS name registrations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">While .eth name registrations ended Q2 with a surge, primary ENS name registrations saw a notable decline. A primary ENS name is a unique domain name registered and associated with an Ethereum address on the ENS platform. Moreover, ENS registered a cumulative profit of $4.8 million between April 1 and June 30, despite a 21% dip in revenue during this period. ENS&rsquo; annualized revenue has fallen by 5.11%, as per Token Terminal.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The daily price performance chart of ENS showed an increase in ENS token accumulation since mid-June, along with a corresponding 22% value growth. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Money Flow Index (MFI) indicators were on an upward trajectory, indicating a bullish run.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) plays a pivotal role in enhancing the user-friendliness of the Ethereum network by replacing complex blockchain addresses with easy-to-remember names. With the latest move of introducing Layer 2 interoperability, ENS Labs takes a significant stride towards improving the operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness of managing ENS domains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This development arrives amidst a growing trend of Layer 2 adoption across the blockchain sphere, an effort to counteract the scalability and performance bottlenecks often associated with the Ethereum mainnet. By enabling Layer 2 solutions, ENS is not only keeping pace with industry trends but also reaffirming its commitment to user experience and network efficiency.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Crypto infrastructure developer Polygon Labs has proposed a new, four-layered architectural design for its upcoming "Polygon 2.0" project.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The announcement, made on June 29, offers a detailed look at the planned infrastructure, which comprises four unique "layers" working in tandem to secure and scale networks built on the protocol. With a bridge aggregator set to make transactions &ldquo;near-instant and atomic,&rdquo; Polygon 2.0 is poised to dramatically reshape the crypto industry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon 2.0: A Four-Layered Approach</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The new proposal outlines the foundation of the project, the &ldquo;staking layer,&rdquo; which is currently in existence. This layer comprises a "validator manager" contract on Ethereum, along with an additional "chain manager" contract for each Polygon chain. Future Polygon chains will be able to form by launching new chain manager contracts on Ethereum.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Built on top of this staking layer will be an "interoperability layer," providing bridges to connect each Polygon chain via Ethereum. This layer will also feature an aggregator that combines individual zero-knowledge proofs from each bridge into one proof before sending it to Ethereum, enabling &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; bridge transactions and &ldquo;dramatically reducing Ethereum gas consumption for proof verification,&rdquo; according to the team.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Labs elaborates in its announcement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe this proposal can and should direct all Polygon protocol development efforts moving forward, serving both as the conceptual North Star and the formal development framework."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The two remaining layers of Polygon 2.0 will include the current execution layer, which relies upon the Erigon Ethereum client, and a "proving layer" that will standardize the zero-knowledge-proof process across all Polygon chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Future-Proof Infrastructure</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon isn't the only network attempting to transform into a multi-chain ecosystem. Other developers like zkSync Era and Optimism are working on similar strategies, but Polygon 2.0's unique four-layered approach sets it apart.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a statement, the team promises more information on each layer in the future, stating:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Polygon 2.0 consists of four protocol layers, each enabling an important process within the network: Staking Layer, Interop Layer, Execution Layer, Proving Layer."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the proposal now public, the network&rsquo;s validators will need to approve it. Polygon 2.0's vision, as expressed by the development team, is to establish &ldquo;the value layer&rdquo; of the internet, promising a more secure and scalable network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Just as the internet is an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing information, Polygon 2.0 seeks to serve as an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing value.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Parallels With Early Internet Innovations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With a vision of enabling an "Internet of Blockchains", Polygon 2.0's strategic design could revolutionize the scalability and interoperability of blockchain technology. Polygon Labs&rsquo; commitment to enhancing the tech stack and protocol layers supports the global shift towards decentralized systems, heralding a new era in digital innovation and resource management.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The suggested architecture of Polygon 2.0 is reminiscent of the Internet protocol suite, a modular, flexible, and efficient framework that has become the backbone of our global digital ecosystem. Each layer in the proposed Polygon 2.0 is designed to facilitate a specific sub-process, streamlining the protocol implementation, updates, and potentially transforming the way we interact with the blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In the broader context of the blockchain space, this development reflects the industry's collective pursuit of scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. As an increasing number of organizations turn to blockchain solutions for various applications, the necessity for adaptable, scalable, and unified frameworks becomes even more apparent. In providing such an architecture, Polygon 2.0 could significantly contribute to the blockchain ecosystem's growth and the wider acceptance of decentralized solutions.</p>

This layer will also feature an aggregator that combines individual zero-knowledge proofs from each bridge into one proof before sending it to Ethereum, enabling &ldquo;seamless&rdquo; bridge transactions and &ldquo;dramatically reducing Ethereum gas consumption for proof verification,&rdquo; according to the team.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon Labs elaborates in its announcement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We believe this proposal can and should direct all Polygon protocol development efforts moving forward, serving both as the conceptual North Star and the formal development framework."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The two remaining layers of Polygon 2.0 will include the current execution layer, which relies upon the Erigon Ethereum client, and a "proving layer" that will standardize the zero-knowledge-proof process across all Polygon chains.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A Future-Proof Infrastructure</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Polygon isn't the only network attempting to transform into a multi-chain ecosystem. Other developers like zkSync Era and Optimism are working on similar strategies, but Polygon 2.0's unique four-layered approach sets it apart.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a statement, the team promises more information on each layer in the future, stating:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Polygon 2.0 consists of four protocol layers, each enabling an important process within the network: Staking Layer, Interop Layer, Execution Layer, Proving Layer."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the proposal now public, the network&rsquo;s validators will need to approve it. Polygon 2.0's vision, as expressed by the development team, is to establish &ldquo;the value layer&rdquo; of the internet, promising a more secure and scalable network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Just as the internet is an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing information, Polygon 2.0 seeks to serve as an elastically scalable, unified environment for accessing value.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Parallels With Early Internet Innovations</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With a vision of enabling an "Internet of Blockchains", Polygon 2.0's strategic design could revolutionize the scalability and interoperability of blockchain technology. Polygon Labs&rsquo; commitment to enhancing the tech stack and protocol layers supports the global shift towards decentralized systems, heralding a new era in digital innovation and resource management.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The suggested architecture of Polygon 2.0 is reminiscent of the Internet protocol suite, a modular, flexible, and efficient framework that has become the backbone of our global digital ecosystem. Each layer in the proposed Polygon 2.0 is designed to facilitate a specific sub-process, streamlining the protocol implementation, updates, and potentially transforming the way we interact with the blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In the broader context of the blockchain space, this development reflects the industry's collective pursuit of scalability, efficiency, and interoperability. As an increasing number of organizations turn to blockchain solutions for various applications, the necessity for adaptable, scalable, and unified frameworks becomes even more apparent. In providing such an architecture, Polygon 2.0 could significantly contribute to the blockchain ecosystem's growth and the wider acceptance of decentralized solutions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">With thousands of cryptos in the dip, finding tokens that will deliver gains in the short and long term has become a hassle. However, recent analyses have pointed to Uwerx, a new crypto that has defied market odds with its presale and bullish token surpassing expectations. </p>
<p class="s5">The WERX token has witnessed over a 100% surge due to its utility, with analysts predicting that WERX, which started at $0.005, could reach $1 by Q1 of 2024.</p>
<p class="s5">This article will give deeper insights into what makes Uwerx unique, its presale, and the 2024 price predictions for Chiliz (CHZ). </p>
<p class="s8">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chiliz (CHZ) 2024 Predictions As It Gains Bullish Sentiments
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) was recently listed as a security by the SEC. This action which took a huge toll on many cryptos seems to have not had much effect on Chiliz (CHZ), as evidenced in its token&rsquo;s recent performance. Chiliz (CHZ) has continued trending, recording above 17% increase in the past week. </p>
<p class="s5">This is quite surprising as the token has been in the red for over two months before the SEC&rsquo;s action. Hence, the recent traction is bewildering. </p>
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) continues to display strong potential, meaning it will likely gain a price increase. The CHZ token sells at $0.07591, but 2024 predictions show it could reach $0.15. </p>
<p class="s5">The recent bullish sentiments Chiliz (CHZ) has witnessed show the token might not be entirely market dependent but is affected by the value it provides and the moves it makes.</p>
Chiliz (CHZ) Launches The Sports Blockchain, Gets Listed In The Asian Markets
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ) is a Layer-1 protocol revolutionizing the entertainment and sports industry and bringing them to Web3. Chiliz&rsquo;s (CHZ) recent launch of the Sports Blockchain is a testament to this vision and its continued efforts to actively connect fans with their favorite teams and players.</p>
<p class="s5">This separates it from the tons of cryptos in the market, putting it in the spotlight since its 2016 launch. The Sports blockchain provides the infrastructure and facilities needed for sports. Chiliz(CHZ) has begun migrating Fan Tokens to the blockchain, and so far, it has moved that of PRSJ, RIVER, TIGERS, SHARKS, HASHTAG, and BENFICA.</p>
<p class="s5">Chiliz (CHZ), which faces delisting in the US, has been listed among the over 400 tradeable assets in the Indonesian market. This announcement has further boosted the CHZ token, signifying a future surge in trading activities. </p>
<p class="s8">&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Exceeds Initial Forecasts
<p class="s5">The speed at which Uwerx&rsquo;s presale progressed is still shocking, as it started just a few months back and is now in its final round, stage 5. The increased demand for WERX has led to increasing the presale WERX quantity to 427.5 million. 72.5 million WERX is available in stage 5, and WERX total supply is 750 million. </p>
<p class="s5">The WERX price has tremendously increased, as it is now at $0.047725, a huge surge from the starting price of $0.005. The same goes for its launch price, as WERX is set to launch at $0.095 - $0.115. There is an ongoing 15% purchase bonus to further benefit users at the current presale stage.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Has Competitive Advantage Over Centralized Freelancing Platforms
<p class="s5">A recent report shows that 71% of companies hire freelancers to increase business agility, especially during economic uncertainty. These companies will usually go to freelancing platforms that provide better working conditions and services at a subsidized rate, which is why Uwerx will gain massive adoption.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx will be the first decentralized freelancing platform as it integrates blockchain technology. It will charge only a 1% service fee against the 10 or 20% charged by centralized platforms. Another innovative feature of this project is the Uwerx Vault, which is similar to the concept of staking. The Vault acts as a storage for users to store their tokens while simultaneously providing rewards. </p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx&rsquo;s Alpha version has been launched and now has features such as Freelancer Profile Creation, Hiring Dashboard Page, Forgot Password, Sign-Up and Logging Pages, Initial Step of Job Creation, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process Page, My Activity Page, Settings, Initial Step of Finding Talent, Milestone, and Application Boosting using the WERX token.</p>
<p class="s11">The Job Creation Page was revamped to the Post Job and Apply Page to make it easier for freelancers to apply for jobs. Features like Freelancer and Client Dashboards and Tools will soon be released.</p>
<p class="s11">The platform has gained over 1,825 Telegram members, 1,652 Twitter followers, and 6,953 sign-ups. SolidProof and InterFi Network have conducted audits on Uwerx and approved its security.</p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx will soon be transitioning to its Beta version, which is now in the works. This will allow users to test the platform. Many developments have been made, and users will be updated soon. </p>
<p class="s11">The project&rsquo;s success also follows the agile methodology the developers use to release the project in bits while making improvements following users&rsquo; feedback. The team is user-based, welcoming users&rsquo; feedback and putting them into action. This feedback can be sent to their email, feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
<p class="s11">Following a modification of the WERX allocations, the team re-assigned only 7% of the total WERX allocation to themselves (previously 8%) and locked their token share, which will last for nine months. This action was hastened by the 82.8% of the community who voted for them to start before the presale ended, and it began on June 7. The presale ends on July 31. </p>
<p class="s11">The team will give up the ownership of the smart contract immediately after Uwerx launches on centralized exchanges. Also, a Test Airdrop will be conducted to validate receiving wallet addresses for users after 98.2% of the token holders voted for this. </p>
<p class="s11">Uwerx has all it takes to become a dominating force in the freelancing industry with its fundamental advantages over traditional freelancing platforms. Indeed, it is poised for massive adoption. </p>
<p class="s11">Its presale is the best opportunity to enter this blue-chip future at an extremely good price. Solook no further! Purchase the WERX token now for a 15% purchase bonus.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest partnership between Near Protocol (NEAR) and Alibaba caused the Near Protocol (NEAR) price to spike, leading experts to wonder whether the token can hold its upward momentum. Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in Stage 4 of its presale, has exceeded everyone&rsquo;s expectations, surging over 80% in price and raising $2.8 million in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Near Protocol (NEAR) Spikes 12% After Alibaba Partnership
<p>The Near Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the Near Protocol (NEAR), recently partnered with Alibaba Cloud intending to accelerate Web3 growth in the Middle East and Asia. Namely, this Near Protocol (NEAR) partnership will provide remote procedure calls (RPC) as a service to Near Protocol (NEAR) users and developers, among other benefits.</p>
<p>As a result, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged 12% as soon as the announcement was made, driving its price to the $1.56 level. However, Near Protocol (NEAR) did not manage to sustain its upward movement, with the Near Protocol (NEAR) token currently trading at $1.36.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Surges 80%, Amassing Over 12,500 Users on Its One-Of-a-Kind Platform
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new hybrid trading platform that will allow people to use their crypto balances to trade stocks, bonds, options, forex, commodities, ETFs, and crypto, all from one account. Also, due to its decentralized nature, TCRV will enable users worldwide to trade on thousands of markets completely anonymously with no need to meet any KYC requirements.</p>
<p>To trade on TCRV, all users need to do is create an account, connect their crypto wallet, deposit the crypto they want to use, and start trading immediately.</p>
<p>Tradecuve is the only trading platform on the market that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges under one roof, well-positioning itself to challenge the likes of Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken and earn a spot among the top-three global trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, TCRV will provide its token holders with many exclusive benefits, including discounts on trading fees, high leverage at 500:1, algorithmic AI trading, and copy-trading (where users can pay a subscription fee to traders with good success rates to copy their traders).</p>
<p>Also, the TCRV team plans to launch its own metaverse trading academy where users can take courses and learn about trading techniques to improve their skills.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, where investors can buy tokens at $0.018 and receive a 50% deposit bonus. Additionally, due to its unprecedented real-world utility and high demand, TCRV has already raised $2.8 million and attracted over 12,500 users. As a result, experts believe the token will deliver 50x gains before it launches on exchanges, when it will rise by an additional 100x.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest partnership between Near Protocol (NEAR) and Alibaba caused the Near Protocol (NEAR) price to spike, leading experts to wonder whether the token can hold its upward momentum. Meanwhile, Tradecurve (TCRV), currently in Stage 4 of its presale, has exceeded everyone&rsquo;s expectations, surging over 80% in price and raising $2.8 million in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Near Protocol (NEAR) Spikes 12% After Alibaba Partnership
<p>The Near Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the Near Protocol (NEAR), recently partnered with Alibaba Cloud intending to accelerate Web3 growth in the Middle East and Asia. Namely, this Near Protocol (NEAR) partnership will provide remote procedure calls (RPC) as a service to Near Protocol (NEAR) users and developers, among other benefits.</p>
<p>As a result, Near Protocol (NEAR) surged 12% as soon as the announcement was made, driving its price to the $1.56 level. However, Near Protocol (NEAR) did not manage to sustain its upward movement, with the Near Protocol (NEAR) token currently trading at $1.36.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Surges 80%, Amassing Over 12,500 Users on Its One-Of-a-Kind Platform
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new hybrid trading platform that will allow people to use their crypto balances to trade stocks, bonds, options, forex, commodities, ETFs, and crypto, all from one account. Also, due to its decentralized nature, TCRV will enable users worldwide to trade on thousands of markets completely anonymously with no need to meet any KYC requirements.</p>
<p>To trade on TCRV, all users need to do is create an account, connect their crypto wallet, deposit the crypto they want to use, and start trading immediately.</p>
<p>Tradecuve is the only trading platform on the market that combines the best elements of centralized and decentralized exchanges under one roof, well-positioning itself to challenge the likes of Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken and earn a spot among the top-three global trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, TCRV will provide its token holders with many exclusive benefits, including discounts on trading fees, high leverage at 500:1, algorithmic AI trading, and copy-trading (where users can pay a subscription fee to traders with good success rates to copy their traders).</p>
<p>Also, the TCRV team plans to launch its own metaverse trading academy where users can take courses and learn about trading techniques to improve their skills.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, where investors can buy tokens at $0.018 and receive a 50% deposit bonus. Additionally, due to its unprecedented real-world utility and high demand, TCRV has already raised $2.8 million and attracted over 12,500 users. As a result, experts believe the token will deliver 50x gains before it launches on exchanges, when it will rise by an additional 100x.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>InQubeta (QUBE) has joined Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on Reddit&rsquo;s list of tokens selected to enjoy bull runs in 2023. Ethereum has had the most substantial price growth in 2023 with its prices rising by over 60%. Bitcoin lagged behind Ethereum, despite having the larger market capitalization, with its prices only growing by about 40% at the height of its bull run.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets have been generally bearish since the two most popular tokens&rsquo; price growth earlier in the year, but that hasn&rsquo;t stopped InQubeta&rsquo;s presale from exceeding all expectations. Tokens allocated for the presale&rsquo;s beta stage were sold out before the period ended. Investors standing to increase the value of their investments by 400% thanks to incremental price changes at each of the presale's ten stages is one of the best deals in the cryptocurrency world.</p>
InQubeta (QUBE) making waves with Reddit investors
<p>Reddit investors know a thing about bull runs so it&rsquo;s prudent to consider which cryptocurrencies or other investment opportunities are popular on the forum. Redditors wreaked havoc on Wall Street whales a few years ago when the forum backed stocks like GameStop and AMC, squeezing hedge funds that were shorting them.</p>
<p>The Reddit mania led to $24 billion being traded on U.S. stock exchanges on Jan 27, 2021, exceeding the previous high of $8 billion set during the 2008 financial crisis. GameStop stock prices went skyrocketing, forcing investors shorting the stock to purchase some to minimize their losses, driving prices further up.</p>
<p>InQubeta is the latest cryptocurrency project to gain the attention of Redditors as its platform makes investments in artificial intelligence more accessible for everyday people. It&rsquo;s not surprising to see Reddit investors, many of whom view themselves as the little people sticking it to the big whales, embrace a democratic platform that empowers everyday people who might not meet the elitist standards of traditional investment channels, like minimum investments that surpass the average annual income in the U.S.</p>
The InQubeta way
<p>InQubeta makes becoming part-owner of an artificial intelligence startup as easy as buying non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the ecosystem&rsquo;s marketplace. Startups looking for capital make these equity-based NFTs on InQubeta&rsquo;s Ethereum-based blockchain and investors purchase them with $QUBE tokens.</p>
<p>The NFTs are sent to investors after sales are finalized and they&rsquo;re free to sell or hold on to them at any point. These NFTs work like stocks, and some come with extra rewards like a slice of the startup&rsquo;s profits.</p>
<p>Thanks to InQubeta, investing in what many are already calling the biggest tech revolution in human history is now more accessible than ever. The internet was the last significant tech breakthrough and it created many millionaires and billionaires. For instance, $2,000 invested in Netflix in the early 2000s would be worth over a million dollars today. InQubeta&rsquo;s approach to investing now makes similar investment opportunities available to all.</p>
<p></p>
Bitcoin (BTC) is almost halfway back to pre-2022 prices
<p>Bitcoin continues to enjoy the largest market capitalization in the cryptocurrency space and it&rsquo;s already enjoyed some decent growth in 2023. Many cryptocurrency experts are expecting a bigger bull run later in the year.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) growing faster than Bitcoin
<p>Ethereum has seen more price increases in 2023 than Bitcoin due to various reasons like Ethereum-based altcoins like InQubeta and Polygon (MATIC) making waves in mainstream and crypto investment circles. Ethereum will likely continue outpacing Bitcoin for the remainder of the year but don&rsquo;t expect it to keep up with InQubeta.</p>
Summary
<p>InQubeta has an excellent chance of seeing more growth than more popular coins like BTC and ETH thanks to incremental price changes during its presale and its tokens being undervalued. Investors can expect to increase the value of their portfolios by up to 400% during the presale period, and there are no limits for InQubeta prices from that point.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Better After 29427 Test:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 2 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) worked to remain above the 30000 figure early in the Asian session as the pair encountered month-ending volatility that saw a rapid depreciation to the 29417.14 area, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; This quick downward move took place shortly after BTC/USD spiked higher to the 30277 area, its strongest print in several trading sessions, and opens up a possible test of the 28604.83 area.&nbsp; BTC/USD notched a June gain of approximately 11.9%, and the pair is now up approximately 83.5% year-to-date.&nbsp; The pair&rsquo;s recent print around the 31443.67 area was a twelve-month high and test of an upside price objective associated with buying pressure that strengthened around the 26637.41 area.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>
<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29863, 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Stops were also recently triggered above additional upside price objectives around the 29068, 29159, 29458, 30088, 30200, 30292, and 30477 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Technicians are closely watching to see how much technical support develops around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30456.83 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30515.87.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
