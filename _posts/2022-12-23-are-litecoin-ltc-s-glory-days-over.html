tag: CryptoDaily
---

<p>Litecoin (LTC) went against all odds when it pulled a bull run whilst the FTX crashed. But it was not the same case lately - the price is down 16.88% in the last 7 days.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, The Hideaways (HDWY) takes the center stage after announcing a $100,000 prize draw for all token holders. The reward is a celebration of the success of its initial presale ending on December 31.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) Trades on a Support Level</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) currently trades on a support level that historically sent the price to the $85.00 zone. LTC is selling at $63.62, down 8.34% in the latest charts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question here is whether the crypto major will get enough buying support to send its price back to its December 5 high at $84.95.</p>
<p>Looking at its technical indicators, sellers will not likely give up their position. The relative strength index is at 34.56, indicating Litecoin (LTC) is nearing the oversold territory.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 50-day EMA takes above the 20-day EMA, indicating bears&rsquo; dominance.</p>
<p>Investors took the negative signals as a chance to buy into The Hideaways (HDWY) which is currently holding a $100,000 prize draw.</p>
<p>Whale Accumulation Spotted on Litecoin (LTC) Charts</p>
<p>Despite its recent depreciation, Litecoin (LTC) whales continue to accumulate.</p>
<p>The latest on-chain analysis reveals that whale addresses with 1 million or more LTC coins have accumulated an additional 2.95 million Litecoin (LTC) valued at $220 million at the current market price.</p>
<p>Other tokens enjoying massive acquisitions lately are Shiba Inu (SHIB) and The Hideaways (HDWY), with the latter promising a 9,000% growth for 2023.</p>
<p>Due to this strong whale support, analysts upgraded their Litecoin (LTC) price projections - LTC is expected to climb to $73.54 next week. On the other hand, a continued weak performance will show $47.88, a November 9 low, back on the daily charts.&nbsp;</p>
