<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The upcoming halving event for Litecoin has resulted in increased attention and network activity, with the hashrate reaching a new all-time high of 831.16 TH/s.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite recent price increases and outperforming other altcoins, LTC is currently facing resistance near the $100 price zone, with the Fibonacci 78.6% retracement level posing a potential challenge.</em></li>



<li><em>It is important to conduct thorough research and consider various indicators.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) is seen as one of the most promising coins at the moment as its major halving event this year draws near. Given its incredible performance, what could be its next price zone?</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="679" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg" alt="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching" class="wp-image-199079" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1536x1019.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-750x497.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1140x756.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the halving event approaches, the Litecoin network receives more attention. This has resulted in an increase in the network&#8217;s hashrate as additional miners join the network. The majority of June saw substantial surges in hashrate due to the increase in mining difficulty.</p>



<p>On June 23, 2023, the Litecoin hashrate hit 831.16 terahashes per second (TH/s), according to <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinWarz</a> statistics. This is a new all-time high for the network, which previously had data slightly higher than 756.26 TH/ S.</p>

<p>The increase in mining difficulty makes it more difficult to locate a block, thus miners must bring more computers online to boost their chances, resulting in a surge in hashrate. When additional miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has reached its peak.</p>



<p>The good news is that Litecoin on-chain statistics show that a sizable fraction of LTC holders keeps their currency. This verified that a portion of newly bought LTC coins did not move throughout the same time period.</p>



<p>The price of Litecoin, which is now trading at $95 per coin, has increased by about 15% in the previous 24 hours, with several other cryptocurrencies following suit. Although most cryptocurrencies have been trending sideways in recent days, LTC has surpassed other altcoins today. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has stayed reasonably stable in the $30,000-$31,000 price area in recent days.</p>

<p>The spike of LTC left no support, its price is at the nearest resistance, which is confluent with the Fib 78.6% level. So, a revolution can happen until LTC reaches the $100 price zone, however, at the moment, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to buy at this price zone.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has recently experienced a significant surge in both trading volume and price, reaching its highest levels since May 12, 2021. BCH&#8217;s contract open interest has surged to an impressive $562 million, reflecting the growing interest and confidence in this digital asset. Over the past week, BCH&#8217;s price has skyrocketed by nearly 100%, capturing the attention of investors and traders alike. This surge in interest can be attributed to various factors, with South Korea emerging as a key player in the BCH market.</p>



<p>The trading volume of BCH contracts has surged by more than 10 times since June 22, with a staggering 24-hour trading volume peaking at 4.427 billion. At the time of writing, BCH is trading at $ 297 after reaching $325, which is up by nearly 30% over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>According to Wu, South Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, Upbit, has played a pivotal role in driving this momentum. In the past 24 hours alone, Upbit recorded a BCH/KRW trading volume of over $350 million, contributing to 23.58% of BCH&#8217;s total trading volume. Notably, this trading volume is three times higher than that of BTC/KRW on the same platform.</p>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s active participation in the BCH market, combined with the repayment of debts and increased interest from traders, has fueled the recent pump in BCH&#8217;s trading volume and price. This surge not only highlights the growing significance of BCH in the cryptocurrency market but also demonstrates the resilience and potential of digital currencies in general.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Base is close to being deployed on the mainnet, prioritizing security.</em></li>



<li><em>The network has met crucial deployment criteria and leveraged collaboration with OP Labs.</em></li>



<li><em>Initiatives like smart contract audits and monitoring tools enhance security and attract users.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Base, Coinbase&#8217;s new layer 2 application-focused protocol, is only one step away from being <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1674543151388966912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ready</a> for mainnet deployment.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1024x512.png" alt="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch" class="wp-image-199039" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Base team revealed their comprehensive security procedures in a block post in anticipation of their imminent mainnet launch. The platform&#8217;s goal is to get the next million developers and billion users onto the blockchain, and security is a critical component of that mission.</p>



<p>On February 23, the exchange officially unveiled Base, which aspires to be a low-cost, secure, and developer-friendly network for creating decentralized apps.</p>



<p>The network is created in conjunction with Optimism on the OP Stack. Because of this basis, it benefits from the considerable security work done by the OP Labs team and the larger Optimism community. Coinbase&#8217;s Protocol Security team performed an internal examination to improve the security of the OP Stack.</p>

<p>The Protocol Security team has worked closely with OP Labs over the last six months to strengthen the security of the layer 2 and Optimism. This involved reviewing all Optimism pre-deployments and contracts on both L1 and L2 to discover technological stack vulnerabilities and dangers.</p>



<p>On June 29, the team announced that the Optimism-powered, Ethereum-secured network had passed its second-to-last criterion for deployment.</p>



<p>A &#8220;Regolith&#8221; hard fork in testnet, a successful infrastructure assessment with OP Labs (the team behind Optimism), and Optimism&#8217;s &#8220;Bedrock&#8221; update was the other three requirements that were met.</p>



<p>Base engaged the larger community in advance of the mainnet launch by hosting a public smart contract audit contest on Code4rena. This competition challenged security researchers to identify and disclose defects in any area of the OP Stack. This challenge drew over 100 security researchers, and no notable vulnerabilities were uncovered.</p>



<p>Optimism&#8217;s node software, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalency flaws, bridge vulnerabilities, and several smart contract concerns were among the audits studied by security experts.</p>



<p>Base is also developing a smart contract security screening tool to assist developers in reducing the likelihood of inserting a security vulnerability into their contracts. This tool allows developers to rapidly and efficiently scan their contracts and get findings from numerous open-source vulnerability detection tools, including Coinbase&#8217;s proprietary secure trait analyzer.</p>

<p>In addition to safeguarding the core OP Stack codebase, the network is working on an open-source monitoring tool, Pessimism, to give timely reporting of protocol and network irregularities. This tool will be used in conjunction with current OP Labs monitoring tools, Coinbase&#8217;s in-house blockchain monitoring capabilities, and third-party solutions.</p>

<p>CME group has announced the launch of Ether/Bitcoin Ratio (EBR) futures contract. This new contract will allow market participants to efficiently execute a relative value trade between Ether futures and Bitcoin futures contracts in a single trade. The EBR futures contract will enable investors to access cryptocurrency exposure without the need to take a directional view.</p>



<p>The CME Globex ticker for the new futures contract is EBR, where the ratio is defined as Ether futures price divided by the Bitcoin futures price. The ratio will be calculated using the same expiration month for the underlying Ether and Bitcoin futures contract. The ratio will always be positive and will be available across all listed contract months. The notional value of the contract is found by multiplying the ratio by $1,000,000.</p>



<p>Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures allow traders to efficiently express a view on the relative value of the two cryptocurrencies without a directional bias on the overall cryptocurrency market. This feature makes the EBR futures contract a promising tool for hedging and risk management purposes in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The EBR Final Settlement price is found by dividing the Ether futures Final Settlement Price by the Bitcoin futures Final Settlement Price. This feature ensures the settlement of the futures contract at a fair value.</p>

<p>After nine weeks (August 31), Forge&#8217;s game premise will expand to include Rift challenges, where select NFT mech owners will have to compete in a new game mode of the genre. &#8220;dungeon collector&#8221;.</p>



<p>In Rifts, players will have to craft, explore, and seek rewards to get to the game&#8217;s final stages. According to Yuuga Forging Game Guide, selected players will have to battle &#8220;epic beasts&#8221; in the game&#8217;s final stages and compete with each other for unspecified &#8220;treasures&#8221; before the game time runs out.</p>



<p>While HV-MTL has a lot of its own ecosystem under the Yuga umbrella, there will also be space for BAYC, MAYC and BAKC holders in the game mechanics. These mechanics won&#8217;t be revealed until the second part of Forge comes out.</p>

<p>The design of Polygon 2.0 will integrate Zero-Knowledge to support all networks. This move comes shortly after the project announced its proposal to migrate the Polygon PoS network to <a href="https://coincu.com/196671-polygon-zkevm-validium-layer-2-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkEVM Validium</a>. Before that, another zk network operating in parallel, Polygon zkEVM, was also broadcast in March 2023.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The proposed Polygon 2.0 network will include an ethereum virtual machine client and a shared ZK proof implementation, which the team calls an &#8220;interoperability layer&#8221; or &#8220;common bridge.&#8221; The in-house developed cryptographic algorithm Plonky3 will support the interoperability layer, and the result will be a single high-performance proof-of-work system that underpins the entire network.</p>



<p>With the new architecture, an orchestration layer will exist to confirm cross-chain transactions, while ZK proofs will provide a shared bridge. The public bridge will connect all Polygon chains and implement ZK-based security proofs on Ethereum to protect all Polygon chains simultaneously.</p>

<p>The plan also offers token resetting, allowing investors to stake the same token across multiple projects simultaneously. And Polygon plans to give developers the ability to &#8220;add new decentralized chains on demand,&#8221; according to a statement &#8211; joining competitors including Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync&#8217;s Matter Labs already make their network easier to replicate, in pursuit of promoting broader ecosystems of specialized but compatible blockchains.</p>



<p>The proposal also calls for an emphasis on resetting, allowing users to reuse their staked cryptocurrencies to ensure the security of other applications on the blockchain. Many protocols, like Eigenlayer, have recently accepted resets.</p>



<p>The expected transition to Polygon 2.0 is scheduled for the first quarter of next year.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On Thursday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) announced the 19b-4 filing of the Fidelity Bitcoin Spot ETF on its website.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) has published the Fidelity Bitcoin Spot ETF filing.</em></li>



<li><em>The Wise Origin, Bitcoin Trust fund, is also a Spot ETF like BlackRock&#8217;s iSHARES BITCOIN TRUST.</em></li>



<li><em>The SEC previously rejected the application of the world&#8217;s 3rd largest wealth management fund in early 2022.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Thursday, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe) <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-044.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the 19b-4 filing of the<a href="https://coincu.com/198213-fidelity-joins-the-battle-for-bitcoin-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Fidelity</a> Bitcoin Spot ETF on its website.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The ETF is called Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, FD Funds Management LLC is its promoter, and Fidelity Digital Asset Services will be responsible for the custody of bitcoins held by the fund.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fidelity joins push for spot bitcoin ETF, and Coinbase seeks dismissal of SEC suit: CNBC Crypto World <a href="https://t.co/AhLHuNhKil" target="_blank">https://t.co/AhLHuNhKil</a></p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1674495935773024259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 29, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<cite>The filing states.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Like BlackRock&#8217;s filing, Fidelity&#8217;s filing also includes Cboe&#8217;s custody-sharing agreement with a US-based spot bitcoin trading platform.</p>



<p>The move is seen as a breakthrough for listing a Bitcoin spot ETF in the US, as the SEC has rejected dozens of similar filings. BlackRock&#8217;s submission is substantially different from this SSA provision. If approved, BlackRock will share custody with Coinbase.</p>



<p>Fidelity also previously expressed interest in cryptocurrencies when it applied to launch a Bitcoin Spot ETF in 2021 but was rejected by the SEC early the following year.</p>

<p>Earlier, there were also many signals that the big asset management group is said to be preparing to re-enter the Bitcoin Spot ETF race, following a series of Wall Street giants, including BlackRock, WisdomTree, Invesco, and Valkyrie.</p>



<p>It must be said that the crypto market has been quite excited lately with the appearance of the Bitcoin Spot ETF. Investors can freely participate in the cryptocurrency market without having to worry about regulatory procedures anymore. Especially it is even more reassuring when this product is guaranteed by the size and influence of the US financial empires.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Central Bank of Korea's central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) will begin its first payment test (empirical test) to the public in 2024.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The Central Bank of Korea has announced that it will begin a CBDC payment experiment next year.</em></li>



<li><em>Korea will start a CBDC private distribution system for commercial banks.</em></li>



<li><em>Last year, 15 banks participated in the CBDC connection trial between the Bank of Korea and institutions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to media Chosun, The Central Bank of Korea&#8217;s central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC) will begin its first payment test (empirical test) to the public in 2024.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="718" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-1024x718.png" alt="Central Bank Of Korea To Test CBDC Payments For Private Sector In 2024" class="wp-image-198988" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-1024x718.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-300x210.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-768x538.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-1536x1076.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-750x526.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216-1140x799.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2216.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Central Bank Of Korea To Test CBDC Payments For Private Sector In 2024 16"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The Bank of Korea has begun a technical review to issue a<a href="https://coincu.com/187467-samsung-spearheads-south-koreas-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CBDC </a>in 2020, built a platform for online and offline payments, and completed simulation testing with commercial banks last year.</p>



<p>A source from a commercial bank said that the Bank of Korea would publicly solicit small-value payment type CBDC trials for financial institutions that participated in last year&#8217;s CBDC simulation test in July this year. Based on this, CBDC pilot testing will be conducted for the public next year.</p>



<p>The CBDC Test Subject is a &#8216;type of micropayment&#8217; that can be used by general financial consumers. CBDCs are divided into bulk payment CBDCs used for payments between financial institutions and micropayments CBDCs used by all economic actors, including the general public, depending on the user object.</p>

<p>Cooperation with the Bank of Korea and commercial banks is critical to testing the use of micropayment CBDCs. Last year, 15 banks participated in the CBDC connection trial between the Bank of Korea and institutions, including KB Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, Hana Bank, Woori Bank, and NH Nonghyup Bank.</p>



<p>The location and form of research on the introduction of CBDCs have been carried out differently depending on the economic situation of each country. Developing countries have been promoting the issuance of CBDCs for financial inclusion, and developed countries to stabilize the financial system.</p>

<p>King Charles endorsed a measure providing authorities the authority to regulate crypto and stablecoins on Thursday, marking the last formal step before the bill becomes law.</p>



<p>The UK Government has been working on the Financial Services and Markets Bill for quite some time, and it believes that its passage will play a central role in delivering the Government&#8217;s vision of growing the economy and creating an open, sustainable, technologically advanced financial services sector, and it includes measures to bring crypto and stablecoins under regulation. The law was adopted by Parliament&#8217;s upper house last week.</p>



<p>Andrew Griffith, the Treasury&#8217;s Economic Secretary, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rocket-boost-for-uk-economy-as-financial-services-and-markets-bill-receives-royal-assent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a>:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This landmark piece of legislation gives us control of our financial services rulebook, so it supports UK businesses and consumers and drives growth.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Among other things, the FSMB establishes a clear route for crypto assets to be regulated as financial products in order to facilitate their safe adoption in the United Kingdom. The necessity to release a functioning regulation remains one of the most pressing issues in the United States, and the clear progress in the United Kingdom has sparked fears that America would lag behind in adopting future innovation.</p>

<p>The recently signed Bill in the United Kingdom is significantly more comprehensive since it considers wider innovation using blockchain technology. Significantly, the Act provides &#8220;sandboxes&#8221; that potentially promote the deployment of innovative technologies like blockchain in financial markets.</p>



<p>The measure, filed in July 2022, provides authorities more control over the financial sector, including cryptocurrency. As the law was being considered in Parliament, modifications were made to treat all cryptocurrency as a regulated activity and to control cryptocurrency advertisements. The law also includes stablecoins in the scope of payment regulations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="420" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215.png" alt="BREAKING: UK Now Admits Crypto As Regulated Financial Activity In The Country" class="wp-image-198982" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215.png 640w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2215-300x197.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="BREAKING: UK Now Admits Crypto As Regulated Financial Activity In The Country 20"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Treasury, Financial Conduct Authority, Bank of England, and Payments Systems Regulator in the UK will soon be able to develop and enforce regulations governing the industry. The United Kingdom has now set a positive example for other countries trying to control the crypto environment by assenting to the Bill.</p>

<p>Solana protocol Cardinal announced that it will gradually close its protocols, including NFT leasing, staking, ticketing, custody, and other functions. The project, which completed a $4.4 million seed round of financing in July 2022, is led by Solana Ventures and Protagonist, with participation from Animoca Brands and others. Cardinal blamed the difficult macro environment for its closure.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Everyone, we have some unfortunate news to share <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>After a lot of reflection, we’ve decided to begin the process of winding down our protocols. Let&#39;s dive into it <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2b07.png" alt="⬇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>&mdash; Cardinal (@cardinal_labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cardinal_labs/status/1674092964124176387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Although Cardinal has seen some real usage of its staking, rentals, and identity products, the team still feels like they’re stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community. They’d hoped that the rest of the world’s industries would have begun adopting blockchain tech at a larger scale by now, but that still feels a ways away.</p>



<p>Cardinal believes that utility and intrinsic value will take center stage for digital assets when the day comes that the rest of the world begins adopting blockchain tech at a larger scale. The Cardinal team hopes that their vision for digital assets will continue to inspire others going forward. The team assures users that all assets are completely safe, and they will all have been returned to their rightful owners by the end of the process.</p>



<p>During the two-month notice period, which runs from June 28 to August 26, Cardinal recommends that any and all depositors of assets into their systems manually withdraw them. All of Cardinal&#8217;s website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.</p>



<p>For the next few weeks, all of Cardinal&#8217;s protocols will work exactly as they do currently. On July 19, Cardinal will disable all new deposit instructions across all protocols so that the only operation that can be done for the remainder of the notice period is a withdrawal.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This means that among others, the following operations will be disabled on 7/19:<br><br>Staking<br>Stake Pool creation<br>Token Manager creation in any context (rental listing, etc.)<br>New NFT rentals and rental extensions<br>Namespaces name linking (social media handles and otherwise)</p>&mdash; Cardinal (@cardinal_labs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cardinal_labs/status/1674093004490166272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 28, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At the end of the notice period, Cardinal will forcibly withdraw all remaining deposits and return them to depositor addresses. Among other things, this will include tokens that are still staked, unallocated stake pool rewards, and NFTs wrapped with token managers (rentals, etc.).</p>



<p>Cardinal will take down its UIs and remove its smart contract deployments from Solana. In the process of removing the smart contracts, Cardinal will return the SOL denominated rent stored in all accounts to the relevant account’s initial fee/rent payer.</p>



<p>For teams that use Cardinal&#8217;s protocols via CPI from other smart contracts in different business contexts, Cardinal encourages them to consider the implications of their timeline on their platforms/systems. Cardinal is happy to discuss trivial solutions to migrating away from their protocols on a case-by-case basis for any team that needs assistance.</p>
