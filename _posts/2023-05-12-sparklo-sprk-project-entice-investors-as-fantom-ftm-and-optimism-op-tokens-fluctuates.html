<p class="s6">Amidst the varying magnitude of price actions going on every minute in the crypto market, Sparklo has become a source of consistent hope that investors look to in making significant gains. </p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, tokens like Fantom (FTM) and Optimism (OP) leave investors second-guessing their next line of action as these coins fail to stabilize. However, volatility in the crypto market is what investors have come to expect in the crypto market. Issues lie in how they respond to price actions.</p>
<p class="s8">Fantom (FTM) Struggle Continues in the Crypto Market</p>
<p class="s6">The price of Fantom (FTM) failed to gain any price value as it lost -1.1% in the last 24 hours to stay at a current price of $0.411. The price decline of Fantom (FTM) went as far back as the last 14 days where statistics show a loss of -20.9% in the price value. Experts are suggesting that a bearish run of Fantom (FTM) may be coming to an end.</p>
<p class="s6">Fantom (FTM) has a circulating supply of 2.787B while the market cap stands at $1.146B. The trading volume of Fantom (FTM) in the last 24 hours is 103.486M. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s8">Optimism (OP) Fails to Regain Lost Grounds with Yet Another Negative Price Action</p>
<p class="s6">The crypto market has witnessed yet another bad day for Optimism (OP) as the coin records a loss of -1.53% in the last 24 hours. While this may seem insignificant, going back to the last 7 days shows that Optimism (OP) has also lost -3.91%.</p>
<p class="s6">The last time Optimism (OP) saw a price rally was when some executives in the Optimism (OP) venture capital such as Andreessen Horowitz firm made a series of tweets in the middle of April which got the market talking and eventually raised the price value. However, the price of Optimism (OP) has maintained a downward trend since then. It is yet to be seen how far the bearish run of Optimism (OP) will go.</p>
<p class="s6">The trading volume of Optimism (OP) in the last 24 hours is $64.74M while the circulation supply is 314.84M. The market cap of Optimism (OP) is $660.79M.</p>
<p class="s8">More Investors Queue in on the Sparklo (SPRK) Project</p>
<p class="s6">It is not often that one sees investors and experts alike back a crypto project. However, that is the case with Sparklo as more investors and analysts foresee a very promising investment in the project.</p>
<p class="s6">While Sparklo is still in its presale phase, it is already tipped to end up becoming a blue-chip crypto with the massive potential for growth that the project shows.</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo will be the first investment platform that will allow members the opportunity to invest in real-life assets like Silver Gold and Platinum. These assets will be backed by NFTs which will represent the luxury investments. </p>
<p class="s6">At the price of just $0.017, investors know how much of a bargain Sparklo is at the moment. That's not all, investors that purchase 1000 SPRK will get a 30% bonus. This means that investors will get 130000 SPRK for the price of 100000. The offer is valid until the 5th of May 2023. As most experienced investors already know, investing in projects early will result in significant gains.</p>
