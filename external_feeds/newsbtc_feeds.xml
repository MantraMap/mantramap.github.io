					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin has seen one of the most impressive runs of any cryptocurrency over the last couple of weeks and this run has propelled the altcoin’s standing in the industry. After rallying more than 30% over a period of three weeks, the digital asset is now the 10th-largest cryptocurrency in the space. LTC&#8217;s Market Cap Crosses $7.1 Billion In the space of a month, the price of Litecoin’s native LTC token shot up from its June lows of $71 and moved as high as $115 before the rally burned out. Following this, the market cap of the digital asset moved up rapidly, beating out some heavy hitters in the space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharks And Whales Go On $2.15 Billion Buying Spree, Is It Time To Sell? Currently, the market cap of the altcoin is sitting above $7.1 billion, despite the price falling back below the $100 level. Its market cap now makes it the 10th-largest cryptocurrency in the market, coming out ahead of the likes of Polygon (MATIC), Tron (TRX), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Litecoin’s standing now makes it the seventh most valuable cryptocurrency in the market when stablecoins are removed from the top 10. This move has also solidified Litecoin’s position as an important player, despite its price correction. LTC price hits local high of $115 before correction &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView.com Could Litecoin Run Further From Here? The biggest bull case for the price of LTC is the Litecoin halving event that is coming up. Only 20 days away from now, investors are already gearing up for what is expected to be a very significant event. These expectations also naturally extend to the price and this could be the reason that the digital asset’s price continues to rise. Just the anticipation from the last month alone has seen the price cross $115 at its local high. But as the event draws closer and this bullish sentiment continues, the LTC price could quickly reclaim this price and run another 50%. LTC halving event happening in 20 days &#124; Source: Litecoin Halving In one instance, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has predicted that LTC could rally as high as $200 off the halving event alone. If this happens, then investors could be looking at gains of over 100% just from the current bounce-off point. However, one concern is that the Litecoin halving could end up being a ‘buy the rumor, sell the news’ event. Examples of this have been the Cardano Alonzo upgrade in 2021 and Ethereum’s Shapella upgrade in 2023. Related Reading: Analysts Puts Bitcoin At $125,000 By 2024, How Is This Possible? In both of these cases, the token prices rallied in the weeks leading up to the event but eventually fell flat and retraced once the event was completed. So if Litecoin ends up in the same trend, then it would be best to sell in the weeks leading up to the event. For now, LTC’s price is still holding steady at $97, despite nursing 8.09% losses on the 7-day chart.

Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LINK is currently trading at $6.26, below the rigid resistance of $6.50. The level above acts as the overhead ceiling for the altcoin. Despite breaking out of the bearish trendline (green), LINK has been unable to overcome immediate resistance as it remains largely bearish on the higher time frame.

					<description><![CDATA[Tether, one of the largest stablecoin issuers, has recently made a significant move in the cryptocurrency market. With the release of an additional 1 billion USDT on the Ethereum and TRON networks, Tether aims to solidify its market dominance and enhance its interoperability. Whale Alert, an on-chain analytics account known for monitoring significant cryptocurrency transactions, drew attention to this latest move by Tether.  In response to Whale Alert&#8217;s tweet announcing Tether&#8217;s 1 billion USDT inventory replenishment on the Tron Network, Tether&#8217;s CTO Paulo Adoino replied in a tweet stating that the issuance was authorized but not yet issued, indicating that the tokens will serve as inventory for future issuance requests and chain swaps.

					<description><![CDATA[A significant development has emerged in the ongoing saga surrounding the defunct criminal online marketplace Silk Road. On-chain data suggest that a massive amount of funds tied to the marketplace is on the move, with more than 9,000 Bitcoin (BTC) recently transferred from two Silk Road-related addresses. The addresses in question are suspected to have been seized by the US Department of Justice. US Government BTC On The Move? The latest transfer of funds follows the seizure of over 50,000 Bitcoin from James Zhong, who recently pled guilty to wire fraud for unlawfully obtaining the Bitcoin from the Silk Road dark web marketplace in 2012. Law enforcement seized the Bitcoin from Zhong&#8217;s home in Gainesville, Georgia, in November 2021, in what was the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the history of the US Department of Justice. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against StakeHound For Withholding $150 Million According to court filings, Zhong created a string of Silk Road accounts to conceal his identity, triggering over 140 transactions in rapid succession to trick Silk Road&#8217;s withdrawal-processing system into releasing approximately 50,000 BTC into his accounts. He then transferred the Bitcoin into separate addresses under his control, all in a manner designed to prevent detection and obfuscate the Bitcoin&#8217;s source. Zhong&#8217;s possession of the 50,000 Bitcoin led to him receiving 50,000 Bitcoin Cash in a hard fork coin split in August 2017. He then exchanged all the BCH Crime Proceeds for additional Bitcoin, amounting to approximately 3,500 Bitcoin of additional crime proceeds. By the last quarter of 2017, Zhong possessed roughly 53,500 Bitcoin of total crime proceeds. In March 2022, Zhong began voluntarily surrendering to the government additional Bitcoin that he had access to and had not dissipated. In total, he surrendered 1,004.14621836 additional Bitcoin. The US government had previously sold 9,800 Bitcoin in March 2022, with plans to sell another 41,500 BTC. However, the recent transfer of more than 9,000 BTC from the Silk Road-related addresses has raised questions about the fate of the remaining seized Bitcoin. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? As previously reported by NewsBTC, the US government plans to sell the remaining 41,500 BTC in connection with the Silk Road case. The US government has been selling the confiscated BTC in batches since then, and the upcoming sale of 41,500 BTC could have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. If there is no demand for Bitcoin when the US government sells the remaining BTC, it could lead to a drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. This is because the sudden influx of BTC into the market could create an oversupply, which could overwhelm the existing demand. As a result, the market price of BTC could fall, leading to a temporary drop in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value. Related Reading: Polygon Volume Registers Sharp Increase, What Does It Mean? However, it&#8217;s important to note that the impact of the government&#8217;s BTC sale on the market is not entirely predictable. If buyers are willing to purchase the BTC at the offered price, then the market may not experience much volatility.  On the other hand, if demand for BTC is strong and buyers are willing to pay a premium for the confiscated BTC, the sale could push BTC prices higher. Despite these concerns, BTC appears to be regaining its bullish momentum, attempting to breach the $31,000 mark. If BTC can consolidate above this resistance level, it could signal a potential upward trend in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value.  Currently, BTC is trading at $30,700, which is the same price level as it was in the 24-hour timeframe from July 11th. BTC&#8217;s support floor at $30,000 has been holding up well, despite poor price action. This could serve as a threshold for Bitcoin bulls in case of another failed attempt to breach the upper resistance lines in the short term.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A significant development has emerged in the ongoing saga surrounding the defunct criminal online marketplace Silk Road. On-chain <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/3c4e8e98890fa5c633d2a4f853751513e0a6558baa2318914eec73c727ef8316" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">data </a>suggest that a massive amount of funds tied to the marketplace is on the move, with more than 9,000 Bitcoin (BTC) recently transferred from two Silk Road-related addresses. The <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/3c4e8e98890fa5c633d2a4f853751513e0a6558baa2318914eec73c727ef8316.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">addresses </a>in question are suspected to have been seized by the US Department of Justice.</p>
<h2>US Government BTC On The Move?</h2>
<p>The latest transfer of funds follows the seizure of over 50,000 Bitcoin from James Zhong, who recently pled guilty to wire fraud for unlawfully obtaining the Bitcoin from the Silk Road dark web marketplace in 2012. Law enforcement <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/us-attorney-announces-historic-336-billion-cryptocurrency-seizure-and-conviction" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seized </a>the Bitcoin from Zhong&#8217;s home in Gainesville, Georgia, in November 2021, in what was the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the history of the US Department of Justice.</p>

<p>According to court filings, Zhong created a string of Silk Road accounts to conceal his identity, triggering over 140 transactions in rapid succession to trick Silk Road&#8217;s withdrawal-processing system into releasing approximately 50,000 BTC into his accounts. </p>
<p>He then transferred the Bitcoin into separate addresses under his control, all in a manner designed to prevent detection and obfuscate the Bitcoin&#8217;s source.</p>
<p>Zhong&#8217;s possession of the 50,000 Bitcoin led to him receiving 50,000 Bitcoin Cash in a hard fork coin split in August 2017. He then exchanged all the BCH Crime Proceeds for additional Bitcoin, amounting to approximately 3,500 Bitcoin of additional crime proceeds. By the last quarter of 2017, Zhong possessed roughly 53,500 Bitcoin of total crime proceeds.</p>
<p>In March 2022, Zhong began voluntarily surrendering to the government additional Bitcoin that he had access to and had not dissipated. In total, he surrendered 1,004.14621836 additional Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The US government had previously sold 9,800 Bitcoin in March 2022, with plans to sell another 41,500 BTC. However, the recent transfer of more than 9,000 BTC from the Silk Road-related addresses has raised questions about the fate of the remaining seized Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy?</h2>
<p>As previously reported by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/us-govt-to-sell-41500-bitcoin-btc-in-four-batches-crash-inevitable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">NewsBTC</a>, the US government plans to sell the remaining 41,500 BTC in connection with the Silk Road case.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows Bitcoin has been stuck in a historically tight 14-day range recently, something that has decompressed into big moves in the past. Bitcoin 14-Day Range Has Been Extremely Narrow Recently According to data from the analytics firm Glassnode, the 14-day range has only been narrower than now during less than 2% of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s entire trading life. The &#8220;14-day range&#8221; here refers to the percentage difference between the top and bottom recorded in the Bitcoin price during the past two weeks. This indicator can tell us about how volatile the asset&#8217;s price has been recently. When its value is high, it means that the coin has observed a large amount of fluctuation within the last fourteen days, and thus, the price has registered high volatility. On the other hand, low values of the metric imply the cryptocurrency hasn&#8217;t been that volatile as its price has moved by only a low percentage during the past couple of weeks. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin 14-day range over the entire history of the asset: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite low in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As highlighted in the above graph, the Bitcoin 14-day range is currently at a value of just 4.6%, which means that the local high and low within the past two weeks have differed by just 4.6%. This is an extremely low value when compared to what has generally been the norm for BTC. In the chart, Glassnode has also marked the instances where the indicator has observed even lower values than right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Braces For CPI Figures: Will BTC Rally Or Retreat Today? As can be seen from the purple bars, there have only been very few occurrences where Bitcoin has traded inside a narrower range. In terms of the numbers, only 2,176 hours in the lifetime of the asset have registered lower values of the metric, which are equivalent to about 1.9% of the entire trading life of the oldest cryptocurrency. An interesting pattern has historically followed whenever the indicator has recorded such low values of the 14-day range. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that Bitcoin has usually succeeded in these periods of extremely low volatility with a violent move. Related Reading: Bitcoin And NASDAQ Composite Index Correlation Drops To A 2-Year Low This violent move can be towards either direction, as both crashes and rallies have followed a narrow range. Though, curiously, the majority of these moves have been towards the upside. The latest occurrence of this pattern was way back in January, right before the current rally initially started. It would appear that back then as well, the tight range exploded into a sharp upwards move. If history is anything to go by, the current low values of the 14-day range may mean that another sharp Bitcoin move may be likely to take place in the near future. And naturally, if precedence is to consider, such a move may be more probable to be towards the up direction.

<h2>Bitcoin 14-Day Range Has Been Extremely Narrow Recently</h2>
<p>According to data from the analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1678712876515618818" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Glassnode</a>, the 14-day range has only been narrower than now during less than 2% of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s entire trading life.

					<description><![CDATA[FTT, the native token of the controversial FTX ecosystem, has been pumping lately. This recent price upswing was triggered by the launch of a customer claims portal, an online platform for customers to access their account information and submit electronic proof of claims in FTX’s restructuring proceedings.  Although the portal became unavailable barely an hour after launch, the price of FTT has managed to stay afloat, with a 21% increase in the last day. FTX Claims Portal Goes Offline For Unknown Reasons Last month, the debtors in FTX’s insolvency case announced that an online claims portal was in the final stages of launch. The portal reportedly went live on Tuesday, July 11, enabling customers of the bankrupt crypto exchange to access their account information. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Ecosystem Token BONE Surges 88%, Too Late To Buy? The platform &#8211; before going offline &#8211; said users can access their account balance as of November 11, 2022 &#8211; the day FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States. Then, if required, customers would also be able to submit an electronic proof of claim with the FTX Debtors’ claims and noticing agent (Kroll Restructuring Administration). However, the claims portal only stayed live for about an hour before going down for unknown reasons. As of this writing, there has been no official statement from FTX addressing the crash. That said, it is worth noting that customers still have until September 29, 2023, to file a claim. This can be done via alternative means besides the website, like through US mail. FTT Rallies 21% In A Single Day &#8211; Price Overview After the FTX claims portal went live yesterday, the FTX token (FTT) received a lot of attention from crypto enthusiasts. And the token’s price showed a positive reaction, gaining more than 24% roughly an hour after the launch.  However, this price surge was short-lived, as the FTT token soon shed a considerable chunk of its early gain. This is understood to be in response to the claims portal going offline. It is worth noting that FTT has been on a positive run in recent weeks. According to CoinGecko data, the token’s value has increased by nearly 117% in the past month. That said, it appears that FTT won’t be staying down for long. The cryptocurrency looks set to touch the previous 24-hour high of $1.79 again, with a 6.7% price increase in the last hour.

					<description><![CDATA[Conflux (CFX) has recently recorded a significant price rise following a few days of bearish movements. According to data from CoinMarketCap, CFX has gained by 11.39% in the last 24 hours, emerging as the day&#8217;s top gainer. So what&#8217;s driving this price gain? Bank of China Announces SIM Card NFC Payments, Sparks Excitement In The Conflux Community.  On July 10, The Bank of China announced it would be commencing the testing of SIM card-linked payments using the digital renminbi &#8211; known as digital yuan &#8211; starting from July 11- yesterday. According to its statement, the state-owned bank claims to be conducting this program in collaboration with telecommunications giants China Telecom and China Unicom. Related Reading: Conflux (CFX) Sheds 16% Despite $18 Million Investment From DWF Labs The project aims to enable payments using a near-field communication protocol (NFC) and a technology known as “super SIM cards.”  Basically, users will be able to process digital yuan payments by bringing their mobile phones in contact with designated payment terminals.  That said, following the emergence of this news in mainstream social media today, there has been a wave of excitement in the CFX community, with some hinting that the latest move by the Bank of China could boost the adoption of CFX in the future.  For context, the Conflux Network signed a partnership with China Telecom to develop a Blockchain-powered SIM card (BSIM) back in May 2023. Given this, it appears that some CFX fans believe the Conflux Network will play a significant role in the new SIM Card e-CNY payment system.  The excitement in the CFX community translated into positive price movement, with CFX surging by 11% this morning to hit a peak price of $0.2031. Prior to this price increase, CFX had seen its market price fall from $0.197 to as low as $0.175 over the last seven days.  At the time of writing, CFX is currently trading at $0.201 with a 0.20% loss in the last hour. However, the token’s trading volume has risen 135.79% and is valued at $75.4 million. With a market cap of $617.6 million, Conflux is ranked as the 67th biggest cryptocurrency on the market. CFX Trading At $0.200 On The 4-Hour Chart &#124; Source: CFXUSD Chart On Tradingview.com CFX Price Analysis And Prediction  Analyzing the CFX’s 4-Hour chart, the token appears to be headed for a resistance zone at $0.214. If the asset&#8217;s bullish momentum is sufficient to break through this zone, it could trade as high as $0.289, which marks its next support zone.  Related Reading: Conflux Claims Its Place Among Top Altcoins As CFX Price Skyrockets 46% However, an overwhelming bearish force at the $0.214 price zone will cause CFX to fall, retesting at the $0.171 support level. That said, it is important that long-term traders note that the CFX market is currently in a downward trend stretching as far back as March.  Featured Image From Conflux Network, Chart From Tradingview.]]></description>
