<p>New York, United States, 10th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>The program aims to help Web3&rsquo;s rising stars boost their media presence, community growth and brand awareness in exchange for project tokens.</p>
<p>The Web3 space is growing rapidly and new startups are emerging daily, with investment into Web3 projects skyrocketing to $30 billion in 2021 and around $36 billion in 2022.</p>
<p>While many Web3 founders have great ideas and a strong value proposition to bring to the space, this is a challenging field riddled with competition and a lack of trust from the broader audience.</p>
<p>Founded in 2013, Cointelegraph has grown to become a world leader in the digital assets, metaverse and emerging technologies media space, with over 20 million readers worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company is now looking to help other rising stars reach their full potential and is delighted to introduce its Accelerator program &mdash; a startup booster leveraging the company&rsquo;s capabilities as a strong media and strategic partner, including content, branding, network, marketing, investor relations and much more.</p>
What is the Cointelegraph Accelerator program?
<p>Cointelegraph Accelerator will leverage the expertise of the global Cointelegraph team, which consists of over 150 professionals working across and developing global media products in 11 different languages.</p>
<p>The program focuses on decentralized finance, nonfungible tokens, GameFi, Web3 social, cross-chain and layer 2 solutions, as well as other segments of the broader Web3 industry. It has already onboarded over a dozen companies and publicly opened the application process for new candidates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While many accelerator programs focus on advisory, followed by monetary investments, Cointelegraph takes a different route. Participants will be able to receive contributions from Cointelegraph in the form of media products available in our ecosystem including advertorials, individually tailored special projects, educational materials, native content integrations and much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the program&rsquo;s key features is that it will be run by a separate commercial arm independent of Cointelegraph&rsquo;s editorial team. Startups will be able to participate in the program in exchange for their projects&rsquo; native tokens or equity, subject to specific conditions. By doing so, Cointelegraph will align its interest in the project&rsquo;s success and growth in token value with supported teams.</p>
<p>Strategic support in the program will typically run from nine to 24 months and will be based on the participating startup&rsquo;s roadmap milestones, marketing and strategic goals. With long-term success in mind, Cointelegraph will leverage its vast partner network to offer a comprehensive, 360-degree marketing strategy to support the program&rsquo;s portfolio of projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This support comes in various shapes and forms, depending on each individual project&rsquo;s needs. Cointelegraph can offer support in marketing, branding and introductions to investors, exchanges, mentors, market makers, technological partners and online and offline events.</p>
<p>Paul Solntsev, Head of Cointelegraph Accelerator, said: &ldquo;We are excited to expand our product suite with the Accelerator program, bringing more knowledge and education to our worldwide audience, especially regarding emerging tech startups and evolutions in Web3.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paul continued: &ldquo;We welcome companies with strong convictions and innovative projects to apply for the program and join our partner network to bring long-lasting value to the industry.&rdquo;</p>
How to participate&nbsp;
<p>Cointelegraph is looking to support projects in their early stages of development that have already designed a product ready for market, usually between pre-seed and Series A stage. A well-outlined roadmap and project documentation with clearly defined utility for the token are also required.</p>
<p>To become part of the Cointelegraph Accelerator program, projects should visit the official Accelerator program website, where they can familiarize themselves with Cointelegraphs offers as a recognized media leader and brand establishment partner. From there, they can also apply.</p>
