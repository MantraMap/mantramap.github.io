The dynamic and ever-evolving blockchain community has shown a great deal of interest in and enthusiasm for Toncoin (TON). Due to its technological underpinnings and innovative answers to the long-standing problems that have plagued the field of decentralized finance, this digital money has risen to popularity very quickly. At the time of writing, TON was trading at $1.46, registering an impressive 10.4% increase in the last 24 hours. Equally impressive is the crypto&#8217;s price rally in the last week, when it registered a 22% climb, data from crypto market tracker Coingecko shows.

Source: Coingecko Just lately, the price of Toncoin broke out in a big way, separating itself from a 30-day consolidation. During this period of consolidation, prices moved inexactly between $1.31 and $1.49, showing a restricted and steady trading range. Toncoin Shows Signs Of Resilience Several times throughout this period of consolidation, the cryptocurrency showed signs of trying to rise beyond the $1.50 barrier, which may have suggested a possible upward trend. However, bullish market forces were unable to push the price over the $1.50 level, and the price ultimately closed below that level. The continuation of these adverse influences indicates that traders and investors are currently exercising caution. The bears&#8217; stubbornness implies there&#8217;s a widespread view that the market can&#8217;t handle a prolonged rise above $1.50 just yet. As of today, cryptocurrencies reached a market cap of $1.13 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com Toncoin At A Glance The Open Network, or TON for short, is a layer-1 blockchain that is both decentralized and fast. Established in 2018, it is a proof-of-stake (PoS) network that has gained massive adoption among crypto users for its lightning-fast transactions.

However, it encountered difficulty at every turn of its path. Despite the project&#8217;s initial focus on Gram, its native digital currency, it ran into trouble when the US Securities and Exchange Commission pointed out Telegram&#8217;s failure to register a substantial preliminary $1.7 billion Gram token sale. Source: Currency.com Possible Revisit Of Resistance Level This regulatory worry caused a brief halt in Gram sales, and the unrevealed offering ultimately led to a legal setback. Simultaneously, a slew of cyberattacks cast a pall over the TON&#8217;s appeal. Meanwhile, the present market structure indicates that the Toncoin price may revisit the resistance level of $1.49 if bulls can push prices above the support turned resistance of $1.31. For this to be even remotely credible, a candle closure over $1.31 would be required. If the TON price, however, rejects $1.31, it may return to the current support level of $1.17.
