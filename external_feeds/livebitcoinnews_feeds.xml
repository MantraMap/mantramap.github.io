<li>Bitcoin cash price started a fresh decline from the $112 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $105 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $103 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $98 and $95 support levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining from the $112 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-of-another-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could decline heavily if there is a move below $95.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $111 and $112 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $111.38 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $110 and $105 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below the $100 support and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bears-in-action-can-they-clear-the-100-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. It traded as low as $97.52 before there was an upside correction.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $111.38 swing high to $97.52 low. However, the price is struggling to rise above the $102 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $103 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $111.38 swing high to $97.52 low.</p>
<p>The main resistance sits near the $105 level.  Any more gains above $103 and $105 could set the pace for a move towards the $112 level. If there is a move above the $112 resistance, the price could rise towards the $120 zone.</p>
<p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $98 zone. The next major support is near the $95 level, below which the bears might aim $88. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $80 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anthony Scaramucci – the founder of Sky Bridge Capital and the former communications director for President Donald Trump – has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/11/scaramucci-on-ftx-sam-bankman-fried-and-the-worst-week-in-cryptocurrency-history.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">given his thoughts on</a> the FTX debacle and the fall of what was labeled one of the biggest and most prominent crypto exchanges in the space.</p>
<h2>Anthony Scaramucci Gives His Thoughts on FTX</h2>
<p>FTX took a 30 percent stake in Sky Bridge last September. At the time of writing, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">company has filed</a> bankruptcy and the executive behind it all, Sam Bankman-Fried, has resigned from his post. The company began experiencing trouble in mid-November after it attempted to be bought out by Binance following what online posts described as a “liquidity crunch.”</p>
<p>From there, it looked <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">like there was going</a> to be a merger between Binance and FTX, though this was later cancelled given Binance felt the problems FTX was dealing with would be too big to handle. This is what led the firm into further demise and eventual bankruptcy.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bankman-Fried is getting a lot of flak for his role in the enterprise’s fall. Some are claiming that he played around with investors’ money and took too many chances. Others are stating that his greed and malicious nature led to FTX’s collapse. Scaramucci is dismissing all these claims for now, and he’s reluctant to say that there was any fraud contributing to what occurred.</p>
<p>In an interview, he commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t want to call it fraud at this moment because that’s a legal term. I would implore Sam and his family to tell the truth to their investors. Get to the bottom of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scaramucci feels that more than likely what happened is Bankman-Fried made mistakes while coping with the bear market, which he thinks can be said for many companies including Voyager Digital and even the Celsius Network, two firms <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-in-the-age-of-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">that eventually went</a> on to file bankruptcy earlier in the year. He doesn’t necessarily think these companies are bad or did anything malicious.</p>
<p>Rather, he wonders if they simply “lost their cool” as a means of dealing with the bearish conditions 2022 has brought on, and that they weren’t thinking clearly during this time. He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Three Arrows went down, it could be possible that Sam had difficulty then, and then he made some decisions that turned out to be disastrous for him and both sides of this business.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Maybe Nothing Nasty Was Happening</h2>
<p>Scaramucci then went on to say that he had spent time personally looking into what might have happened, and his research leads him to conclude that there was no illegal activity involved. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Duped I guess is the right word, but I am very disappointed because I do like Sam. I don’t know what happened because I was not an insider at FTX.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new lawsuit centering around failed exchange FTX has named legendary sports stars like Tom Brady and David Ortiz as potential defendants. Many of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/ortiz-brady-named-among-defendants-in-lawsuit-over-ftx-collapse/ar-AA14bFG8" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">these individuals have long</a> been associated with FTX and promoted what is now considered a fraudulent and twisted exchange.</p>
<h2>Tom Brady and Others Are Being Sued</h2>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court of Miami, Florida. Not long ago, FTX had purchased the naming rights of the home arena for the Miami Heat.</p>
<p>The lawsuit states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Part of the scheme employed by the FTX entities involved utilizing some of the biggest names in sports and entertainment, like these defendants, to raise funds and drive American consumers to invest in the (yield-bearing accounts), which were offered and sold largely from the FTX entities’ domestic base of operations here in Miami, Florida, pouring billions of dollars into the deceptive FTX platform to keep the whole scheme afloat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Figures like Brady and Ortiz have <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sports-stars-stephen-curry-and-tom-brady-join-the-ftx-exchange-family-as-ambassadors/" data-wpel-link="internal">operated as brand ambassadors</a> for FTX in the past. According to the suit, this makes them liable for any losses or damages incurred by traders. Brady’s now ex-wife Giselle Bundchen has also been named in the lawsuit due to her taking part in the firm’s promotion.</p>
<p>Brady has also appeared <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tom-brady-featured-in-new-ftx-crypto-commercial/" data-wpel-link="internal">in several commercials</a> for FTX, the most recent of which poked fun at the bitcoin mining process. Brady was seen with a flamethrower in hand and burning away at a huge block of ice. Once the ice melted, a large bitcoin was revealed.</p>
<p>The lawsuit continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FTX entities and defendants made numerous misrepresentations and omissions to plaintiff and class members about the deceptive FTX platform in order to induce confidence and to drive consumers to invest in what was ultimately a Ponzi scheme, misleading customers and prospective customers with the false impression that any cryptocurrency assets held on the deceptive FTX platform were safe and were not being invested in unregistered securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FTX exchange will go down as one of the biggest embarrassments of the crypto world. Once considered a top exchange, the enterprise came to a sudden halt in mid-November when it was announced that Sam Bankman-Fried – the man behind the platform – was approaching Binance as a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-i-the-fall-of-a-token/" data-wpel-link="internal">means of garnering additional</a> funds to keep the business in play. At the time, FTX was allegedly enduring a liquidity crunch.</p>
<h2>A Major Disappointment</h2>
<p>While Binance initially took <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">on the idea of the</a> merger, the notion was later rejected given that the exchange felt FTX’s problems were too big for it to handle. Since then, FTX <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">has filed bankruptcy</a> and Sam Bankman-Fried has resigned from his position as head executive of the company.</p>
<p>Another top name included in the lawsuit was Kevin O’Leary, a known crypto bull and star of the reality series “Shark Tank.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The California Attorney General’s office is <a href="https://fox5sandiego.com/news/california-wire/california-launches-cryptocurrency-information-website/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">launching a new website</a> warning people of the risks that come with digital currencies.</p>
<h2>California Is Warning Traders About Crypto&#8217;s Dangers</h2>
<p>California says there are simply too many crypto scams out there that people have fallen for. Regulators in the Golden State suggest that between the Ponzi schemes, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/romance-scam/" data-wpel-link="internal">the romance scams</a>, and all the other digital dangers out there, crypto has given way to a world of criminality that cannot be controlled unless people have the right knowledge.</p>
<p>California attorney general Rob Bonta explained in a recent news release:</p>
<blockquote><p>From celebrities to your next-door neighbor, it seems like everyone these days is investing in cryptocurrency based on the promise of fast and easy money. Don’t fall for a fantasy. Cryptocurrency, like all investments, carries significant risks, and there’s no guarantee that you’ll see large – or any – returns.</p></blockquote>
<p>The website will feature information about what to avoid while also providing tips for those seeking to engage in legitimate crypto trades. Some of the data will discuss purchasing non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for example. It will also answer questions regarding the sale and transfer of digital assets.</p>
<p>Bonta was adamant that anyone looking to engage in crypto trading needs to do their due diligence and check out the legitimacy of every exchange or company they do business with. He says traders need to be aware of the problems stemming from the space and that they should ensure they’re always spending money wisely.</p>
<p>He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>You should only invest money you are willing to lose, and you should be on the lookout for red flags and potential scams.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the tips the website gives are to avoid any promotions that involve celebrity faces or endorsements. Bonta and his team said that many of these promotions are not real, and that several of these celebrities have not given permission for their likenesses to be utilized. Thus, traders are likely entering phony trading schemes that could see their money vanish for good.</p>
<p>He also said that any coins bearing names similar with mainstream currencies should be avoided at all costs. A prime example is Ethereum Max, which of course, stems from the Ethereum digital currency, presently the second largest cryptocurrency in the world.</p>
<h2>What to Steer Clear Of</h2>
<p>Not long ago, reality star Kim Kardashian was hit with a $1 million+ <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/kim-kardashian-settles-with-the-sec-over-ethereum-max-promotion/" data-wpel-link="internal">financial penalty by the SEC for unlawfully</a> promoting the asset.</p>
<p>Lastly, Bonta says that no legitimate cryptocurrency firm will bombard you with phone calls or other forms of contact. You should not respond to phone calls, nor should you give in if any of these firms require heavy payments. He also said that no company can guarantee large returns, and thus statements revolving around what you’ll get back should not be believed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenal rise of NFTs in the last few years surprised many, but experts and enthusiasts long believed in the potential held by this domain of the blockchain space. The costliest NFT to date was sold just a few months ago for a whopping $91.8 million. And there are several others fetching millions of dollars in the market. The meteoric rise led to an increased interest in the domain and attracted more investors. But the dearth of reliable marketplaces significantly hindered the mass adoption of NFTs. The few options that seemed reliable had a high transaction fee, another major deterrent. Besides, most decentralized NFT marketplaces don’t offer a user-friendly interface and are often deemed a little too complex by new users.</p>
<p>But, this changes with the release of Upstairs, an NFT marketplace that intends to transform the whole user experience game for good and place users’ interests at the top. The UI has been kept simple enough to allow even those new to the space, with little or no understanding of Web 3.0, crypto wallets, or blockchain, to mint NFTs easily.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.upstairs.io/home/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Upstairs</a> is one of the best NFT marketplaces developed to date and will officially launch for the public on October 10, 2022. The platform has multi-chain integration and supports ETH and BNB chains for deposit and payment, thus allowing users to explore and trade an extensive range of NFTs on different blockchains. CertiK also audited Upstairs’ Smart Contracts.</p>
<p>Upstairs aims to eliminate the commonly encountered problems on other platforms while offering a simple and interactive UI, in addition to a seamless registration process. Users can easily register with an email address and start trading NFTs, unlike other platforms with an extensive and intricate registration process.</p>
<p>Upstairs will only list the most exclusive and curated collections, some with bundled utilities, from the most reputed artists. The platform has already collaborated with great names in the industry, including <a href="http://www.chizhang.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Zhang Chi</a>, <a href="https://huteford.artstation.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Huteford</a>, and <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/462997690_523187" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Yang Ga</a>, amongst others. They are all accomplished artists with a massive social media following, and users go crazy over their creations. Before every listing, Upstairs will sign a contract with the IP source and the artist to ensure exclusivity. And anyone fairly acquainted with the space would realize how exclusivity drives the value of NFTs.</p>
<p>The platform offers several exciting features, all in line with the current market dynamics and user requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lowest fees: </strong>Upstairs realizes the importance of low transaction fees and, as a result, has kept it at 6%, which includes both the Royalties and the Platform fees. Besides, there is no gas fee, achieved through the integration of Layer 2 technologies at the backend, or hidden charges involved whatsoever, making it one of the most cost-effective NFT marketplaces to trade.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced accessibility: </strong>Upstairs intends to become the most accessible platform for the community and employs features like mass buying and selling. It allows users to make payments in fiat currency. Also, it supports multiple languages, thus making it accessible for people worldwide.</li>
<li><strong>Multi payment options: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Upstairs allows users to directly deposit funds via crypto exchanges, thus simplifying the whole process.</li>
<li>For those without crypto holdings, Upstairs also allows the use of regular credit cards, both Visa and Master.</li>
<li>The platform has already partnered with XanPool, Alchemy Pay &amp; Simplex to offer seamless local payment options.</li>
<li>Upstairs also plans to add many more payment gateways in the future, and users would, most certainly, find the one they prefer the most.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Additional rewards: </strong>Profits from trades are usually not enough for users, given the market’s volatility, and additional rewards play a vital role. Upstairs offers a referral and automatic rebate program to increase earnings and further cut down on transaction costs. With Upstairs, users can earn as high as 2% rewards through the rebate program, something that remains a distant dream on most marketplaces.</li>
<li><strong>Region-specific developments:</strong> As discussed earlier, Upstairs intends to become the most significant player in the NFT marketplace. And to achieve this, it will deliver curated content to users in different parts of the globe. Whether a historical piece of art or a trendy fashion, it will all be available as collectibles on the custodial NFT marketplace.</li>
<li><strong>Staking: </strong>Staking, of late, has become one of the preferred investment strategies, given that it delivers stable and regular profits. Users on Upstairs can stake tokens earned from trading and establish a steady stream of funds.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time statistics: </strong>Trading requires detailed knowledge of the various aspects involving NFT, including real-time data. Upstairs has it ready and arranged in a systematic order for quick understanding. Users can identify the rarity of an NFT, verify its ranking, and check the sales volume.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s not all! Upstairs has also employed the most advanced security protocols to provide complete security and safety. Also, the collections listed on the marketplace are verified beforehand for authenticity to ensure the user’s peace of mind.</p>
<p>Another vital aspect of NFTs that Upstairs wants to tap into is their real-world utility. Most of the NFTs available out there are nothing more than digital art simply stored in the wallet. But the ones available on Upstairs can be used in games, and many will have real-world applications. Besides, the value of every piece will be justified based on past trading and the benefits it stands to offer.</p>
<p>As Co-founder &amp; CEO of Upstairs, <a href="https://twitter.com/rexteo_ups" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">Rex Teo</a> mentions, “The purpose of Upstairs is to reduce blockchain complexities for all users by bridging Web3.0’s technologies into Web2.0’s domain, allowing every user to trade NFTs with seamless go-to options.”</p>
<p>“The NFT Industry is clearly going to be a major component in the future of digital collectibles. We look forward to revolutionizing this industry with Upstairs”</p>
<p>Upstairs has created a team of dedicated professionals, collaborated with artists, and partnered with the best marketing and legal entities to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform and for its further development. The team comprises experts in every field, which becomes apparently clear when using the platform. The simple and straightforward user interface, quick processing, seamless transactions, and plethora of features are all testament to the efforts put into the development of Upstairs.</p>
<p>So, for those planning to invest in NFTs or acquire some as collectibles, Upstairs would be a perfect choice! A wide range of collections will be available on the platform after its launch on October 10, 2022. The next few days might keep many restless, but remember, Upstairs is worth all the wait.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.90 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-of-another-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to rise if there is a clear move above $0.905.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, EOS price saw a major decline below the $1.00 zone against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.95 and $0.92 levels to enter a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The pair accelerated lower below the $0.90 support zone and settled well below the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-fresh-increase-possible-if-it-holds-this-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. It traded as low as $0.8306 and recently started an upside correction. There was a minor move above the $0.850 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price even climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.068 swing high to $0.8306 low. The price is now trading below $0.90 and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</p>
<p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $0.90 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.905 the 4-hours chart of the EOS/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.92 level, above which the price might test the $0.945 level.</p>
<p>The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.068 swing high to $0.8306 low is also near $0.945. Any more gains might send the price towards the $1.00 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $0.860. The next key support is near the $0.830 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.830 support, the price could test the $0.80 support in the near term.</p>

<p><em>Litecoin price is struggling below $70 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-of-another-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. LTC price could continue to decline if it stays below the $70 resistance zone.</em></p>
<h2>Litecoin Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few sessions, there was a fresh decline in bitcoin, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-turns-red-again-risk-of-more-downsides/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ethereum</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-bears-in-action-below-0-365/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">ripple</a>, and litecoin against the US Dollar. Earlier, LTC struggled to clear the $78 and $80 resistance levels.</p>
<p>As a result, there was a sharp bearish wave below the $75 level. There was a drop below the $72 and $70 levels. The decline gained pace below the $70 support and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The price spiked below the $65 level and tested $62.</p>
<p>A low is formed near $61 and the price is now consolidating losses. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $66.50 zone. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $84.97 swing high to $61.00 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance sits near the $68 level and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). The main resistance is near the $70 level. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $71 on the 4-hours chart of the LTC/USD pair.</p>
<p>The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $84.97 swing high to $61.00 low. A clear move above the $72 level could pump the price towards the $80 level or even $85. The next major resistance could be $92.</p>
<p>On the downside, an immediate support is near the $64.00 level. The next key support is near the $61.00 level. If there is a downside break below the $61.00 support, the price could accelerate lower towards the $58 level in the near term.</p>

<h2>Mark Cuban Isn&#8217;t Happy About the FTX Fall</h2>
<p>The FTX collapse rocked the crypto world. What was long considered one of the biggest players in the digital currency world has suddenly come crashing down without notice, and its fall from grace has led to several repercussions.</p>
<p>Allegedly experiencing a liquidity crunch, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-ii-binance-said-it-would-buy-the-firm/" data-wpel-link="internal">company approached Binance</a> for help, though the latter firm said “no,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/nov/09/ftx-binance-merger-crypto-price-falls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">claiming that the problems</a> FTX was facing were too big for it to handle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/news/article/ar-AA142UAt" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Binance explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of FTX.com. In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ftx-drama-part-iii-the-rise-and-fall-of-sam-bankman-fried/" data-wpel-link="internal">company has filed bankruptcy</a> and the founder – Sam Bankman-Fried – has stepped down from his post. Cuban believes that the company was very poorly managed, and he doesn’t doubt that there were many shady things happening behind closed doors.</p>
<p>In an interview, Cuban commented that what FTX pulled is quite common in the world of stocks, and he says that all who fell for the ploy were not investors, but rather “suckers.” He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stock market is a platform where companies pretend that their shares of stock represent ownership in their enterprise. Using this pretense, they actively market their shares to buyers, attempting to drive up the price, often buying shares themselves, to make up for lack of demand… Leveraging real or artificial demand, they issue shares to themselves to accelerate their compensation, rarely doing the same for all but the employees who are already highly compensated.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went on with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The myth of shares representing ownership falls apart when shareholders attempt to influence operations of the enterprise through recommendations or active participation in shareholder meetings where these efforts are summarily dismissed as annoyances. How am I doing so far? Their only value comes from selling to someone believing that the share will go up in value. To increase demand, the company will market their stocks to funds and brokers in hopes they will buy their stocks and recommend them to their clients. One tool is quarterly earnings calls. Another is by creating modified reporting structures like EBITDA and other invented metrics.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Investors or Suckers?</h2>
<p>He concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately for suckers, I mean investors, there are thousands of SEC approved companies that trade off the major exchanges for which there is little regulation, less information or liquidity, and where we often see BANKRUPT companies trade millions of shares.</p></blockquote>
