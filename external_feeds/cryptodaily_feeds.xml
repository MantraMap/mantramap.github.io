			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto billionaires Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss cautioned the Democratic Party that its &ldquo;war on crypto&rdquo; will result in its losing crucial voters. </p>
<p>According to the Winklevoss twins, US President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party risk losing crucial voters if it continues its &ldquo;war on crypto.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss, who founded crypto exchange Gemini with his brother Tyler, recently tweeted to warn democrats that they will &ldquo;alienate an entire generation&rdquo; of youth voters should it continue with its anti-crypto attitude.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The @SenWarren and @GaryGensler war against crypto is going to alienate an entire generation of would-be Democrats.Winning the youth vote w/ "get out the vote" is key part of Dem playbook. Dems believe the youth vote will carry the day. pic.twitter.com/F4FQowjCVn</p>
&mdash; Cameron Winklevoss (@cameron) June 10, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>Winklevoss called out SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and Senator Elizabeth Warren in his tweet.</p>
<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Crypto has already won the hearts and minds of Millennials and GenZ. They don&rsquo;t debate the merits of crypto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tyler Winklevoss followed up the next day with a tweet saying:</p>

<p>Roe cost Republicans the mid-terms. The @SenWarren and @GaryGensler war on crypto will cost Dems the 2024 election.</p>

<p>The Winklevoss twins&rsquo; statements come amid aggressive action from the SEC, led by Gensler. The agency famously sued crypto exchange Binance and rival exchange Coinbase for alleged securities violations.</p>
<p>Senator Warren also made headlines for cultivating an anti-crypto coalition under US politicians.</p>
<p>The Gemini co-founder further offered two explanations for the recent enforcement:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Two explanations: (1) blue establishment either doesn't understand what's going on w/ Warren and Gensler or (2) are grossly miscalculating impact of their actions on youth vote this upcoming election cycle.They may not care about crypto, but they will care about the lost votes.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Trading platform eToro announced on Monday that it would delist four crypto assets for its US customers, citing &ldquo;recent developments.&rdquo; </p>
<p>On Monday, social investment platform eToro said it would delist four crypto tokens from its platform for US customers. The platform announced via Twitter that US customers will no longer be able to open new positions in Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH), and Polygon (MATIC) from July 12.</p>
<p>The platform said, however, that customers will still be able to hold and sell existing positions in these tokens.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">From 6:00AM ET on Wednesday July 12th, 2023, US customers will no longer be able to open new positions in Algorand (ALGO), Decentraland (MANA), Dash (DASH) and Polygon (MATIC). Customers can continue to hold and sell existing positions in these coins. (2/5)</p>

</p>
SEC Action Leads eToro to Delist Four Tokens
<p>eToro ended support for these tokens as part of an ongoing review process.</p>
<p>The firm cited &ldquo;recent developments&rdquo; for the move, referring to the SEC&rsquo;s legal action against Binance and Coinbase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;eToro has a framework in place which reviews the cryptoassets we offer in light of the rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. Due to recent developments, we will be making some changes to our crypto offering for US customers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the lawsuit against Binance, the SEC called several popular crypto tokens unregistered securities. The suit named Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Filecoin (FIL), Decentraland (MANA), Algorand (ALGO), The Sandbox (SAND), Coti (COTI), and Axie Infinity (AXS).</p>
<p>The platform will only halt purchases for the four tokens mentioned and said it remains a supporter of crypto assets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We remain a supporter of crypto assets and believe in the importance of offering our users access to a diversified range of asset classes, which includes stocks, ETFs, and options. We are committed to working closely with regulators around the world to shape the future of the crypto industry and champion access for the ordinary investor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>eToro&rsquo;s decision comes after its competitor Robinhood announced it would end support for ADA, SOL, and MATIC.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">We've all come across captivating tales of traders who struck it rich in the world of cryptocurrencies. These stories, where a fortunate individual invested a mere $100 and reaped a staggering $100,000 in a single day, never fail to captivate readers. They simultaneously allure and intimidate us because we are well aware of the timeless axiom: high returns always come hand in hand with high risks. Nevertheless, have you ever wondered how to learn crypto trading in the least risky manner?</p>
<p class="s3">Cosmic FOMO, a product inside the MarsDAO ecosystem masterminded and launched by Vlad Utushkin, is an app that teaches cryptocurrency trading and is focused on beginners who make their first steps in the crypto world. Cosmic FOMO imparts crypto trading skills through an engaging gaming experience, allowing users to earn without risking their actual assets. With Cosmic FOMO, users can take their initial strides into the realm of secure cryptocurrency management, comprehending the intricacies of trading and mastering the mechanics of the cryptocurrency market, all in a delightful game format. The primary focus of Cosmic FOMO lies in empowering gamers to make informed choices and accurate predictions. It's like a cryptocurrency trading course but fun and engaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The team behind this project released 20+ successful out-of-the-box products. This time their mission is proclaimed to be the simplification of the transition into the world of digital assets, drawing mass adoption ever closer.</p>
How to start a Cosmic FOMO journey
<p class="s3">Gameplay unfolds in the following manner: users must select a playable character known as a pilot, which exists as a non-fungible token (NFT) within the BNB Smart Chain. These pilots require backpacks to be filled with cryptocurrencies (currently offering 15 available assets) that players believe will appreciate in value within the next 60 minutes. Once prepared, the pilot embarks on a thrilling space race. It is crucial to note that the app provides a simulation of asset acquisition, eliminating the need for users to purchase any actual assets. Each flight lasts between 10 minutes to an hour, during which the quotes of the selected assets may fluctuate. Ultimately, the income received hinges upon these fluctuations. All asset quotes are streamed directly from Binance, ensuring real-time accuracy. If players wish to secure their profits mid-flight, they have the option to terminate the race prematurely. The greater the growth of the selected assets, the higher the profits received. Those players whose predictions prove right win COSMIC, in-game tokens that can be used to upgrade pilot's stats. This unique approach enables users to learn the art of trading, comprehend the workings of the cryptocurrency market, and safeguard their tangible assets.</p>
<p class="s3">Energy replenishment occurs every six hours. For users with a single pilot, one flight per day is available, equating to 2 units of fuel. Owning a second pilot grants access to 3 units of fuel, with each subsequent pilot providing an additional unit. Accounts can accommodate a maximum of 50 pilots, but only a maximum of 17 fuels can be obtained.</p>
<p class="s3">The main feature of Cosmic FOMO is that there are no losers in this game. Even if a gamer lacks in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies or is unfamiliar with fundamental indicators that indicate future growth or decline, and even if their predictions turn out to be incorrect, they still receive in-game tokens regardless of the outcome of their gaming session. The only difference is that their reward will be comparatively smaller compared to more experienced players. This unique feature serves as one of Cosmic FOMO's primary advantages. The game was primarily designed for individuals embarking on their cryptocurrency journey. The project team aimed to create gameplay that is not only non-intimidating but also an exciting exploration into the world of cryptocurrencies, allowing future crypto owners to familiarize themselves with digital assets in a playful manner. Cosmic FOMO caters to all individuals, irrespective of their knowledge or skill level.&nbsp;</p>
Pilot Minting Bonus
<p class="s3">The game mechanics also feature the ability to independently mint pilots. In order to mint a new pilot, users need to cross two pilots that have attained a specific level known as a mint point. Each pilot can partake in minting up to 3 times, achievable at levels #11, #21, and #25. It is noteworthy that minting can transpire between pilots of varying classes and rarity levels. However, the likelihood of acquiring a rare or legendary pilot is contingent on these particular characteristics. For instance, crossing two common pilots will solely yield a common or uncommon pilot, while crossing a common pilot with a rare pilot offers a 40% chance of obtaining a rare pilot. NFTs produced via this method can be sold on the secondary market. Depending on the level and class of the newly minted pilot, owners have the potential to earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars through a single transaction. To engage in minting, players must possess COSMIC and MDAO tokens.</p>
<p class="s3">Thus, Cosmic FOMO offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to its popularity, including a balanced gameplay experience, a user-friendly interface that captivates the eye, and the incorporation of five deflationary tools that positively impact the game's equilibrium. Moreover, the game boasts straightforward mechanics that ensure accessibility for players of all backgrounds and skill levels.</p>
<p class="s3">Embrace Cosmic FOMO today, embark on an exhilarating crypto trading journey, and unlock the gateway to vast financial opportunities. This immersive game experience presents an unmatched avenue to acquire knowledge, refine trading skills, and potentially prosper in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Don't miss your chance to become the next trading prodigy!</p>

They simultaneously allure and intimidate us because we are well aware of the timeless axiom: high returns always come hand in hand with high risks. Nevertheless, have you ever wondered how to learn crypto trading in the least risky manner?</p>
<p class="s3">Cosmic FOMO, a product inside the MarsDAO ecosystem masterminded and launched by Vlad Utushkin, is an app that teaches cryptocurrency trading and is focused on beginners who make their first steps in the crypto world. Cosmic FOMO imparts crypto trading skills through an engaging gaming experience, allowing users to earn without risking their actual assets. With Cosmic FOMO, users can take their initial strides into the realm of secure cryptocurrency management, comprehending the intricacies of trading and mastering the mechanics of the cryptocurrency market, all in a delightful game format. The primary focus of Cosmic FOMO lies in empowering gamers to make informed choices and accurate predictions. It's like a cryptocurrency trading course but fun and engaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">The team behind this project released 20+ successful out-of-the-box products. This time their mission is proclaimed to be the simplification of the transition into the world of digital assets, drawing mass adoption ever closer.</p>
How to start a Cosmic FOMO journey
<p class="s3">Gameplay unfolds in the following manner: users must select a playable character known as a pilot, which exists as a non-fungible token (NFT) within the BNB Smart Chain. These pilots require backpacks to be filled with cryptocurrencies (currently offering 15 available assets) that players believe will appreciate in value within the next 60 minutes. Once prepared, the pilot embarks on a thrilling space race. It is crucial to note that the app provides a simulation of asset acquisition, eliminating the need for users to purchase any actual assets. Each flight lasts between 10 minutes to an hour, during which the quotes of the selected assets may fluctuate. Ultimately, the income received hinges upon these fluctuations. All asset quotes are streamed directly from Binance, ensuring real-time accuracy. If players wish to secure their profits mid-flight, they have the option to terminate the race prematurely. The greater the growth of the selected assets, the higher the profits received. Those players whose predictions prove right win COSMIC, in-game tokens that can be used to upgrade pilot's stats. This unique approach enables users to learn the art of trading, comprehend the workings of the cryptocurrency market, and safeguard their tangible assets.</p>
<p class="s3">Energy replenishment occurs every six hours. For users with a single pilot, one flight per day is available, equating to 2 units of fuel. Owning a second pilot grants access to 3 units of fuel, with each subsequent pilot providing an additional unit. Accounts can accommodate a maximum of 50 pilots, but only a maximum of 17 fuels can be obtained.</p>
<p class="s3">The main feature of Cosmic FOMO is that there are no losers in this game. Even if a gamer lacks in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies or is unfamiliar with fundamental indicators that indicate future growth or decline, and even if their predictions turn out to be incorrect, they still receive in-game tokens regardless of the outcome of their gaming session. The only difference is that their reward will be comparatively smaller compared to more experienced players. This unique feature serves as one of Cosmic FOMO's primary advantages. The game was primarily designed for individuals embarking on their cryptocurrency journey. The project team aimed to create gameplay that is not only non-intimidating but also an exciting exploration into the world of cryptocurrencies, allowing future crypto owners to familiarize themselves with digital assets in a playful manner. Cosmic FOMO caters to all individuals, irrespective of their knowledge or skill level.&nbsp;</p>
Pilot Minting Bonus
<p class="s3">The game mechanics also feature the ability to independently mint pilots. In order to mint a new pilot, users need to cross two pilots that have attained a specific level known as a mint point. Each pilot can partake in minting up to 3 times, achievable at levels #11, #21, and #25. It is noteworthy that minting can transpire between pilots of varying classes and rarity levels. However, the likelihood of acquiring a rare or legendary pilot is contingent on these particular characteristics. For instance, crossing two common pilots will solely yield a common or uncommon pilot, while crossing a common pilot with a rare pilot offers a 40% chance of obtaining a rare pilot. NFTs produced via this method can be sold on the secondary market. Depending on the level and class of the newly minted pilot, owners have the potential to earn hundreds or even thousands of dollars through a single transaction. To engage in minting, players must possess COSMIC and MDAO tokens.</p>
<p class="s3">Thus, Cosmic FOMO offers a multitude of benefits that contribute to its popularity, including a balanced gameplay experience, a user-friendly interface that captivates the eye, and the incorporation of five deflationary tools that positively impact the game's equilibrium. Moreover, the game boasts straightforward mechanics that ensure accessibility for players of all backgrounds and skill levels.</p>
<p class="s3">Embrace Cosmic FOMO today, embark on an exhilarating crypto trading journey, and unlock the gateway to vast financial opportunities. This immersive game experience presents an unmatched avenue to acquire knowledge, refine trading skills, and potentially prosper in the exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Don't miss your chance to become the next trading prodigy!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution Polygon (MATIC) has unveiled its Version 2.0, the blueprint for which will be revealed over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>The layer-2 scaling solution is calling its latest iteration the &ldquo;value layer of the internet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
The Blueprint For Polygon 2.0&nbsp;
<p>According to a blog post published by Polygon, it will be revealing the blueprint over the next few weeks. It would also address several topics, including the future of the Polygon Proof-of-Stake chain, the utility and evolution of Polygon&rsquo;s token, and the transition to greater community governance and involvement when it comes to the protocol and treasury. The blog post stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the coming weeks, we will detail each component of Polygon 2.0, addressing topics like the future of the Polygon PoS chain, the utility and evolution of the Polygon token, and the transition to greater community governance of the protocol and treasury. We will lay out a roadmap for how Polygon will become the Value Layer of the Internet, offering unlimited scalability and unified liquidity via ZK technology.&rdquo;</p>

The Value Layer Of The Internet&nbsp;
<p>Polygon added that its vision behind creating the &ldquo;value layer of the internet,&rdquo; as it calls Polygon 2.0, is to enable digital ownership, decentralized finance (DeFi), and new means for coordination. Polygon 2.0 will consist of a network of zero-knowledge (ZK) layer 2 chains. These chains will be able to communicate seamlessly among themselves, giving users the feeling that they are using a single chain. The blog post highlighted the limitations of individual blockchains when it comes to throughput.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Individual blockchains aren&rsquo;t infinitely scalable; they have strict throughput limits. We can add capacity by creating new chains, but not without fragmenting liquidity and reducing security and capital efficiency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the blog post, Polygon 2.0 could support an unlimited number of chains, enabling cross-chain interactions to occur seamlessly, securely, and instantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polygon 2.0 is a network of ZK-powered L2 chains, unified via a novel cross-chain coordination protocol. For a user, the entire network will feel like using a single chain. The network can support a practically unlimited number of chains, and cross-chain interactions can happen safely and instantly, without additional security or trust assumptions. Unlimited scalability and unified liquidity.&rdquo;</p>

Version 2.0 Rollout&nbsp;
<p>Polygon 2.0 has been created after collaboration between Polygon Labs, researchers, developers, node operators, validators, applications, and the larger Ethereum and Polygon communities. Polygon plans to detail all the components of Version 2.0 over the next few weeks through a series of podcasts, community meets, blog posts, and AMAs. The protocol also highlighted a series of important dates for the community to follow over the next four weeks, on which it will make a series of announcements related to the blockchain&rsquo;s architecture, token, and governance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only chain from Polygon that incorporates ZK technology is the Polygon zkEVM Beta, which was released to the public in March. ZK technology is a type of scaling solution that utilizes zero-knowledge proofs to reduce transaction fees and help blockchains scale. While Polygon&rsquo;s primary Proof-of-Stake chain is not ZK-compatible, the protocol is exploring the possibility of incorporating ZK technology into its primary chain.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After the lawsuits presented by Gensler and the SEC, the crypto market underwent a correction followed by a subsequent rebound to a lower level. Tradecurve is unaffected by the move, and the price is set to rise soon.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin price action
<p>Although the entire crypto market is down, including Bitcoin, BTC is the only coin that SEC chair Gary Gensler does not think is a security, based on the way the coins were mined and the level of decentralization. Nevertheless, Bitcoin still reacted to the news of the Binance and Coinbase lawsuits, on the 6th of June. Bitcoin&rsquo;s price fell as low as $25,600, before rebounding to $27,216, correcting again, and is now going back up, and is currently trading at $26,666.</p>
<p>Based on the ongoing price action, Bitcoin exhibits a robust support level around $25,000, which closely aligns with the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level derived from the rally spanning $10,000 to $65,000. Upholding its current level may catalyze a rebound, prompting Bitcoin to test resistance levels positioned at $30,000, $35,000, and $40,000. However, breaching this threshold could instigate a further sell-off, potentially pushing Bitcoin down to $20,000 or below.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Ethereum - shaken but not stirred (too much)
<p>Ethereum was notably absent from the list of crypto currencies declared a security, and similarly saw a price reaction, falling to $1806 after the news, rebounding to $1895, and is, at time of writing, sitting at $1844.</p>
<p>Therefore, just as we have seen support for Bitcoin, Ethereum demonstrates a comparable support level around $1,800 where the bulls jumped in, in proximity to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level obtained from the surge in its history from $300 to $4,400.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Ethereum upholds this level, it could trigger a recovery, propelling Ethereum towards resistance levels situated at $2,000, $2,500, and $3,000. Conversely, if this threshold is breached, Ethereum may experience a decline towards $1,500 or lower.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve presents a solution needed now more than ever
<p>In the wake of the SEC&rsquo;s targeting of two of the biggest centralized exchanges, a new solution is needed. DEXes like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Curve have experienced huge inflows of money as people look to store and trade their crypto on-chain.</p>
<p>However, although some of those exchanges offer things like leverage, none of them offer a professional trading terminal. Furthermore trades can be slow and slippage and spreads are sometimes quite high.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is the answer here as it offers everything that these DEXes lack, and more, using its hybrid exchange model, and built on the Ethereum blockchain. Leverage of 500:1 is available by using crypto as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are worried about the recent attacks on centralized exchanges will be happy to know that as Tradecurve is built on the blockchain, it means your crypto is kept in your decentralized wallet, so no governmental agency can take it from you.</p>
<p>As they are based outside of the US, they are not subject to the rules and regulations stipulated by the SEC, and as such, KYC free trading is possible. This gives freedom and anonymity to traders, in a world that the SEC is increasingly trying to control.</p>
<p>TCRV is currently in presale at $0.015, having increased by 50% since stage 1. 50% is the magic number right now, or so it seems, as stage 3 is currently halfway sold out. The next stage of the presale will see it increase to $0.018. Crypto experts are predicting a rise of 80-100% after it leaves stage 8 of the presale.</p>

Upholding its current level may catalyze a rebound, prompting Bitcoin to test resistance levels positioned at $30,000, $35,000, and $40,000. However, breaching this threshold could instigate a further sell-off, potentially pushing Bitcoin down to $20,000 or below.</p>

Ethereum - shaken but not stirred (too much)
<p>Ethereum was notably absent from the list of crypto currencies declared a security, and similarly saw a price reaction, falling to $1806 after the news, rebounding to $1895, and is, at time of writing, sitting at $1844.</p>
<p>Therefore, just as we have seen support for Bitcoin, Ethereum demonstrates a comparable support level around $1,800 where the bulls jumped in, in proximity to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level obtained from the surge in its history from $300 to $4,400.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Ethereum upholds this level, it could trigger a recovery, propelling Ethereum towards resistance levels situated at $2,000, $2,500, and $3,000. Conversely, if this threshold is breached, Ethereum may experience a decline towards $1,500 or lower.</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve presents a solution needed now more than ever
<p>In the wake of the SEC&rsquo;s targeting of two of the biggest centralized exchanges, a new solution is needed. DEXes like PancakeSwap, Uniswap and Curve have experienced huge inflows of money as people look to store and trade their crypto on-chain.</p>
<p>However, although some of those exchanges offer things like leverage, none of them offer a professional trading terminal. Furthermore trades can be slow and slippage and spreads are sometimes quite high.</p>
<p>Tradecurve is the answer here as it offers everything that these DEXes lack, and more, using its hybrid exchange model, and built on the Ethereum blockchain. Leverage of 500:1 is available by using crypto as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who are worried about the recent attacks on centralized exchanges will be happy to know that as Tradecurve is built on the blockchain, it means your crypto is kept in your decentralized wallet, so no governmental agency can take it from you.</p>
<p>As they are based outside of the US, they are not subject to the rules and regulations stipulated by the SEC, and as such, KYC free trading is possible. This gives freedom and anonymity to traders, in a world that the SEC is increasingly trying to control.</p>
<p>TCRV is currently in presale at $0.015, having increased by 50% since stage 1. 50% is the magic number right now, or so it seems, as stage 3 is currently halfway sold out. The next stage of the presale will see it increase to $0.018. Crypto experts are predicting a rise of 80-100% after it leaves stage 8 of the presale.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Floki Inu (FLOKI) and Uwerx stand at the forefront of the battle for supremacy in the crypto world, each harboring its aspirations and potential. As the crypto world closely watches their contrasting journeys, questions arise regarding Floki Inu's (FLOKI) ability to rise from the ashes and challenge the soaring success of Uwerx's presale.</p>
Floki Inu (FLOKI): Unleashing the Power of Utility
<p>Floki Inu (FLOKI) stands out among the vast array of cryptocurrencies by offering compatibility with both Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). This unique characteristic allows users to enjoy increased flexibility and accessibility in their transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike many other meme coins, Floki Inu (FLOKI) sets itself apart by prioritizing utility. It has plans for a DeFi platform, a staking program, and a distinctively designed debit card featuring the beloved Floki motif.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Priced at $0.000031, industry analysts predict that Floki Inu (FLOKI) could reach $0.001 by Q1 2024, positioning it as a promising meme coin. However, Uwerx, on the other hand, promises even greater value and potential for users.</p>
Uwerx's (WERX) Blockchain Revolution in Freelancing
<p>Uwerx, an upcoming freelancing platform built on the Ethereum blockchain, is making waves with its innovative approach and commitment to delivering a seamless freelancing experience. By harnessing the power of blockchain technology, Uwerx aims to address the pain points faced by freelancers and clients, paving the way for a new era of decentralized and efficient collaboration.</p>
<p>At the core of Uwerx's vision is providing greater decentralization and enhanced benefits for freelancers. Unlike traditional platforms that levy hefty transaction fees ranging from 10-20%, Uwerx disrupts the norm by charging a mere 1% transaction fee, ensuring that freelancers can reap the rewards of their hard work while enjoying access to exceptional freelancing services.</p>
<p>Recognizing the significance of security and accountability, Uwerx has undergone rigorous auditing processes conducted by renowned firms SolidProof and InterFi Network. These audits testify to Uwerx's unwavering commitment to ensuring a secure platform for freelancers and clients.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): Sneak Peek into the Future
<p>Uwerx's dedication to delivering an exceptional platform experience is exemplified by the recent unveiling of its Alpha platform. Through a tantalizing peek into the landing page and Sign-Up/Sign-In page, Uwerx showcases its user-friendly interface, enticing freelancers and clients to join its ecosystem. Marking a significant milestone in the journey of Uwerx, the final launch of the Alpha platform is scheduled for August 4th, heralding a new chapter in the world of freelancing.</p>
<p>As anticipation builds, Uwerx is preparing to roll out a range of exciting features, including the login page, user dashboard, settings, posting jobs, and finding jobs. These additions facilitate a seamless transition to the Beta versions and allow users to provide valuable feedback, driving continuous improvement and refinement.</p>
<p>Transparency and trust are pillars of Uwerx's philosophy, as evidenced by its plan to renounce contracts once the project is ready for launch on centralized exchanges. This commitment further reinforces Uwerx's dedication to creating an open and trustworthy ecosystem for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Uwerx's rapid growth is undeniable, with the platform recently surpassing the remarkable milestone of 5,500 sign-ups. The overwhelming response reflects the industry's growing demand for a platform that prioritizes transparency and user-friendly experiences, setting the stage for Uwerx's ascent as a prominent player in the freelancing market.</p>
Uwerx's (WERX) Journey Towards Presale Triumphs&nbsp;
<p>Community support is pivotal in Uwerx's trajectory, evident in the 98.2% vote to conduct a Test Airdrop through a Twitter poll. Scheduled to occur after the presale on July 31st, this highly anticipated event aims to reward early participants and ignite excitement among token holders, driving the platform's growth.</p>
<p>Solidifying its presence in the cryptocurrency market, Uwerx has secured a listing on CoinSniper, further bolstering its credibility and visibility. The upcoming listing on the renowned decentralized exchange, Uniswap, by August 1st promises to unlock new opportunities for trading and liquidity, propelling Uwerx to the forefront of the industry.</p>
<p>With the hard-cap presale nearing completion, Uwerx remains unwavering in its commitment to its timeline. The team's diligent efforts to modify token allocations reflect their dedication to accommodating the presale's rapid pace and meeting the community's demands and expectations.</p>
<p>As each presale stage sells out rapidly, Uwerx's journey is a testament to the community's trust and confidence in the platform's vision for the future of freelancing. In a remarkable feat, stage 1 of its presale concluded within 17 days, followed swiftly by stage 2, which reached its target in just 8 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These impressive achievements serve as a testament to the overwhelming interest and trust that the community has placed in the Uwerx project. The presale of Uwerx tokens is in the midst of an enticing stage 5, offering tokens at a favorable price of $0.041 per token with a 15% bonus on every purchase.</p>
<p>The transparent and well-structured approach to token distribution, exemplified by the substantial 25-year token lock approved by an overwhelming 82.8% vote, ensures long-term stability and security for Uwerx token holders.</p>
<p>In a remarkable stride towards enhancing user engagement, Uwerx introduces the Uwerx Vault for storing WERX tokens. This secure vault enables users to store their tokens for various durations, akin to staking, and earn rewards based on platform variables, amplifying the benefits of participating in the Uwerx ecosystem.</p>
<p>As Uwerx continues to rewrite the rules of freelancing, it beckons freelancers and clients alike to join its revolution, as together, they forge a future where transparency, efficiency, and empowerment reign supreme.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Two digital currencies, Solana and Tradecurve, have been generating excitement recently within the crypto space. Although the Solana blockchain witnessed numerous shutdowns in 2022, the network has bounced back with several new developments in 2023 which could push SOL, its native token towards the $25 price level. Meanwhile, Tradecurve, a promising DeFi project, is poised for another huge price surge of about 50% as investors show huge interest in its token presale.</p>
<p></p>
Solana (SOL) Price To Reach $25
<p>Solana has been on an upward trajectory, surpassing the $20 mark as it shows strong momentum. Factors contributing to its recent price gains include increased user engagement, notable upgrades such as the ChatGPT plugin integration, and positive remarks from the project's co-founder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presently, Solana faces a resistance level of $21.40, which, if breached, could potentially propel the cryptocurrency toward a significant price rally, targeting the $25 price level. Trading expert Jimie (@Your_NLP_Coach) identifies the next resistance level at $26, emphasizing the need for Solana's price to close above $21.3 to confirm further upward movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Other market analysts have predicted that if Solana (SOL) breaks out of this resistance, the token could experience a 28% rally. If this happens, the price of Solana (SOL) could be priced as high as $28 in the next few weeks. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Solana is trading at $20.20, a 1.20% increase in the last 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
Tradecurve (TCRV) Price Could Increase Another 50%&nbsp;
<p>As the bullish sentiment surrounding Solana increases, traders are preparing to test the resistance level at $21.50. Tradecurve is already in the midst of a bull market. In May, which was a bearish month for the crypto market, Tradecurve's governance token, TCRV, experienced a remarkable 50% surge amidst a spike in interest from both retail and institutional investors. Expert analysts even project that June could bring another rally for Tradecurve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple factors could help TCRV record another 50% price hike. One of them is its utility. Also, Tradecurve is building a decentralized platform that will offer users access to different trading markets like cryptocurrencies, forex, CFDs, commodities, and stocks. These markets have huge potential and high trading volume. According to IMARC impactful insights, the global foreign exchange (FX) market was valued at $ 753.2 Billion in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the utility token that offers Tradecurve holders benefits like governance rights, staking rewards, and discounts on fees, TCRV has been primed to benefit from the growth of the platform. In addition to the 50% rally, experts foresee the price of the token increasing by as much as 100x when the platform hits the global market. Currently, TCRV is valued at $0.015 per token, presenting a promising investment opportunity for investors looking to expand their market portfolio and grow their assets.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sturdy Finance, has taken an unconventional approach to reclaiming stolen funds. Following an exploit that captured around $800,000 in Ether, the project offered a $100,000 bounty to the attacker.</p>
<p>Sam Forman, founder of Sturdy Finance, confirmed that his team had offered the generous $100,000 bounty. The message asks that the attacker return the stolen funds to an address owned by Sturdy Finance, emphasising that the team will refrain from pursuing legal action if the funds are returned promptly.</p>
Addressing the exploit
<p>The security incident occurred when an attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in one of Sturdy Finance's liquidity pools. Through this vulnerability, the hacker manipulated a price oracle, ultimately stealing a substantial amount of funds from the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As soon as Sturdy Finance was aware of the breach it suspended all of its markets as a precautionary measure. The team assured users that no other funds were compromised and pledged to conduct a wide-ranging investigation into the platform's security.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We've sent the following message to the Sturdy hacker on-chain:"To the exploiter: as we have seen with recent hacks, exploits are not as easy to escape from as they used to be. That said, we are willing to offer you $100k as a bounty, and will not pursue you further if you send&hellip;</p>
&mdash; Sam Forman (@pgpsam) June 12, 2023
<p>

</p>
A risky approach?
<p>Sturdy Finance's decision to offer a bounty to the attacker raises eyebrows in the crypto community. While unconventional, this approach demonstrates the project's commitment to recovering the stolen funds and mitigating the potential fallout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By choosing not to pursue criminal charges and instead incentivising the return of the funds, Sturdy Finance seeks to resolve the situation amicably while sending a strong message about its dedication to the principles of decentralisation and forgiveness.</p>
The way forward
<p>As the crypto world awaits the outcome of this unexpected offer, the incident serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by decentralised platforms. Sturdy Finance's swift response and commitment to securing its users' funds demonstrate its determination to uphold the highest standards of safety and integrity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The community will be closely monitoring the outcome, which may set a precedent for how future security breaches are handled within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>United States Congressman Warren Davidson has filed a new bill called the SEC Stabilization Act, which looks to restructure the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the key provisions in the bill is the dismissal of currency SEC Chair Gary Gensler.&nbsp;</p>
The SEC Stabilization Act&nbsp;
<p>The new bill filed by Davidson calls for the immediate dismissal of current Securities and Exchange Chair Gary Gensler and the restructuring of the SEC to better protect the markets. Rep Davidson, in a statement, added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come. It&rsquo;s time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as Chair of the SEC.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The representative used the hashtag &ldquo;FireGaryGensler,&rdquo; adding that the United States markets must be protected from the SEC Chair. He was joined by the Republican Party&rsquo;s majority whip, Tom Emmer, who Davidson quoted as stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;American investors and industry deserve clear and consistent oversight, not political gamesmanship. The SEC Stabilization Act will make common-sense changes to ensure that the SEC&rsquo;s priorities are with the investors they are charged to protect and not the whims of its reckless Chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tom Emmer co-authored the bill.</p>
Structural Changes&nbsp;
<p>According to Davidson, apart from the removal of Gensler, the bill will also look to restructure the Securities and Exchange Commission, redistributing power between the SEC and its commissioners. It will also add a sixth commissioner to the agency so that no single party can have a majority over the commission and create an executive director position that would handle all day-to-day operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Davidson and Emmer did not explicitly mention cryptocurrencies or the crypto ecosystem in their statements, both are known to be extremely pro-crypto. Furthermore, both are also highly critical of Gensler&rsquo;s leadership of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Emmer has previously called Genser a &ldquo;bad faith regulator,&rdquo; while Davidson is the vice chair of the House Financial Services Committee&rsquo;s new Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Community Pushes Back Against Gensler&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s latest action against Coinbase and Binance has not been met warmly by the crypto community. Many brought up old videos of Gensler and his views on crypto. One such video shows the SEC Chair teaching blockchain technology at MIT. Another video that has garnered significant controversy is that of Gensler telling hedge funds that Ethereum and Litecoin are not securities. These videos and many more have left the crypto community seething at what they perceive as blatant hypocrisy. Gensler has also previously showered praise on Algorand, but later called ALGO a security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crypto community has also pointed to the fact that the SEC Chair has close ties with Senator Elizabeth Warren. Senator Warren is notoriously anti-crypto, with the crypto community wondering if she has a role to play in Gensler&rsquo;s recent outbursts against crypto. Many in the crypto space believe that Gensler is out to kill the crypto industry, with the regulatory action against Coinbase and Binance the latest salvo against the industry.</p>
<p>The SEC made its position against crypto clear when it launched regulatory action against Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, and Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Lawyers for FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried have stated that litigation proceedings against him could be significantly delayed if further charges are added against the founder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers have argued that a new Supreme Court judgment shows that the FTX founder has not committed fraud.&nbsp;</p>
A Significant Delay&nbsp;
<p>Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s lawyers argued about the delay in legal filings that were made on Monday. The disgraced FTX founder remains on bail after being arrested in the Bahamas in December. US authorities filed several criminal charges against Bankman-Fried, following which he was extradited following the collapse of FTX and its associated entities, including Alameda Research. FTX and Alameda Research had filed for bankruptcy in November, with SBF pleading not guilty to charges brought against him, including those of money laundering and wire fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lawyers representing Bankman-Fried argued in a pretrial motion to dismiss a majority of the charges against him that charges added by the United States Department of Justice after Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s extradition could breach the treaty between the United States and the Bahamas. They further added that he held the right to contest any attempt to add charges in overseas courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bankman-Fried is currently challenging the Government&rsquo;s new application for consent in The Bahamas, as is his right, and such proceedings may well take many months, even years, to be litigated.&rdquo;</p>

The US Supreme Court Boosts Defense Case&nbsp;
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s case has been significantly emboldened by the United States Supreme Court, which recently narrowed the scope of federal laws during a case involving the bidding of state contracts. The narrowing of the scope of federal laws, along with other case laws, significantly weakens the prosecution&rsquo;s arguments that Sam Bankman-Fried defrauded banks and users/clients that lend money to the crypto hedge fund Alameda Research. The banks and users in question still stand a chance of receiving their money back as the firm is wound up. Lawyers arguing for SBF stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Alameda lenders were not deprived of their contractual rights to collect the existing loans&rdquo; by Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s actions. We understand that Alameda&rsquo;s lenders are vigorously asserting their rights in the FTX bankruptcy proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the document filed, &ldquo;Bank-1&rsquo;s right to control access to its bank accounts is no longer a valid property right&rdquo; after the Supreme Court&rsquo;s observation in May. According to SBF&rsquo;s lawyers, this invalidates charges against him, stating that he misrepresented the purpose of a bank account set up for the company North Dimension.&nbsp;</p>
SBF&rsquo;s Growing Problems&nbsp;
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has constantly denied any wrongdoing after pleading not guilty to federal charges. In January, he posted an astonishing blog post stating that he did not steal funds or stash away billions. Instead, he blamed Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, saying that he had orchestrated the liquidity crisis that led to the fall of FTX and its associated entities. Despite his protests, federal prosecutors added further charges to a growing list of indictments, alleging that he paid $40 million to Chinese officials to unfreeze specific accounts.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried was also sued by FTX and its sister entity Alameda Research, as it looks to recover $240 million related to the Embed acquisition. Other executives sued by the companies include Nishad Singh and Gary Wang.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the SEC piles on the misery for the crypto sector most would expect Bitcoin to continue its descent. However, two indicators say otherwise.</p>
SEC pulls crypto market down
<p>Gary Gensler&rsquo;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is doing everything in its power to crush the crypto sector. A sector that is potentially seen as a rival to the hegemony of the US dollar is having the life sucked out of it as the SEC attacks on/off ramps and major exchanges.</p>
<p>The retail investors who are just there for the money are leaving in droves and it is likely that many cryptocurrencies will die because of being labelled by the SEC as securities, while others will have their growth stunted as the threat of a potential SEC action hangs over them.</p>
Bitcoin still in upward trend
<p>Meanwhile, as the crypto industry continues its suffering, Bitcoin is still technically in its upward trend; one that it has been following since the beginning of the year. Granted it has seen an 18% correction since topping at around $31,000 in early April, but this is entirely normal.</p>
Weekly Stochastic RSI
<p>One huge indicator for Bitcoin, which is potentially only 2 or 3 weeks away from triggering, is a cross up on the high time frame weekly Stochastic RSI. This indicator is very near bottoming out, and in fact, it is showing bullish divergence, which on the weekly time frame can be very powerful.</p>
Gaussian Channel
<p>Another indicator, which not so many look at, is the Gaussian Channel. This indicator is incredibly powerful in interpreting price movements and is able to predict price trends. When looking at the Gaussian Channel on the higher time frame of 5 days, the data has no false signals, at least for Bitcoin&rsquo;s short history.</p>
<p>The Gaussian Channel flipped from red to green on the 5 day in early May and is now trending upward. Importantly, the bitcoin price has come back to test the top of the channel and a bounce could be seen from this area.</p>
Bitcoin will outstrip the dollar
<p>This still does not mean that Bitcoin is automatically confirmed as having entered its bull market, but it is certainly a positive sign. To boot, given the decentralised nature of the Bitcoin network, and its scarcity and predictability of supply, it is highly likely to outstrip the dollar as that fiat currency continues to suffer extreme debasement.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bank of China (BOCI) has made history by issuing tokenised securities on the Ethereum blockchain in Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This revolutionary development signifies a significant stride forward in the adoption of decentralised finance and highlights Hong Kong's efforts to attract major players in the cryptocurrency industry, including Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>
Tokenised Securities: Pioneering a New Era in Finance
<p>The Bank of China's decision to issue tokenized securities on the Ethereum blockchain is a bold testament to the institution's acknowledgment of the tremendous potential of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By harnessing the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum, BOCI aims to amplify the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of traditional securities. Tokenisation paves the way for fractional ownership, heightened liquidity, and streamlined settlement processes, ushering in a revolutionary approach to trading, selling, and purchasing assets.</p>
Hong Kong's Crypto-Friendly Stance
<p>Hong Kong's ambitions to establish itself as a global hub for digital assets and cryptocurrencies have taken a significant leap forward with the Bank of China's introduction of tokenised securities. This milestone aligns seamlessly with the city's concerted efforts to allure leading cryptocurrency exchanges, with Coinbase expressing its interest in expanding its footprint in the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Kong's proactive approach to embracing digital innovation and its regulatory framework, striking a balance between investor protection and industry growth, positions it as a potential destination for companies operating in the crypto space.</p>
Unprecedented Accessibility and Enhanced Liquidity
<p>By tokenising securities on the Ethereum blockchain, the Bank of China paves the way for investors, both institutional and retail, to access traditional financial assets with newfound ease and flexibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenisation empowers fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy and trade smaller portions of high-value assets, thereby rendering previously illiquid investments more accessible. This democratisation of investment opportunities has the potential to revolutionise financial markets, expanding participation and fostering financial inclusion.</p>
Advancing Blockchain Adoption
<p>The Bank of China's pioneering initiative to issue tokenized securities represents a substantial stride in the adoption of blockchain technology within the conventional financial system. As a prominent financial institution, BOCI's embrace of blockchain validates its transformative potential to reshape the global financial landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This progressive move is poised to inspire other institutions to explore the utility of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, propelling further innovation and nurturing a more inclusive and efficient financial ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The, Caribbean, June 12th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Recently, Huobi held its mid-year conference to review the overall progress from the first half of 2023 including a development plan for the second half of the year. H.E. Justin Sun, a member of the Huobi Advisory Board, shared his unique insights into the development of the blockchain industry.</p><p class="ql-align-center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming a Household Name</p><p>Huobi and Poloniex witnessed a significant improvement in operational performance during Q2 compared to Q1 2023. This can be attributed to various factors, including the meme coin frenzy and the regulatory crackdown on other exchanges.</p><p>However, in terms of total on-chain assets, Huobi and Poloniex equated to $4 billion which falls behind Binance's $60 billion and OKX's $10 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Huobi stated that in the next six months, it will continue to restore its brand confidence, increase platform assets and trading volume, and achieve profitability targets. It aims to become a stronger player and a household name within the cryptocurrency exchange industry.</p><p>With months of cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts, Huobi has overcome survival challenges and will make future decisions based on long-term perspectives. Huobi is committed to actively embracing the ever-changing crypto industry and prioritizing user needs. The company firmly doesn&rsquo;t believe in sacrificing user interests for short-term gains. The focus will be on constantly creating value for users while achieving greater business wins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto Market's Three Pillars: Exchange, Public Chain, and Stablecoin</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sun expressed that Huobi has always been following their global compliance strategy by actively embracing regulation and exploring diverse compliance operations. Numerous crypto companies are entering the Hong Kong market because of its new regulatory rules. Huobi is gaining exposure in the Hong Kong crypto market by launching Huobi Hong Kong, which allowed registration for Hong Kong residents on June 1 2023. Huobi is also the first exchange to become a member of the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Consortium (HKVAC). Additionally, Huobi is in continuous communication with the Hong Kong government to apply for a cryptocurrency exchange license.</p><p>Sun analyzed that exchanges, public chains, and stablecoins will become the main core of the entire blockchain industry. These three pillars for the decentralized financial landscape will influence long-time development in the industry. Sun stated that their mission is to build a Web3 finance hub in the metaverse and give an option to people worldwide to pursue financial freedom in the metaverse. Public chains serve as the foundation for creating a financial world in the metaverse, while exchanges play a crucial role as the gatekeepers.</p><p>Sun believes that Huobi holds a leading position within the industry. However, in terms of integration capabilities, Huobi stands out as the sole decentralized financial ecosystem platform with a structure encompassing all three pillars mentioned earlier. The three core businesses consisting of exchanges, public chains, and stablecoins will strive to enhance the user experience from multiple angles. It focuses on long-term industry development, covering the majority of industry traffic, and building a globally influential Web3 financial hub.</p><p></p><p>About Huobi</p><p>Founded in 2013, Huobi has evolved from a crypto exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, wallets, research, investment, incubation and other areas. Huobi serves millions of users worldwide, with a business presence covering over 160 countries and regions across five continents.

It aims to become a stronger player and a household name within the cryptocurrency exchange industry.</p><p>With months of cost reduction and efficiency improvement efforts, Huobi has overcome survival challenges and will make future decisions based on long-term perspectives. Huobi is committed to actively embracing the ever-changing crypto industry and prioritizing user needs. The company firmly doesn&rsquo;t believe in sacrificing user interests for short-term gains. The focus will be on constantly creating value for users while achieving greater business wins.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Crypto Market's Three Pillars: Exchange, Public Chain, and Stablecoin</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="ql-align-center">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sun expressed that Huobi has always been following their global compliance strategy by actively embracing regulation and exploring diverse compliance operations. Numerous crypto companies are entering the Hong Kong market because of its new regulatory rules. Huobi is gaining exposure in the Hong Kong crypto market by launching Huobi Hong Kong, which allowed registration for Hong Kong residents on June 1 2023. Huobi is also the first exchange to become a member of the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Consortium (HKVAC). Additionally, Huobi is in continuous communication with the Hong Kong government to apply for a cryptocurrency exchange license.</p><p>Sun analyzed that exchanges, public chains, and stablecoins will become the main core of the entire blockchain industry. These three pillars for the decentralized financial landscape will influence long-time development in the industry. Sun stated that their mission is to build a Web3 finance hub in the metaverse and give an option to people worldwide to pursue financial freedom in the metaverse. Public chains serve as the foundation for creating a financial world in the metaverse, while exchanges play a crucial role as the gatekeepers.</p><p>Sun believes that Huobi holds a leading position within the industry. However, in terms of integration capabilities, Huobi stands out as the sole decentralized financial ecosystem platform with a structure encompassing all three pillars mentioned earlier. The three core businesses consisting of exchanges, public chains, and stablecoins will strive to enhance the user experience from multiple angles. It focuses on long-term industry development, covering the majority of industry traffic, and building a globally influential Web3 financial hub.</p><p></p><p>About Huobi</p><p>Founded in 2013, Huobi has evolved from a crypto exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, wallets, research, investment, incubation and other areas. Huobi serves millions of users worldwide, with a business presence covering over 160 countries and regions across five continents. Its three development strategies - "global development, technology drives development, and technology for good" - underpin its commitment to providing comprehensive services and values to global cryptocurrency enthusiasts.</p>ContactMichael Wangglo-media@huobi.com]]></content:encoded>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uwerx is positioned to be the best freelance platform for all freelancers worldwide. Through the platform&rsquo;s unique features, freelancers will have a community that hears their needs and helps them grow. Uwerx&rsquo;s presale is coming to a quick close. In this article, we discuss why Uwerxwill be your best investment.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): The Hub of Freelancing Solutions
<p>Freelancers all over the globe struggle with a plethora of challenges and obstacles on different freelancing platforms. From high flat fees to the inability to land gigs on these platforms, it has become a battle zone for freelancers seeking more gigs. Uwerx aims to solve these challenges and more.</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to solve several problems that freelancers face in the cryptocurrency industry. This is why the platform offers users a 1% flat fee, a significant reduction compared to the 10% and 20% flat fees offered by freelancing platforms such as Upwork and Fiverr. </p>
<p>Uwerx is growing beyond expectations. Within a few weeks of launching, the Uwerx platform has grown to over 6,000 signups. The social media platforms are not left out, as Uwerx&rsquo;s Twitter now has 1,627 followers, with Telegram boasting 1,456 subscribers. These numbers have only just begun to grow. With Uwerx&rsquo;s current listing on CoinSniper, and its scheduled listing on Uniswap by the 1st of August, these numbers are bound to quadruple in the coming months.</p>
<p>Uwerx is here to stay. Uwerx communicates this message to its growing community by announcing a 25-year liquidity lock on its tokens. After 82.8% of Uwerx&rsquo;s users voted for the lock to happen imminently, unlike after the presale as planned, the Uwerx team will make this lock happen before the end of the presale. </p>
<p>Uwerx has already exceeded all standards of the cryptocurrency industry. The platform proves this with its successful audit undergone by InterFi Network and SolidProof, both renowned authorities in the industry. Once Uwerx is launched on centralized exchanges, the Uwerx team will be renouncing contract ownership, thus ensuring transparency with the platform and reducing taxes to zero..</p>
<p>The Uwerx Team is also taking steps to transition the platform from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform. Through the Beta platform, Uwerx users can test the platform for themselves, and they are encouraged to share all forms of feedback with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
The Uwerx (WERX) Presale is Exceeding Expectations!
<p>Due to the unexpectedly high demands for Uwerx, the Uwerx team has had to make essential token modifications to accommodate these demands. 98.2% of Uwerx users voted via a Twitter Poll for the Uwerx team to launch a Test Airdrop for the platform. This will be launched on the 31st of July, 2023. &nbsp;Uwerx itself will be launched on the 4th of August, 2023, opening freelancers and crypto investors up to a whole new world. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team has also unveiled the Uwerx Vault. Through this vault, Uwerx users can store their WERX tokens for different periods and access rewards based on the variables within the platform. </p>
<p>Uwerx&rsquo;s first presale stage was completed in only 17 days, while its second was completed within eight days. Uwerx is in its fifth presale stage, selling at $0.041 per token, with a 15% bonus on every purchase. Uwerx&rsquo;s hard-cap presale end date has been scheduled for the 31st of July, 2023.</p>
