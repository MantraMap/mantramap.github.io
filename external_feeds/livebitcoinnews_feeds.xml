										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin had a very harsh year in 2022. Can we expect 2023 to be any better now that it’s about to enter the fray?</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Price Had It Really Hard This Year</h2>
<p>We are literally hours away from greeting 2023, and we can’t help but reflect on what a year 2022 has been for the world’s number one digital currency by market cap. The crypto space has had extreme difficulty staying at the top of its game these last 12 months, and many of us are surprised that bitcoin and its crypto cousins are still around, ready and willing to play.</p>
<p>In this sense, we can be grateful that bitcoin has matured enough that it’s able to withstand the harsh conditions it’s endured. At the same time, we can’t help but reflect on how bearish this period has been, and we truly hope things improve now that the new year has arrived.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a> price has taken its biggest beating since it first rose to prominence 14 years ago. The world’s number one digital currency rose to a whopping $68,000 per unit, for example, in November of last year. The currency hit a new peak and it looked like it suddenly had newfound power that was never going to fade, but we couldn’t have been more wrong.</p>
<p>Sadly, 2022 started on a weak note in that the currency fell into the $40K range, nearly $20,000 less than where it had been just two months prior. From there, the currency endured a long string of losses that ultimately brought it down to its present price, which lies in the $16K arena. It’s a sad and ugly sight to see, and one that has permeated the entire crypto space, causing it to lose more than $2 trillion in valuation in just the last few months.</p>
<p>In many ways, 2022 is comparable to 2018, though the damage has been far greater than what occurred four years ago. This is primarily because bitcoin has grown so much since that bear year, but there is also some good news in that 2019 brought a strong level of recovery from 2018, and with so many 2018 patterns showing themselves in 2022, perhaps we can expect 2019’s recovery to appear again in 2023.</p>
<h2>So Many Companies Fell</h2>
<p>Many companies have fallen victim to the crypto crash that endured. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-top-bitcoin-and-crypto-stories-of-2022/" data-wpel-link="internal">we published a piece</a> talking about all the companies that filed bankruptcy thanks to the ongoing speculation and volatility. We’ve also seen several firms – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/michael-saylor-just-bought-more-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal">like MicroStrategy</a> – fall heavily into debt due to their love of BTC.</p>
<p>There is a lot of healing that now needs to happen, and we’re confident that 2023 can at least bring us a small taste of that healing. Let’s keep our fingers crossed and hope for the absolute best over the next 12 months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2022 is on the verge of disappearing forever, and <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> is looking back one last time on the biggest digital currency stories of the year.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>The biggest story of 2022 revolved around how poorly bitcoin did. What was once one of the largest and most worthwhile assets around sank to the bottom of a deep financial pit, and the currency has refused to get up. In November of last year, for example, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap rose to a whopping $68,000 per unit, the largest it’s ever been.</p>
<p>From there, however, the currency began to endure a series of dips that have taken it to its current price. At the time of writing, one unit of bitcoin has fallen into the mid-$16K range. That’s a loss of more than 70 percent. In addition, the entire crypto space has followed suit, and the arena has lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation.</p>
<h2>Bankruptcies Galore</h2>
<p>Due to the crash of bitcoin and ongoing volatility and speculation, many <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-crypto-in-the-age-of-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto and blockchain-based</a> companies endured horrific circumstances that caused them to engage in behaviors which made several traders raise their eyebrows in shock and disgust. Many investors didn’t know that these initial maneuvers were the beginning of something worse, and that many of these enterprises were either on their way out or were on the verge of entering bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest name to come to mind in this category is lending network Celsius, which in the summer, stirred fear in the hearts of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/another-mega-bitcoin-crash-is-in-the-books/" data-wpel-link="internal">traders after it halted</a> all withdrawals as a means of dealing with the ongoing crypto price swirls. From there, however, the company was <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/celsius-network-is-next-crypto-company-to-file-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">quick to file bankruptcy</a> so that it could explore other options of staying in business and satisfying customers while avoiding the angry faces of lenders.</p>
<p>Many other digital currency companies took the same path. Among the other firms to crash and burn this year were <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-lender-voyager-digital-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Voyager Digital</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-mining-firm-compute-north-files-for-bankruptcy/" data-wpel-link="internal">Compute North</a>, and hedge fund <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-is-now-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">Three Arrows Capital</a>.</p>
<h2>FTX – The Fall of an Empire</h2>
<p>In mid-November, the crypto world was dealt a harsh blow when FTX – one of the largest and most powerful digital currency trading platforms around – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/what-will-happen-now-that-ftx-is-bankrupt/" data-wpel-link="internal">entered bankruptcy</a>. The company was widely considered the golden boy of the crypto arena, and its founder – Sam Bankman-Fried – was lauded as a genius by many, but an investigation into the firm following its bankruptcy filings and the resignation of its head executive shows a company that has long been mismanaged.</p>
<p>Investor funds were played with and used to buy luxury homes in the Bahamas for company employees, while virtually no <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/john-ray-iii-ftx-is-the-most-mismanaged-company-ive-ever-seen/" data-wpel-link="internal">business structure could</a> be uncovered by John Ray III, the lawyer called in to clean up FTX’s mess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The FTX disaster was something nobody saw coming, and <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/ftx-investor-calls-crypto-exchange-decline-big-lesson-says-lawmakers-should-return-funds-to-victims/ar-AA14jkd7" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">now one investor</a> – a young man named Evan Luthra – has described the debacle he’s endured after losing nearly $2 million in crypto funds following the collapse of one of the biggest and most powerful crypto trading platforms in the world.</p>
<h2>Evan Luthra Has Lost a Lot of Money</h2>
<p>UBS Americas CEO Robert Wolf recently labeled FTX as a “Ponzi scheme.” Millions of investors have seen their money completely vanish after it’s been shown that FTX <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/john-ray-iii-ftx-is-the-most-mismanaged-company-ive-ever-seen/" data-wpel-link="internal">used customer funds</a> to purchase items like luxury condominiums in the Bahamas. Luthra himself lost quite a bit, and now he’s sharing his story to help others learn from what’s happened. In a recent discussion with <em>FOX News</em>, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a big lesson for everybody in the crypto community. It&#8217;s a big, strong lesson [of] not your keys, not your crypto. If you don&#8217;t hold the keys to crypto, it&#8217;s not really your money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried – the man behind the exchange – is believed to have pocketed as much as $300 million from investors. In his interview, Luthra slammed the former CEO, claiming that he’s nothing but a criminal and that everything that occurred with FTX did so because he and his fellow executives wanted it to happen. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was all intentionally done. This was a very calculated plan, or I should say a crime that has taken place… You could have a car manufacturer who cut some corners and then defrauded the industry. Doesn&#8217;t mean electric vehicles are bad. So, it&#8217;s like bitcoin by itself. The fundamentals are still very strong and if you have bitcoin in your hard wallet, in your hand, you have not lost any money today… From all this, I&#8217;ve already come to realize that Sam Bankman-Fried is a bad actor, here. We already know that this is a bad actor, this is a fraud, [and] this is a criminal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many are calling for a fund to be established to help the victims of the fallen company. Also, several <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-gave-a-lot-of-money-to-democrats-what-will-they-do-with-it/" data-wpel-link="internal">democrat politicians accepted</a> money from FTX, and they’re now being pressured to give it back.</p>
<h2>This was a Criminal Act</h2>
<p>Luthra doesn’t blame the politicians for taking the money as he’s convinced that they weren’t aware of the company’s dirty dealings or criminal behavior. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You can&#8217;t blame the government for accepting donations without knowing that this was going to be criminal. You can&#8217;t really blame anybody in this case except Sam Bankman-Fried who is cruel, who intentionally planned and executed a fraud against the whole community, but the right thing would be for them to give the funds back. Whoever got the donations, and it should go back to the victims whose funds it really is. This was never his money to give away. This was our money.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Edward Snowden – the U.S. intelligence leaker now living in Moscow – hinted he has <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/snowden-bitcoin-holdings-151914599.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">quite a few bitcoins</a> to his name, and that he’s got enough to live on “until the f*cking sun dies.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How Much BTC Does Edward Snowden Own?</h2>
<p>Since he left the country, many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley have been sending him bitcoin and crypto units so he could stay afloat. This has turned into a vast and considerable sum over the years, and Snowden appears to be living well thanks to the amount of crypto he’s accumulated.</p>
<p>In October, Snowden made a special panel appearance via satellite and was asked if he was “bitcoin rich.” He laughed this off, claiming that what everyone has read about his alleged bitcoin stash might not be true. While he didn’t give a straight answer, he hinted that his ties to crypto could have been forged and were initially based on a comment that was never meant to go public. This puts things in a weird loop and doesn’t allow crypto fans to fully understand what’s going on.</p>
<p>In the interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, one thing I would say [is] don’t trust everything you read in the press. Secondly, that [bitcoin comment] was a private comment that wasn’t meant to be published, but look, my advice is as a privacy advocate. If anybody asks you what crypto you have, what you hold, the answer is, ‘What is crypto?’ but I’m not at risk of going hungry, certainly not this year. Let’s put it that way.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/edward-snowden/" data-wpel-link="internal">Snowden</a> stirred controversy roughly ten years ago when allegations from the U.S. government came about that he had removed more than one million classified documents from various U.S. systems in 2012 and 2013. At the time, Snowden was working as an NSA contractor in Hawaii. He’s believed to have provided over 200,000 of those documents to foreign entities and journalists before fleeing to Russia.</p>
<p>Not long after he fled the U.S., Kremlin-linked lawyer Anatoly Kucherena explained that Snowden was on the verge of building a “new life in Russia.” The attorney also commented that Snowden would hold an IT job with an unnamed enterprise in the country, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Edward Snowden will begin working in one of the biggest Russian companies. His job will be to provide support and develop one of Russia’s biggest websites.</p></blockquote>
<h2>He&#8217;s Pretty Active</h2>
<p>One would think a man like Snowden would do everything to maintain a low profile, but this isn’t quite the case. In fact, he’s quite active on Twitter, and boasts a following of more than five million people. Following <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">the fall of FTX</a> he mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s still a lot of trouble ahead, but for the first time in a while, I&#8217;m starting to feel the itch to scale back in.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>A temporary outage of LBank’s trade platform in December sparked discussion among users about how exchanges should approach cloud hosting. LBank CEO Allen Wei addressed the issue during a Twitter Space AMA on December 26th.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Veteran crypto exchanges like LBank are trying to uphold a long-standing reputation of seeing little service downtime and thwarting hackers.</p>
<p><strong>Driving the discussion: </strong>Alibaba Cloud, LBank’s Cloud Service Provider, experienced <a href="https://twitter.com/LBank_Exchange/status/1604470379787214848" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">technical issues</a> on December 18th, rendering the trade platform temporarily inaccessible for over 7 million users.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Our engineers got word from Alibaba Cloud that there was a server crash ongoing and immediately started collaboration. It took quite some time to recover our services, but luckily we recovered access to our websites through other cloud services quite early on. The incident not only affected us, but a lot of other exchanges and internet companies,” Wei said.</li>
<li>LBank stresses that these kinds of outages have no impact on user assets whatsoever. “We take regular back-ups of platform data. The wallet side is especially secure because we utilize cold storage controlled by our own servers,” Wei added.</li>
<li>Addressing the FUD that popped up on social media during the incident, Wei stated this phenomenon isn’t an abnormality in the financial industry. “We’ve been through this before ever since kicking off in 2015 and are nonetheless still supporting crypto and blockchain tech. The community continues to trust us and trade on our platform, which underlines the potential of crypto,” the LBank CEO said.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Big Picture: </strong>Wei points out that exchanges should approach cloud hosting with a multipronged strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The exchange will take even more frequent back-ups of platform data in the future and will look towards other Cloud Service Providers to mitigate downtime. “We are slowly moving some of our services to other Cloud Providers, like Amazon”, Wei stated.</li>
<li>Continuing to provide excellent stability of the trading platform is an integral part of LBank’s global goals, Wei said. “In 2023, we would also like to expand on the local community relations we established this year”, he concluded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About LBank</strong></p>
<p>LBank, founded in 2015, is an innovative global trading platform for various crypto assets. The exchange provides its users with safe crypto trading, specialized financial derivatives, and professional asset management services. It has become one of the most popular and trusted crypto trading platforms, with over 7 million users from more than 210 regions around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX collapse</a> is going to go down as one of the biggest flops to ever occur in crypto. The event has caused several politicians to enter the regulatory call factory, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2022/11/20/joe-biden-leads-critical-call-for-game-changing-global-bitcoin-and-crypto-rules-after-shock-ftx-collapse/?sh=5bbe678b7f17" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">one of which is</a> Joe Biden.</p>
<h2>Joe Biden Wants the Crypto Space Regulated</h2>
<p>Thinking he can somehow make a difference, Biden recently voiced support for newfound digital currency regulation to ensure that what happened with FTX never happens again.</p>
<p>Biden initially sought to get the ball rolling on such a proposition in March of this year when he issued a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-is-the-biden-crypto-executive-order-all-its-cracked-up-to-be/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto executive order</a> for financial agencies throughout the United States to begin researching digital currency platforms to see what the benefits and disadvantages could be for everyday Americans and financial systems. The order also opened the door to a digital version of USD.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like several world leaders are getting involved, with many speakers at the recent G20 Summit calling for more regulation of crypto. The G20 leaders issued the following joint statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is critical to build public awareness of risks, to strengthen regulatory outcomes, and to support a level playing field, while harnessing the benefits of innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In October, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) suggested new rules that would subject the crypto space to the same financial rules one often witnesses in the world of banks and standard monetization. These leaders supported such ideas, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>We welcome the FSB’s proposed approach for establishing a comprehensive international framework for the regulation of crypto asset activities based on the principle of ‘same activity, same risk, same regulation.’ The crypto assets ecosystem, including so-called [traditional currency-pegged] stable coins, is closely monitored and [should be] subject to robust regulation, supervision, and oversight to mitigate potential risks to financial stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the big problems that occurred with FTX is that the head honcho behind it, Sam Bankman-Fried, may have taken user funds and lent them out to his second company Alameda Research. This put the FTX exchange in a dark place and caused it to fall $8 billion in debt.</p>
<p>Cristiano Bellavitis – a Syracuse University professor specializing in crypto and blockchain technology – recently mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a wake-up call, rather than just a bump in the road, or even the end of the road. The sector is huge financially but has very limited regulation. The same problems would not have occurred in the mainstream financial system.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Things Will Fix Themselves</h2>
<p>Despite all the trouble, he is confident that the space is going to recover from all this in due time, though he doesn’t deny regulation could help. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[The collapse of FTX] will diminish confidence in the crypto industry, but this industry and blockchain technology [are] here to stay. More regulation and clearer rules will only strengthen what this industry can do.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> has seemingly come and gone. The fall of the exchange will likely go down as one of the biggest embarrassments of the digital currency space, and as a result, many players within the industry are calling for exchanges to become less centralized. They are certain that decentralized finance (or defi as it’s called for short) is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/not-your-keys-not-your-coins-after-ftx-collapse-new-focus-on-decentralization-emerges/ar-AA14mZ3e" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the answer to many</a> of crypto’s problems.</p>
<h2>Every Exchange Is Being Told What to Do</h2>
<p>There is a big idea flowing through the crypto space at the time of writing. It’s:</p>
<blockquote><p>Not your keys, not your coins.</p></blockquote>
<p>What this means is that if you don’t hold the private keys to your crypto account, it doesn’t matter how many units you purchase. They are not really yours, and they can be thrown out from under you anytime the holding exchange sees fit to take such action. Crypto fans are confident only in themselves, not in third parties.</p>
<p>Tracy Wang – a crypto journalist and managing editor – explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>A company like FTX was supposed to hold your assets, but they ended up lending them out. This is like taking power back and being… in charge of your own money.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several exchanges out there that see firsthand the growing fear that stems from the collapse of FTX. Coinbase, for example, appears largely unaffected by the fall. The exchange has put out several notices telling customers that their funds are safe, and that it will never lend their money out without permission. However, some traders don’t feel this is enough reassurance.</p>
<p>Caitlin Long – the founder and CEO of crypto organization Custodia Bank – stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those of us grizzled veterans have seen this game before. We&#8217;ve been trying to warn folks. Get your coins off exchanges, and there&#8217;s been a huge wave since FTX collapsed.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is now being reported that more than $2 billion in digital currency funds have been removed from crypto exchanges over just the last few weeks alone. The fear is real, and it appears to be getting bigger. This has caused a new call for regulation that would enforce new laws requiring crypto exchanges to protect their customers’ money at all costs. Long continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>You’re just giving temporary possession for safekeeping. [They] can’t lease it to be used on Uber, and if the garage goes bankrupt, that’s not an asset of the garage. They can&#8217;t drive your car away. This is very simple, very boring, but foundational.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We Need to Be Like Wyoming</h2>
<p>To prove her point, she told traders to look at the current regulatory system in place in Wyoming. Any exchange based in the state, for example, is already being subjected to such rules. She says:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Wyoming&#8217;s regime had been in place, FTX wouldn’t have happened.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash price started a fresh decline from the $105 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $102 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $100 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $95 and $92 support levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining from the $105 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-drop-to-new-2022-lows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could decline heavily if there is a move below $95.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price struggled to gain pace for a move above the $105 and $106 resistance levels. BCH formed a high near $103.70 and started a fresh decline.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $102.50 and $102.00 support levels. The bears even pushed the price below the $100 support and the 55 simple moving average (4-hours). It traded as low as $97.22 and is currently consolidating losses.</p>
<p>It is now trading below the $102 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-recovery-could-fade-near-102/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4-hours)</a>. An immediate resistance is near the $98.80 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $103.70 swing high to $97.22 low.</p>
<p>There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $100 on the 4-hours chart of the BCH/USD pair. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $103.70 swing high to $97.22 low.</p>
<p>The main resistance sits near the $104 level.  Any more gains above $104 and $105 could set the pace for a move towards the $110 level. If there is a move above the $110 resistance, the price could rise towards the $120 zone.</p>
<p>An immediate support on the downside is near the $97.50 zone. The next major support is near the $95 level, below which the bears might aim $85. The next target for them may perhaps be near the $80 level.</p>
