			            <description><![CDATA[Aside from XRP, MATIC, LTC, and BCH are the other big losers on a daily scale.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After marking a new 13-month high yesterday at almost $32,000, bitcoin has been rejected once again and even dipped below $30,000 hours ago.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are also in the red today following the recent gains, except for DOGE, SHIB, OP, and a few others.</p>
<h2>BTC Stopped</h2>
<p>Most of the working week went by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-tumbles-toward-30k-kava-crashes-12-daily-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">quietly</a> for the primary cryptocurrency as the asset spent it trading sideways in a tight range between $30,000 and $31,000. All that, however, changed on Thursday evening when Judge Torres, presiding over the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled in favor</a> of the blockchain company in regard to its native cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>BTC, along with the rest of the market, went on the offensive and spiked to just under $31,900 (on Bitstamp), which became the asset&#8217;s highest price tag in over a year.</p>
<p>However, bitcoin couldn&#8217;t maintain that run and quickly retraced by a grand. The landscape <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-slides-back-to-30k-amid-245-million-in-liquidations/" data-wpel-link="internal">worsened</a> yesterday evening as BTC dumped hard and slipped below $30,000 for the first time in a week.</p>
<p>Despite bouncing off that level and currently sitting a few hundred dollars above it, bitcoin is still 3% down on the day. Its market capitalization has tumbled to $590 billion after exceeding $610 billion yesterday. Its dominance over the alts sits at almost the same spot as yesterday at 48.4%.</p>

<h2>XRP Loses Some Momentum</h2>
<p>As expected, Ripple&#8217;s native token was the most significant gainer after the judge&#8217;s ruling. It skyrocketed by almost 100% at one point and tapped $0.95 for the first time since December 2021, leaving millions of shorts <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/220m-in-shorts-liquidated-as-ripple-xrp-explodes-to-19-month-high-following-victory-over-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">liquidated</a>.</p>
<p>However, it couldn&#8217;t maintain its run, either, and fell back down to $0.8 yesterday. Another 8% daily retracement has pushed it back down to $0.72 as of now. Similar losses come from Litecoin, Polygon, Bitcoin Cash, Polygon, and others.</p>
<p>ETH, BNB, ADA, SOL, DOT, and TRX are also in the red from the larger-cap alts. The two largest memecoins are among the few exceptions in the green, as both DOGE and SHIB are up by around 5% daily.</p>
<p>Optimism&#8217;s OP has soared by 7.5% in the past 24 hours and has reclaimed $1.5.</p>
<p>The total crypto market, though, is down by over $30 billion since yesterday to $1.220 trillion on CMC.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The names of the people in the list might be "under seal" as a safety measure. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lawyers representing Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) requested Judge Lewis Kaplan to issue an order permitting certain people to visit their client without the necessity of security checks.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Despite being allowed to reside at his parents&#8217; house, the former CEO of FTX is subject to strict restrictions. He must wear an electronic monitoring bracelet, while a security guard must be present should he invite guests.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SBF&#8217;s Wish</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys sent an official </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/174/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">letter</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> to New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, asking the magistrates to enable people from their client&#8217;s inner cycle, dubbed as &#8220;close friends,&#8221; to meet him at his parents&#8217; house in Palo Alto, California. They insisted that such gatherings could happen without a security guard being constantly around:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;On behalf of our client, Samuel Bankman-Fried, we write to respectfully request that the Court issue an order permitting the people on the attached list to visit his parents&#8217; house without the need for a security guard to be present.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apart from &#8220;close friends,&#8221; the list of individuals includes colleagues of Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman (SBF&#8217;s parents). </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawyers also requested that the names of those people remain a secret for broad society out of security reasons. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;Here, even assuming that the list of people can be considered a &#8220;judicial document,&#8221; the individuals&#8217; privacy and safety interests greatly outweigh any presumption of access to the list and justify protecting their identities from public disclosure,&#8221; the letter reads.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not so Peaceful Life for the Family</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Keeping the people&#8217;s identities &#8220;under seal&#8221; might be appropriate since SBF and his parents have previously become a target of violence and harassment. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/a-car-crashed-into-the-barricade-of-sbfs-current-home-lawyers-said/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reported</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in January, three men crashed their car into the barricade of the house, telling a security officer:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;You won&#8217;t be able to keep us out.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Subsequently, they got back in the vehicle and drove away without being recognized. The incident happened two months after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-fall-of-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-a-timeline-of-ftxs-collapse/" data-wpel-link="internal">the implosion of FTX</a>, and shortly after, a New York federal judge </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/sam-bankman-fried-released-on-a-250m-bail-can-stay-at-parents-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">permitted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> SBF to live with his family under a $250 million bond.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It remained unclear whether the men in the car were fallen investors from the once-prominent exchange looking for revenge for their potential losses. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Bankman-Fried faces multiple fraud charges and, according to many regulators and agencies, is the main culprit behind the crash. The October trial will decide whether he was guilty and his eventual punishment. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[This is the last phase before the public launch in early August that will aim to amass more builders. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The team behind Base &#8211; an Ethereum Layer 2 chain built on OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism &#8211; said its mainnet is available for builders to deploy their products. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The entity will release a &#8220;Genesis Builder&#8221; NFT to commemorate those who entered the ecosystem from the get-go. However, it has no intentions of issuing a network token.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Latest Step</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://base.mirror.xyz/hwNwqXHVoLlO8s4DZppog4DfGvM34tigaDjOWuEJQfY" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">announced</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> its testnet launch in February, which allowed it to connect with &#8220;incredible builders and have watched their projects start to thrive&#8221; on the network, enabling on-chain games, restaurants, communities, and advocacy. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Base mainnet aims to double down on the previous success, providing &#8220;hands-on support&#8221; for developers who deploy products into the ecosystem. The entity revealed that builders could bridge ether (ETH) to Base for gas during this phase by employing the portal proxy contract. &#8220;Do not send any asset other than ETH to the portal proxy contract,&#8221; the team warned. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Various tools, including smart wallet infrastructure, node providers, data indexers, and more, are already live on the mainnet and aim to support the builders&#8217; efforts.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base highlighted its most recent achievement, assuring it has completed all necessary criteria, such as demonstration of the testnet&#8217;s stability, Optimism&#8217;s successful upgrade of Bedrock, and completion of internal and external audits. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;We&#8217;re grateful for the community&#8217;s patience as we worked through these criteria, and we&#8217;re excited to welcome everyone on to a secure, scalable, and builder-friendly Base,&#8221; it stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">What&#8217;s Next?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base is preparing for a public launch in early August when more users will be permitted to onboard the network. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;With our mainnet GA launch in early August, we&#8217;ll welcome everyday users to feel how on-chain is the next online with a seamless, easy, secure experience across hundreds of products on Base,&#8221; it stated.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Base is empowered by the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. One of its advantages is that it lets users build decentralized apps with access to the platform&#8217;s products, clients, and tools. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The network leverages the underlying security of Ethereum alongside Coinbase&#8217;s experience in the industry to enable consumers to onramp layer 1 and layer 2 blockchain protocols. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Torres raised concerns over the circumstances Prometheum was granted a special purpose broker-dealer license and SEC's role in it. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s partial victory in its fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a court ruling paved the way for small but significant regulatory clarity that the cryptocurrency industry was deprived of for so long. Now all eyes are on the security regulator who, according to Congressman Ritchie Torres, is acting like &#8220;an overzealous traffic cop arbitrarily ticketing drivers while keeping the speed limit a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>As such, Torres wants the SEC to be investigated for its approach to the digital asset industry and accused the regulatory agency&#8217;s boss Gary Gensler of &#8220;politicizing&#8221; the registration process by granting a controversial license to Prometheum.</p>
<h2>SEC Under Scanner for &#8216;Unusual Backroom Deal&#8217;</h2>
<p>Representative Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) drafted requests for two investigations into the license granted by the SEC to Prometheum Ember ATS under unusual circumstances. In the two letters <a href="https://twitter.com/RepRitchie/status/1679534903661301761" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">addressed</a> to &#8211; SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey and Comptroller General Gene Dodaro &#8211; Torres questioned if the issuance of Prometheum&#8217;s Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD) license was a political ploy by the financial regulator.</p>
<p>Torres wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Prometheum appears to be nothing more than a Potemkin platform, operating as a timely talking point for crypto critics rather than a true trading platform for crypto customers. The dubious decision to license a deceptive digital assets platform reflects the latest attempt by Chair Gary Gensler to politicize the registration process to an extent seldom seen in the SEC’s history.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC has received severe backlash from crypto firms that feel the regulator has tried to aggressively police the market. Apart from a few failed petitions asking for clarity on crypto regulations, the agency has not been yet implicated for its alleged behavior. But that could change.</p>
<p>Torres&#8217; letters highlighted that the watchdog may have acted arbitrarily with its approach to crypto regulation; hence his call for an &#8220;independent review&#8221; of the financial regulator&#8217;s &#8220;haphazard and heavy-handed&#8221; approach to digital assets could prove beneficial in expediating necessary regulation.</p>
<h2>Prometheum Controversy</h2>
<p>The letter follows the issuance of a similar request by the United States-based crypto advocacy group, Blockchain Association, that called for an investigation into crypto firm Prometheum.</p>
<p>Besides pointing out the SPBD license approval, the group requested SEC Inspector General Deborah Jeffrey to look into raised concerns about how the firm&#8217;s CEO, Aaron Kaplan, secured a seat testifying before the US House Financial Services Committee last month.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's rally on Thursday following a judge's ruling in SEC V. Ripple has proven to be short lived. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) quickly fell back to $30,000 on Friday as market hype surrounding the court’s recent ruling on XRP has begun to fade.</p>
<p>The volatility has triggered $245 million in liquidations across the entire crypto market in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CoinGlass</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Most liquidations occurred across a combination of BTC, Ether (ETH), and XRP trades.</li>
<li>XRP exploded 75% on Thursday after a judge delivered <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal">summary judgment</a> in its lawsuit against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after a three-year-long wait.</li>
<li>The judge ruled that most XRP transactions, including those on secondary markets and exchanges, are not securities transactions. This ruling prompted exchanges like Gemini and Coinbase to immediately <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-announces-the-relisting-of-ripple-xrp-following-court-ruling/" data-wpel-link="internal">relist</a> XRP.</li>
<li>While XRP briefly returned to crypto’s top 4 largest assets yesterday, it’s already back down to rank 5, having slid by 13% on the day.</li>
<li>The surrounding crypto market also rallied yesterday, with Bitcoin touching a yearly high of $31,700, and ETH briefly racing above $2000.</li>
<li>Assets like Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC), both of which rallied over 20% on Thursday, have also cooled off by 5% and 7.5% respectively. Both assets were named as securities in the SEC’s lawsuit against Coinbase last month and may be impacted by Judge Torres’s latest ruling on XRP.</li>
<li>Despite the volatility, Bitcoin dominance remains above 50%, according to TradingView.</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP&#8217;s recent win against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sparked a wave of optimism in the crypto market, driving a rally in altcoins. Amid this rally, Stellar Lumens (XLM) stood out with an almost 50% price jump in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The likes of Solana and Cardano have also seem significant gains, while new coins like Thug Life and Chimpzee are surging as the market turns bullish.</p>
<h2><strong>Stellar Lumens&#8217; Bullish Recovery Amid SEC Setback</strong></h2>
<p>Previously, the SEC&#8217;s legal actions against major crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance caused market corrections.</p>
<p>But a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-says-sec-lawsuit-vs-ripple-labs-can-proceed-trial-some-claims-2023-07-13/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">New York judge ruling that XRP ‘did not violate the securities law’</a> changed the course, benefiting Stellar Lumens significantly.</p>
<p>Stellar, created by a Ripple co-founder to improve global payments, is known for its association with Circle, the creator of USD Coin, the world&#8217;s second-largest stablecoin.</p>
<p>Given these ties, Stellar investors paid close attention to the SEC vs Ripple case. Considering its significant crypto industry presence, a win for the SEC could&#8217;ve also invited legal trouble for Stellar.</p>
<p>But the SEC&#8217;s loss bodes well for Stellar Lumens, paving the way for wider acceptance of its payment technology in the finance sector.</p>
<p>XLM is currently up 48.7% in the last day, currently trading at at $0.144. At one point it hit a high of $0.2 &#8211; an 180% rise from its lowest level this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260754" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-3.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="674" height="375" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-3.jpg 674w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-3-300x167.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture6-3-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></a></p>
<p>Although the price has since corrected slightly, hopes remain high for XLM to continue rising, with the token having jumped above all moving averages.</p>
<p>Stellar Lumens&#8217; rise also coincides with a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/inflation-rose-just-0point2percent-in-june-less-than-expected-as-consumers-get-a-break-from-price-increases.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">recent drop in US consumer inflation</a>. The June data showed a 3% increase year-on-year, marking the lowest rate since March 2021.</p>
<p>At press time, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XLMUSDT/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TradingView’s data</a> suggests XLM faces resistance at the $0.15 mark after its rally from $0.09. A short-term downtrend might occur if it fails to cross this hurdle, with $0.12 as the first major support line.</p>
<p>Though a near-term price correction may be looming, XLM&#8217;s long-term outlook suggests a continued upward trend, especially after a recent bullish flag pattern on its daily chart.</p>
<p>Since the domino effects of the SEC’s recent loss can be seen in the altcoin market, many meme coins are also pumping, with new tokens Thug Life and ChimpZee particularly bullish.</p>
<h2><strong>Trending Meme Coin Thug Life Also Pumping as it Raises Over $1.5 Million with Two Days Left to Buy</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357?referrer=stellar-lumens-xlm-price-sees-huge-gains-after-xrp-ruling-while-these-tokens-are-also-surging" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is an emerging meme crypto reaching milestones even during turbulent market times. It aims to offer those investors who may have missed earlier meme coin booms an upside opportunity while focusing on community participation.</p>
<p>Within hours of its launch, $THUG collected over $100,000, showing a strong community response. At the time of writing, the presale has raised over $1.5 million.</p>
<p>In its presale stage, the platform plans to distribute 70% (2.94 billion) of the total 4.2 billion tokens, each priced at $0.0007 USDT, with a hard cap of $2.058 million.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260753" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-4.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="1024" height="599" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-4.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-4-300x175.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-4-768x449.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-4-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></p>
<p>According to the Thug Life website, it offers no utility but focuses solely on community building. But this hasn’t stopped meme coins from providing exceptional returns.</p>
<p>On the contrary, this approach has proven to be quite successful, evidenced in the case of Pepe, which even outperformed market leaders Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Once the presale ends, $THUG tokens will be listed on various Decentralized Crypto Exchanges (DEXs). The project will lock its liquidity pool for three months after launch to maintain price stability and encourage consistent growth.</p>
<p>Two 15% portions of the total supply are reserved for marketing and community rewards. These rewards, including airdrops and giveaways, are planned for after the token&#8217;s listing on DEXs.</p>
<p>Importantly, Thug Life&#8217;s anonymous team has not reserved any tokens for themselves, reducing the risk of scams or &#8216;rug pulls.&#8217;</p>

<h2><strong>Chimpzee Turning Heads with Climate-Friendly Utility </strong></h2>

The project blends digital rewards with eco-friendly actions, as it uses blockchain to back green causes and rewards its users with its unique $CHMPZ tokens.</p>
<p>Along with upside potential, it also offers the Chimpzee Diamond NFT passport, which gives holders benefits like a 20% staking APY and an AI-driven mobile app.</p>
<p>The project’s presale event has so far generated over $840, showing strong community support.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-10.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-260752" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-10.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="695" height="356" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-10.jpg 695w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-10-300x154.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-10-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px" /></a></p>
<p>As per the <a href="https://www.chimpzee.io/assets/chimpzeeWhitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Chimpzee whitepaper</a>, the platform offers five key features: the Shop-2-Earn store, NFT marketplace, Zero Tolerance Play-2-Earn game, NFT Passports, and Chimpzee AI Avatar Generator.</p>
<p>The Shop-2-Earn store lets users sell Chimpzee items to earn CHMPZ tokens, with some profits going to green groups. The NFT marketplace, on a Trade-2-Earn basis, shares trading revenue with users. In the Zero Tolerance Game, users earn CHMPZ tokens for reaching set goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, the limited NFT Passport offers benefits within Chimpzee&#8217;s ecosystem for trading, shopping, or gaming.</p>
<p>The Chimpzee AI Avatar Generator lets users create personalized chimpanzee avatars for their NFT Passports, adding an exclusive element for games.</p>
<p>Showing its green commitment, Chimpzee donates 10% of its tokens and some profits to eco-friendly initiatives.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The international presence of digital assets gives them the power to transcend any one national currency like the U.S. dollar, said BlackRock CEO Larry Fink on Friday.</p>
<p>During an interview, the executive highlighted what makes crypto unique from other asset classes, and the role BlackRock can play in the space.</p>
<h2>Democratizing Crypto Through ETFs</h2>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/blackrock-has-a-responsibility-to-democratize-investing-including-in-crypto-larry-fink-says.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, Fink highlighted BlackRock’s mission to “democratize investing,” by creating products that are cheap and easy for investors to use, and noted how that goal could extend to crypto assets.</p>

<p>An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is a fund trading on an exchange that tracks a particular index. Investors buy shares of the fund, and fund managers use investor funds to buy stocks, bonds, crypto, or whatever the fund intends to track.</p>
<p>Last month, BlackRock filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch a Bitcoin spot ETF in the United States. Since June, Bitcoin has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-sharks-and-whales-accumulated-2b-worth-of-btc-since-blackrocks-etf-filing/" data-wpel-link="internal">rallied</a> on optimism that BlackRock could be the first to get such a product approved, given its overwhelming success rate versus the SEC in the past.</p>
<p>Fink believes an increasing portion of the crypto market will be represented by ETFs down the line, and highlighted how the advent of a gold ETF ‘<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrocks-btc-etf-filing-could-democratize-crypto-ceo-larry-fink-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">democratized</a>” gold investing, by making it affordable to transact with the asset.</p>
<p>The CEO said BlackRock could do the same for crypto: “The cost to transact is quite expensive,” he said. “Over the last five years, more and more global investors are asking us about the role of crypto.”</p>
<h2>Crypto VS Other Currencies</h2>
<p>Fink also recognized crypto as an “international asset” that could “transcend any one currency,” citing U.S. dollar devaluation as a concern. “An international crypto product can really transcend that,” he said, adding that the asset class has attracted “broad-based” and “worldwide” interest.</p>
<p>His comments were well received by Bitcoin bulls like MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor, who often promote Bitcoin as a superior savings technology to dollars due to its limited supply.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[This week will go down in history with Ripple scoring a massive win against the US SEC in court. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The past seven days will go down in history as the week when Ripple scored a massive win in court against the United States Security and Exchange Commission. In fact, the news is so important that it&#8217;s hard to talk about anything else. However, it&#8217;s worth mentioning that the entire market took to the skies following the development, and BTC is finally trading above $31K, while ETH is above $2K.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s dive into some specifics.</p>
<p>More than three years ago, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple, alleging that the company conducted an unregistered sale of securities, essentially claiming that its XRP token constitutes a security. More specifically, the agency also alleged that secondary sales of XRP also constitute investment contracts, pushing many cryptocurrency exchanges to delist it.</p>
<p>Over the years, this has taken a massive toll on XRP as investors were staying away in anticipation of some sort of resolution. And while the case might not be over and headed to trial, Ripple scored a monumental win this week.</p>
<p>US Judge Analisa Torres stated that secondary sales of XRP do not constitute an investment contract. This had immediate implications on the entire industry because other altcoins that were also named in various SEC filings might also be off the hook. A lot of the exchanges that had previously delisted XRP immediately re-listed it.</p>
<p>The token soared by over 70% in the hours after the ruling.</p>
<p>The news also pushed the entire market up. Bitcoin is up 3% over the past 7 days, ETH &#8211; 7%, BNB &#8211; 9%, ADA &#8211; 22%, SOL &#8211; 31.7%, MATIC &#8211; 26%, and so forth. It&#8217;s worth noting that a whole lot of these (except ETH) have been named securities by the SEC on previous occasions.</p>
<p>In any case, much is left unresolved when it comes to the clash between the cryptocurrency industry and the US Securities and Exchange Commission, but it&#8217;s an undeniable fact that this week&#8217;s ruling was a huge win for the former.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Market Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Market Cap: $1,182B | 24H Vol: $36B | BTC Dominance: 44.1%</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BTC: $26,922 (+1.2%) | ETH: $1,881 (+3%) | BNB: $304 (-0.6%)</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Altcoins previously flagged securities by the SEC witnessed large gains following the court's ruling in the XRP case.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>XRP appears to be leading the altcoin rally fetching over 66% in the past day alone. This comes after Ripple Labs managed to score a victory in the SEC case crippling the financial regulator&#8217;s plan to regulate the digital asset industry. The market has reacted positively to the District Court for the Southern District of New York&#8217;s ruling.</p>
<p>Interestingly, altcoins that have posted significant gains are mostly the ones deemed as securities by the US financial regulator.</p>
<ul>
<li>Binance Coin (BNB) 7-day gains: 8.98%</li>
<li>Cardano (ADA) 7-day gains: 23.54%</li>
<li>Solana 7-day gains: 39.52%</li>
<li>Polygon 7-day gains: 25.97%</li>
<li>COTI 7-day gains: 12.79%</li>
<li>The Sandbox (MANA) 7-day gains: 13.06%</li>
</ul>
<p>The altcoin market &#8211; especially the PoS-based coins &#8211; chalked out double-digital gains as prices skyrocketed since XRP&#8217;s court ruling.</p>
<h2>PoW-Based Coins&#8217; Underwhelming Performance</h2>
<p>Even as Bitcoin quietly broke out of its $31k resistance, its peer PoW-powered coins have underperformed. Despite all the buzz surrounding the upcoming halving event, Litecoin&#8217;s network activity has slowed down, and its price followed a similar trajectory. Over the past week, the &#8220;silver&#8221; digital asset noted a mere 3% increase.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash&#8217;s (BCH) performance was underwhelming and slid down to $271 after a 3% decline in the past week. Bitcoin Satoshi&#8217;s Vision (BSV) was also down by 8.04% over the same period and was currently trading at $39.20, huddled up in the 58th spot by market cap.</p>
<p>Another PoW-based crypto eCash (XEC) also remained unfazed by the broader market movement, with its price plummeting by 19.15%.</p>
<p>The latest chart depicted a fairly contrasting picture to that of last week when proof-of-work coins <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/proof-of-work-coins-mark-mad-gains-on-7d-chart-in-hash-cash-frenzy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dominated</a> the gains amidst escalating tensions with the SEC as well as plunging energy prices.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Dominance Falter</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">XRP declared not a security.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dominance: <a href="https://t.co/veZDJTHQlu" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/veZDJTHQlu</a></p>
<p>— Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) <a href="https://twitter.com/WClementeIII/status/1679523580772589568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 13, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s share of the total crypto market tanked in the wake of the altcoin rally. According to data from CoinMarketCap, the dominance rate fell by nearly 2% from 50.04% pre-ruling to 48.58% at the time of writing. The turnaround is crucial because Bitcoin dominance had reached 50.80% of the total crypto market, marking its highest level since April 2021.</p>
<p>But the market flashed green, signaling the onset of a potential altseason after being stuck in a long crypto winter.</p>
