<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DeFi protocol Conic Finance suffered an exploit, allowing attackers to grab over 1,700 ETH worth over $3.2 million from its Omnipool.</em></li>



<li><em>The root cause of the attack was a &#8220;re-entrancy attack&#8221; resulting from a wrong assumption in the Curve Meta Registry for ETH in Curve V2 pools.</em></li>



<li><em>Conic Finance is actively addressing the issue, deploying a fix for the affected contract, and ensuring the safety of user withdrawals.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the latest announcement from Conic Finance, the DeFi protocol provided a detailed status update regarding the recent exploit that led to the loss of over 1,700 Ether (ETH), valued at over $3.2 million.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-1024x512.png" alt="Conic Finance Confirms Other Liquidity Pools Not Affected By Hack" class="wp-image-204867" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1519.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Conic Finance Confirms Other Liquidity Pools Not Affected By Hack 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The root cause of the attack was <a href="https://twitter.com/ConicFinance/status/1682385605668241408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">identified</a> as a &#8220;re-entrancy attack,&#8221; which exploited a wrong assumption about the address returned by the Curve Meta Registry for ETH in Curve V2 pools.</p>



<p>The re-entrancy attack is a well-known vulnerability in smart contracts that allows attackers to repeatedly call a protocol, tricking it into transferring assets. In this case, the attacker took advantage of a discrepancy in the price data provided by the oracle, enabling them to manipulate the pricing system and withdraw the stolen funds.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204773-conic-finance-3-2-million-attack-on-eth-omnipool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conic Finance</a> has been proactively addressing the issue and is deploying a fix to the affected contract to prevent further exploits. The protocol has confirmed that the exploit cannot be performed again on the ETH Omnipool, and user withdrawals are secure. Additionally, they assured the community that no other Conic Omnipools were affected by this particular issue.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="758" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520-1024x758.png" alt="Conic Finance Confirms Other Liquidity Pools Not Affected By Hack" class="wp-image-204868" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520-1024x758.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520-300x222.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520-768x568.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520-750x555.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520-1140x843.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1520.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Conic Finance Confirms Other Liquidity Pools Not Affected By Hack 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The incident highlights the significance of oracle systems in DeFi, as they provide real-time price data for various assets. However, they also present a potential attack vector for hackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.</p>



<p>This exploit came shortly after another DeFi platform, <a href="https://coincu.com/194236-sturdy-finance-was-attacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sturdy Finance</a>, suffered a similar oracle manipulation attack that resulted in an $800,000 loss. These incidents underscore the importance of ongoing vigilance and security measures within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<p>Conic Finance aims to provide a more detailed post-mortem analysis of the exploit soon, shedding light on the specific factors that allowed the re-entrancy attack to occur and the measures taken to prevent such occurrences in the future.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://coincu.com/200342-surge-in-defi-exit-scams-certik-report-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi</a> space continues to evolve, ensuring the security and integrity of protocols remains a top priority to safeguard user funds and foster trust in the ecosystem.</p>

<p>Recent reports have accused former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of paying millions to his defense lawyers using stolen funds. The accusations have been made on behalf of the now-collapsed crypto exchange, with lawyers claiming that Bankman-Fried used $10 million of misappropriated money to pay for his defense.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-defense-lawyers-with-ftx-funds-lawsuit.html#:~:text=A%20lawsuit%20against%20Sam%20Bankman,Joe%20Bankman%2C%20FTX%20lawyers%20say." target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-defense-lawyers-with-ftx-funds-lawsuit.html#:~:text=A%20lawsuit%20against%20Sam%20Bankman,Joe%20Bankman%2C%20FTX%20lawyers%20say." rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC </a>has reported on the initial accusations against Bankman-Fried. Furthermore, lawyers allege that the FTX founder “engineered a gift” of $10 million to his father, Joe Bankman. The FTX legal team is now suing the former CEO in Deleware bankruptcy court over the stolen funds.</p>



<p>This latest legal dispute adds to the list of offenses that Bankman-Fried is facing. He has been accused of fraud, bribery, and campaign finance violation charges. The once-revered cryptocurrency exchange was found to be fraudulent, and Bankman-Fried is a con man.</p>

<p>The FTX lawyers are attempting to recover the funds Bankman-Fried and other FTX executives misappropriated throughout their tenure. Lawyers claim that Bankman-Fried pilfered money by sending a $10 million gift to his father, Joe Bankman. The lawsuit further states that gifts had been tracked from the former CEO’s Morgan Stanley and TD Ameritrade accounts since early 2022, and those funds are now allegedly paying for his defense.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried has yet to comment on this latest legal dispute. However, the controversy surrounding FTX and its former CEO is one of the most thoroughly horrible in the young history of the digital asset industry. The cryptocurrency exchange collapsed almost instantly, and now, its executives are facing a barrage of legal troubles.</p>

<p>The couple, Heather Morgan and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein, were initially arrested in February 2022 and are scheduled to appear for a plea hearing on August 3 before Senior Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, according to court records.</p>



<p>Heather Morgan, also known as &#8220;Razzlekhan&#8221; in the hip-hop community where she promoted her music, and Ilya Lichtenstein are accused of conspiring to launder over 100,000 bitcoin stolen in the hack of Bitfinex. At the time of the hack, the stolen bitcoin was valued at $71 million, but its value had appreciated to more than $4.5 billion by the time of their arrest. Prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of assets worth approximately $3 billion, including various cryptocurrencies and cash from bank accounts, according to the charging document and current spot prices of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>The couple, who had active public profiles, are facing charges of money laundering conspiracy, with Morgan facing an additional count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, as per an updated charging document filed recently. Their case has drawn significant attention, particularly due to Morgan&#8217;s unique music videos and public persona, which added a touch of comic relief to the otherwise serious affair.</p>

<p>The emergence of the plea agreement marks the conclusion of one of the most sensational criminal cases in the cryptocurrency space, an industry that has witnessed its fair share of scandals. The couple&#8217;s alleged involvement in laundering the stolen cryptocurrency raised eyebrows in the crypto community and brought attention to the need for stronger security measures in the industry.</p>



<p>The seized Bitcoin, totaling 94,000 BTC, was successfully recovered by federal officials upon the couple&#8217;s arrest in early 2022. The Department of Justice (DOJ) had previously implied that the couple may have been linked to the original hackers, but did not formally make such claims. The couple was accused of laundering around 25,000 BTC, with access to an additional 94,000 BTC stolen during the Bitfinex exploit in 2016.</p>



<p>Initially, Morgan and Lichtenstein had planned to fight the charges, pointing out deficiencies in the government&#8217;s evidence against them. However, signs of a potential plea deal emerged in March 2022 when prosecutors indicated that they were in talks with Morgan&#8217;s attorneys regarding a possible resolution that wouldn&#8217;t involve a trial.</p>

<p>As part of the plea agreement, the couple has agreed to forfeit various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether, stablecoins, and cash, from their bank accounts. The precise length of their potential sentencing remains unclear, and their sentencing hearing is expected to take place before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington.</p>



<p>The case has shed light on the need for heightened security measures and increased vigilance in the cryptocurrency space to prevent such incidents and protect the integrity of the industry. With the plea agreement, the fate of the couple and their involvement in the Bitfinex hack is likely to be determined soon.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Paradigm, an institutional liquidity platform for crypto, launches Paradex, a decentralized perpetual platform on Starknet&#8217;s Layer 2 appchain.</em></li>



<li><em>Paradex combines CeFi liquidity with DeFi transparency and self-custody, addressing trust issues and fragmented risk engines in traditional finance.</em></li>



<li><em>Collaboration between Paradigm and StarkWare brings scalability and customization, ushering in a new era of hybrid derivatives exchanges in DeFi.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Paradigm, a prominent institutional liquidity platform for cryptocurrency, is making its entry into the decentralized finance (DeFi) arena with the unveiling of <a href="https://twitter.com/StarkWareLtd/status/1682409806076735488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradex</a>, an innovative decentralized perpetual platform.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1024x536.png" alt="Paradigm Unleashes Paradex: A Revolutionary Hybrid CeFi-DeFi Derivatives Exchange" class="wp-image-204848" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1536x804.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1511.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Paradigm Unleashes Paradex: A Revolutionary Hybrid CeFi-DeFi Derivatives Exchange 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Blending the best of both worlds, Paradex aims to offer a seamless trading experience by combining the liquidity prowess of centralized finance (CeFi) with the transparency and self-custody features of DeFi.</p>



<p>The birth of Paradex is the result of a productive six-month collaboration between <a href="https://coincu.com/152165-paradigm-crypto-derivatives-reduces/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradigm</a> and <a href="https://coincu.com/165000-starkware-will-power-eth-layer-2-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StarkWare</a>, the visionary company behind Ethereum&#8217;s layer 2 network, Starknet. As a testament to its versatility, Paradex will operate as an independent chain within Starknet&#8217;s developer stack, effectively positioning it as a Layer 2 appchain.</p>

<p>The choice of Starknet as the platform for Paradex comes as no surprise, given its capacity for scalability, control, and customization. Nafaa Hendaoui, Head of Product at Paradex, expressed enthusiasm for Starknet&#8217;s private instance, <a href="https://coincu.com/204036-starknet-starknet-appchains-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Appchain</a>, which provides a robust solution to accommodate Paradex&#8217;s ambitious vision.</p>

<p>One of Paradex&#8217;s primary aims is to address the trust deficit that has emerged in the realm of centralized finance, with FTX&#8217;s multi-billion-dollar collapse due to a liquidity crisis caused by management decisions serving as a poignant example. By integrating the transparency and trustlessness of DeFi, Paradex endeavors to furnish users with a secure and reliable trading platform.</p>



<p>Beyond enhancing trust, the platform seeks to tackle the challenges posed by fragmentation within legacy CeFi risk engines. Such fragmentation adversely affects capital efficiency and liquidity levels, prompting Paradex to devise an all-encompassing solution.</p>



<p>Paradigm, with its wealth of experience in catering to both institutional crypto derivatives traders and the DeFi sector, is confidently venturing into the Layer 2 domain with the introduction of Paradex. By leveraging Starknet&#8217;s capabilities, the platform aims to offer an unparalleled trading experience, fostering greater adoption of DeFi within the institutional sphere.</p>



<p>As Paradex takes flight, the industry eagerly anticipates how this hybrid derivatives exchange will shape the future of decentralized finance and redefine the landscape of crypto trading.</p>

<p>Utopia Labs has launched USDC stablecoin bank transfers for businesses in an effort to accelerate crypto payment adoption. This new offering will allow entities from almost all over the world to send <a href="https://coincu.com/203389-circles-usdc-suffers-100m-loss-as-usdt-dominates/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/203389-circles-usdc-suffers-100m-loss-as-usdt-dominates/" rel="noreferrer noopener">USDC</a> to any U.S. bank account without needing to go through centralized exchanges.  </p>



<p>Utopia said that the U.S. banking system has failed to support crypto organizations, and its solution addresses this shortfall head-on. Businesses that make, raise or send money in crypto can pay service providers, office rent, or &#8220;literally anyone who has a U.S. bank account&#8221; via USDC, according to the firm.</p>



<p>Businesses interested in using the service can apply by submitting their know-your-business (KYB) and know-your-customer (KYC) verification details to Utopia Labs, which says it can approve applications in under two business days. Once approved, businesses can start off-ramping USDC at a guaranteed 1:1 conversion rate with the U.S. dollar for a 0.3% fee. The USDC transfers are exclusive to the Ethereum blockchain with no limits and are compliant with ACH (automated clearing house) transfers, received in less than three business days, according to the firm.</p>

<p>While the service is available to most countries worldwide, companies in Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Belarus and Russia are not supported, Utopia added. Utopia&#8217;s roadmap includes providing off-ramping for any token, not just USDC, expanding to other blockchain networks, and introducing on-ramps to get fiat into crypto. Beyond crypto payments, Utopia Labs also offers treasury management for Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) users, enabling token swaps with liquidity across more than 100 decentralized exchanges through its integration with 0x Protocol.</p>



<p>Utopia Labs raised $23 million in a 2022 Series A funding round led by Paradigm, with participation from Circle Ventures and Coinbase Ventures. The firm&#8217;s roadmap includes more offerings like off-ramping for any token, expanding to other blockchain networks, and introducing on-ramps to get fiat into crypto.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/trm-finds-mounting-evidence-of-crypto-use-by-isis-and-its-supporters-in-asia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> highlights several instances of pro-ISIS groups in different regions leveraging cryptocurrencies for their operations.</p>



<p>According to TRM Labs, in Tajikistan, multiple pro-ISIS groups raised around $2 million in <a href="https://coincu.com/202103-tether-issues-1-billion-usdt-tron-network-usdt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tron-based USDT</a> in 2022. These funds were used for recruiting fighters for ISIS&#8217;s affiliate in Afghanistan, known as the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP). <a href="https://coincu.com/117810-trm-labs-explains-tornado-blocking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRM Labs</a> traced the money to an unnamed centralized exchange, which was subsequently notified about the illicit activities. As a result, Turkish authorities arrested a senior fundraiser, Shamil Hukumatov, who was allegedly behind the fundraising campaign.</p>



<p>Another pro-ISIS group managed to raise over $517,000 using an account on an Indonesia-based exchange. The group&#8217;s campaign aimed to free members held in Syrian internment camps. Interestingly, the donations to this campaign were often made in substantial amounts, around $10,000 each.</p>



<p>TRM Labs also discovered that those affiliates in Pakistan raised approximately $40,000 over the past year, pretending to help victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023. These funds were obtained through fraudulent fundraising campaigns.</p>

<p>The report further reveals that the al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production, a pro-ISIS media organization in Afghanistan, also utilized cryptocurrencies for fundraising purposes. TRM Labs identified wallets controlled by the group that received $10,000.</p>



<p>The use of cryptocurrencies by terrorist groups for fundraising and illicit activities poses significant challenges for authorities and financial institutions. TRM Labs&#8217; report sheds light on the evolving tactics employed by these groups to exploit the anonymity and decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies for their nefarious activities.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the US Treasury Department&#8217;s <a href="https://coincu.com/184915-poloniex-settles-7-6-million-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) </a>previously sanctioned five Indonesian nationals in May 2022 for facilitating money transfers from Indonesia to members in Syria. This highlights the ongoing efforts of authorities to address the use of cryptocurrencies in funding terrorist activities.</p>

<p>As terrorist groups continue to innovate their fundraising methods, blockchain analytics firms and law enforcement agencies are working tirelessly to track and disrupt their operations, safeguarding the integrity of the crypto ecosystem and global security.</p>

<p>This much-anticipated protocol is set to transform the way users interact with their wallets and explore new possibilities in the web3 ecosystem.</p>



<p>First announced back in 2020, Snaps has been described by <a href="https://coincu.com/204081-metamask-will-provide-linea-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaMask</a> as &#8220;an open-source system that allows anyone to safely extend the functionality of MetaMask&#8221; by creating new web3 experiences. The protocol empowers developers to build specialized features on top of the MetaMask wallet, enhancing its capabilities and providing users with a more tailored and versatile experience.</p>



<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Snaps is its ability to enable wallet users to run applications deployed on different networks using MetaMask. This cross-chain functionality opens up a world of possibilities for users who can seamlessly interact with different blockchain networks and access a broader range of decentralized applications (dApps) with ease.</p>

<p>Snaps are essentially isolated JavaScript programs that customize users&#8217; wallet experiences based on specific permissions granted by the users themselves. These snaps are composable, which means users can create modular snap-stacks, combining different snaps to tailor the functionality of their wallet to their preferences. This level of customization empowers users to curate their own wallet experience and access features that matter most to them.</p>



<p>Moreover, snaps offer a powerful way to enhance security within the wallet. For instance, a snap can provide warnings and alerts to users when attempting to interact with potentially malicious smart contracts, thereby safeguarding them from potential scams or attacks. This additional layer of protection is invaluable in an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving blockchain landscape.</p>



<p>The MetaMask team has been proactive in supporting snap developers through grants and hackathons organized by the MetaMask Grants DAO. While the grants might not cover developers&#8217; entire expenses, they are intended to provide a solid foundation for them to build, deploy, and have their snaps audited. The goal is to encourage innovation and creativity among developers, fostering a thriving ecosystem of snap-based applications that ultimately benefit MetaMask users.</p>



<p>MetaMask is committed to maintaining Snaps as an open platform, allowing developers to create snaps that are useful and valuable to users. The more popular and impactful these snaps become, the greater the benefit to the entire user base. This open approach aligns with the spirit of decentralization and community collaboration that underpins the web3 movement.</p>



<p>With Snaps on the horizon, MetaMask is once again solidifying its position as a leading player in the blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi) space. As the protocol prepares for its launch in Q4, the community eagerly awaits the exciting new experiences that Snaps will bring to the world of <a href="https://coincu.com/193298-metamask-integratesn-with-fireblocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Web3</a> and decentralized applications.</p>



<p>MetaMask is not only gearing up for the launch of its Snaps protocol but also introducing another exciting feature, the MetaMask Portfolio. This new addition aims to revolutionize how users manage and explore the world of Web3, providing a comprehensive view of their digital assets in one centralized Dashboard.</p>

<p>With the <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1682042135225446404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaMask Portfolio</a>, users can now easily track, manage, and monitor their tokens, NFTs, and transactions across multiple accounts and networks. The days of navigating through various tabs and wallets to keep tabs on their assets are gone.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Optimism is adding zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enable secure and efficient cross-chain communication between its Layer 2 solution and Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>The ZKPs will be provided by O(1) Labs and RISC Zero, enhancing security and reducing latency in the network.</em></li>



<li><em>Optimism aims to improve its ecosystem&#8217;s performance and compatibility with existing systems, paving the way for more accessible development using Solidity and EVM.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution, Optimism, is making strides in improving cross-chain communication with the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). The initiative aims to enable secure and efficient communication between layers and directly between OP chains, enhancing privacy and security in blockchain transactions.</strong></h5>

<p><a href="https://coincu.com/192902-optimisms-layer-2-network-upgrade-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism</a> recently <a href="https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/ecosystem-contributions/issues/61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> that they will be moving forward with proposals from O(1) Labs and RISC Zero, both offering innovative solutions to bring ZKPs to the platform. ZKPs are cryptographic concepts that allow one party to prove the truth of a statement to another party without revealing any additional information. This implementation will revamp Optimism&#8217;s tech stack, ensuring faster and more secure transactions.</p>



<p>RISC Zero&#8217;s proposal seeks to upgrade Optimism&#8217;s existing fault protocol, using ZKPs to validate state changes on the platform. Users can prove the correctness of state changes with ZKPs, while also challenging any incorrect state changes with supporting proofs.</p>



<p>On the other hand, O(1) Labs, known for incubating the <a href="https://coincu.com/179253-mina-protocol-launched-its-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mina Protocol</a>, is proposing a new fault-proof solution using Kimchi, a ZK-proof system used in Mina. This solution allows efficient proof of correct transaction execution, which is then used to update the Ethereum network&#8217;s state via smart contracts, enhancing performance, security, and compatibility.</p>

<p>The incorporation of ZKPs will enhance Optimism&#8217;s cross-chain communication capabilities by bolstering security, decreasing latency, and making the platform more affordable and efficient. The Optimism Foundation is actively working with O(1) Labs and RISC Zero to finalize the project and set detailed expectations.</p>

<p>Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky was arrested in July and charged with defrauding customers at the now-bankrupt crypto lender. His former colleague, Celsius’s chief revenue officer, and longtime lawyer Roni Cohen-Pavon have also been charged with aiding in some of Mashinsky’s alleged crimes. </p>



<p>Prosecutors allege that Cohen-Pavon was key to one of Mashinsky’s schemes, manipulating Celsius’s native token CEL to mislead customers and line the executives’ pockets. While Mashinsky was the public face of Celsius, Cohen-Pavon operated behind the scenes. He allegedly took home $3.6 million from selling his CEL holdings, while Mashinsky allegedly pocketed $42 million.</p>



<p>Cohen-Pavon had a strong interest in crypto and helped architect the Celsius initial coin offering in 2018. In 2020, he allegedly helped craft a doomed deal with the decentralized finance app KeyFi, which compounded Celsius’s financial woes. Despite concerns about Celsius internally, Mashinsky used his weekly Q&amp;As to create a much rosier picture for customers. For instance, he claimed the ICO was a huge success. Celsius raised $50 million, Mashinsky claimed and sold all the CEL tokens it had offered. But in reality, prosecutors say, Celsius underperformed, raising only $32 million and failing to sell one-third of its tokens.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="340" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496.png" alt="Celsius Network: A Story Of Greed And Deception By CEO And Lawyer" class="wp-image-204805" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1496-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Celsius Network: A Story Of Greed And Deception By CEO And Lawyer 26"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cohen-Pavon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>By early 2021, Mashinsky discovered a sizable hole in Celsius’s balance sheet, partly from using customer deposits to purchase CEL. Prosecutors say he kept the problem under wraps and handpicked Cohen-Pavon to oversee Celsius’s frenzied CEL purchases on the open market. Publicly, Celsius claimed to buy CEL to meet its promise of customer rewards. Still, prosecutors allege it was buying well above that amount to prop up the price of the cryptocurrency artificially.</p>



<p>Cohen-Pavon was still on the payroll after the company filed for bankruptcy, and he was even in line to receive up to $239,000 to help restructure the company, according to documents in the bankruptcy case. He wasn’t placed on administrative leave until after the US Attorney’s office in Manhattan announced charges against him and Mashinsky. Celsius attorney Christopher S. Koenig said during a bankruptcy hearing days after the arrests that Cohen-Pavon would be fired “in short order.”</p>



<p>While announcing charges against Cohen-Pavon, US Attorney Damian Williams wouldn’t say whether the office would seek his extradition. Israel has historically erred against extraditing its citizens to face charges in other jurisdictions, said Michael Zweiback, an attorney who worked on two cases involving extradition with Israel as a federal prosecutor. In 2007, the country changed its treaty with the US to send its citizens to America if any prison sentence is served back in Israel, but Zweiback says the process is still difficult.</p>
