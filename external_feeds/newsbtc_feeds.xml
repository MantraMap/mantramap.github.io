					<description><![CDATA[DeFi protocol, Hector Network, has closed its official Discord server, leaving many investors in the dark.

This has led to a lot of backlash, and according to Libagscientist, an investor and vocal critic of the platform, “there is no backchannel open anymore.”  In the absence of any official communication, dejected investors are accusing the network of siphoning the $16 million left in its treasury.  According to investors, the team embezzled the project’s funds over an 18-month period starting in 2021.

					<description><![CDATA[In a thought-provoking blog post titled &#8220;Moai,&#8221; Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the renowned crypto exchange BitMEX, delves into the potential impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on the future of economic organization and the role of Ethereum. Hayes argues that the rise of AI-driven Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) will revolutionize the global economy and propel Ethereum to new heights. The Critical Role Of DAOs In The AI Era Hayes contends that the current economic progress and per capita wealth of global civilization can be attributed to the efficient self-organization of human societies. He emphasizes that traditional company structures, empowered and regulated by the state, have been the primary vehicles for economic development. However, he highlights the limitations of these structures when it comes to AI-driven entities. He states, &#8220;An AI has no reason to follow any laws. It cannot be coerced by the state, and therefore, exchanges that trade tokens issued by AI-powered DAOs will likely become natural monopolies.&#8221; Related Reading: Lacoste Unveils Exclusive Ethereum-Based Virtual Store For NFT Holders Hayes lays out a compelling argument for why DAOs, relying on smart contracts executed on public blockchains like Ethereum, are the ideal organizational structure for AI-driven entities. These smart contracts provide transparency, immutability, and cryptographic verification of transactions and agreements. Consequently, DAOs can operate efficiently and securely without the need for third-party intermediaries or costly auditing processes. He envisions a future where AI-powered DAOs will raise capital and trade their tokens on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum rather than traditional centralized exchanges. This will create truly global capital markets accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Hayes predicts that DEXs will become natural monopolies due to the advantages they offer in terms of trust, security, and ease of use. The BitMEX founder presents a hypothetical example of &#8220;PoetAI,&#8221; an AI-powered DAO that aims to fundraise and produce original poetry for profit. He envisions how PoetAI could issue its tokens, called &#8220;POET,&#8221; through a smart contract with specific attributes, such as revenue sharing and voting mechanisms. Investors can confidently invest in PoetAI DAO knowing that its financial statements are continuously available on the public blockchain, eliminating the need for traditional auditors. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Could Avoid More Downsides If It Closes Above One Key Level Moreover, Hayes explains that DAOs can raise capital by issuing debt, enabling economic time travel by borrowing from the future to stimulate present economic activity. The enforceability of contracts in DAOs can be facilitated through smart contracts on public blockchains, ensuring that investors are protected. Hayes’ Bull Case For Ethereum Hayes concludes, &#8220;Ethereum transactions will grow exponentially as DAOs proliferate. As a result, the price of ETH should skyrocket in anticipation if this AI DAO hypothesis is widely believed.&#8221; He also suggests that identifying and investing in Ethereum based governance tokens of DEXs facilitating AI-driven DAO trading will lead to significant profits. Furthermore, Ethereum middleware layers that enable visualization of AI DAO accounts will become essential for the smooth functioning of these capital markets. While these ideas represent bold predictions about the future of AI and the role of Ethereum, Hayes presents a compelling case for the potential disruptive power of AI-driven DAOs. Hayes is one of the great thinkers of crypto space and his thesis a narrative to watch. At press time, the Ether (ETH) price was at $1,863, just below the mid-range resistance.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin price is currently in an uncertain situation. After BTC broke below the one-month trading range between $29.800 and $31.500, the bulls have so far failed to recapture this area. A first attempt failed on Wednesday at $29.725, a second effort on Thursday at $29.600. On the other hand, the bears currently also fail to push the price below the critical support at $29.000. In which direction the next movement will go is, as always, pure speculation, but data can give indications. Bullish Signal 1: Decreasing BTC Supply On Exchanges Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an intriguing bullish chart, revealing that only 2.25 million BTC are currently held in known crypto exchange wallets. This is the lowest Bitcoin supply on trading platforms since January 2018. The data suggests that investors and long-term holders are refraining from selling and are instead choosing to keep their BTC off exchanges. This &#8220;hodling&#8221; behavior indicates a positive sentiment BTC holders. Bullish Signal 2: Lack Of Inflows From Bitcoin Whales Head of Research at CryptoQuant, Julio Moreno, pointed out another bullish sign when he shared a chart showing a lack of inflows from large investors with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC (aka Bitcoin whales) into exchanges. Moreno stated, “&#8221;Not really seeing Bitcoin whale inflows into exchanges.&#8221; Additionally, the same trend is observed among smaller investors, indicating a reluctance to deposit BTC into centralized exchanges. Commenting on the exchange deposit transactions (7-day SMA) chart, Moreno added, “indeed, seems nobody wants to deposit into centralized exchanges.&#8221; Related Reading: Don’t Change The Channel! Why Bitcoin Could Target $42K If Uptrend Holds Such behavior suggests that significant holders and institutions are holding onto their BTC assets, potentially anticipating future price increases. Bearish Signal: Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV Metric On-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. addressed the short-term holder (STH) MVRV metric, saying: &#8220;STH MVRV is actively falling and we may see something similar to what happened in the two previous corrections.&#8221; The chart shown by Adler reveals that the STH MVRV fell either close to 0 or even below during the lows of the sharp Bitcoin price corrections in mid-March and mid-June. Currently, the STH MVRV is still somewhat elevated, so a last pullback in the Bitcoin price triggered by short term holder selling may be necessary for the MVRV to reset to 0. Adler also remarked that there isn&#8217;t a substantial Inflow to futures exchanges at the moment like there was in March and June. &#8220;Don&#8217;t expect a sharp breakthrough upwards or downwards,&#8221; added Adler. BTC Binance Spot Liquidity Analysis Analyst @52kskew shared a comprehensive analysis of BTC Binance spot liquidity, highlighting an interesting observation. The bid liquidity (bids &#62; asks) and spot asks moved lower towards price due to low volatility. He added, “note the difference in volume leading to previous selloff &#38; current falling volume &#38; minimal decline.” Related Reading: Fed’s No Recession Claim Boosts Bitcoin And Crypto, Historical Data Contradicts Given the bid liquidity between $29,000 and $28,500, this area could be the point for buyers to step in if BTC experiences a pullback. In a bullish scenario, spot buying would occur in this area, followed by a rotation out of shorts. New longs get opened and price migrates towards spot supply near $30,000. In a sell off scenario, price grinds through spot bid liquidity and forced selling occurs, says Skew. Potential Impact of Economic Data On Bitcoin In addition, it is crucial to keep an eye on macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) at 8:30 am EST today is of particular importance. During Wednesday&#8217;s FOMC press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the importance of core inflation, which is proving sticky. Therefore, the Core PCE in particular, needs to continue falling to alleviate the Fed&#8217;s inflation concerns. If the 4.2% expectation for core PCE is exceeded, a bullish reaction from Bitcoin can be expected. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $29,210.

<p>Analyst @52kskew shared a comprehensive analysis of BTC Binance spot liquidity, highlighting an interesting observation. The bid liquidity (bids &gt; asks) and spot asks moved lower towards price due to low volatility. He added, “note the difference in volume leading to previous selloff &amp; current falling volume &amp; minimal decline.”</p>

<p>Given the bid liquidity between $29,000 and $28,500, this area could be the point for buyers to step in if BTC experiences a pullback. In a bullish scenario, spot buying would occur in this area, followed by a rotation out of shorts. New longs get opened and price migrates towards spot supply near $30,000. In a sell off scenario, price grinds through spot bid liquidity and forced selling occurs, says Skew.</p>

<h2>Potential Impact of Economic Data On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In addition, it is crucial to keep an eye on macroeconomic factors that could influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price. The release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index (PCE) at 8:30 am EST today is of particular importance.</p>
<p>During Wednesday&#8217;s FOMC press conference, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the importance of core inflation, which is proving sticky. Therefore, the Core PCE in particular, needs to continue falling to alleviate the Fed&#8217;s inflation concerns. If the 4.2% expectation for core PCE is exceeded, a bullish reaction from Bitcoin can be expected.</p>
<p>At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $29,210.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable downturn recently, unable to sustain itself above the $32 mark. The altcoin remains below a strong resistance level, but a potential breakthrough could lead to a 20% price appreciation. Related Reading: PEPE Whales Load Up Their Bags As Memecoin Jumps 13% In the last 24 hours, SOL saw a modest surge of 2.2%, but its performance on the weekly chart shows minimal upward movement. Despite the challenges, there are two essential bullish signals to consider: the morning star reversal sign and a bullish pennant formation. These signals suggest that if SOL surpasses the immediate resistance, the coin might aim for a rally back to levels it reached two weeks ago. In the broader market context, Bitcoin&#8217;s re-entry into the $29,000 price level has caused retracements in altcoins on their respective charts. Therefore, for SOL to surpass the immediate resistance, it will require strong support from the broader market. The market capitalization of SOL has also experienced a decline, indicating a slight weakening in buying strength. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SOL was valued at $24.90. The coin tried to reach the $32 level, but the bulls faced resistance and could not sustain it. Subsequently, SOL has been striving to breach the immediate resistance level at $26. A successful move above $26 could propel the coin&#8217;s value to $28. It may encounter a potential price ceiling at that level. If this level is surpassed, the coin could rally further to reach $30. On the other hand, there is a downside risk. If SOL fails to hold above the $26 level, it might face a decline to $21. A further fall below this mark could result in a drop to $18. The price movement remains crucial for SOL&#8217;s future trajectory. Technical Analysis The market exhibited bullish signals, with the bulls taking control despite a slight dip in buying strength. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicated buyers dominated the market, as it remained above the half-line. Moreover, the price movement above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line highlighted the influence of buyers in driving the price momentum. Should the price maintain its position above the 20-SMA, increased demand is anticipated to propel the asset&#8217;s value above the immediate resistance line. This could potentially lead to further bullish movement in the market. Despite the continued dominance of buyers, SOL presented sell signals on the daily chart. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed red signal bars, suggesting a potential slight dip in the price before any attempt to breach the $26 mark. This indicator reflects the price momentum and its shift. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) was below the half-line, indicating that capital inflows were lower than capital outflows. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ascendance: How It Captured PEPE Investors’ Attention This observation suggests a potential decrease in buying pressure at the given moment. The upcoming trading sessions hold significance for the altcoin&#8217;s price movement, as the broader market may influence the further trajectory of SOL.

					<description><![CDATA[Decentralized Exchange (DEX) PancakeSwap (CAKE), has announced the launch of PancakeSwap v3 on zkSync Era, a Layer 2 scaling solution that promises to deliver improved scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness to its users. According to the announcement, with the popularity of ZK rollups increasing and users and builders increasingly looking to L2 solutions, PancakeSwap is thrilled to offer users and developers even more reasons to build and trade on its DEX. The Benefits Of PancakeSwap v3&#8217;s Swap Feature On zkSync Era PancakeSwap v3 on zkSync Era comes with several exciting features, including Swap, Liquidity Provision (LP), Farms, and Initial Farm Offering (IFO).  The Swap feature allows users to enjoy quick and cost-effective token swaps through a user-friendly interface. With multi-tier fee structures ranging from 0.01% to 1%, traders can select the fee structure that aligns best with their trading preferences and liquidity pool engagement.  With low trading fees, users can trade their favorite tokens seamlessly while enjoying enhanced liquidity and reduced slippage. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Records Positive Moves As Bears Took Control, What’s Pushing It? Moreover, the Liquidity Provision feature lets users become part of PancakeSwap&#8217;s thriving decentralized exchange ecosystem by providing liquidity. Liquidity providers earn passive income through trading fees when people use their liquidity pool to complete swaps.  Per the announcement, with the scalability of zkSync Era, users can maximize their returns, achieving an impressive capital multiplier of up to 4000x. Users can engage in Swap, LP, and social media tasks to earn loyalty points and unlock exclusive NFTs. The Galxe campaign provides an opportunity to explore and experience the power of PancakeSwap on this ecosystem, unlocking the full potential of the platform. Ultimately, the integration with zkSync Era allows PancakeSwap to increase its transaction capacity and reduce congestion on the Ethereum network. As the popularity of DeFi continues to grow, the Ethereum network has become congested, leading to high gas fees and slower transaction times.  By leveraging Layer 2 scaling solutions like zkSync, PancakeSwap can significantly increase its transaction capacity, reduce congestion, and offer users a more reliable and cost-effective trading experience. What’s more, the integration with zkSync Era is expected to pave the way for the mass adoption of DeFi. By offering users faster and cheaper transactions, PancakeSwap can attract more users to the platform, increasing the adoption of DeFi as a whole.  PancakeSwap&#8217;s Revenue Hit By Market Conditions PancakeSwap has experienced some fluctuations in its market performance recently. According to Token Terminal data, PancakeSwap&#8217;s circulating market cap is currently $313.88 million, with a 1.16% decline in the past 24 hours.  Meanwhile, its fully diluted market cap has declined by 3.22% in the same period, currently standing at $1.12 billion.  Related Reading: Sui Foundation Dumps MovEX After Contract Violation Similarly, the total value locked on the platform has also decreased by 0.77% in the past 24 hours, currently sitting at $1.23 billion. Over the past 30 days, PancakeSwap has generated $1.20 million in revenue, representing a decline of 26.02%. Its annualized revenue has also decreased by 32.11% to $14.55 million. The trading volume on PancakeSwap for the past year is $40.22 billion, indicating a 16.00% decline. The fully diluted P/F ratio of PancakeSwap has increased by 31.2% to 26.21x, while its P/S ratio has also increased by 29.1% to 76.46x. In the past 30 days, PancakeSwap has generated $3.49 million in fees, representing a decline of 27.23%. Its annualized fees have decreased by 32.59% to $42.45 million. These figures suggest that PancakeSwap&#8217;s performance has been impacted by recent market trends. Despite the decline in revenue and trading volume, the platform&#8217;s P/F and P/S ratios have increased, indicating a higher valuation for the company.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last day, the majority of the crypto market has been rallying alongside Bitcoin. But Dogecoin seems to have a mind of its own as it has gone in the opposite direction. The meme coin started out Thursday with a decline, which follows the trend of DOGE deviating from the general crypto market trend over the past week. Dogecoin Fails To Register Similar Gains To Larger Altcoins Dogecoin has struggled to keep up with the gains of top altcoins such as Ethereum and XRP. In this time, the meme coin has maintained a rather constrained trend, falling over 3% in the early hours of Thursday while the likes of Bitcoin saw recoveries. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023 This is not the first that DOGE has gone in the opposite direction in as many days. Earlier in the week, the price of Bitcoin fell below $30,000, taking the broader market down with it. However, DOGE remained resilient in the face of this bear trend as billionaire Elon Musk reiterated his support for the digital asset once more. With the change of Twitter to X, Musk had changed his location to X but added the infamous DOGE symbol as well. This move sparked speculation of Dogecoin being integrated into the social media platform as a payment method and the price rallied as a result of this. Thus, while digital assets across the space saw their prices falling, Dogecoin was rising as high as double-digit daily gains. So the meme coin’s deviation during the market recovery comes as no surprise given the expected cool-off from its earlier rally. DOGE price struggles to break $0.08 resistance &#124; Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com DOGE Becomes 7th-Largest Cryptocurrency Despite Dogecoin not following the market uptrend, the meme coin continues to maintain its standing in the market. DOGE is currently the 7th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $11.1 billion. This puts it ahead of Cardano, which lost its spot to the meme coin following’s DOGE’s multiple rallies this week. However, DOGE is currently seeing a significant slowdown in its momentum with a rapid decline in daily trading volume. According to Coinmarketcap, the daily trading volume of Dogecoin is down more than 45% in the last day to rest at $678 million at this time. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s Time To Buy Dogecoin, Here’s Why This nosedive in trading volume indicates that investors may already be moving away from the asset as they believe the rally might already be over. Given this, the meme coin may have a hard time mounting a recovery at this level. Nonetheless, the slowdown in momentum would not matter if Musk mentions the coin in the coming days as it would rally nonetheless.

However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-similar-trend-that-led-to-2021-rally/" rel="nofollow">DOGE remained resilient in the face of this bear trend</a> as billionaire Elon Musk reiterated his support for the digital asset once more.</p>
<p class="p2">With the change of Twitter to X, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-twitter-elon-musk-drops-hints/" rel="nofollow">Musk had changed his location to X but added the infamous DOGE symbol as well</a>. This move sparked speculation of Dogecoin being integrated into the social media platform as a payment method and the price rallied as a result of this.</p>
<p class="p2">Thus, while digital assets across the space saw their prices falling, Dogecoin was rising as high as double-digit daily gains. So the meme coin’s deviation during the market recovery comes as no surprise given the expected cool-off from its earlier rally.</p>

<h2 class="p2">DOGE Becomes 7th-Largest Cryptocurrency</h2>
<p class="p2">Despite Dogecoin not following the market uptrend, the meme coin continues to maintain its standing in the market. DOGE is currently the 7th-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $11.1 billion. This puts it ahead of Cardano, which lost its spot to the meme coin following’s DOGE’s multiple rallies this week.</p>
<p class="p2">However, DOGE is currently seeing a significant slowdown in its momentum with a rapid decline in daily trading volume. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow">Coinmarketcap</a>, the daily trading volume of Dogecoin is down more than 45% in the last day to rest at $678 million at this time.</p>

<p class="p2">This nosedive in trading volume indicates that investors may already be moving away from the asset as they believe the rally might already be over. Given this, the meme coin may have a hard time mounting a recovery at this level. Nonetheless, the slowdown in momentum would not matter if <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-twitter-elon-musk-drops-hints/" rel="nofollow">Musk mentions the coin</a> in the coming days as it would rally nonetheless.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A noteworthy development has occurred in regulating the United States’ crypto space as a House Committee has approved a bill to bring clarity into the industry.  On July 26, the U.S House Financial Services Committee approved the Financial Innovation and Technology Act for the 21st Century Act, popularly known as FIT21. #PASSED: In a historic first, the House Financial Services Committee just advanced the BIPARTISAN FIT for the 21st Century Act to protect consumers and provide clear rules of the road for the digital asset ecosystem.

Although Armstrong believed the bill would likely be modified as it passes the complete legislative process, its approval by the House Committee was vital to safeguard the crypto space, “American innovation and national security.” Related Reading: New Crypto Bill Demands SEC And CFTC To Draft Rules For Trading Platforms The FIT21 Act &#8211; A  Landmark Legislation For U.S. Crypto Space?  The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Act was recently introduced to the House on July 20.  In the Act’s introductory statements, Representative French Hill, who serves as Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion, referred to the bill as a “landmark legislation” critical to creating an efficient regulatory framework to safeguard crypto users&#8217; interests. The U.S. House Representative further stated that this bill would have prevented the FTX crisis and provided much-needed clarity in crypto. Hill said: This legislation would not only have prevented FTX from stealing billions of customer funds, but also establishes robust consumer protections and clear rules of the road for market participants.  In addition, the FIT21 Act will enhance cooperation between the two financial regulators trying to assume control of the U.S. crypto market. U.S. Representative Dusty Johnson, another sponsor of the bill, emphasized this motion saying: The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate.
