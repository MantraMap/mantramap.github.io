										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Bybit will not accept new account applications from Canadian residents and nationals as from 31 May.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Existing customers have until 31 July and thereafter they will only be able to withdraw funds.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Any open positions after 30 September 2023 will be liquidated, the exchange said in a notice.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency exchange Bybit is exiting the Canadian market, according to a notice the company <a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/en-US/article/notice-on-exit-from-canadian-market-bltc1bfb8746d077fda/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">published</a> on Tuesday, 30 May.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exchange noted that the decision to exit <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/canada/">Canada</a> was reached as a result of recent regulatory developments. Bybit said that while it had always been its &ldquo;primary objective&rdquo; to comply with all local rules and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/regulation/">regulations</a>, the decision to leave was necessary &ndash; even if difficult.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bybit is thus pausing its activities and products in the Canadian market as from 31 May 2023.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">No new accounts for Canadian residents</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Beginning Wednesday, 31 May, Bybit will no longer accept account opening applications from new users ascertained to be from Canada. The restriction applies to all existing Canadian nationals, the exchange noted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Existing Canadian customers will still be able to use the platform until 31 July, when they will also be restricted from making new deposits or entering into new contracts. Bybit will also not allow them to increase existing positions across all products and services effective on that date. However, customers will still be able to withdraw funds or reduce existing positions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Overall, Canadian customers have until 30 September, 2023, 8am UTC to wind down positions. Any margin or derivatives positions still open after this date will be liquidated, with funds made available for withdrawal.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Several crypto firms have exited Canada</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bybit&rsquo;s exit from Canada comes a day after the exchange <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bybit-gets-in-principle-approval-to-begin-operations-in-kazakhstan/">announced</a> it had received &ldquo;in-principle&rdquo; approval to expand its operations into Kazakhstan.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, the news also come a few weeks after <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/binance/">Binance</a>, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, exited Canada. As <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-announces-exit-from-canada/">reported</a>, Binance cited new developments around crypto guidelines from Canadian regulators as the reason for its decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Since February, when the Canadian Securities Adminstration (CSA) formalised new requirements for crypto exchange operators, several providers have exited. As CoinJournal also <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/what-does-binance-leaving-crypto-mean-for-the-crypto-industry/">highlighted here</a>, these include OKX, dYdX and Paxos.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Metacade CEO upholds ambitious goal ahead of the main platform launch</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Metacade has enjoyed a stellar rise since it started to list on exchanges</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The token is attractive as Metacade embarks on roadmap</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">You might be scared &ndash; is it the right time to invest in cryptocurrencies during this prolonged bear market? It is reasonable to have this fear, but&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=investment_opportunity" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade&nbsp;</u></a>(MCADE) CEO Russell Bennett intentionally launched the ambitious Web 3.0 gaming platform in a bear market. Why? Bennett wanted MCADE to soar once the market turns bullish. Shortly after launching the presale, MCADE quickly sold out as investors saw a robust gaming ecosystem unrivaled by peers. Analysts have lauded the token as a 10x investment. There are potential reasons for it.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Metacade&rsquo;s ambition in Web 3.0 gaming</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">If you are a gaming enthusiast, perhaps you have been looking for a platform with great earning opportunities and where your voice counts. There are hardly any you can find around. This is why Metacade was initiated.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade aspires to become the biggest community-led Web 3.0 gaming arcade. As a result, it has outlined an ambitious roadmap that it seeks to fulfill. The early goals have already been hit, including the successful presale and listings on exchanges. MCADE can be bought on Uniswap, BitMart, and MEXC Global, with more exchanges to follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the greatest reasons Metacade has grown popular is its earning opportunities. Unlike its predecessors, Metacade users can earn by competing in games, creating projects, and working on gig opportunities. Developers have a ready community for their creations and can have their projects funded through MetaGrants. In other words, Metacade aims to become a virtual one-stop shop for gamers, crypto fans, and developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade also seeks to avoid the mistakes of its predecessors &ndash; the lack of sustainability. The platform will harbor a launchpad where others can launch their projects and contribute to the revenue of Metacade. Others can also advertise on the platform and post jobs, making Metacade a self-sustaining gaming platform.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Metacade CEO emphasizes an ambitious strategic goal</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">After the early successes of Metacade, CEO Russell Bennett is focused on delivering on the project&rsquo;s roadmap. The Metacade Lite, whose countdown is barely 3 days, will usher in the main platform that will actualize the dream of building a thriving Web 3.0 community. That begins with the launch of the Creat2Earn platform in the second quarter, Play2Earn in the third, and Work2Earn in the fourth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade&rsquo;s CEO has emphasized the need to create a great community and platform and forge partnerships to bridge the Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 sectors for its users. Metacade Lite, which launches soon, is expected to actualize the ambitious dream.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>MCADE&rsquo;s price movement and what it means to investors</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Just imagine a cryptocurrency launching in a bear market and retaining its value. According to Metacade CEO, the project and cryptocurrency, MCADE, launched in a bear market to keep off the distractions of speculation and hype. It has worked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unlike some tokens launched recently with a lot of surges and crashing thereafter, MCADE has maintained its value. The cryptocurrency trades in a bullish market at $0.024, higher than its final price at presale of $0.020. The current price happens in a market correction since MCADE recently hit a record $0.045. The correction reflects profit-taking activities, with the price steadily rising again as demand soars.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It then means that the price of MCADE could recover to its previous level of $0.045 and surpass it as enthusiasm grows ahead of Metacade Lite launch. As such, the current price could be attractive to investors looking to buy MCADE on the dip.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Investing in MCADE for 10x return &ndash; is it realistic</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">There is no doubt tokens of very innovative platforms like Metacade can increase by 1000% within months of launch. Analysts have projected an even higher return for the token in 2023. A return of 10x is realistic, given that MCADE is already enjoying strong demand on exchanges, which helped the token rise 100% after the presale. It means there is still room for the token to run and could return big to investors.</p>

<li>Atlantic Equities upgraded Coinbase Global to &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; on Tuesday.</li>
<li>Analyst Simon Clinch explained why in a research note to clients.</li>
<li>Coinbase stock is already up more than 80% versus the start of 2023.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/coinbase/">Coinbase Global Inc</a> continues to be the &ldquo;best expression of crypto&rdquo;, says Simon Clinch &ndash; an Atlantic Equities analyst.</p>
<h2>Coinbase stock could gain 20%</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Clinch upgraded the crypto exchange to &ldquo;overweight&rdquo;. His $70 price target suggests a close to 20% upside from here.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s bullish on the Coinbase stock partially because the company has topped expectations in terms of executing <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/coinbase-lays-off-950-staff-cuts-operational-costs-by-25" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost cuts</a>. The analyst agreed that risks including regulation and recession remain on the table but said in his research note:</p>
<blockquote><p>These actions are building resilience in the business model . . . Coinbase&rsquo;s recent actions allow investors to look through toward the longer-term opportunity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Year-to-date, the Nasdaq-listed firm is already up more than 80% at writing.</p>
<h2>Coinbase had a strong first quarter</h2>
<p>Coinbase has recently <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/05/02/coinbase-sets-up-shop-in-bermuda-as-it-battles-sec-at-home/?sh=6d00af177c62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> a Bermuda-based exchange that, at least for now, is limited to non-U.S. institutional users interested in Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures.</p>
<p>Earlier in May, the crypto exchange also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/coinbase-earnings-q1-2023-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> its financial results for the first quarter that handily topped estimates as Coinbase Prime noted record volumes. According to Atlantic Equities&rsquo; Clinch:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase is regaining custody asset share and is also leveraging its trust credentials to exercise pricing power &ndash; both important steps towards building resilience in the model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those interested in buying Coinbase stock today should remember, though, that this crypto firm received a &ldquo;<a href="https://kkc.com/blog/coinbase-gets-a-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wells Notice</a>&rdquo; from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">MCADE is up by more than 13% over the last seven days and is now trading above $0.024.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The rally comes as the crypto market recovers thanks to the debt ceiling agreement over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has underperformed for the best part of May. Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is down by nearly 5% since the start of the month.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the market has had relief this week, with Bitcoin up by more than 3% over the past few days. MCADE, the native coin of the Metacade ecosystem, is also up by more than 6% in the last seven days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The imminent debt relief vote in the United States has seen the sentiment in the market become positive.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">US debt ceiling vote set for tomorrow</h2>
<p dir="ltr">An agreement was reached between President Biden and the House leadership on the United States debt ceiling over the weekend. The House leadership has agreed to suspend the federal government&rsquo;s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the deal was struck between McCarthy and Bide, it still has to pass through Congress later this week. The vote is expected to take place tomorrow, May 31st, before the United States runs out of money to pay its debts on June 1st.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin and others rally following the debt ceiling deal</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market was in a bearish mode earlier this month as investors continued to fear that a deal would not be agreed.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The deal brought optimism to the market as it indicated that the United States would not default on its debt. A US default could result in a recession, and that could see the cryptocurrency market and other financial markets record massive losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin and other&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-up-today-imminent-debt-ceiling-vote-boosts-the-market/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies have performed well</u></a> since the deal was announced over the weekend. Bitcoin touched a low of $25,800 last week but has since renounced and moved past the $28k level on Monday. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $27,710, up by less than 1% over the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MCADE rallies by 13% in the last seven days</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE, the native token of the&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> ecosystem, has performed well over the past few days. The token has added 13% to its value over the last seven days, outperforming the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade is currently trading at $0.0248 per coin and is close to the $0.034 all-time high price it set a month ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE could rally higher in the near term if the fundamentals of the broader cryptocurrency market continue to improve. In addition to being listed on popular exchanges, including Uniswap, MEXC, and BitMart, the Metacade team is preparing to launch the&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade Lite</u></a> in two days.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade Lite is set to offer users the first experience of the app UX. It will offer users a selection of both Web2 and Web3 games. Users will have an idea about the GameFi ecosystem Metacade is building.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Metacade continues to pride itself as a unique GameFi project that seeks to grant its users exciting gaming adventures. With its plan to transition into a DAO in 2024, MCADE could record massive gains as the Metacade project gains adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Metacade a good investment?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE has outperformed the broader cryptocurrency market over the last seven days, adding more than 13% to its value during that period.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this sentiment improving, the crypto market could record more gains, and MCADE could be one of the biggest winners.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MCADE has been performing well since the presale event was concluded, where the development team raised $16 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">For investors,&nbsp;<a href="https://metacade.co/en?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Metacade</u></a> could be an exciting project as the development team continues to work to launch its GameFi platform. The team is also working hard to get MCADE listed on numerous cryptocurrency exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With such plans in place, MCADE could be on track to record gains over the next few months and years. Metacade is still very much in its development phase and could prove to be an excellent investment for early investors.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Nvidia&rsquo;s march to a $1 trillion market cap has been helped by the AI boom.</li>
<li>The company joins Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Saudi Aramco in this exclusive club.</li>
<li>Crypto AI tokens like Render, SingularityNET, Fetch.ai and Akash Network have also surged amid the AI hype.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Nvidia Corp (NVDA) joined an elite club of U.S. companies sporting a $1 trillion market value on Tuesday, as investors piled into the chipmaker that has quickly become one of the biggest winners of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ai/">AI boom</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The growing positive forecasts around AI are also cascading into the ecosystems of leading artificial intelligence-powered cryptocurrencies. Many of these rose on Tuesday.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/akash-network/">Akash Network (AKT)</a>, which provides an open and P2P marketplace for cloud resources, saw the native token rise nearly 20%.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dynex (DNX) , a neuromorphic supercomputer, rose 35%. Meanwhile, top AI tokens that have soared in recent weeks amid the broader market hype including <a href="https://coinjournal.net/render-token/">Render (RNDR)</a>, SingularityNET (AGIX) and Fetch.ai (FET) all gained more than 5%.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Nvidia&rsquo;s march to $1 trillion market cap</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Nvidia, for a long time the leading maker of video game graphics cards, has seen its valuation more than double in the past six months. The company&rsquo;s fortunes in the market have spiked amid the huge demand for generative AI tools takes the world by storm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Now the company is looking to establish itself in the exclusive club of just five, four being US companies, valued at $1 trillion or more. Market analyst Holger Zschaepitz pointed this out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/1663552062209282059" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tweet</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As of May 2023, this club is led by <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, which currently has a market cap of over $2.8 trillion. &nbsp;Microsoft Corp is valued at $2.47 trillion, Alphabet at $1.57 trillion and Amazon at $1.24 trillion. The non-US company in this category is oil giant Saudi Aramco.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tesla, Meta, and PetroChina, a Chinese oil giant, previously hit this milestone.</p>

<li>Air Nippon Airways (ANA), the largest airline in Japan, launched an aeronautical-themed NFTs marketplace.</li>
<li>Air Nippon Airways partnered with its subsidiary ANA Neo to develop the platform.</li>
<li>Air Nippon Airways is currently expanding into Web3.</li>
</ul>
<p>The largest airline in Japan, Air Nippon Airways (ANA), has today launched an aeronautical-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs) marketplace with its subsidiary ANA Neo.</p>
<p>The NFT marketplace is part of the airline&rsquo;s ongoing forays in trying to connect airlines with Web3</p>
<h2>ANA GranWhale NFT Marketplace</h2>
<p>The development of ANA Neo&rsquo;s GranWhale&nbsp;marketplace started in August 2023 as a virtual travel platform that promised to use &ldquo;technology, including VR, to recreate the destinations and cultures of the world&rdquo; in the form of metaverse parks.</p>
<p>The new NFT marketplace is dubbed &ldquo;ANA GranWhale NFT Marketplace&rdquo; and it will feature an inaugural NFT collection created by aerial photographer Luke Ozawa.</p>
<p>The platform&rsquo;s developers when announcing the marketplace said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;From May 30, aerial photographer Luke Ozawa&rsquo;s first digital photo will be converted to NFT. One of them will be sold with a positive film, which is the source of photo development. The price is 100,000 yen, and the NFT with positive film will be sold at auction.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>After the inaugural collection, the second collection will be released on June 7 and will represent the NFT image conversion of the first Boeing 787 operated by ANA. About the second collection, ANA wrote:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Selling as a 3D model airplane. There are 787 items each of the two types, for a total of 1,574 items, and the price is 7,870 yen.&rdquo;</em></p>

<li dir="ltr">Tether will invest in the project through a partnership with a local licensed company.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Uruguay generates 94% of electricity from renewable energy sources</li>
<li dir="ltr">Tether recently said it would invest profits into buying Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/tether/"><u>Tether</u></a>, the issuer of leading stablecoin USDT, has revealed an investment into renewable energy production to support sustainable Bitcoin (BTC) mining in Uruguay.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is the latest&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/tether/"><u>Tether news</u></a>, in which the USDT issuer said it was looking to add to its team for this project by hiring experts from within the energy sector, according to details in the&nbsp;<a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-invests-in-energy-production-and-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-in-uruguay/"><u>announcement</u></a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Eyeing sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining</h2>
<p dir="ltr">As announced on Tuesday, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-mining/"><u>Bitcoin mining</u></a> initiative will see Tether collaborate with a locally licensed company and involve putting money into resources aimed at increasing the use of green energy to mine BTC.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay&rsquo;s renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining</em>,&rdquo; said Paolo Ardoino, the Tether CTO.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Uruguay ranks among the world&rsquo;s leading renewable energy producers, with about 94% of its electricity generated from renewable sources. This is mainly from wind and solar power and Tether notes it is the ideal location for the establishment of solar parks, wind farms and hydro-power projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A reliable supply of clean, renewable energy will be critical to ensuring BTC mining has the least possible ecological footprint, Ardoino added.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>Our unwavering commitment to renewable energy ensures that every Bitcoin we mine leaves a minimal ecological footprint while upholding the security and integrity of the Bitcoin network. Tether is proud to spearhead a movement that combines cutting-edge technology, sustainable practices, and financial innovation</em>,&rdquo; he stated.</p>
<p>Tether&rsquo;s latest BTC related investment comes just days after the company&nbsp;<a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-to-further-strengthen-reserves-through-purchase-of-bitcoin-with-realized-net-operating-profits"><u>announced</u></a> that it would plough back 15% of net profits into buying Bitcoin. The move is part of the USDT issuer&rsquo;s strategy of further strengthening its reserves, a key part of the company&rsquo;s business.</p>

<li dir="ltr">bitFlyer announced the Travel Rule restrictions will apply to TRUST-compatible exchanges across 21 countries.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The exchange will also only allow transactions for TRUST-compatible cryptocurrencies, which include Bitcoin, Ethereum and some ERC-20 tokens.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Crypto transfers in Japan can only be made to and from Coincheck, the country&rsquo;s other TRUST-compatible exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Japan-based cryptocurrency exchange bitFlyer has<a href="https://bitflyer.com/pub/20230530-announcement-TravelRule2-en.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>announced</u></a> restrictions to deposits and transfers as it seeks to implement new anti-money laundering (AML) measures put in place under the Financial Action Task Force&rsquo;s (FATF) &ldquo;Travel Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitflyer-review-2020/">bitFlyer</a> said in the notice to its users on Tuesday that the new measures are meant to ensure the exchange complies with the Travel Rule requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Among these requirements is that <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a> have to share information about their customers&rsquo; details whenever transactions are initiated to or from their platforms.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Restricted are transactions to or from platforms that do not comply with the Travel Rule. The restrictions on crypto deposits and transfers went into effect on Tuesday, 30 May 2023, the exchange noted.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Restrictions to TRUST-compatible platforms</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Travel Rule Universal Solution Technology (TRUST) is a system that allows crypto platforms to work together in complying with the Travel Rule. The solution was spearheaded by Coinbase, a leading US-based cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As noted above, the Travel Rule requires that crypto exchanges share certain details of users sending crypto via their platform with the exchange receiving the transfer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">To ensure compliance, bitFlyer has therefore moved to restrict transactions to TRUST-compliant platforms across 21 countries, including <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/japan/">Japan</a>, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, Israel, Hong Kong, Germany and Switzerland.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The exchange also revealed crypto transfers are now restricted to TRUST-compatible cryptocurrencies, which include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and multiple ERC-20 tokens like Polygon (MATIC), Chainlink (LINK), Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Maker (MKR).</p>
<p dir="ltr">In Japan, bitFlyer will only support transactions to Coincheck. Currently, only BTC is the TRUST-compatible asset accepted until Coincheck completes its system development to support ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<p dir="ltr">bitFlyer&rsquo;s decision follows Japan&rsquo;s recent move to implement FATF&rsquo;s tough anti-money laundering checks as defined in the travel rule. It also comes a few days after FATF urged G7 nations to work together in the battle against money laundering in the digital assets space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-begins-transition-to-new-platform-for-japan/">reported</a> earlier this week, Binance has began the process of transitioning all its users in Japan to a new regulated plaform dubbed Binance Japan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals has raised more than $840k in its presale.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The ASI token is going for $0.015 during the presale and could rally higher once it lists on exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been performing well since the start of the week. The prices of most coins and tokens are trading in the green zone. Indicating that the market sentiments have improved.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The rally comes thanks to the debt ceiling agreement in the United States. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies performing well so far, it would be intriguing to look at the price prospects of tokens in presale like AltSignals.</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals recently crossed a new threshold in its funding effort. The development team has raised more than $800,000 so far and could achieve its objective soon. With that possibility in mind, investors would be watching the project and see how its price would perform in the near term.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals token set to hit the desired milestone soon</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rave this year. Following the launch of ChatGPT and other AI products, more companies are leveraging AI to optimise their activities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market is not left behind. AltSignals is one of the projects that is set to allow traders to leverage AI to boost their trading activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is developing a suite of AI products designed for cryptocurrency traders. To achieve its goal, the development team has set a $1 million presale target. So far,&nbsp;<a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>AltSignals</u></a> has raised $847,035 in its presale and is close to hitting its target. This means that it has raised 78% of its required funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASI, the native token of the AltSignals ecosystem, is trading at $0.015 per token, making it very affordable to most investors. The token could probably experience a surge in price once the presale is over and it lists on decentralised and centralised crypto exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is an exciting project that could prove to be beneficial to cryptocurrency traders. Its impact could surpass the crypto space and affect forex, stock, commodities, and indices traders.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals is a trading platform that provides trading signals for cryptocurrencies, forex, indices, stocks, and commodities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The team will use the funds it raised to develop ActualizeAI, a solution that could make it easier for people to trade cryptocurrencies and a few other asset classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to its whitepaper, ActualizeAI will be fully automated and work 24/7, just like the cryptocurrency market. The solution could make it easier for traders to pinpoint e entry points in the market, execute more accurate trades, and take advantage of proper risk management strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Holders of the ASI token would be granted access to the numerous services offered by AltSignals. The AI integrated within AltSignals&rsquo; will take advantage of other technologies like natural language processing, machine learning, regression, and predictive modeling to improve its services.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">AltSignals will also include other exciting features like an AI members club, trading tournaments, community governance, and more. Following the end of the presale, ASI is expected to launch on exchanges like Uniswap.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The development team will also work on expanding the team, securing OTC partnerships, and introducing the sentiment analysis engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>Visit the official AltSignals website</u></a> to learn more about their presale.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">AltSignals (ASI) price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr">ASI is still in its presale stage, which means it is hard to accurately predict its price movement. At the moment, ASI is going for $0.015 in its presale.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, based on history, ASI&rsquo;s price could experience a price pump once the presale concludes.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the major factors behind a surge in the price of cryptocurrencies is when they list on crypto exchanges. ASI would be listed on Uniswap and a host of other crypto exchanges once the pre-sale is over. This could see ASI&rsquo;s price record a massive surge.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Another reason to predict a surge in ASI&rsquo;s price is the fundamentals of the broader crypto market. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin and other leading cryptocurrencies have rallied by at least 50%.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto market is still down by more than 50% from the all-time high recorded in 2021. This implies that there is still room for recovery. ASI launching during this period could see it record massive gains as the broader crypto industry continues to recover from the bear market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A third reason could be the utility of AltSignals. Cryptocurrency trading is a multi-billion dollar industry. There are thousands of traders in the cryptocurrency space, and a tool like AltSignals could gain wide adoption amongst the traders.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If AltSignals gains wide adoption, ASI could see its price explode in value over the next few months and years.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is now a good time to buy AltSignals?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://token.altsignals.io/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=invezz&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news"><u>AltSignals</u></a> is in its presale stage, and this could be an excellent time to invest in the project. If the team delivers on its promises, AltSignals could become a major project in the cryptocurrency trading space.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">ASI could become a big winner in the crypto space if the broader cryptocurrency market continues its recovery and rally to a new all-time high.&nbsp;</p>
