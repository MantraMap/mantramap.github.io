<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Crypto advocacy groups, CoinCenter and the Blockchain Association, criticize the US Senate&#8217;s &#8220;Crypto Assets National Security Enhancement Act of 2023.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>The bill proposes strict regulations on individuals involved in decentralized finance (DeFi), making platform operators and stakeholders responsible for illegal uses of their platforms.</em></li>



<li><em>Critics argue that the bill extends sanctions and Bank Secrecy Act obligations to individual developers, potentially leading to overreach and restricting free speech.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Two prominent crypto policy advocacy groups, CoinCenter, and the Blockchain Association, have expressed strong criticism of the &#8220;Crypto Assets National Security Enhancement Act of 2023&#8221; introduced in the US Senate. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-1024x576.png" alt="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill" class="wp-image-204594" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1433.png 1616w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://coincu.com/204102-us-senate-proposes-new-bill-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bill</a>, titled the Crypto-Asset National Security Enhancement and Enforcement Act (CANSEE), aims to impose strict regulations on individuals involved in decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<p>If passed into law, the CANSEE Act would hold DeFi platform operators and major stakeholders accountable for any illegal use of their platforms. However, CoinCenter and the Blockchain Association believe that the bill carries significant flaws and overreaches that could have negative consequences for the crypto community.</p>



<p>In a joint statement, CoinCenter and its executive director, Jerry Brito, <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/the-cansee-act-is-a-messy-arbitrary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">condemned</a> the proposal as messy, arbitrary, and unconstitutional. One major concern raised by CoinCenter is that the bill would extend sanctions and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations to individual developers, giving the Secretary of the Treasury full power to decide who controls specific protocols. The proposed exemption does not adequately address this issue.</p>



<p>The groups also expressed apprehension over potential overreach, as the bill could result in enforcement actions against those who publish books containing code. This, <a href="https://coincu.com/133214-coin-center-sues-us-treasury/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinCenter</a> argues, could limit free speech and stifle innovation within the crypto space.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill" class="wp-image-204596" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-750x563.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/U.S.-Senate-Capitol-building-Lynne-Terry-OCC-scaled-1-1140x855.jpg 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>While acknowledging the government&#8217;s intention to combat money laundering, CoinCenter believes that the bill takes a &#8220;blanket ban&#8221; approach and lacks the necessary nuance to protect individual rights. They urge the authorities to consider a more balanced and targeted approach to achieve their objectives.</p>



<p>The Blockchain Association also <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainAssn/status/1681689788225650689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a response to the CANSEE Act, highlighting that illegal transactions accounted for a mere 0.24% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2022. According to the advocacy group and its CEO, Kristin Smith, current regulations already provide sufficient powers to enforce the law effectively. They deem the bill &#8220;unworkable&#8221; and simply incompatible with digital asset technology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="750" height="500" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434.png" alt="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill" class="wp-image-204595" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1434-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" title="CoinCenter Strongly Criticizes With US Senate&#039;s New DeFi Regulation Bill 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Both CoinCenter and the <a href="https://coincu.com/143673-blockchain-in-secs-against-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain Association</a> expressed support for alternative efforts to prevent illicit activities, such as amendments to the National Defense Act that specifically target cryptocurrencies. The groups assert that these targeted measures would better address concerns without compromising individual freedoms and the growth of the crypto industry.</p>



<p>The CANSEE Act was introduced in a bipartisan manner on July 19 by members of the US Senate Banking Committee, including Democratic senators Jack Reed and Mark Warner, along with Republican senators Mike Rounds and Mitt Romney. The bill is now under review in the US Senate, where further discussions and potential amendments are expected. If enacted, it could have far-reaching implications for the DeFi space and crypto stakeholders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Former Alameda Research Co-CEO Caroline Ellison admits fraud and estimates a cash deficit of over $10 billion at FTX.com before its collapse.</em></li>



<li><em>Court documents reveal that FTX.com owed customers more than $8 billion in fiat currency, which it couldn&#8217;t repay.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX sues founder Sam Bankman-Fried and former executives to recover more than $1 billion allegedly misappropriated before the exchange&#8217;s bankruptcy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a shocking revelation, court documents <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for FTX, the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange once an empire with sister company Alameda Research, have unveiled a staggering cash deficit of over $10 billion about eight months before the platform&#8217;s collapse, according to <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-20/alameda-co-ceo-saw-over-10-billion-ftx-cash-gap-in-march-2022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a></em>. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-1024x683.png" alt="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit" class="wp-image-204586" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-1024x683.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429-750x500.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1429.png 1098w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to the documents, Caroline Ellison, the former co-CEO of Alameda Research, made this eye-popping estimate in March 2022 through private notes. This disclosure adds another layer of complexity to the already tumultuous situation surrounding FTX.</p>



<p>Moreover, the court filing further alleges that FTX executives, along with Ellison, privately estimated in August of the preceding year that the exchange owed customers more than $8 billion in fiat currency, which it was unable to repay. The scale of these figures indicates a grave financial crisis brewing within FTX, raising questions about the management&#8217;s decisions and the overall financial health of the exchange.</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, has been at the center of the controversy. FTX&#8217;s downfall last November sent shockwaves throughout the crypto sector and triggered calls for stricter regulatory oversight of digital assets from authorities in the United States and beyond. US authorities have accused FTX of using customer funds for trading activities at the affiliated hedge fund Alameda and for personal expenses. The situation has escalated into one of the highest-profile bankruptcies ever witnessed in the US crypto landscape.</p>

<p>The gravity of the situation has led <a href="https://coincu.com/204325-ftx-recover-71m-charity-life-science/">FTX</a>, under the guidance of a new executive team led by restructuring expert <a href="https://coincu.com/151386-john-ray-refutes-contention-re-ftx-solvency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Ray</a>, to take legal action against its own founder and three other former executives. The lawsuit <a href="https://coincu.com/204533-ftx-sues-sbf-and-former-executives-recover-1b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aims</a> to claw back more than $1 billion that the company claims was misappropriated in the months leading up to the exchange&#8217;s collapse. The allegations encompass a wide range of transactions, including share awards, real estate purchases, and cash transfers.</p>



<p>One notable incident detailed in the lawsuit involves Caroline Ellison, who was previously responsible for FTX&#8217;s trading arm, Alameda Research. It is alleged that Ellison paid herself a substantial bonus of $22.5 million, part of which was later transferred to a personal bank account and eventually invested in a company specializing in artificial intelligence research. The lawsuit also implicates Zixiao &#8220;Gary&#8221; Wang, a co-founder of FTX, and Nishad Singh, a former employee of both FTX and Alameda, as beneficiaries of illicit transfers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="862" height="485" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431.png" alt="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit" class="wp-image-204588" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431.png 862w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1431-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" title="Former Alameda Co-CEO Admits Fraud, Estimates $10 Billion Cash Deficit 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The legal proceedings have taken a dramatic turn as Ellison, Wang, and Nishad Singh have all pleaded guilty to various charges, including fraud, in separate criminal cases unrelated to the recent lawsuit. However, Sam Bankman-Fried has entered a plea of not guilty to US criminal charges, which include fraud, money laundering, and campaign finance violations.</p>



<p>As the bankruptcy proceedings continue to unfold, the fate of FTX remains uncertain. The exchange&#8217;s executives are diligently working to recover funds and repay creditors, all while trying to restore confidence in the crypto sector. The outcome of the legal battle and the efforts to unwind the alleged misappropriated assets will likely have far-reaching implications for the cryptocurrency industry, influencing regulatory measures and investor trust in the market.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Recent NYDIG research speculates that momentum from Bitcoin Spot ETFs could bring in $30 billion in new demand for the digital asset.</em></li>



<li><em>Currently has $28.8 billion in bitcoin assets under management with $27.6 billion in spot-like products.</em></li>



<li><em>The US SEC has accepted six spot bitcoin ETF proposals for consideration.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a recent research <a href="https://viewemail.nydig.com/estimating-the-size-of-spot-etf?ecid=ACsprvtc_0cO7kdkM7J6U0cnRWG73-wGxdDEOaNEGQv4RGLXD4cd0RmQC1ejvDhujo1CX3XoZykT&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=266380078&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_TDHBegA66jxJDo8pBMdolD_XE5W-iPqYVyv87jKPVBQlVbzFwn1srAYKZW2EHJTFpRpIujEN-SLP52npxzZ_pjg1oug&amp;utm_content=266380078&amp;utm_source=hs_email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by crypto exchange NYDIG, the Bitcoin Spot ETFs registration craze could generate $30 billion in new demand for the crypto market.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423.png" alt="Trending Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could Drive $30 Billion In New Demand: Report" class="wp-image-204574" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1423-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Trending Bitcoin Spot ETFs Could Drive $30 Billion In New Demand: Report 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Currently, NYDIG has modeled that there are $28.8 billion in bitcoin assets under management with $27.6 billion in spot-like products.</p>



<p>Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold, so it will inevitably be compared to the gold ETFs listed in the early 2000s. Currently, gold ETFs hold only 1.6% of the total global gold supply, the NYDIG pointed out, compared with 17.1% of central banks, while bitcoin funds hold 4.9% of the total bitcoin supply.</p>



<p>There is a huge demand gap for digital and analog versions of assets in funds. There is over $210 billion invested in gold funds, while only $28.8 billion is in bitcoin funds due to the asset&#8217;s high volatility.</p>

<p>The NYDIG&#8217;s conclusion that the real potential of a Bitcoin ETF lies in a convergence of factors: the launch of an ETF, a weaker US dollar, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s shift to quantitative easing, and a generational transfer of assets to younger individuals who are more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>In a twist on July 19, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://coincu.com/204120-sec-adds-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-federal-register/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accepted</a> applications to create a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund from six companies, including BlackRock (BLK.N), for consideration, the first step in the agency&#8217;s process to decide whether or not to approve the latest round of proposals.</p>



<p>The SEC also officially recognized applications from Bitwise, VanEck, WisdomTree (WT.N), Fidelity, and Invesco (IVZ.N) for a similar spot bitcoin ETF, with those proposals appearing on the Federal Register on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>



<p>It has been more than 10 years since the first application statement was filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, and investors are once again excited about the prospect that one of the existing applications will be approved.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave community conducts a vote for introducing a Stability Module (PSM) for the GHO stablecoin.</em></li>



<li><em>The proposed module aims to maintain GHO&#8217;s peg with innovative features and price strategies.</em></li>



<li><em>It includes Debt Ceiling control, Capital Allocator, and risk management mechanisms.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Aave community has <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth/proposal/0x98bdd30f645b2981320f82c671ae9fee31ee771766c13cd2627b66a22f0d438e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken</a> a significant step towards enhancing the stability of the GHO token by proposing the introduction of a Peg Stability Module (PSM) for GHO. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424-1024x573.png" alt="Aave Community Proposes Innovative Stability Module For GHO Token" class="wp-image-204575" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424-1024x573.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424-300x168.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424-768x430.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424-750x420.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424-1140x638.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1424.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Community Proposes Innovative Stability Module For GHO 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>Through a governance vote, community members are actively participating in a temperature check to gauge approval for the proposed stability module. The voting, which commenced on the Snapshot voting page, is set to conclude on July 23. This innovative mechanism, known as a Peg Stability Module, has proven effective in other stablecoin projects like MakerDAO, enabling the seamless conversion of two tokens at a predetermined ratio.</p>



<p>The proposed GHO Stability Module (GSM) draws inspiration from the successful PSM models while introducing unique features that cater to GHO&#8217;s specific requirements. One of the key features of the GSM is the introduction of &#8220;Price Strategies.&#8221; These strategies offer flexibility in adjusting the pricing ratio between GHO and governance-accepted stablecoins. The Price Strategies can be either fixed or dynamic, based on market conditions, price oracles, linear curves, or stableswap curves. For its initial launch, the proposal recommends implementing a Fixed Pricing Strategy, allowing for smooth integration.</p>



<p>To exercise control over exposure to specific assets backing <a href="https://coincu.com/201480-aave-dao-to-launch-gho-on-through-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GHO</a>, the proposed GSM includes a &#8220;Debt Ceiling&#8221; feature. This feature empowers the DAO to set a maximum limit on the exposure to exogenous assets. If a user attempts to mint GHO and the amount of exogenous assets exceeds the defined Debt Ceiling, the transaction will be automatically reverted, ensuring risk management and stability.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1024x576.png" alt="Aave Community Proposes Innovative Stability Module For GHO Token" class="wp-image-204578" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1536x864.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1427.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Community Proposes Innovative Stability Module For GHO 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>Additionally, the GSM incorporates a &#8220;Capital Allocator,&#8221; providing a method for a designated &#8220;fund manager&#8221; to allocate and earn yield from a pre-defined portion of exogenous assets within the GSM. The configurable threshold for capital allocation will be decided through a separate governance process, ensuring transparency and effective asset management.</p>



<p>In the face of rapid increases in exogenous asset risk, the GSM is equipped with &#8220;Last Resort Liquidations&#8221; to mitigate potential threats. This mechanism allows the liquidation of the exogenous asset in extreme scenarios, offering an effective safeguard in times of crisis.</p>



<p>Moreover, the GSM features &#8220;Price Bounds and Swap Freezes&#8221; to address any price deviations of the exogenous asset from the 1:1 ratio. These safeguards allow for temporary halting of trading when significant deviations occur, thereby preventing adverse fluctuations in the system.</p>



<p>The temperature check vote will serve as a significant milestone, setting the stage for community discussions and governance processes. If the proposal receives community approval, the next steps include engaging community auditors to review the GSM codebase. Following the audit, the codebase will be shared with the community alongside an Aave Request for Comment (ARFC) based on the Facilitator Onboarding Process Framework.</p>

<p>During the subsequent governance stage, the community will have the opportunity to decide on various GSM configurations, such as initial Debt Ceilings, Exogenous Assets, Pricing Strategy, Distribution for Capital Allocation, and Price Bounds for Swap Freezes.</p>



<p>The Aave community is confident that GHO Stability Module will play a pivotal role in maintaining GHO&#8217;s stability and bolstering confidence in the platform&#8217;s peg stability mechanism. As <a href="https://coincu.com/203057-aave-wants-to-launch-v3-on-linea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave</a> continues to foster active community engagement and governance, it reinforces its position as a leading DeFi ecosystem, driving innovation and resilience in the decentralized finance space.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/203080-aave-unleashes-gho/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, Aave announced that GHO has successfully launched on the Ethereum mainnet. This is a huge step forward for the Aave protocol and its community since GHO aspires to be a decentralized stablecoin that empowers users and encourages a people-powered financial ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The OpenSea NFT Marketplace has announced the launch of the &#8220;Deals&#8221; peer-to-peer NFT trading function.</em></li>



<li><em>The new feature allows collectors to trade NFTs directly with each other as well as adding WETH to simplify the transaction process further.</em></li>



<li><em>To initiate the swap, users need to connect their wallet and search for the person they want to trade NFT using their username, address, or ESN.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to official news, NFT marketplace <a href="https://coincu.com/203742-etherfis-ether-fan-nft-collection-opensea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea </a>has launched a &#8220;Deals&#8221; peer-to-peer NFT trading function, which can help traders interact directly with other collectors.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="567" height="337" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png" alt="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot;" class="wp-image-204560" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421.png 567w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1421-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" title="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot; 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>OpenSea said in a tweet that Deals will allow collectors to trade NFTs with each other &#8211; as well as include coated ether (WETH). It added that OpenSea&#8217;s native NFT protocol Seaport powers the feature to ensure smooth transactions and save gas.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Deals: offer your NFTs for theirs, securely on OpenSea.<br><br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f449.png" alt="👉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK" target="_blank">https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK</a> <a href="https://t.co/KR2MLbi7jh" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/KR2MLbi7jh</a></p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1682077991029932032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 20, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>With the Deals function, collectors can now connect with each other easily. To initiate the swap, users need to connect their wallet and search for the person they want to trade NFT using their username, address, or ESN. Once defined, users can select an NFT from their collection that they wish to trade and select an NFT of their choice from the other.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deals website</a>, users can enter the username, ENS name, or wallet address of the person they want to make a transaction with. They can then choose up to 30 NFTs, as well as the amount of WETH they want to add to the swap, if any.</p>



<p>Next, they choose the asset they want to offer for trading, and then they can submit the transaction for review. Currently, OpenSea requires that NFTs on both sides of the deal be on the same chain and from badged (verified) collections.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="722" height="343" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png" alt="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot;" class="wp-image-204561" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422.png 722w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1422-300x143.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" title="OpenSea Enables New Peer-to-Peer NFT Trading Function &quot;Deals&quot; 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The swap proposal could also include WETH token incentives, adding more flexibility to the process. The other party can then review and accept the agreement directly through this NFT platform.</p>



<p>An OpenSea spokesperson said Deals aims to invite more users to join the NFT community by simplifying the transaction process. This move signifies the NFT platform&#8217;s commitment to providing a superior experience for NFT enthusiasts and staying ahead in the competitive market.</p>

<p>Earlier this morning, it was reported that the Twitter account of Uniswap founder Hayden Adams with more than 254,000 followers, had been hacked and that many of the tweets sent by this account contained links to phishing websites.&#8217;</p>



<p>Then a suspicious tweet sent from Adams&#8217; account urged UniswapX users to check if they were eligible for the donated $UNI token by visiting a website hosted in Russia. That site was registered on the day of the hack, one Twitter user noted.</p>



<p>Members of Crypto Twitter were quick to identify and warn others of a promoted scam. Therefore, during the hacking process, no damage was recorded from the user.</p>



<p>Upon receiving the information, <a href="https://coincu.com/194785-uniswap-labs-revealing-new-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uniswap Labs</a> issued a warning about the account being hijacked and warned users of fraudulent links related to the airdrop and rewards.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://coincu.com/130981-house-republicans-requested-doj-of-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US House Republicans </a>members have introduced a new digital asset regulation bill.</em></li>



<li><em>The bill aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto space and outlines the authority of the SEC and CFTC over crypto.</em></li>



<li><em>The amendment bill that excludes a range of traditional securities from the &#8220;digital asset&#8221; category could signal tightening for Defi.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Thursday, US House Republicans members<a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/fit_for_the_21st_century_act_of_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> introduced </a>a new digital asset regulation bill, the 21st Century Financial Innovation and Technology Act, which aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto industry.</strong></h5>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Today&#8217;s introduction of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act marks a significant milestone in the House Committees on Agriculture and Financial Services&#8217; efforts to establish a much-needed regulatory framework that protects consumers and investors and fosters American leadership in the digital asset space,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture Rep. Glenn &#8220;GT&#8221; Thompson (R-Pa.) said in <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a statement</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The current need for clarity on digital asset management and enforcement actions is causing crypto businesses to consider leaving the United States and preventing startups from establishing in the country.</p>



<p>Thursday&#8217;s bill, drafted initially in early June, seeks to pave the way for cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and allow them to trade digital securities, commodities, and stablecoins.</p>



<p>The bill introduced in recent years aims to create comprehensive rules for digital assets, coming at a time when both regulators and participants in the crypto market have noticed a need for regulatory clarity.</p>



<p>A wave of aggressive enforcement actions by regulators, especially the SEC and CFTC, is prompting established crypto businesses to consider leaving the US and preventing startups from forming there. In addition, the bill will clarify the powers of the SEC and CFTC in regulating crypto companies.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The crypto industry wants clarity and our collaborative bill gives both the CFTC and SEC a seat at the table. Our bill establishes clear principles to ensure financial security and certainty as digital asset developers continue to innovate,&#8221;</p>
<cite>Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.) said in the statement.</cite></blockquote>



<p>The revised bill removes a range of traditional securities from the definition of &#8220;digital assets,&#8221; such as stocks, bonds, &#8220;transferable shares,&#8221; &#8220;interest certificates, or entering into any profit-sharing arrangement,&#8221; among others.</p>



<p>This is seen as a signal to watch out for in the Defi sector by Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel of Delphi Labs, noting that a range of assets found in the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, such as Compound&#8217;s cToken or Liquid Collective&#8217;s Liquidity Staking Token, will be strictly regulated under this provision even if they are not under applicable law.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX Trading Ltd sued the SBF founder and other former executives on Thursday to recover $1 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>The defendants include Caroline Ellison, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh.</em></li>



<li><em>The defendants embezzled money to buy luxury apartments, political donations, and speculative investments and carried out one of the largest financial frauds in history.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-sues-bankman-fried-others-recoup-fraudulent-transfers-2023-07-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>, FTX Trading Ltd sued the SBF founder and other former executives on Thursday, seeking to<a href="https://coincu.com/204325-ftx-recover-71m-charity-life-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> recover</a> more than $1 billion they allegedly embezzled before FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1416.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1416.png" alt="FTX Sues SBF And Former Executives To Recover $1 Billion They Embezzled" class="wp-image-204538" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1416.png 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1416-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="FTX Sues SBF And Former Executives To Recover $1 Billion They Embezzled 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Defendants in the lawsuit filed in Delaware bankruptcy court include former CEO of hedge fund Alameda Research Caroline Ellison, former FTX chief technical officer Gary Wang, and former FTX chief technical officer Nishad Singh. These are all key names and were an effective arm of SBF before the second-largest cryptocurrency empire collapsed.</p>



<p>This exchange said the defendants continued to embezzle funds to purchase luxury apartments, political donations, and speculative investments and conduct &#8220;one of the largest financial frauds in history.&#8221;, </p>



<p>FTX said the fraudulent transfers occurred between February 2020 and November 2022, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>



<p>These transfers may be reversed or &#8220;avoided&#8221; under US bankruptcy or Delaware law. US prosecutors say SBF was the mastermind behind a scam that led to the downfall of FTX, which included the embezzlement of billions of dollars in customer funds.</p>

<p>According to Thursday&#8217;s complaint, the fraudulent transactions included more than $725 million in equity that FTX and West Realm Shires, an entity controlled by Bankman-Fried, awarded &#8220;without receiving any value in exchange.&#8221;</p>



<p>The suit also states that Bankman-Fried and Wang also embezzled $546 million to buy shares of Robinhood Markets (HOOD.O), while Ellison used $28.8 million to pay his bonuses. In addition, some of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s criminal defenses are being funded by a $10 million &#8220;gift&#8221; he gave his father.</p>



<p>Previously, three close associates of Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, co-founder, and former CEO of FTX, along with FTX&#8217;s chief technical officer Nishad Singh pleaded guilty to fraud.</p>



<p>However, the SBF, who is believed to be primarily responsible for 12 criminal counts, has so far pleaded not guilty to several criminal charges brought by US prosecutors. He is still out on $250 million bail, the most oversized bail ever for an individual.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase announced it will shut down its Coinbase Borrow product in the next few months.</em></li>



<li><em>The platform says users need to repay all their loans by November 20.</em></li>



<li><em>The service outage is explained simply by a drop in demand.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/20/coinbase-to-wind-down-coinbase-borrow-lending-program-over-coming-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> CoinDesk</a>, a Coinbase spokesperson said that Coinbase will gradually shut down its Coinbase Borrow lending operation over the next few months in order to focus resources on the products that customers are most interested in.</strong></h5>

<p>“We have notified prioritizing loan holders and are taking extra measures to ensure a smooth transition for them, including providing a four-month loan repayment period and access to customer support through Coinbase One,” According to a statement sent to CoinDesk. Coinbase One is a monthly subscription product with multiple benefits for traders.</p>



<p>Coinbase Borrow customers with outstanding balances have until November 20, 2023, to repay their loans. Coinbase Borrow is a product that allows customers to borrow loans equivalent to 30% of their Bitcoin holdings, with a cap of $1 million.</p>



<p>Coinbase introduced the Borrow program in August 2020 and launched it to the masses in November 2021. The program enables users in several US states to borrow up to $1 million using their Bitcoin as collateral with an APR of 8.7%. The product helps customers avoid selling Bitcoin when they need cash for an emergency.</p>



<p>As previously reported, Coinbase <a href="https://coincu.com/185147-coinbase-to-stop-new-loans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in May that it would no longer allow Coinbase Borrow customers to apply for new loans as part of its regular product re-evaluation process.</p>



<p>A Coinbase spokesperson said at the time that the closure of Coinbase Borrow was simply due to a drop in demand.</p>

<p>The decision to close the Borrow program comes amid an escalating legal dispute between Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The legal battle between the two sides broke out in early June after the SEC filed a lawsuit accusing Coinbase of violating US securities regulations regarding the trading and staking activities of the following cryptocurrencies, which were all declared securities by the SEC: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGEXODASH, and NEAR.</p>



<p>In November 2021, Coinbase had to shelve a lending product called Lend after a similar warning from the SEC. This product offers a crypto savings account with 4% APY higher returns than most traditional banks.</p>

<p>The grant is part of Binance Labs&#8217; commitment to supporting innovative projects that have the potential to lead the next era of DeFi and put users at the heart of Binance Labs. This lending platform aims to solve DeFi&#8217;s fragmented liquidity problem by acting as a money market where users can deposit and borrow assets across various chains.</p>



<p>With the capital poured in, the project will accelerate product development, expand oracle support and collateral options, deploy on the Ethereum mainnet, and support seamless communication with LayerZero.</p>



<p>According to DeFi Llama data, Radiant currently has about $265 million in TVL. The platform supports more than 20 collateral options and plans to add new opportunities in the future as Radiant DAO expands functionality to additional chains.</p>



<p>Radiant Capital is a lending platform developed on Arbitrum to become the first omnichain money market. The project is built on LayerZero&#8217;s cross-chain interoperability and sending infrastructure, which raised $120 million in April at an estimated $3 billion.</p>
