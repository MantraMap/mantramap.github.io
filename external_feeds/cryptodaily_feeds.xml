			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to reports by the news agency Reuters, United States prosecutors are considering filing criminal charges against cryptocurrency exchange Binance and executives of the company, including founder and CEO Changpeng &ldquo;CZ&rdquo; Zhao. Reuters cites four persons familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Prosecutors in the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office in Seattle launched an investigation into Binance in 2018 after instances were recorded that saw criminals use Binance to transfer illicit funds. According to Reuters, Binance has been under investigation for possible money laundering and criminal sanctions violations. Splits between prosecutors from the Department of Justice have however been delaying the conclusion of this long-running investigation into the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Some of the half dozen federal prosecutors involved in the case believe that the evidence gathers thus far justifies moving forward and bringing action against Binance and some of its executives. Others in the department however are arguing to take more time to sufficiently review the evidence.</p>
<p>The Justice Department&rsquo;s investigation involves three offices: the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS), the U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle, and finally the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. According to the sources, Justice Department regulations stipulate that money laundering charges against a financial institution must be approved by the MLARS chief. Further, leaders from the two other offices, as well as higher-level DOJ officials, would also have to sign off on any action leveled against Binance.</p>
Prosecution Would Be Problematic for Crypto Industry
<p>The crypto industry finds itself in a very precarious position now. The sector has been plagued by negative news ever since the collapse of Binance&rsquo;s rival exchange FTX in November. Should the investigation into Binance and Zhao continue and eventually lead to formal charges, it could loosen Binance&rsquo;s grip on the industry which has strengthened tremendously since the demise of FTX. Defense attorneys for Binance at U.S. law firm Gibson Dunn have attended several meetings with Justice Department officials over the past couple of months according to people familiar with the matter. Binance has posited a couple of arguments which include the facts that a criminal prosecution would have a disastrous effect on the market which already finds itself in a prolonged downturn. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigation has focused on unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. Although no final charging decisions have been made, prosecutors view Zhao and several executives to be the subject of these investigations. Should the investigation prove to be fruitful for the DOJ, the department may bring indictments against Binance and its executives, negotiate a settlement, or may close the case without taking any action against them at all. &nbsp;</p>
Binance Denies Claims Made by DOJ
<p>Binance issued a statement in which it refuted the claims made in the Reuters article. Binance&rsquo;s global head of intelligence and investigations, Tigran Gambaryan, said that the exchange has &ldquo;responded to over 47,000 law enforcement requests&rdquo; since November 2021.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Binance said:</p>

<p>As has been reported widely, regulators are doing a sweeping review of every crypto company against many of the same issues. This nascent industry has grown quickly and Binance has shown its commitment to security and compliance through large investments in our team as well as the tools and technology we use to detect and deter illicit activity.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon is showing bullish signals after crypto whale moved $12 million.</p>
<p>Last week, crypto tracking platform Whale Alert reported a massive $12 million Polygon (MATIC) transaction. The whale moved the funds from cold storage to a wallet managed by Coinbase.</p>
<p>This is likely in preparation for some larger transactions. The news comes after Polygon rose 10% the week prior. Polygon has been showing bullish signs recently, and could surge in the following weeks.</p>
<p>At the same time, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has seen its price increase again. ORBN is up 655% since its presale, and is projected to rise even more in the following weeks.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">What is Polygon (MATIC)</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) started out as a way to enable faster, cheaper, and more decentralized transactions for Ethereum.</p>
<p>The Layer 2 scaling solution allows large-scale DApps to be more efficient and affordable. It uses a highly optimized form of proof of stake consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>By focusing on scalability, Polygon enables developers to build high-throughput applications. These include DeFi, NFTs, non-fungible tokens and games.</p>
<p>As an upgrade to Ethereum's ecosystem, Polygon is taking some load away from the largest DeFi network. It also benefits from Ethereum's huge development infrastructure and vibrant community.</p>
<p>This helps boost MATIC, Polygon's native currency. MATIC has the function of validating transactions and settling fees on the network.</p>
<p>As Ethereum's ecosystem grows, Polygon is set to benefit. This is especially true since some of Ethereum's smaller competitors were hit by the recent FTX crash.</p>
<p>Ethereum's surge will benefit not just Polygon, but also other projects in its ecosystem. One of these projects is Orbeon Protocol.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">What is Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol is a decentralized investment platform that challenges the traditional venture capital model. It's a crowdfunding platform that aims to build an inclusive economy through blockchain technology.</p>
<p>Startups can use Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s NFTs as a service (NFTsaaS) to mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs to issue during funding rounds, allowing them much quicker and easier access to capital. In turn, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) allows investors to support these funding rounds from as low as $1.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol offers a secure way to access investments in innovative projects. It provides investors with liquidity options and allows them to monitor their investments through the blockchain.</p>
<p>At the same time, Orbeon Protocol allows startup founders to raise funds more easily, efficiently, and cost-effectively. It also allows founders to connect more easily to their backers.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol has plans to become a multichain, metaverse-enabled platform. Right now, it is built on the Ethereum network, with plans to expand to Polygon next. That's why it could benefit from the growing interest in Polygon.</p>
<p>The Orbeon ecosystem is powered by the project&rsquo;s native ORBN token, a utility coin that provides holders with various benefits ranging from governance rights, staking bonuses and transaction fee discounts. </p>
<p>The project is making waves in the DeFi space as ORBN&rsquo;s price has been steadily increasing over the past months. Investors are optimistic, as the token has increased 655% since the presale. Experts predict ORBN will surge as high as 6000% before the presale ends.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Canada is set to prohibit crypto firms from offering leveraged trading to its citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision was explained on the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) website, where it was stated that these activities should not be allowed as they are considered &ldquo;high-risk, speculative investments.&rdquo; This means that firms will no longer be able to offer leveraged trading of cryptocurrencies to Canadians.</p>
<p>The announcement by the CSA is the latest in a string of measures taken to protect investors from the perceived volatile nature of cryptocurrencies. In the past, the agency has cracked down on crypto firms offering services such as margin trading, which allow customers to borrow money to speculate on the price of digital coins.</p>
<p>The new rule is intended to prevent customers from taking on more risk than they can handle. It also serves to protect against possible issues, which can occur when customers are not aware of the potential losses they may incur when investing in leveraged trading.</p>
<p>Overall, this move could be seen to have a positive effect on crypto retail traders in Canada. By limiting the risk involved with leveraged trading, the CSA could be seen to be helping to protect these investors from potential losses, but on the other hand, some might see this as a Big Brother type move.</p>
Stablecoins ban?
<p>The CSA also gave the view that stablecoins &ldquo;may constitute securities, and/or derivatives&rdquo;. Therefore registered or pre-registration undertaking (PRU) trading platforms are reminded that they are prohibited from allowing Canadian citizens to trade or have any exposure to such an asset.</p>
Opinion
<p>It would certainly be the case that many retail investors have taken some heavy losses due to leverage trading. Such a strategy is assuredly best undertaken by those traders who are experienced in this area.</p>
<p>However, the sheer level of regulation that is in place, or that is coming into effect in many countries in the near future, might be considered huge overreach, and a step too far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already in the traditional financial sector the average retail investor is completely barred from trading in instruments that are considered to be only for those with &ldquo;accredited investor status&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That stablecoins also might be prohibited to retail traders could be the last nail in the coffin of retail investor participation in much of crypto. Stablecoins are a tool for trading in and out of cryptocurrencies and are useful for holding value in downturns.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptodaily has been at the forefront of delivering insightful news and updates from the crypto ecosystem. Today, we introduce a new weekly video feature, allowing our audience to catch up with the hottest news from the crypto sector in a new format.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>This week, we will cover Orthogonal Trading&rsquo;s loan default, Ren Protocol&rsquo;s warning to users, Nomad&rsquo;s bridge relaunch, Binance&rsquo;s Proof of Reserves, and the FTX hearings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Orthogonal Trading Defaults On Loans
<p>The week saw Orthogonal Trading default on eight loans worth $36 million. The loans were taken on DeFi lending platform Maple Finance. The default occurred because Orthogonal&rsquo;s funds were tied up with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and impacted 30% of all active loans on the protocol. As a result of the default, Maple Finance severed all ties with Orthogonal Trading.</p>
Ren Protocol Warns Users Of Potential Loss Of Funds
<p>Alameda Research-backed Ren Protocol has warned its users that they risk losing their funds as it prepares to shutter its current Ren Version 1.0. According to the Ren team, once the current version is retired, users will not be able to recover their funds. The team encouraged users to redeem their tokens before the current version shuts down and their assets lose their value.</p>
Nomad To Relaunch Bridge
<p>Cross-chain bridge Nomad has announced that it will be relaunching its bridge after suffering a crippling hack in August. The Nomad team also stated that it would be offering impacted users partial refunds. Nomad suffered a serious exploit in August when malicious actors discovered a loophole in Nomad&rsquo;s smart contracts, resulting in the protocol losing $190 million.</p>
Binance Reveals Proof of Reserves
<p>The world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, announced that it completed an independent audit of its reserves. The audit confirmed that the exchange&rsquo;s Bitcoin reserves are overcollateralized. The audit was carried out by the global audit and advisory company Mazars. The audit set several minds at ease, as it revealed that customer assets are safe and sound.</p>
FTX Hearings To Take Place This Week
<p>The Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee have confirmed that they will be holding hearings this week to look into the astonishing collapse of the FTX exchange and its sister concern, Alameda Research. The Committees also asked FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried to appear before them and stated that subpoenas could be an option if Bankman-Fried refused to appear before the committees.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin Lightning Network will be facilitating cross-border fiat payments between the EU (UK and Europe) and Africa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto trading companies CoinCorner and Bitnob have teamed up to introduce cross-border payment between the European and African continents through the Bitcoin Lightning Network. As a result, users will now be able to send funds from the UK and Europe to select African countries. The application, Send Globally, will use the Bitcoin Lightning Network to send funds in fiat currencies. Under the application, users can send funds in British Pounds (GBP) or Euros (EUR) to the countries of Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana, where they will be converted into the local currencies of Nigerian Naira (NGN), Kenyan Shilling (KES), and Ghanaian Cedi (GHS). The Lightning Network will automatically convert the funds from GBP or EUR to BTC. They are then converted to the local currency of the African country and directly deposited into the recipient's bank account or online wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This development bodes well for the crypto industry, struggling in 2022, with crypto prices taking a plunge amidst several firms going bankrupt. Before this initiative, users wishing to send funds across continents only had the option of a third-party, centralized facilitator like Western Union. The issues associated with centralized money exchanges include longer transaction times and higher transaction fees. Considering that the high remittances sent from European countries to sub-Saharan Africa are $40 billion, the transaction fees alone would amount to millions of dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CoinCorner CEO Danny Scott acknowledged the scope of the remittance market and the role BTC can play in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He pointed out,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The remittance market is a huge opportunity for Bitcoin. By partnering with Bitnob to provide a seamless cross-border experience using Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, we hope to remove some of the friction and cost that customers experience when using traditional FX and money remittance companies.&rdquo;</p>

Sub-Saharan Remittance Corridor
<p>There has been a spur of crypto adoption in the MENA (Middle East and Africa) region, despite the efforts of the IMF to discourage the industry. With the introduction of the Lightning Network, Africans working in the UK and Europe can send funds home without worrying about extended processing times or high percentage cuts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitnob CEO Bernad Parah believes the initiative will significantly reduce the costs of sending funds to the sub-Saharan region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For us at Bitnob, this is another leap forward in economic empowerment for Africans. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the most expensive region to send money to, where sending $200 costs an average of 8.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 according to the World Bank. Bitcoin is powering the future of money and this partnership highlights a strong use case of what the future will look like.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Looks to Sustain Multi-Week Highs:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 14 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) encountered strong upward momentum early in the Asian session as the pair escalated higher to the 17500 level after finding technical support around the 17089.17 level, representing a test of the 50-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; Stops were elected above the 17221.04, 17302.51, and 17434.51 levels during the ascent, upside price objectives related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16875.83 and 17089.17 areas.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives related to this appreciating range include the 17779.81 and 17872.75 levels.&nbsp; Additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 1200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 17069.47 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17137.61.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Department of Justice is conflicted about the decision to charge the crypto exchange in the 2018 anti-money laundering laws investigation.&nbsp;</p>
DOJ Considers Charging Binance
<p>The crypto exchange, the largest in the world by trading volumes, has been the subject of a long-running investigation into its compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) laws. The investigation started back in 2018 and has amassed evidence that, according to some federal prosecutors, is sufficient to charge the company. Reuters reports that around half a dozen federal prosecutors believe the evidence collected against the exchange will be sufficient to back up filing criminal charges against individual Binance executives, including CEO Changpeng Zhao. However, other prosecutors have protested, saying that more crucial evidence is required to move legally against the crypto exchange.</p>
Other Departments Involved
<p>Besides the Justice Department, three other government agencies are involved in the investigation. According to the DOJ, money laundering charges against a financial company need to be approved by the head of the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section (MLARS). Furthermore, the heads of the United States Attorney&rsquo;s Office for the Western District of Washington in Seattle and the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) must also approve before the DOJ can take any action against the crypto company.&nbsp;</p>
Money Laundering And Other Charges
<p>Even though the company has recently revealed that its BTC reserves are over-collateralized, the Reuters investigation has revealed that the crypto firm has been financially non-compliant with AML laws. Not only did Binance fail to enforce strict anti-money laundering controls, but it also processed over $10 billion in payments for sanctioned individuals and groups and conspired to evade U.S. regulators. The company could be facing charges of unlicensed money transmission, money laundering conspiracy, and criminal sanctions violations. The Justice Department will have the final say in whether to indict Binance and its executives, negotiate a plea deal, or drop the case entirely.&nbsp;</p>
Criminal Charges Could Shake Market&nbsp;
<p>Moving ahead with the criminal proceedings would be another nail in the crypto coffin. The industry has already been struggling in the wake of the growing inflation, the LUNA debacle, the FTX crash, and the many exploits by cybercriminals. Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been maintaining one of the industry's few remaining pillars of support. Criminal charges at this point could prove lethal for the industry, which might not recover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reuters has unearthed that Binance has tried to keep the matter quiet. Indeed there has not been any news or reports of prosecutors deliberating about charging the company. The crypto company has argued that a criminal prosecution could wreak havoc on an already delicate market and has led to speculations that a conspiracy is brewing to destabilize Binance and the entire crypto market. Binance&rsquo;s legal team has been meeting with officials from the Justice Department to work out a solution, including potential plea deals.&nbsp;</p>

Criminal Charges Could Shake Market&nbsp;
<p>Moving ahead with the criminal proceedings would be another nail in the crypto coffin. The industry has already been struggling in the wake of the growing inflation, the LUNA debacle, the FTX crash, and the many exploits by cybercriminals. Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao have been maintaining one of the industry's few remaining pillars of support. Criminal charges at this point could prove lethal for the industry, which might not recover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reuters has unearthed that Binance has tried to keep the matter quiet. Indeed there has not been any news or reports of prosecutors deliberating about charging the company. The crypto company has argued that a criminal prosecution could wreak havoc on an already delicate market and has led to speculations that a conspiracy is brewing to destabilize Binance and the entire crypto market. Binance&rsquo;s legal team has been meeting with officials from the Justice Department to work out a solution, including potential plea deals.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The demise of FTX created unprecedented turmoil for Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot (DOT), causing the altcoins to lose their investors to The Hideaways (HDWY). The new generation investment has been making headlines despite the dreary cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="s8">Cardano (ADA) Movement Under Pressure</p>
<p class="s9">The value of Cardano (ADA) has seen unexpected lows amid the weeklong tale of the financial discrepancy of FTX. ADA has edged down 7.10% to $0.324887 in the past month, along with an 89.50% decline from its last year's peak.</p>
<p class="s9">2022 has not been suitable for the cryptocurrency market as compounded miseries have dented investors' sentiment. The sudden market meltdowns turned more intense after the dramatic FTX fall.</p>
<p class="s9">Digital assets like Cardano (ADA) are under pressure as their utility is tied to traders' confidence in the market. Analysts now expected ADA to reach $0.54 in 2023, a bearish prediction compared to The Hideaways (HDWY), which recently flagged up to 40x ROI next year.</p>
<p class="s9">In other news, Cardano (ADA) unveiled plans to launch a new privacy blockchain and token but still failed to support its price movement.</p>
<p class="s10">Polkadot (DOT) Fades Price Value</p>
<p class="s9">Polkadot (DOT) indicates a further downtrend in its price movement, obtaining negative sentiment from the broader market. At press time, DOT has remained negative in the 30-day timeline, translating to a decline of 8.80% to $5.56.</p>
<p class="s9">The series of drawbacks on Polkadot (DOT) has signified the loss of positivity in the crypto space as investors exited risky assets in light of the FTX failure.</p>
<p class="s9">Due to the weighing bearish pressure, Polkadot stayed behind from high price predictions for 2023, with expectations to stay at $6.72. This is farfetched from the anticipated bullish run of The Hideaways (HDWY) next year.</p>
<p class="s12">The Hideaways (HDWY) Rises As Favorite Token After FTX Collapse</p>
<p class="s9">Cryptocurrency values were crushed after the FTX exchange went insolvent, but The Hideaways (HDWY) popularity surged ahead, making it the most favorite presale token.</p>
<p class="s9">The Hideaways has been making noise as analysts projected massive returns in 2023, supported by its lot of space for growth amid a small market cap of $45.00 million. The newest venture is set to deliver exceptional benefits that even Cardano (ADA) and Polkadot(DOT) could not provide.</p>
<p class="s9">Investing in the trillion-dollar luxury property market is now easy, thanks to The Hideaways (HDWY). It mints fractionalized NFTs backed by high-tier real estate properties, handpicked by experts.</p>
<p class="s9">The Hideaways presale is still ongoing, offered at $0.10. This trusted project has also passed audits from the German firm Solidproof, proving its reliability to investors. In addition, HDWY has established a permanent lock on the platform&rsquo;s liquidity to highlight its long-term commitment.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Ripple (XRP) and Polygon (MATIC) price values have been swept into the FTX storm, ignoring the significant developments on both platforms.</p>
<p class="s6">On the other hand, The Hideaways (HDWY) has laid out a silver lining in the crypto community. The dramatic fall of the crypto exchange has driven XRP and MATIC investors to the presale superstar.</p>
<p class="s9">Ripple (XRP) Endures Ripple Effect of FTX&rsquo;s Troubles</p>
<p class="s6">Ripple (XRP) has been tireless in expanding its platform&rsquo;s presence worldwide, but FTX&rsquo;s contagion has dissolved support for the American-based crypto company.</p>
<p class="s6">In the past week, XRP has reported a decline of 15.30% to $0.382037, and it is about to close the year far behind its all-time high of $3.40. Correspondingly, Ripple is anticipated to end 2023 at $1.76.</p>
<p class="s6">The shock from Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s crypto exchange FTX sent leading crypto into a tailspin except for The Hideaways (HDWY), which has retained its bullish projections.</p>
<p class="s6">Accordingly, Ripple no longer derives most of its income from the United States as it reaches Europe, an effort to lessen the dragging impact of the market sell-off.</p>
<p class="s6">Ripple (XRP) was once the third-largest cryptocurrency, holding a $120.00 billion market value in 2018. However, XRP has declined sharply amid American regulatory scrutiny, which has unfolded a case from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p class="s9">Polygon (MATIC) Becomes Extra Bearish</p>
<p class="s6">Polygon (MATIC) has experienced significant declines this week despite its exceptional performance in terms of both business and performance. MATIC skidded 19.50% to $0.864124 in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s6">Subsequently, the number of unique addresses on the Polygon network continues to gain, surpassing the 191-million-wallet mark.</p>
<p class="s6">However, Polygon (MATIC) failed to protect itself from the FTX contagion, moving its 2023 price predictions to $0.93.</p>
<p class="s6">Unlike MATIC and XRP, The Hideaways (HDWY) has resisted broader crypto factors. The new projects made waves in a revolutionary way in the real estate market.</p>
<p>Why The Hideaways (HDWY) Could Be A Game Changer In 2023?</p>
<p class="s6">The Hideaways (HDWY) stands out as a highly growing crypto investment, while Ripple (XRP) and Polygon (MATIC) have been struggling.</p>
<p class="s6">At present, the new-generation investment is the safest project to grow your money as the venture places a high value on the security of the trader's assets with an audit from Solidproof.</p>
<p class="s6">The Hideaways (HDWY) welcomes investors to purchase high-tier properties by minting fractionalized non-fungible tokens (NFT). </p>
<p class="s6">For next year, crypto experts expected up to 40x ROI from The Hideaways, giving early investors the most significant returns possible.</p>
<p class="s6">The Hideaways (HDWY) offers the best way to obtain passive income while holding your crypto gains. Now is the perfect time to invest in HDWY tokens when it's priced at only $0.072. Join today, and you'll receive a 30% bonus on your purchase!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In an unexpected move, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Binance, has temporarily halted USDC (USD Coin) withdrawals. This news sent a few tremors through the crypto community but doesn&rsquo;t seem to be very serious according to the exchange.</p>
<p>USDC is a stablecoin backed one-to-one by the U.S. dollar. It is one of the most popular stablecoins used as a medium of exchange in the crypto world. The decision to halt USDC withdrawals was made due to &ldquo;technical difficulties&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance tweeted:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">On USDC, we have seen an increase in withdrawals. However, the channel to swap from PAX/BUSD to USDC requires going through a bank in NY in USD. The banks are not open for another few hours. We expect the situation will be restored when the banks open. 1/2</p>
&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>The Binance CEO also tweeted out his belief that his exchange is receiving a huge amount of FUD. He expressed annoyance but said that in spite of the negativity Binance was still growing.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">FUD helps us grow, even though they are thoroughly annoying. You can FUD about someone without explicitly mentioning their name, which spreads awareness.It also helps unite their supporters because it forms a common defense alliance.Short thread. 1/4 https://t.co/PlxhqV5cZS</p>
&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) December 13, 2022
<p>

</p>
Opinion
<p>The news of USDC withdrawals being halted does appear to have had far more negativity than would probably be the case normally. Up until very recently Binance was generally considered to be a model of stability in the crypto space, and it does seem a little odd that there is so much FUD being directed its way over recent days.</p>
<p>The crypto industry is in a vulnerable state, with the bear market extending for longer than many had anticipated. The FUD over Binance halting USDC withdrawals could be seen as a further sign that those wishing the sector ill might be trying to topple one of the biggest dominoes in the hope that this will bring crypto down for a long, long time to come.</p>

The FUD over Binance halting USDC withdrawals could be seen as a further sign that those wishing the sector ill might be trying to topple one of the biggest dominoes in the hope that this will bring crypto down for a long, long time to come.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Dubai, UAE, 13th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Morningstar Ventures, an investment firm specializing in digital assets and blockchain technology, is opening its first interactive digital art gallery in the heart of Dubai. Located in the Burj Daman Tower (DIFC area), &lsquo;37xDubai&rsquo; is positioned amidst Dubai&rsquo;s business and lifestyle center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>37xDubai aims to bridge art and technology through focusing on web3 education, traditional art, digital art, entertainment, and community. A carefully curated collection of art mixed with digital experiences will make 37xDubai much more than just a gallery. Via educational programs, private events, and monthly gatherings, 37xDubai will cultivate a global community of digital art enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Featured artists will be able to leverage Morningstar Ventures&rsquo; and 37x&rsquo;s network and expand their reach by engaging with a new influx of web3 enthusiasts. The modular technology behind the 37xDubai gallery allows for frequent changes in exhibited collections, keeping the creative space fresh and adaptable to diverse concepts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clemence Cazeau, 37xDubai CEO, said: &ldquo;The design and architecture of our gallery are highly sophisticated, filled with state-of-the-art equipment, interior, sound, and lighting infrastructure. We&rsquo;ve hand-picked and meticulously selected every element of the space to ensure that the 37xDubai gallery and its exhibitions are presented in an unforgettable fashion to every one of our visitors.&rdquo;</p>



<p>The co-founders of Morningstar Ventures, Danilo S. Carlucci and Arut Nazaryan, are two young Dubai-based entrepreneurs who were early investors in web3 and are affiliated with the entertainment and luxury industries. Early in 2021, the pair got together with Clemence Cazeau who brings years of experience from art, galleries, and auction houses.</p>
<p>The global NFT market is projected to reach 23.9% between 2022 and 2028. In the UAE, 23% of people own at least one NFT, ranking the region first compared to Europe (8%) and the U.S. (2.8%). MoMa, Sotheby&rsquo;s, and other institutional players in the art scene have also opened NFT or metaverse-related initiatives or shown interest in the space recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 37xDubai team is in the later stages of the development process and has already gathered interest from a range of exclusive partners from the luxury, art, fashion, and lifestyle sectors. 37xDubai will open its doors just before Art Dubai which is to take place in early March 2023. Details around the grand opening will be released in January.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In what it says is an effort to protect investors and maintain market integrity, the SEC of Thailand is preparing to implement stricter regulations for digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Regulation at a difficult time for crypto
<p>The Thai SEC&rsquo;s new regulations are an effort to counter the various collapses and bankruptcies that have taken place in the crypto sector throughout the course of the last few months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency cites that many investors have suffered heavy losses due to the likes of Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, FTX among others.</p>
<p>Advertising is another area that the SEC has highlighted, where cryptocurrency advertising was said to be misleading, further adding to the risks for investors.</p>
Regulation in other parts of Asia
<p>An article for the Bangkok Post highlights how the Thai SEC is seeking to &ldquo;mirror&rdquo; regulation that is being seen in other countries.</p>
<p>For example: the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is walking a line between trying to protect investors whilst also attempting to not put damper on the new technology innovations that are springing up out of the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>Five risk areas have been identified by the MAS, and these are:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing, technology management services, hedging against retail investors, stabilisation of stablecoins, and mitigating against potential financial stability risks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Japan the regulatory system is focused on financial stability. The Financial Services Agency has promulgated that stablecoin issuers have to be &ldquo;banks, trusts, or fund transfer service providers, and the FSA issues rules on funding in order to protect against stability risks.</p>
Fair regulations can assist investors and traders
<p>The regulatory framework for digital asset trading is still in its early stages, but the Thai SEC&rsquo;s efforts to introduce stricter regulations and protect investors may be a step in the right direction. As more investors and traders become exposed to the digital asset market, it is essential that the authorities ensure that the market is fair, safe and secure. With the right regulatory measures in place, digital asset trading could become more accessible to a wider range of investors and traders, while also protecting them from potential losses.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Hong Kong, Hong Kong, 13th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Platypus Finance is launching USP, a protocol-native stablecoin. USP&rsquo;s deployment has emerged from Platypus&rsquo; goal of improving capital efficiency for its users. USP also resolves long-running collateral issues associated with stablecoins. The native Platypus Finance stablecoin has been designed to reduce the liquidity fragmentation and scattered assets that are endemic to many protocols.</p>
<p class="chainwire-video-container"></p>
<p>USP is pegged to the US dollar, operating as an overcollateralized stablecoin that provides a layer of security in cases of depegging with its unique Adaptive Peg Stabilizer. The coin maintains its value itself with the Platypus stableswap AMM algorithm and coverage ratio model.</p>
<p>Platypus&rsquo; native stablecoin dramatically enhances capital efficiency for users of the Avalanche DEX. It takes advantage of single-sided collateral and allows users to sit comfortably with minimum smart contract risk. USP can be earned by users by collateralizing their LP tokens with up to 20 times leverage. This way, investors can farm with their USP as a liquid asset and ultimately increase their earning power. USP can be minted in the Main Pools LP to start with, and will expand minting opportunities to the Alternative Pools LP as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Benefits to USP include:</p>
<p>Maximizes Capital Efficiency: Users can mint USP using LP tokens on Platypus Finance as collateral and turn staked assets to liquid.</p>
<p>Enables 20x Leverage Farming: Through repeated minting, leverage farming on Platypus is made possible by up to 20x.</p>
<p>Minimizes Smart Contract Risk: Minting and collaterals are based on a single platform which greatly reduces systematic risks.</p>
<p>Utilizes Single-Sided Collateral: Impermanent loss-free, single-sided LP collateralization enables much higher flexibility and risk control on the minting.</p>
<p>Platypus continues to grow with USP launching as a follow-up to the platform&rsquo;s release of its Voting Gauge mechanism. The feature essentially gave users power to control where PTP emissions go through the gauge and earn rewards in the form of bribes as they vote.</p>
<p>About Platypus Finance</p>
<p>Platypus has redefined stableswaps and reinvented stablecoins on Avalanche. Masterfully utilizing Platypus&rsquo; underlying assets brings next-level capital efficiency which solves the long-standing problem of liquidity fragmentation in traditional DeFi. With an open liquidity pool stableswap and single-sided liquidity provision, it redefines the concept of liquidity equilibrium allowing for the integration of new assets, more use cases for the single-sided LP tokens, and organic growth of assets based on supply and demand. Platypus further utilizes its capital to mint stablecoins: the USP - all of these innovations neatly wrapped in one sleek user interface.</p>

<p>The fund, supported by the project team, seed investors and members of the BNX community, will be used to invest in on-chain gaming projects that utilize or are experimenting with blockchain technology. BinaryX is also offering advisory services alongside the fund to bolster support for projects under the fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fund will be used to provide resources and all forms of support for games at any stage, including early-stage, and late-stage development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BinaryX Incubation Fund Distribution Breakdown</p>
<p>The fund distribution comes from the overall BinaryX fund as pictured below:</p>

<p>BinaryX will allocate 8% of their overall funds to the Cyber Incubation Fund, the amount is $12 million USD at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rudy, Head of Growth at BinaryX, said:&nbsp;</p>
&ldquo;BinaryX is committed to accelerating the adoption of Web3 technologies in gaming. The fund is not limited to supporting blockchain games already in the space, but also traditional developer teams who want to experiment with blockchain in their games or NFTs. We believe in the overall growth and adoption of blockchain within the gaming ecosystem, and we will strive to support any project that is promising to that effect.&rdquo;
<p>Since launching the incubation arm mid-2022, BinaryX has invested in and incubated 2 GameFi projects. Its portfolio includes SHIT games, and Rh!noX NFT collection, with several exciting projects underway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BinaryX will accelerate its search and adoption of projects in need of incubation, and offer support across all stages, including early-stage and late-stage development.</p>
<p>With this incubation arm, BinaryX aims to connect projects with BinaryX&rsquo;s network of resources, advisors and investors to help projects go to launch. The Incubation Fund is open to receive applications and all year round, providing iterative support to any project at any stage of development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The news comes amidst already refuted rumours that BinaryX is selling tokens. To reiterate their stance, Rudy said, &lsquo;We would like to emphasize that there was no foul play from our team. We are entirely focused on our games, and we have been communicating our upcoming plans transparently.&rsquo; The team has just arranged a DAO vote to decide on the buy back plan for BNX, and are working to execute it alongside other strategic plans for long-term growth, including the development of their latest game, CyberLand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About BinaryX</p>
<p>BinaryX is the GameFi platform behind play-to-earn games CyberDragon and CyberChess, both of which run on the BNB chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BinaryX began as a decentralised derivative trading system. The team gradually evolved into developing decentralised video games, and is now transitioning to becoming a GameFi platform offering IGO services to bridge Web2 developers to Web3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one of the top 10 projects on the BNB Chain, BinaryX has a vast community of more than 100k coin holders and 17K monthly active wallets. It is also one of the largest metaverse projects by trading volume on the BNB chain. BinaryX also has a token, $BNX, that has consistently demonstrated strong performance despite the bear market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has denied being part of a secret group titled &ldquo;Wirefraud&rdquo; just hours before his arrest by the Bahamian authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret Signal group allegedly involved other former FTX and Alameda Research Executives, including Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</p>
Secretive Signal Group&nbsp;
<p>According to the Australian Financial Review, members of the FTX and Alameda Research inner circle were part of a secret group chat called &ldquo;Wirefraud&rdquo; on the messaging app Signal. The news broke just a day prior to a scheduled United States Congressional hearing on the FTX debacle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The report added that FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang, Nishad Singh, and CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison, were all part of the group chat. Additionally, the report states that the group chose Signal so that the information and contents of the group would remain hidden.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;JUST IN: Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX&rsquo;s inner circle reportedly had a secret group chat on Signal named &lsquo;Wirefraud.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

FTX Rabbithole Gets Deeper&nbsp;
<p>The group chat is another in a series of revelations about FTX and how Sam Bankman-Fried and his associates ran it. The collapse and subsequent scandal has been among the biggest scandals to hit the crypto space. Additionally, the misuse of customer funds has opened another pandora&rsquo;s box, making the revelation of a secret group chat more interesting to authorities and market watchers alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, SBF maintains his innocence, stating that any failure should be attributed to competence and not malice. However, many have continued to call this narrative into question, implying SBF knew what he was doing, with the discovery of the Signal group further proof of intentions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FTX still holds millions in unaccounted customer assets, and with Congressional hearings slated to begin during the week, Sam Bankman-Fried is set to appear before the US House Financial Services Committee today. Another congressional hearing is already scheduled to investigate the fTX collapse in more detail.&nbsp;</p>
SBF Denies Involvement In Secret Group&nbsp;
<p>Just hours before his arrest by the Bahamian authorities, embattled FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried took to Twitter to deny his knowledge and involvement with the Signal group chat &ldquo;Wirefraud.&rdquo; The group allegedly involves former FTX and Alameda management and officials, including Zixiao &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; Wang, Nishad Singh, and Caroline Ellison. According to the report, the group sent information about FTX and Alameda Research&rsquo;s operations in the lead-up to their collapse.</p>
<p>However, Bankman-Fried flatly denied knowledge of any such group, stating that he had never heard of such a group and was quite sure the reports were false.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If this is true, then I wasn&rsquo;t a member of that inner circle (I&rsquo;m quite sure it&rsquo;s just false; I have never heard of such a group).&rdquo;</p>

Will Bankman-Fried Appear Before Congress?
<p>Until recently, Bankman-Fried was expected to appear remotely before a United States House Committee Hearing to explain the collapse of FTX. However, he was taken into custody by the Bahamian authorities and is likely to be extradited to the United States of America. Following the arrest, Committee Chair Maxine Waters confirmed that the committee would not be able to hear SBF&rsquo;s testimony due to the arrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried was also requested to appear at a December 14th hearing with the Senate Committee on Banking. However, he never confirmed if he would attend, and his lawyers refused to accept a subpoena compelling him to testify. Meanwhile, in his testimony, the chief restructuring officer and FTX CEO, John Ray, stated that FTX customer assets were intermingled with those of Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
