<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DOJ requests time to gather evidence against Celsius founder for fraud charges.</em></li>



<li><em>Celsius settles with FTC for $4.7 billion over investor deception.</em></li>



<li><em>The trial date is pending, and if convicted, Mashinsky and a co-defendant could face lengthy prison sentences, making this a significant case in the crypto industry.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a high-stakes legal battle, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has requested six to eight weeks from a federal judge to gather evidence against Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency lending platform <a href="https://coincu.com/204888-celsius-hits-deal-users-compensation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius</a>, <em>CoinDesk</em> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/25/us-doj-needs-6-8-weeks-to-process-evidence-against-alex-mashinsky-attorneys-tell-judge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849.png"><img decoding="async" width="860" height="394" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849.png" alt="DOJ Seeks Evidence in Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement" class="wp-image-205928" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849.png 860w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849-300x137.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849-768x352.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1849-750x344.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" title="DOJ Seeks Evidence In Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The DOJ&#8217;s attorneys have cited the need to sift through a massive trove of corporate records and communications from Celsius, which includes over 1,200 videos of &#8220;ask-me-anything&#8221; sessions featuring Mashinsky and other executives, some lasting over an hour.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/204802-celsius-network-a-story-of-greed-and-deception/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mashinsky</a>, who was taken into custody earlier this month, has <a href="https://coincu.com/202741-celsius-network-founder-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entered</a> a plea of not guilty to charges of securities fraud, commodities fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to manipulate the price of CEL, Celsius&#8217; native token. His defense in court is led by lawyer Marc Mukasey.</p>



<p>Judge John G. Koeltl of the District Court for the Southern District of New York has set the next conference date for October 3rd, with the trial date yet to be determined. Koeltl had previously granted Mashinsky&#8217;s team additional time to comply with the conditions of his $40 million bail.</p>



<p>This recent arrest follows Mashinsky&#8217;s previous detention on July 13 on federal securities fraud charges, coinciding with the crypto exchange&#8217;s agreement to settle a $4.7 billion lawsuit with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-1024x768.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-1024x768.png" alt="DOJ Seeks Evidence in Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement" class="wp-image-205929" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-1024x768.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-750x563.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850-1140x855.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1850.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DOJ Seeks Evidence In Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>Celsius, along with Mashinsky, is also facing lawsuits from both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on allegations of conspiring to defraud investors of substantial amounts.</p>



<p>Mashinsky faces a string of charges in Manhattan federal court, encompassing securities, commodities, and wire fraud, as well as various securities manipulation and fraud charges. If convicted, both Mashinsky and his co-defendant, Roni Cohen-Pavon, could be sentenced to decades in prison.</p>



<p>Celsius&#8217; settlement with the FTC stands as one of the largest in the agency&#8217;s history, comparable to the record $5 billion fine imposed on Meta in 2019. This settlement comes as the FTC accuses Celsius and Mashinsky of engaging in repeated deceptive practices.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-1024x576.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-1024x576.png" alt="DOJ Seeks Evidence in Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement" class="wp-image-205930" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1851.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="DOJ Seeks Evidence In Fraud Case Against Celsius Founder Amidst $4.7B FTC Settlement 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The terms of the settlement, announced by the FTC, dictate that the payment will be withheld until Celsius can return the remaining customer assets amidst ongoing bankruptcy proceedings.</p>



<p>In the charging document, the office of U.S. Attorney Damian Williams alleges that:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Mashinsky misrepresented, among other things, the safety of Celsius’s yield-generating activities, Celsius’s profitability, the long-term sustainability of Celsius’ high rewards rates, and the risks associated with depositing crypto assets with Celsius.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the trial date looms, the outcome of this high-profile case could have significant implications for the crypto industry and its regulatory landscape. The court proceedings will undoubtedly be closely monitored by stakeholders and investors alike.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>KuCoin, a cryptocurrency exchange, denies rumors of laying off 30% of its workforce amid declining profits and legal challenges from the New York State Attorney General.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange introduced strict KYC policies in response to the lawsuit, impacting its profits.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has been grappling with rumors of potential workforce reductions as it contends with legal challenges and declining profits.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="567" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-1024x567.png" alt="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed" class="wp-image-205920" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-1024x567.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-300x166.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-768x425.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-750x416.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845-1140x632.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1845.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>Twitter news account <em>Wu Blockchain</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1683821842447106048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited</a> three anonymous internal sources in a tweet, claiming that <a href="https://coincu.com/198648-kucoin-mandatory-kyc-verification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KuCoin</a> plans to lay off up to 30% of its employees, amounting to nearly 1,000 staff members. The decline in profits was attributed to the implementation of strict Know Your Customer (KYC) policies, a move made in response to the legal challenges posed by the United States.</p>



<p>However, a spokesperson for KuCoin refuted the claims, stating that the company has not initiated any layoff plans, <em>CoinDesk</em> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/25/crypto-exchange-kucoin-to-adjust-some-personnel-as-needed-denies-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. Instead, the spokesperson asserted that any personnel adjustments would be part of routine business development and semi-annual employee performance reviews—a normal process in organizational development.</p>



<p>The legal troubles faced by the exchange are not unique, as the cryptocurrency industry faces increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. The New York Attorney General&#8217;s lawsuit against the exchange <a href="https://coincu.com/172664-kucoin-sued-asks-permanent-ban-eth-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged</a> violations of the Martin Act, a powerful state securities law, accusing the exchange of conducting unauthorized transactions and offering a product called &#8220;KuCoin Earn&#8221; that generated income for both the platform and investors. Moreover, the lawsuit contested the exchange&#8217;s claim of being an official &#8220;exchange.&#8221;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="503" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847.png" alt="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed" class="wp-image-205922" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1847-750x393.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">New York State Attorney General Letitia James</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Despite the challenges, the exchange has amassed over 27 million users across 207 countries and regions since its launch in September 2017. However, in terms of trading volume among cryptocurrency spot exchanges, KuCoin trails behind major players like Binance, <a href="https://coincu.com/204526-coinbase-stops-coinbase-borrow-users-repay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, and <a href="https://coincu.com/200835-fbi-targets-kraken-founder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kraken</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, KuCoin&#8217;s rival, Binance, has <a href="https://coincu.com/202996-binance-fired-1000-people-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> undergone workforce reductions in recent weeks, although the exchange denies the extent of the layoffs. Binance, like KuCoin, attributed these adjustments to a reevaluation of talent and expertise in critical roles.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="674" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848.png" alt="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed" class="wp-image-205923" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848-300x197.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848-768x506.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1848-750x494.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="KuCoin Faces Profit Woes Surround, But No Layoffs Confirmed 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve, exchanges face mounting pressure to comply with regulatory frameworks and adapt to changing market dynamics. For KuCoin, navigating legal challenges and implementing measures to enhance customer security remain crucial factors in securing its position in the competitive crypto landscape.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Web3 gaming company Aurory announces integration with Arbitrum, Ethereum&#8217;s Layer 2 scaling solution, enabling digital asset existence on both Arbitrum and Solana blockchains.</em></li>



<li><em>Players can now use SyncSpace technology to deposit and withdraw gaming assets between Solana and Arbitrum, offering a seamless cross-chain experience.</em></li>



<li><em>This significant milestone advances Aurory&#8217;s multi-platform vision and enhances the utility of in-game assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aurory, a renowned web3 gaming company offering a universe of interoperable games, has taken a significant step towards its multi-platform vision. The company recently <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aurory-franchise-enables-cross-chain-operability-with-arbitrum-integration-301885313.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> its integration with <a href="https://coincu.com/204281-arbitrum-foundation-grants-phase-1-targets-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arbitrum</a>, the leading Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, opening up new possibilities for digital asset acquisition and management within its gaming ecosystem.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1024x576.png" alt="Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum" class="wp-image-205906" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1843.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aurory Sets The Stage For Seamless Web3 Gaming With New Integration On Arbitrum 7"></a></figure></div>


<p>While Aurory&#8217;s free-to-play games don&#8217;t require wallet connections, the company has enabled on-chain Aurory assets to exist on both Arbitrum and Solana, two prominent blockchain ecosystems within the web3 gaming realm. These assets encompass AURY tokens, playable NFT characters, skins, and Neftie eggs, all of which serve or will serve a utility in Aurory&#8217;s flagship games, Adventures (JRPG) and Tactics (Timeline-Based Battle Arena).</p>



<p>SyncSpace technology plays a pivotal role in making this integration possible. It is a proprietary hybrid on-chain/off-chain inventory management system specifically designed by Aurory. Originally aimed at reducing friction for new users entering the Aurory gaming universe without the need for wallet connections, SyncSpace also allows them to earn in-game items that can later be minted on-chain when withdrawn to an external wallet. Moreover, users can deposit on-chain items into SyncSpace, facilitating seamless gameplay, trading, Neftie egg hatching, Aurorian expeditions, and more without the constant need for blockchain transaction approvals.</p>



<p>By leveraging SyncSpace, Aurory now empowers gamers to deposit their assets from the Solana network into SyncSpace and withdraw them on the Arbitrum network and vice versa, ensuring a seamless cross-chain experience. Notably, this innovation also opens the door for Aurory games to integrate with traditional gaming platforms that impose stricter regulations on incorporating blockchain elements.</p>

<p>The integration with Arbitrum comes at a time when the network is making substantial strides in the web3 gaming industry. During the first quarter of 2023, Arbitrum witnessed a staggering 125% growth in active blockchain gaming users, thanks to its cutting-edge technological advancements in scaling performance. The Arbitrum Nova scaling solution utilizes &#8220;AnyTrust&#8221; technology, processing data off-chain to enable low-cost transactions, which is particularly beneficial for game developers handling high transaction volumes.</p>



<p>Arbitrum has been a hotbed of activity lately, attracting prominent projects in the blockchain gaming space. Notably, Xai, a gaming-focused permissionless Layer 3 blockchain, revealed plans to launch on the network later this year. Additionally, The Graph, a leading indexing and query protocol for organizing blockchain data, recently commenced its final phase of migration to Arbitrum. Moreover, Cega expanded its structured DeFi investment product to the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Flashbots, an Ethereum infrastructure service, raises $60 million in a Series B funding round led by Paradigm.</em></li>



<li><em>The funding will be used to advance the development of Flashbots&#8217; SUAVE network, aimed at mitigating maximum extractable value (MEV) challenges on Ethereum.</em></li>



<li><em>SUAVE enables cost-effective and private transactions, making significant strides in revolutionizing blockchain efficiency and privacy.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flashbots, an Ethereum infrastructure service, has successfully completed its Series B funding round, securing $60 million. The funding was led by Paradigm, a prominent crypto-focused investment firm.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="494" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-1024x494.png" alt="Flashbots Secures $60M In Funding Led By Paradigm To Enhance SUAVE MEV Network" class="wp-image-205900" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-1024x494.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-300x145.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-768x371.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-750x362.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841-1140x550.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1841.png 1450w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Flashbots Secures $60M In Funding Led By Paradigm To Enhance SUAVE MEV Network 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>The primary focus of this funding is to accelerate the development of Flashbots&#8217; maximum extractable value (MEV) network called <a href="https://writings.flashbots.net/mevm-suave-centauri-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUAVE</a>.</p>



<p>The news of the funding round was initially reported by <em><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/241327/flashbots-becomes-unicorn-after-completing-60-million-raise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Block</a></em>, which mentioned a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on July 21.</p>



<p>The filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1879282/000187928223000003/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Flashbots had raised $30,353,089 of its targeted $59,999,919. The completion of the round is expected to be confirmed shortly when additional filings become public.</p>



<p>An intriguing aspect of the project&#8217;s fundraising approach was their invitation to investors and partners to participate in a reverse pitch &#8220;beauty contest for decentralization.&#8221; Paradigm emerged as the lead investor among the chosen backers.</p>



<p>Flashbots is known for its extensive research and development work centered around Ethereum. Their main objective is to tackle the issue of MEV, which refers to the potential profits that network operators can gain by previewing or reordering upcoming blockchain transactions.</p>



<p>The project also officially <a href="https://twitter.com/SheaKetsdever/status/1683477917949411330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the open-source implementation of Nodes in its MEV-Share product array. Specifically, it said that the biggest motivation behind this decision is to be transparent about the arrangement and distribution of profits after MEV transactions.</p>



<p>The SUAVE (Single Unifying Auction for Value Expression) platform, developed by Flashbots, is an independent network serving as a mempool and decentralized block builder. Developers can use SUAVE to launch intra-block applications such as block builders or orderflow auctions. These applications then compete to execute user preferences, leading to more cost-effective and private transactions compared to traditional chains like Ethereum.</p>

<p>With the additional funding, <a href="https://coincu.com/133876-flashbots-announced-an-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flashbots</a> plans to further enhance the SUAVE platform, with a specific focus on allowing users to transact more affordably and privately on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>



<p>This successful Series B funding round comes after earlier reports that Flashbots aimed to become a unicorn by raising up to $50 million. Notably, Paradigm was also a lead investor in the project&#8217;s seed-stage fundraising round back in 2020.</p>



<p>In addition to proposing blocks for validators on the Ethereum blockchain, Flashbots offers MEV-boost, a middleware that optimizes MEV for use by Ethereum validators.</p>



<p>With the new funding in place and the continuous development of SUAVE, Flashbots is well-positioned to address MEV challenges and provide more efficient and private transaction solutions on the Ethereum network.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Tennessee couple charged with defrauding over 100 investors in the &#8220;Blessings of God Thru Crypto&#8221; scheme by the CFTC.</em></li>



<li><em>They raised $6 million, promising high returns through crypto futures trading.</em></li>



<li><em>CFTC seeks restitution, but recovery difficult as funds were transferred to untraceable digital wallets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8757-23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a complaint on July 25 against Michael and Amanda Griffis, owners of a real estate company in Clarksville, Tennessee, for allegedly defrauding over 100 people in a digital assets commodity pool scheme. The couple raised more than $6 million by persuading colleagues and customers to pool funds for trading digital assets.</strong></h5>

<p>Operating under the name &#8220;Blessings of God Thru Crypto,&#8221; the defendants promised high returns to participants by claiming to trade &#8220;crypto futures&#8221; on the &#8220;Apex Trading Platform&#8221; with guidance from an individual named &#8220;Coach Wendy.&#8221; Their personal and professional connections were leveraged to lend credibility to the scheme.</p>



<p>A commodity pool is an investment vehicle that combines funds from multiple investors for trading in futures contracts or other commodity interests, typically managed by a pool operator.</p>



<p>The CFTC is seeking restitution, civil monetary penalties, permanent trading and registration bans, as well as a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The defendants falsely represented that pool funds would be safe and under their control, that pool participants could expect high gains, and that the defendants would use pool funds to trade &#8216;crypto futures&#8217; on the &#8216;Apex Trading Platform&#8217; with the advice of a person identified only as &#8216;Coach Wendy,'&#8221; the CFTC stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The couple allegedly mingled the pool funds with their personal finances. Investors would transfer funds to Michael Griffis&#8217; account, which were then moved to his personal account on Coinbase. Next, the funds were converted into digital asset commodities and transferred to the Apex Trading Platform for futures trading. However, the CFTC revealed that over $4 million of the pool funds were quickly transferred to digital wallets beyond the defendants&#8217; control, making recovery impossible.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-1024x576.png" alt="CFTC Charges Tennessee Couple For Defrauding Investors In Crypto Scam Scheme" class="wp-image-205893" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1839.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="CFTC Charges Tennessee Couple For Defrauding Investors In Crypto Scam Scheme 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>Approximately $855,000 was paid out to certain pool participants, resembling Ponzi-style payments. The <a href="https://coincu.com/205581-binance-cz-file-a-petition-dismiss-cftcs-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFTC</a> warned that retrieving lost funds might prove difficult, as the defendants may lack sufficient assets. Despite this, the regulatory body is steadfast in holding the couple accountable for their actions. The defendants are accused of misappropriating around $1 million to settle debts and indulge in luxury purchases. The remaining funds were allegedly used for Ponzi-like payments to prolong the scheme.</p>



<p>Commodity pool scams have long been used to deceive victims, with perpetrators offering promises of unique market insights and fast returns. However, once the funds are in the pool operator&#8217;s control, recovering them becomes significantly challenging, especially when perpetrators transfer the funds to digital wallets outside their jurisdiction.</p>



<p>Ian McGinley, the CFTC&#8217;s director of enforcement, declared: </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The defendants betrayed their pool participants, and they profited from that betrayal. Today&#8217;s filing reinforces the CFTC&#8217;s long-standing commitment to hold accountable those who take advantage of victims.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CFTC insists that it will continue to hold the defendants responsible for their acts.</p>



<p>In a recent development, the CFTC <a href="https://coincu.com/202226-digitex-futures-founder-default-judgment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued</a> a default judgment against Florida resident Adam Todd and his affiliated companies. The judgment comes from his involvement in illegal activities related to their digital asset exchange, operating under the name &#8220;Digitex Futures.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the franchise continues to flourish, the creators have now set their sights on further expansion. The latest developments include the migration of their NFT minting game, &#8220;Play and Kollect,&#8221; from the Polygon Ethereum sidechain to Ronin, the network created by Axie Infinity&#8217;s developer, <a href="https://coincu.com/132845-axie-infinity-developer-stake-axs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sky Mavis</a>.</p>



<p>The migration to Ronin represents a strategic move for the Kongz team, as they plan to leverage the gaming ecosystem provided by Sky Mavis and delve deeper into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets. A representative from Sky Mavis confirmed the partnership, which also involves rewarding players of <a href="https://coincu.com/202547-axie-infinity-launches-new-player-profile-module/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axie Infinity</a> with digital assets from the CyberKongz collection.</p>



<p>The franchise is not content with just the migration, as they are launching a new anime-inspired NFT collection called &#8220;Genkai.&#8221; The collection is set to make its debut on July 27, with some of the tokens being minted on Ronin, while others will be available on the Ethereum mainnet. The total supply of Genkai tokens is 20,000, with 4,000 of them available on Ronin through Sky Mavis&#8217;s in-house NFT marketplace, Mavis Market.</p>



<p>&#8220;Myoo,&#8221; the pseudonymous founder and artist behind CyberKongz, expressed excitement about Genkai, stating, &#8220;Genkai is the first non-pixel artwork I have created for CyberKongz, and will represent our growth as a project to expand our IP into the Southeast Asian and Japanese markets.&#8221; Furthermore, the collaboration with Ronin will also pave the way for the development of a game featuring the Genkai collection.</p>

<p>Despite the fluctuations in the NFT market, <a href="https://coincu.com/197996-cyberkongz-introduces-on-chain-2fa-with-erc-721x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CyberKongz</a> remains determined to thrive, and the introduction of Genkai is a testament to their commitment to evolving their IP and engaging with the gaming community. Sky Mavis&#8217;s support in rewarding Mystic Axie holders with Genkai NFTs aims to foster a strong connection between the two franchises.</p>



<p>The Genkai minting on Ronin is significant as it marks the first non-Axie Infinity NFT drop on the blockchain. This move comes shortly after Sky Mavis&#8217;s announcement of its collaboration with multiple game studios, including The Machines Arena developers, to bolster Ronin&#8217;s gaming ecosystem.</p>



<p>With a total of 20,000 NFTs set to be minted for Genkai, 16,000 will be available on the Ethereum mainnet, while 4,000 will reside on Ronin. Moreover, Ethereum NFT holders will have the option to migrate their Genkai NFTs to Ronin in the future, giving them more flexibility in managing their digital assets. The Ethereum public mint for Genkai NFTs will commence on July 27, priced at 0.25 ETH per token.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>EraLend, the leading lending protocol on Ethereum&#8217;s zkSync, suffers a $3.4 million read-only reentrancy attack.</em></li>



<li><em>The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the smart contract code, using a faulty price oracle to repeatedly withdraw more funds than authorized.</em></li>



<li><em>EraLend promptly suspends borrowing operations and advises users against depositing USDC while working with cybersecurity firms to address the security breach.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a recent security breach, EraLend, the largest lending protocol operating on the Ethereum scaling blockchain <a href="https://coincu.com/203301-zksync-era-introduced-boojum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zkSync</a>, fell victim to a read-only reentrancy attack, resulting in a substantial loss of $3.4 million.</strong></h5>

<p>According to blockchain security firm CertiK, the attack <a href="https://skynet.certik.com/alerts/security/c501f496-5302-4c6a-b3a4-5b12b9a78915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exploited</a> a vulnerability in EraLend&#8217;s smart contract code, allowing the attacker to withdraw more funds than authorized within a single transaction. As a result of the exploit, the total amount of locked capital on EraLend dropped from $18.5 million to $7.7 million, as reported by DefiLlama.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The vulnerability that the attacker took advantage of involved a read-only function, typically considered safe due to its inability to modify the contract&#8217;s state. These functions perform view actions, such as calculating token balances, without altering any data. However, the hacker manipulated this function through a reentrancy exploit, repeatedly calling it to drain assets from EraLend. The exploit focused on a faulty price oracle that EraLend relied on, ultimately allowing the attacker to siphon off significant funds from the protocol.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Era Lend addressed the incident promptly, suspending all borrowing operations and warning users against depositing USDC (USD Coin) until the issue is resolved. The team is actively working with cybersecurity firms and partners to investigate the attack and implement necessary security measures.</p>



<p>In the wake of the attack, Era Lend <a href="https://twitter.com/Era_Lend/status/1683826465446715397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassured</a> its users that only the USDC pool was compromised, and the security of assets other than USDC remains intact. As a precautionary step, the platform temporarily halted borrowing operations to prevent further losses.</p>



<p>The attack on EraLend bears a resemblance to a similar incident that targeted the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol <a href="https://coincu.com/204863-conic-finance-liquidity-pools-not-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Conic Finance</a> the previous week, resulting in a total loss of $3.6 million. It highlights the need for increased security measures within the DeFi space as attackers continue to exploit vulnerabilities in smart contract code.</p>



<p>Despite the setback, EraLend remains committed to enhancing its security infrastructure to protect user funds and bolster the confidence of its community. As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, it is evident that constant vigilance and proactive security measures are essential to safeguarding users&#8217; assets and the overall integrity of decentralized platforms.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Avalanche Foundation allocates $50 million for purchasing tokenized assets on its blockchain, promoting tokenization in sectors like stocks, credit, real estate, and commodities.</em></li>



<li><em>The initiative, called Avalanche Vista, aims to improve liquidity and demonstrate the benefits of blockchain-based asset tokenization, attracting interest from traditional players and fostering blockchain adoption in the financial landscape.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Avalanche Foundation is gearing up to invest up to $50 million in acquiring tokenized assets on its Layer-1 blockchain.&nbsp;</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Avalanche-raises-230-million-from-Private-Sale-of-AVAX-Tokens.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Avalanche-raises-230-million-from-Private-Sale-of-AVAX-Tokens.jpeg" alt="Avalanche Foundation Announces $50 Million Allocation For Tokenized Asset Purchase " class="wp-image-205868" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Avalanche-raises-230-million-from-Private-Sale-of-AVAX-Tokens.jpeg 600w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Avalanche-raises-230-million-from-Private-Sale-of-AVAX-Tokens-300x158.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="Avalanche Foundation Announces $50 Million Allocation For Tokenized Asset Purchase  19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Termed &#8220;Avalanche Vista,&#8221; this initiative seeks to showcase the potential of tokenization across diverse sectors, including stocks, credit, real estate, and commodities. Tokenization involves creating digital representations of real-world assets on a blockchain, providing a faster and more efficient way for companies to issue assets, individuals to own them, and everyone to transfer value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>John Wu, president of Ava Labs, the firm behind <a href="https://coincu.com/201985-oracle-redstone-data-dapps-avalanche-spruce/">Avalanche</a>, highlights the benefits of tokenization in revolutionizing traditional asset ownership and transfer processes. Avalanche has already established its presence in the asset tokenization space, having collaborated with KKR, a prominent U.S. investment management firm, to tokenize a portion of its private equity fund through digital asset securities firm Securitize.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AVAX.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="367" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AVAX.png" alt="Avalanche Foundation Announces $50 Million Allocation For Tokenized Asset Purchase " class="wp-image-205869" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AVAX.png 640w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/AVAX-300x172.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="Avalanche Foundation Announces $50 Million Allocation For Tokenized Asset Purchase  20"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to Wu, through various dealings with conventional market players, the liquidity aspect emerged as a critical challenge. In response, Avalanche aims to address this concern by allocating $50 million to bolster liquidity, aligning with the ongoing pipeline of tokenized assets and the amount required to enhance market liquidity.</p>



<p>Avalanche Vista&#8217;s $50 million investment reflects the foundation&#8217;s confidence in the potential growth and viability of tokenized assets. By showcasing the benefits of blockchain-based asset tokenization, the foundation hopes to attract more interest and participation from companies and individuals alike.</p>



<p>The move comes at a time when the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is witnessing increasing interest from traditional finance sectors. As tokenization gains momentum, more assets from various industries are expected to undergo the process, unlocking new opportunities for investors and creating a more accessible and efficient financial ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Superchain?</h2>



<p>Superchain is a set of project rollups that have been launched on the OP Stack. <a href="https://coincu.com/197566-optimism-rebranded-op-mainnet-superchain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Superchain</a> is planned to provide a decentralized, safe, and dependable scaling platform to let developers build decentralized apps on the Ethereum blockchain. The OP Mainnet will serve as the Superchain&#8217;s foundation layer.</p>



<p>Presently, a few famous names have surfaced in this Superchain ecosystem:</p>



<ul>
<li>Coinbase is employing OP Stack technology to create a new Layer 2 dubbed <a href="https://coincu.com/204074-coinbases-base-optimisms-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Base</a>. The Base project is now in beta (testnet) and has completed half of its trip before going to the mainnet. While no exact date has been set, the project has indicated that the mainnet for Base will be deployed in 2023.</li>



<li>Apart from Base, the NFT marketplace project Zora recently revealed Zora Network, a blockchain network. This Layer 2 will assist Zora marketplace users in enhancing transaction speed and cut gas expenses by using OP Stack technology.</li>
</ul>



<p>The development journey of <a href="https://coincu.com/204801-optimism-to-launch-zkps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Optimism</a> leading to the creation of Superchain has been riddled with numerous challenges and pivotal events that shaped its evolution. From inefficient beginnings to embracing simplicity as a core principle, the Optimism team navigated through obstacles to realize their vision of a robust blockchain platform.</p>



<p>The initial stages of development were focused on creating a Layer 2 solution based on Plasma. However, the team encountered significant setbacks, which ultimately forced them to make a bold switch to the Rollup model. Even with this new approach, the Optimism build process remained an arduous task, demanding immense effort and perseverance from the team.</p>



<p>Amidst these trials, a breakthrough occurred when a talented developer named Geohot joined the ranks. Geohot&#8217;s intervention proved to be a game-changer, as he managed to reduce a colossal 6,000-line codebase that had consumed the Optimism team&#8217;s time and energy for months down to a mere 300 lines within a few short days. This transformative experience led the team to adopt simplicity as a guiding principle for their future endeavors.</p>



<p>In 2021, the team faced another pivotal moment when the Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM) was phased out. This decision presented a formidable challenge, compelling the team to contemplate a modular approach to implementation and proofing. Despite the difficulty, this shift allowed EVM Equivalence to become available on the Optimism network, expanding the platform&#8217;s compatibility and usability.</p>



<p>The path of Optimism has undoubtedly been fraught with obstacles, and the team recognized the need for a comprehensive solution. Hence, the birth of OP Stack marked a significant turning point in their journey, eventually leading to the emergence of Superchain. Built on the lessons learned and the principles of simplicity and efficiency, Superchain aims to propel blockchain technology forward with a renewed sense of purpose.</p>



<p>As Superchain takes its first successful steps towards the future, the challenges faced by the Optimism team have proven to be instrumental in shaping the platform&#8217;s robustness and potential for widespread adoption. With a modular architecture and EVM Equivalence, Superchain is poised to offer a powerful and user-friendly ecosystem for developers and users alike.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1829.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="919" height="761" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1829.png" alt="Optimism Update: Building A Decentralized Superchain Ecosystem With Layer 2 Solutions" class="wp-image-205857" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1829.png 919w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1829-300x248.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1829-768x636.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1829-750x621.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px" title="Optimism Update: Building A Superchain Ecosystem With Layer 2 Solutions 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>At present, the disjointed state of the crypto market poses a significant challenge in onboarding the next generation of users. The Optimism Superchain, however, holds the potential to change this landscape drastically. Acting as a catalyst for Layer 2 chains, advancements in data availability on the main Ethereum network, particularly through EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), play a pivotal role in paving the way for the Superchain&#8217;s success.</p>



<p>EIP-4844 is expected to revolutionize rollup solutions by significantly increasing data availability, resulting in cheaper transactions for end-users. Coinbase engineers&#8217; involvement in the development of EIP-4844 led to a fortuitous collaboration with the Optimism team. As a consequence, Coinbase decided to utilize the OP Stack as the architecture for its own Layer 2 chain, Base. With approximately ninety-eight million users, Base aims to provide an accessible on-ramp into DeFi for Coinbase&#8217;s vast user base.</p>



<p>By adopting the OP Stack, Base achieves a more cohesive foundation, abstracting away technical nuances between chains. Consequently, asset transfers between Optimism and Base become smoother and less risky when compared to transfers between Optimism and other chains like the Binance Smart Chain. The OP Stack acts as an enabler for creating interoperable bridges, connecting Ethereum&#8217;s vast archipelago of chains to the mainland.</p>



<p>To visualize this transformation, one can envision Layer 1 blockchains as isolated and siloed islands surrounded by vast oceans. In contrast, Ethereum and Layer 2 scaling solutions form a rich archipelago of interconnected islands, with the OP Stack allowing the creation of infinite new islands, bridging the gaps between them. This interconnected ecosystem facilitates the seamless movement of assets and users between various platforms.</p>



<p>The implications of the Layer 2 narrative go beyond most people&#8217;s imagination, offering a clear path toward the global adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. As the Superchain concept takes flight, crypto&#8217;s fragmented landscape is set to be unified, providing a streamlined and user-friendly experience for both existing and new crypto enthusiasts. With the Optimism Superchain leading the charge, the future of crypto looks promising, leaving behind the limitations of the past to embrace a more connected and inclusive era of digital finance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">OP Stack &amp; Superchain</h2>



<p>Every Layer 2 chain typically comprises three essential modules: the consensus layer, execution layer, and settlement layer. What sets the OP Stack apart is its ability to generate standardized open-source building blocks for each of these elements, empowering developers to construct distinct Layer 2s that cater to specific needs while promoting code reuse and refinement.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1827.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="638" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1827.png" alt="Optimism Update: Building A Decentralized Superchain Ecosystem With Layer 2 Solutions" class="wp-image-205855" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1827.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1827-300x239.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1827-768x612.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1827-750x598.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Optimism Update: Building A Superchain Ecosystem With Layer 2 Solutions 23"></a></figure></div>


<p>Drawing inspiration from Ethereum&#8217;s successful scaling through modularity, the OP Stack replicates this concept for Layer 2 solutions. With each component becoming a standardized module, developers can now construct new Layer 2 chains akin to assembling Lego pieces, whether for general-purpose or application-specific purposes. This approach not only accelerates the process of building Layer 2s but also enhances the strength of the code through iterative improvements.</p>



<p>By curating an extensive open-source library of code and standardized modules, the OP Stack democratizes the creation of Layer 2 chains, enabling anyone to spin up their own chain effortlessly. This development lays the groundwork for what experts are calling a &#8220;Cambrian explosion&#8221; in the number of chains, sparking a flurry of innovative Layer 2 solutions across the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>



<p>David Hoffman from Bankless draws an intriguing analogy, likening the OP Stack&#8217;s impact to that of the ERC-20 token standard. Just as ERC-20 tokens simplified the creation of fungible tokens on Ethereum, the OP Stack aims to make the process of spinning up a Layer 2 chain as effortless as creating an ERC-20 token, further fueling the proliferation of Layer 2 adoption.</p>



<p>The power of the OP Stack lies in its ability to distill each component of a Layer 2 into a standardized module, making it a plug-and-play solution for entities seeking to build their Layer 2 chains. This flexibility empowers developers to choose from a wide array of available module layers, including alternative Layer 2 solutions beyond Rollup, or opting for different consensus mechanisms like ZKP (Zero-Knowledge Proof) instead of Fault Proof. Moreover, developers can even integrate Layer 1 solutions such as Celestia or leverage the Bitcoin network for the execution layer.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the OP Stack empowers individuals and organizations alike, offering them an easy-to-use set of SDKs to build and customize their Layer 2 platforms on Ethereum. With its Lego-like approach to Layer 2 construction and a vast repository of standardized modules, the OP Stack sets the stage for a new era of scalable, efficient, and diverse Layer 2 solutions, propelling Ethereum&#8217;s ecosystem towards unprecedented growth and innovation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Interaction between Op-chains in Superchain</h2>



<p>According to Optimism&#8217;s vision, the ultimate goal is not merely to construct a single blockchain but to foster a comprehensive Digital Society that thrives on seamless and efficient interaction between different Op-chains. This interconnectedness opens up a world of possibilities for projects and developers within the Optimism ecosystem.</p>



<p>A key feature of Op-chains is their capability to communicate and interact with one another. This inter-chain communication forms the bedrock for establishing an omnichain system that facilitates smooth cross-chain transactions. By enabling Op-chains to message and collaborate, Optimism lays the groundwork for the future of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>The foundational element enabling this interoperability is the OP Stack, which offers a high degree of flexibility in passing the Sequencer—a crucial component in the transaction verification process. However, to further expedite and streamline cross-chain interactions, Optimism encourages Op-chains to share the same Sequencer Set. This shared approach significantly reduces transaction times and minimizes potential risks.</p>

<p>In a bid to promote collaborative innovation, projects within the Optimism Collective can now register to utilize the Set Sequencer, further reinforcing the vision of a united Superchain. This shared resource pool empowers projects to pool their resources and enhance their operational capabilities collectively.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that projects adopting the common Set Sequencer are considered part of the growing Superchain community. The Superchain represents a major milestone in the platform&#8217;s development journey and is expected to become more decentralized as the foundational Bedrock infrastructure reaches its full potential.</p>



<p>With the Op-chains and Superchain technologies taking center stage, Optimism&#8217;s vision of a Digital Society is closer to becoming a reality. By fostering an environment of interconnectedness and collaboration, the platform aims to revolutionize the blockchain landscape and unlock the true potential of decentralized applications and services.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>The Superchain ecosystem aims to decentralize further, with the transition to becoming fully decentralized happening after the success of Bedrock, which is expected to occur on June 7, 2023. As of now, it&#8217;s difficult to predict the exact future of Superchain, but with OP Labs&#8217; proven experience, there is a level of trust in their capabilities. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that the Bedrock release faced a delay of one year compared to the original expectations.</p>



<p>Base is the first blockchain to participate in the Superchain, but it seems like there is a discussion about whether the benefits it brings should be limited to the Base project only or shared with the entire Optimism Collective. Sharing revenue from transaction fees is seen as a positive concept.</p>



<p>It appears that the current situation requires more time to observe OP Labs&#8217; operations, development, and overall performance before making a more thorough assessment of the Superchain ecosystem. This approach allows for a more informed judgment of the project&#8217;s progress and potential future implications.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The advent of LSDFi has stirred a frenzy among blockchain enthusiasts as it introduces exciting new possibilities to the DeFi space. As a result, various parties are now vying for dominance over vePENDLE, a sought-after asset within the Pendle ecosystem. The battle lines are drawn, and PenPie, Equilibria, and Stake DAO have emerged as the main contenders in this epic conflict.</strong></h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>As the conflict intensifies, all eyes turn to two main players, PenPie and Equilibria, due to Stake DAO&#8217;s limited traction in the vePENDLE arena. In this article, <a href="https://twitter.com/Coincuofficial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coincu</a> delves into the current situation of the Pendle War.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824.png" alt="Pendle War Intensify: PenPie And Equilibria Battle for Yield Farming Supremacy" class="wp-image-205847" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1824-750x393.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Pendle War Intensify: PenPie And Equilibria Battle for Yield Farming Supremacy 25"></a></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Causes of Pendle War</h2>



<p>With its unique features and tools, <a href="https://coincu.com/200584-pendle-opens-up-new-growth-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pendle</a> empowers users to maximize interest rates, increase yields during bull markets, and offer hedging plans during bear markets.</p>



<p>At its core, Pendle utilizes three main tools to achieve its objectives. First is the concept of yield tokenization, which involves creating encrypted versions of tokens that yield on the Pendle platform. These yield tokens (PT and YT) are crucial for participating in Pendle&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>



<p>The second tool is Pendle&#8217;s Automated Market Maker (AMM), allowing users to trade the PT and YT yield tokens, enabling them to capitalize on fluctuating yields in response to token price movements and other market factors.</p>



<p>The third tool is governance, where Pendle leverages vePendle for project administration. This mechanism incentivizes projects to accumulate and acquire vePENDLE, sparking a governance battle within the DeFi market, known as Pendle War.</p>



<p>Pendle War revolves around projects competing for vePENDLE and attempting to attract holders from the parent project to their own child projects. The allure lies in the possibility of acquiring a substantial amount of veTokens, which confers greater power in directing incentives, rewards, and emission flows into the pools for their benefit.</p>



<p>The ongoing Pendle War currently features a heated competition between two major projects, Equilibria (ePENDLE) and Penpie (mPENDLE), with others such as Stake DAO and Swell Network also joining the fray. As more projects are expected to participate in the near future, users stand to benefit from the optimized yield sources created by these subprojects.</p>



<p>The success of Pendle is evident in the continuous inflow of funds, propelling its Total Value Locked (TVL) to new all-time highs. According to Defilama, Pendle&#8217;s TVL has surged nearly tenfold since the beginning of the year, growing from $15 million to an impressive $150 million.</p>



<p>In addition to the TVL growth, the native token PENDLE has experienced significant price appreciation despite the overall market being in a downtrend. The token&#8217;s value surged from $0.04 to approximately $1, marking an impressive 25-fold increase in the second half of 2023. Furthermore, Pendle&#8217;s listing on Binance on July 3 has attracted additional attention and interest from the market.</p>



<p>Another factor fueling Pendle&#8217;s growth is its association with the booming LSDFi (Leveraged Staking DeFi) array. As LSDFi&#8217;s TVL continues to climb, Pendle&#8217;s prominence within this segment also rises. Reports from reputable organizations like Binance Research have contributed to a surge in community attention towards LSDFi and Pendle.</p>



<p>Pendle has created a new market in the Crypto market that is DeFi Yield &#8211; Trading Protocol. With Pendle, users can build strategies to generate profits from their own future profits. Currently, the assets that Pendle is aiming for are LST (Liquid Staking Token), such as sfxrETH, stETH. It can be said that up to the present time, Pendle is doing one of the platforms leading the recent LSDfi trend.</p>



<p>Pendle&#8217;s veToken model has some of the following characteristics:</p>



<ul>
<li>vePENDLE will be locked for a maximum of 2 years the value of vePENDLE will gradually decrease within 2 years.</li>



<li>Voters use vePENDLE to boost yield from LPs and share revenue with the protocol.</li>



<li>Participating in voter voting will receive additional incentives &amp; transaction fees from voting pools.</li>
</ul>



<p>It can be seen that the model of vePENDLE has many similarities with the model of veCRV. The key point here is that Pendle must have a large revenue stream, which is currently being shown when <a href="https://defillama.com/top-protocols" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TVL</a> and volume on Pendle are still growing very well.</p>



<p>This has opened up a real war that is Pendle War. In this war, two names are competing fiercely, which are Penpie and Equilibria. Now we&#8217;ll take a closer look at this war to see who is benefiting and which project&#8217;s strategy will help them win the Pendle War.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Overview of Pendle War</h2>



<p>PenPie and Equilibria, are currently engaged in a heated battle for dominance in the <a href="https://dune.com/coumarin/pendle-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pendle War</a>. The focus lies on their vePENDLE holdings, with both projects accounting for a substantial amount of this coveted asset, while Stake DAO trails behind with a mere 2.99 percent share.</p>

<p>VePENDLE, an essential asset for yield optimization, serves as the battleground for PenPie and Equilibria, and understanding their respective approaches is crucial.</p>



<ul>
<li>PenPie, a robust Yield Farming platform, is deployed on both Ethereum and Arbitrum chains. The vePENDLE amount on PenPie is calculated by combining holdings on both chains, offering users the potential for higher rewards.</li>



<li>On the other hand, Equilibria also operates on two chains but solely calculates its vePENDLE amount on Ethereum. Although it provides a Yield Farming solution for vePENDLE holders, it lacks the cumulative approach offered by PenPie.</li>
</ul>



<p>A Brief Introduction to PenPie and Equilibria:</p>



<ul>
<li>PenPie, designed by the Magpie team, aims to maximize profits for PENDLE holders. It leverages the expertise gained from the successful Wombat Wars project on both BNB Chain and Arbitrum.</li>



<li>Equilibria, on the other hand, provides a platform for PENDLE holders to profit from vePENDLE without the concern of locked assets in the protocol.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Battle Factors</strong></h3>



<p>In this Pendle War clash, several factors will determine the ultimate victor:</p>



<ul>
<li>APR from PENDLE deposits: PenPie holds a clear advantage in terms of profitability metrics for PENDLE depositors into the protocol. Its higher APR attracts users seeking greater returns.</li>



<li>Peg holding during AMM switches: The ability to maintain the peg when users switch back to PENDLE on the AMM is a crucial factor. Both platforms will be evaluated based on their efficiency in this regard.</li>



<li>Native tokens for Liquidity Mining: The availability of remaining Native Tokens to use for Liquidity Mining will play a significant role in attracting users and Total Value Locked (TVL).</li>



<li>Team Experience: The development teams&#8217; experience in similar battles will be a determinant in ensuring a robust and reliable platform.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Current Status</strong></h3>



<p>As of now, both platforms hold a comparable amount of vePENDLE. PenPie, apart from its substantial vePENDLE holdings, has also established itself as a successful project on Camelot, the premier Launchpad platform on the Arbitrum ecosystem. Its token price has experienced a fivefold increase compared to the initial IDO price, adding to its allure for users.</p>



<p>Equilibria, while offering a slightly better option for compounding Pendle profits, faces stiff competition from PenPie. Both platforms have recently launched their native tokens, creating incentives to attract users, with TVL levels remaining on par.</p>
