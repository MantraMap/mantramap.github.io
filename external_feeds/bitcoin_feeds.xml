<h2>Spacex Writes Down $373M in Bitcoin Value</h2>
<p>On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk&#x2019;s Spacex has written down its bitcoin investments, citing documents it has seen. The news outlet wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spacex wrote down the value of bitcoin it owns by a total of $373 million last year and in 2021 and has sold the cryptocurrency. Tesla has taken a similar approach with its bitcoin holdings. Musk has posted about cryptocurrencies frequently over the years.</p></blockquote>
<p>This led to numerous headlines claiming that Spacex had liquidated its entire bitcoin holdings, sending the price of bitcoin tumbling.</p>
<p>However, many people took to social media to point out that writing down investments is a standard accounting practice for businesses and does not imply that the investments have been sold or liquidated. For example, a company might write down the value of its inventory if its market value has declined, yet retain the inventory until it is no longer needed.</p>
<h2>Tesla and Spacex Adopt Similar Bitcoin Approach</h2>
<p>Although Elon Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-spacex-owns-bitcoin-personally-owns-btc-ethereum-dogecoin-pump-dont-dump/">revealed</a> in July 2021 that Spacex owned bitcoin, the details of the company&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> holdings remain largely undisclosed. In contrast, there is greater transparency regarding Tesla&#x2019;s bitcoin position. According to the Wall Street Journal, both companies have adopted a similar approach to their bitcoin holdings.</p>

<p>During the first quarter of 2021, Tesla purchased bitcoin valued at $1.5 billion. The company subsequently trimmed its <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> stash twice: once also in Q1 2021 and the other instance in July last year &#x2014; the same years Spacex reportedly wrote down its bitcoin holdings.</p>
<p>In Q1 2021, Tesla <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-owns-bitcoin-has-not-sold-any-tesla-hold-btc-long-term-sold-to-prove-liquidity/">sold</a> $272 million in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Musk clarified that the sale was &#x201C;to prove liquidity of bitcoin as an alternative to holding cash on balance sheet.&#x201D; In July last year, the company <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-sold-75-of-its-bitcoin-elon-musk-says-we-have-not-sold-any-of-our-dogecoin/">sold</a> approximately 75% of its bitcoin, which added $936 million in cash to its balance sheet. Musk explained that the company needed to &#x201C;maximize&#x201D; its cash position due to &#x201C;the uncertainty of the Covid lockdowns in China.&#x201D; The billionaire stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in the future, so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the two <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> sales, Tesla still owns bitcoin valued at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/teslas-bitcoin-portfolio-remains-unchanged-at-184m-for-third-straight-quarter-q2-2023-report/">$184 million</a>, as disclosed in the company&#x2019;s Q2 financials.</p>

The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) and its campus will subsidize 90% of the costs of these licenses to attract companies in this sector as part of its push to become a worldwide tech hub.</strong></p>
<h2>Dubai to Offer Subsidies for Web3 and AI Companies</h2>
<p>The Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) announced the issuance of special commercial licenses for Web3 and artificial intelligence (AI) companies wanting to set up operations in the emirate. 90% of the cost of each license will be subsidized to help companies in their initial stages.</p>
<p>The licenses offered will allow the companies to access physical offices and co-working spaces in the Innovation One building, according to a press release issued by the DIFC.</p>
<p>The UAE Ministry of Economy details that the DIFC <a href="https://www.moec.gov.ae/en/-/dubai-international-financial-centre?p_l_back_url=%2Fen%2Ffree-zones%3Fstart%3D2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a> more than 25,000 professionals working at more than 2,000 active registered companies, as one of the biggest financial centers for the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. With this move, the DIFC hopes to become a significant hub in the industry, advancing and supporting Dubai&#8217;s leadership in Web3 and AI technology.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Tech Hub</h2>
<p>Only companies looking to develop activities in areas such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) services, specialized AI research &amp; consultancies, IT infrastructure building, technology research and development, and public networking services will be able to take advantage of these license subsidies.</p>
<p>Mohammad Alblooshi, CEO of the DIFC Innovation Hub, detailed that he was optimistic about attracting innovation to the center with this move. He <a href="https://www.difc.ae/newsroom/news/dubai-ai-and-web-30-campus-introduces-specialised-licensing-solutions-tech-firms-looking-scale-their-business-region/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are confident that by granting these licenses, we will attract more global talent and investment to the region and create a culture of collaboration and innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Alblooshi qualified this move as a milestone for the center to &#8220;strengthen Dubai&#8217;s position as the business destination of choice for technology-focused companies and attract more world-class talent and diversified investors to the region.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dubai has shown its interest in Web3 and other new technologies previously. In March, the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC), another free zone in the emirate, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dubai-free-trade-zone-partners-with-south-korean-companies-to-expand-web3-and-metaverse-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a series of agreements with Korean Web3 and metaverse companies to bring their activities to the country and expand Dubai&#8217;s business in the Web3 industry.</p>

A Dappradar study reveals that trading actions and sales figures for Bitcoin Ordinals have plummeted by a staggering 97% since their May 2023 zenith. This downturn mirrors a wider slowdown in the NFT sector. However, the slump in Bitcoin Ordinals is far more pronounced than in established networks such as Ethereum.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin NFTs Face Crossroads: Ordinal Sales Decline Highlights Market Volatility and the Quest for Tangible Utility</h2>
<p>After soaring to record levels this spring, the nascent market for Bitcoin-centric NFTs has hit a snag. By June and July, Bitcoin Ordinals reported a sharp drop in both sales and transactions, diving 97% and 98% from their May pinnacle. Dappradar&#8217;s <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/ordinals-sales-down-97-since-may-are-bitcoin-nfts-over">analysis</a> indicates that Ordinals trading dwindled from $452 million in May to a mere $3 million in early August.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also been a sharp downturn in active participants in the Bitcoin NFT arena. The number of unique active Bitcoin wallet addresses plunged 90% from February to mid-August, dwindling from 79,261 to a scant 6,708. While Ethereum and Polygon have witnessed declines in active traders, their 22% and 60% reductions during the same timeframe seem trivial compared to Bitcoin&#8217;s dramatic downturn.</p>
<p>Dappradar posits that this retraction may signal waning excitement and trust in Bitcoin NFTs&#8217; prospects. Unlike their counterparts in Ethereum and Polygon, Bitcoin&#8217;s NFT sphere is predominantly dominated by profile picture collections, which generally offer limited utility. Given the broader and more varied offerings of Ethereum and Polygon, Bitcoin&#8217;s narrow NFT specialization might be accelerating its descent.</p>
<p>“As you can see using <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/nft/collections/chain/bitcoin?range=all">Dappradar’s NFT Collection Ranking</a>, most of the collections on Bitcoin are still in the early stages and still lack the innovation that the NFT space is experiencing – regarding interoperability, dynamism, and utility,&#8221; the report states.</p>
<p>Dappradar’s report says the coming months are set to be defining moments for Bitcoin NFTs. It further notes how there&#8217;s a debate within the community: some advocate for Bitcoin to maintain its &#8220;digital gold&#8221; persona, suggesting Ethereum plays the &#8220;digital oil&#8221; role, powering Web3 innovations.</p>
<p>The waning activity in Ordinals trading suggests that the Bitcoin community might not be as enthusiastic about NFTs as initially thought. However, Dapprader notes that it may be premature to dismiss Bitcoin&#8217;s potential role in the dynamic NFT arena.</p>
<p>The researchers further conclude by saying the meteoric rise and subsequent fall of Bitcoin Ordinals spotlight the capricious nature of the NFT market. For those enticed to ride the wave of the newest trend, the dip in Ordinals serves as a stark reminder of how fleeting speculative excitement can be.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin NFTs harbor great theoretical potential, sheer hype might not be enough to keep market frenzies alive. Dappradar researchers suggest to ensure the Ordinals setback is viewed as a lesson rather than a terminal blow, it&#8217;s imperative for developers to zero in on fostering tangible utility, enabling Bitcoin NFTs to truly realize their promise.</p>

The coin’s latest 13% tumble mirrored a decline in the broader crypto market in the last 24 hours. </strong></p>
<h2>New L1 Token Plummets 65% From Record High</h2>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.sei.io/">SEI</a>, the latest entrant in the L1 blockchain realm tailored for trading. By Friday, this newly launched token hovered between <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sei">$0.15 and $0.184 apiece</a>. Touted by the team as one of the swiftest L1 networks, SEI claims a transaction finality of a mere half-second, processing 20,000 orders per second.</p>
<p>SEI&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.sei.io/learn/about-sei">documentation</a> highlights its distinctive &#8220;Twin-turbo consensus&#8221;, designed for optimal efficiency. Developers note that SEI is among the few chains that adopt market-based parallelization. Moreover, SEI&#8217;s network offers an in-built exchange matching engine and protection against frontrunning, addressing common vulnerabilities in rival ecosystems. So far, however, SEI&#8217;s market performance has been lackluster.</p>
<p>Although SEI has been in the trading game for a scant three days, it&#8217;s already plunged 65.71% from its record high on August 16, 2023. Touching $0.15 on Friday marked its lowest valuation yet. With a market cap hovering around $279.51 million, SEI occupies the 115th slot among over 10,000 crypto assets, joining the ranks of other hyped L1 debuts like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/following-apts-400-rise-since-late-december-aptos-drops-20-from-all-time-high/">aptos</a> (APT) and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sui">sui (SUI)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aptos">APT</a>, holding the 38th rank among the 10,000+ coins, has descended 71.07% from its zenith on January 26, 2023. Yet, it rose 87.13% from its lowest point on December 29, 2022. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sui">SUI</a>, another newly launched L1 contender, has fallen 78.10% from its top price reached on May 03, 2023, hitting its lowest value on August 17, 2023.</p>

The stablecoin market now stands at $124 billion, following notable reductions across several projects. Yet, stablecoins still dominate in terms of global trade volume, accounting for 61% of all settled trades in the past day.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Top 10 Stablecoin Supplies Drop Lower in 30 Days; FDUSD&#x2019;s Supply Jumps 23% Higher</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Each of the ten premier stablecoins by market value has observed a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">decrease in supply</a>. Notably, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) experienced a 1.3% dip in its circulation over the recent month. USDC&#x2019;s supply has diminished by 3%, and Makerdao&#x2019;s DAI took a 7.6% hit.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Paxos-backed BUSD now hovers slightly above 3 billion, shedding 15.7% of its circulating supply since the same period last month. Meanwhile, trueusd (TUSD) and Frax&#x2019;s FRAX supply lessened by 1% and a whopping 19.8%, respectively.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Both USDD and USDP underwent reductions ranging from 1.2% to 10.1%. Concurrently, gemini dollar (GUSD) saw a sharp 36% drop this month, while liquity usd (LUSD) decreased by 1.4% in a month.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In contrast, the freshly introduced stablecoin, FDUSD, has expanded its supply significantly. On August 3, 2023, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gho-and-fdusd-stablecoins-see-massive-supply-growth-in-recent-debut/">highlighted</a> FDUSD&#x2019;s supply at 232 million, and now it&#x2019;s around <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xc5f0f7b66764F6ec8C8Dff7BA683102295E16409">287 million</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This indicates that in the last 15 days, FDUSD&#x2019;s supply surged by 23.7%, even as most of the top ten stablecoins faced significant withdrawals. Binance wallets <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xc5f0f7b66764F6ec8C8Dff7BA683102295E16409#balances">predominantly</a> hold FDUSD&#x2019;s supply, with only 26 distinct holders as of August 18, 2023.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
With 61% of today&#x2019;s trades associated with stablecoins, the total value reaches $74.26 billion at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on this Friday. Out of this, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) represents a staggering $52.73 billion, translating to 71% of the global stablecoin trade volume for the day.&#13;<br />

Today&#x2019;s sell-off saw the global market cap fall by roughly 6.20%, at the time of writing. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> also fell significantly.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>) fell by as much as 15% on Friday, as a red wave washed over the cryptocurrency market.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD fell to a low of $61.76 late on Thursday, which came following a high of $74.73 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This decline pushed <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a> to its lowest point since December 19, when price traded to a low of $61.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this sell-off, the relative strength index (RSI) fell below the 30.00 level, which means price is oversold.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 18.21, which is its weakest point since November 2018.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The price has since moved away from earlier lows, and is currently trading at $64.80.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Additionally, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, also had significant declines on Friday, falling to a multi-month low of its own.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After climbing to a high of $0.5852 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $0.4681 later in the session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> dive to its weakest point since May 16, when the price traded around the $0.4300 region.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This drop saw the token marginally break out of a key support point at $0.4600, wiping out all gains accrued following the ripple ruling.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Like with bitcoin above, price strength is now oversold, which prompted bulls to reenter, pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> slightly higher.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the token is trading at $0.5087.&#13;<br />

One insider privy to the development indicated that a handful could secure approval come October.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Unnamed Sources Reveal SEC May Soon Greenlight Ethereum Futures Products</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In recent weeks, a consortium of firms, including Valkyrie, Roundhill, Proshares, Grayscale, Vaneck, Volatility Shares, and Bitwise, have submitted applications to roll out ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>)-based futures products. A Thursday <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/sec-said-to-be-poised-to-allow-us-debut-of-ether-futures-etfs-eth#xj4y7vzkg">report</a> by Bloomberg&#x2019;s Vildana Hajric and Allyson Versprille reveals the SEC&#x2019;s likely inclination towards not obstructing ETH-based futures. This intel comes from individuals &#x201C;familiar with the matter,&#x201D; preferring anonymity.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
While these insiders remained tight-lipped about potential approvals, there&#x2019;s buzzing speculation that green lights might emerge in October. This anticipated move has been warmly received by <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> aficionados, who see it as a boon for the crypto world&#x2019;s runner-up. Ethereum advocate Adam Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1692322452586553714?s=20">opined</a> that the implications of such news on <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> futures ETFs could be &#x201C;bigger than first meets the eye.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1692322454461350006?s=20">argued</a>, &#x201C;The SEC cannot really both simultaneously argue that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> is some new intrinsic &#x2018;crypto asset security&#x2019; that is unregistered, and approve an <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> Futures ETF. You couldn&#x2019;t have a futures ETF made out of an unregistered security. You must accept the state that it is a commodity or a currency for this to be the case, and revert to only attacking the transactional matter of it under Howey.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
However, Thursday wasn&#x2019;t all rosy for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>. The cryptocurrency took a hit after Bitcoin&#x2019;s abrupt <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-dips-below-26k-in-crypto-market-whirlwind-1-billion-liquidated-amid-top-coins-tumble/">plunge below the $26K mark</a>. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> diminished by 6% vis-&#xE0;-vis the U.S. dollar in 24 hours and 9% over the week. After touching a Thursday low of $1,576 per token, Friday witnessed a slight bounce-back, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> trading at $1,681 each. Currently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>&#x2019;s footprint in the crypto sphere, valued just north of $1 trillion, stands at 18.3%, translating to a market cap nearing $201 billion.&#13;<br />

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) bears pushed the cryptocurrency to a two-month low on Friday, following news that Spacex had liquidated all of its holdings <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
After peaking at $28,525.11 during Thursday&#x2019;s session, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD plunged to a bottom at $25,409.11 late last night.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This was the weakest point that bitcoin had fallen to since June 16, when price was near a breakout below $25,000.&#13;</p>

&#13;<br />
From the chart, it appears that the sell-off came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) fell deep into oversold territory.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is now tracking at 20.10, which is the lowest level it has hit since January 2022, which ironically was when Tesla began to sell off its own holdings in bitcoin.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Price has somewhat rebounded from earlier lows, and is now trading at $26,341.67.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to bitcoin, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved significantly lower following the news, slipping below $1,600 in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,551.71 on Friday, down nearly $200.00 from Thursday&#x2019;s peak.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This is the weakest reading for ethereum since March 12, when price was trading below the $1,459 level.&#13;</p>

Like with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> above, today&#x2019;s sell-off has moved the RSI into a bear zone, with a current reading of 21.30.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This could work in the favor of bulls looking to buy the dip, and to a degree already has, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> now trading at $1,678.05.&#13;<br />

<h2>Crypto Growth and Financial Innovation</h2>
<p>Kenya’s Financial Reporting Centre (FRC) has asked residents of East Africa’s largest economy to participate in its ongoing public survey on virtual assets and virtual assets service providers (VASPs). FRC, a statutory body established under Kenya’s anti-money laundering law, says the anonymously shared feedback is expected to help authorities better understand the country’s crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>In a statement left on its website, the anti-money laundering body acknowledges the rapid growth of the ecosystem as well as the space’s potential ability &#8220;to spur financial innovations and efficiency.&#8221; The organization however argued that the crypto market’s rapid growth can also present opportunities for illicit activities like money laundering and terrorism financing.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to protect the Kenya financial system and consumers, the FRC said it wants Kenyans to share their thoughts via the survey. The body added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your feedback will play a vital role in shaping the future of the virtual assets ecosystem and promoting a safer and more transparent financial system. The FRC appreciates your participation and looks forward to receiving your input by 8 September 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the FRC, prospective survey participants can share their thoughts via the six-page <a href="https://forms.microsoft.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=DRf3Qldrx0ORtwrtZMOBubX2_Z90wWJIk8yPH9fNj41URDJWUlNBTkZTQ1RXUEpVVDVMUjZRSDBLWS4u">form</a> on its website. As claimed on the form, the information gathered during the survey period &#8220;will only be used to help drive policy decisions with regard to the crypto industry in Kenya.&#8221;</p>

The company stated that one of the factors that affected this decision was the level of community interest in these projects, declaring that maintaining support for projects without traction was &#x201C;inefficient and may jeopardize security and oversight.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Tether to Withdraw Support for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> Issued on Top of Omni, Kusama, and Bitcoin Cash</h2>&#13;
<p>Tether, the company behind the issuance of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>, the largest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency market, has <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a &#x201C;strategic transition,&#x201D; discontinuing support for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> tokens issued on top of Bitcoin-based protocol Omni, Kusama, the Bitcoin Cash-based Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP).</p>&#13;
<p>In a press release, Tether explained these actions are directed to maintain &#x201C;a robust blockchain ecosystem for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>&#x201D; and derived from an evaluation of &#x201C;the effort required, encompassing security, customer support, compliance, and regulatory oversight, to ensure the security, usability, and sustainability&#x201D; of maintaining <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on each one of the networks where it is available.</p>&#13;
<p>The company detailed that users will not be able to mint <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on these chains starting August 17. Tether will support redemptions of tokens issued on these networks for the next 12 months, with independent exchange channels also operating.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Focused on Bitcoin</h2>&#13;
<p>Tether lamented the situation of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on the Omni protocol, given that it was the first transport layer that the token leveraged when it was launched back in 2014. The company acknowledged that Omni languished after the arrival of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tron-partners-with-tether-to-launch-trc20-based-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new</a> transport layers, which were favored by many exchanges in the cryptocurrency space.</p>&#13;
<p>However, the company declared it still had hope in the potential of Omni, saying that the &#x201C;increased utilization of the Omni layer&#x2019;s decentralized exchange and its token issuance protocol (including NFTs) would allow us to reconsider issuing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on Bitcoin via Omni.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Nonetheless, the company reinforced its support and belief in Bitcoin, stating that it was &#x201C;the most secure, audited, and decentralized blockchain ever built.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>In this regard, the company revealed that it was developing RGB, a smart contracts system that would function on top of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Tether also announced the release of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on this platform, stating that &#x201C;once <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on RGB goes live, the world will witness <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> on another super-powerful and scalable Bitcoin layer.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p><em><strong>What do you think about Tether dropping support for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> issuance on some chains? Tell us in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>&#13;
