<p class="s8">The Musiverse team is pleased to announce to the crypto community that it has launched its project with a focus on bridging the gap between the music industry and Web3. Musiverse NFT's mission is to build a sustainable, decentralized ecosystem based on common interests to connect the two markets.</p>
<p class="s8">The project is kicking off with a bang on 14 December launching its 5000-unit Genesis NFT Collection on the Ethereum network, with a strong focus on real-life utility: the NFT Collection gives its owners lifetime VIP access to a series of music and Web3 events worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s8">And it is just the beginning; the Music Tokenization Marketplace and DAO Token, launching in 2023, will enable musicians, music fans and Web3 enthusiasts to benefit together in a decentralised system of shared interests.</p>
<p class="s8">But what is Musiverse and how does it plan to connect the music industry with web3?</p>
<p class="s8">Barnab&aacute;s S&aacute;ra, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Musiverse NFT says:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s8">&ldquo;We believe that Web3 is not only a technological and financial revolution, but a social one as well. We follow the rule of thinking global - acting local. Our mission is to educate, to form community and to open the gate of Web3 to the music industry. We know that both markets are suffering from serious problems and we realised the opportunity of solving them by introducing the 2 to each other. The mass adoption of crypto assets will only come when traditional markets start to integrate them to their business models.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s8">Musiverse launched its international event series this year, positioning it all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">Events include private NFT parties for holders only, community meet-ups with partners, open-to-public parties and music concerts, as well as conferences and festivals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">While the project is still in its early stages, it has already gained traction within the music and Web3 communities, which shows the potential to become a major player in the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">Musiverse's wide-ranging events have been highly attended in New York and Hungary with a Web3 Conference and NTF Parties, as well as a Web3 meet-up in Amsterdam in collaboration with Polkadot &amp; W3b Lab.</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s8">M&aacute;ri&oacute; V&aacute;nyi, co-founder &amp; CEO, says of the upcoming NFT collection:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">&ldquo;The NFT collection is called 'Keys to the Musiverse'. The collection consists of unique 3D Keys whose main uses include free entry to any concert, party, community event or conference organised by us, our musicians or our partners. The Key NFTs will provide more &amp; more social, artistic and financial utilities to the holders, being gradually unlocked as the ecosystem expands &amp; evolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="s8">The project further aims to raise the general awareness about what Web3 really means and realise mass adoption of the Web3-music market in the future. The current innovations are steps towards a longer-term plan that includes the gradual transformation into a DAO with the aforementioned community-governeddecentralised musical NFT marketplace and music tokenisation in its most sustainable forms.</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s5">The project has a strong vision and big plans, but it is also focused on delivering real-world value from the very beginning. This focus makes Musiverse unique and provides a great opportunity for those who are interested in the potential of Web3.</p>
