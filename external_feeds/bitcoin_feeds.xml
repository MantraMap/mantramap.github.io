The biggest fall came versus the British pound, with USD/GBP hitting a 15-month low. Bitcoin also rose higher, climbing past $31,000 earlier in the day. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved back above the $31,000 level in today&#x2019;s session, as the U.S. dollar weakened across the board.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to an intraday peak of $31,026.08 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes after dropping to a low of $30,156.54 on Monday.</p>
<p>Price has since slipped, dropping as volatility in the market remains high ahead of tomorrow&#x2019;s inflation report from the United States.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the decline came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to jump past a ceiling at 61.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, price strength is tracking at 58.96, with the next visible point of support at 55.00.</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) moving average has edged even closer to its 25-day (blue) counterpart, increasing the chances of a downturn.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) briefly rose over the $1,900 zone in today&#x2019;s session, after nearly falling below $1,800 in recent days.</p>
<p>After hitting a low of $1,860.62 to start the week, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD rallied to a high of $1,905.46 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>However, like bitcoin, ethereum has since shifted lower, as the cryptocurrency consolidated for a fifth straight session.</p>

<p>As of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> is trading at $1,870.15, with the RSI at a reading of 50.43, which is marginally below a ceiling at 51.00.</p>
<p>In the event the index is able to rise above the 51.00 zone, there is a strong possibility that ethereum will be back over $1,900.</p>

The capital raise came shortly after Masroofi&#8217;s co-founders reportedly rejected a funding offer from investors in the &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221; program. </strong></p>
<h2>Investors Drawn by Fintech Startup&#8217;s Focus on Children</h2>
<p>Masroofi, the Egyptian fintech focused on electronic payment services for children, recently raised $1.5 million via an investment funding round. The raised capital is expected to fund the fintech startup’s operational and expansion activities. According to a report, Masroofi was able to raise $1.5 million after the company’s directors reportedly rejected funding from investors in the &#8220;Shark Tank&#8221; program.</p>
<p>As explained in the African Heroes <a href="https://afrikanheroes.com/2023/07/05/egyptian-fintech-startup-masroofi-secures-1-5m-for-innovative-childrens-electronic-payment-services/">report</a>, the unnamed participants in Masroofi’s investment round were drawn by the fintech’s focus on the 20 million Egyptian youth aged between five and 20. The track records as well as the rapport between the fintech startups’ co-founders are the other factors that had a positive influence on investors.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the report revealed that Masroofi is hoping to reach two million young people within five years. The fintech is also reportedly aiming to grow with its young customers by catering for their evolving needs through the provision of product offerings such as neo banking services.</p>
<p>While the co-founders Mostafa Abdel-Khabeer and Sayed Hosni are said to be confident of the fintech sector’s capacity to continue leading Egypt’s startup market, the Africa Heroes report suggested that there is still room for improvement. The report identified Egypt’s remittances and installment payments market as areas which can be bolstered by emerging financial technologies.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unidef&#8217;s mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to a </span><a href="https://unidef.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">decentralized future</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that empowers all to take full control of their finances, identity, and data. Moreover, Unidef advocates for an ethical crypto industry and recognizes its social responsibility to extend support to those globally affected by crypto companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the recent bankruptcy filings of crypto firms, Unidef has taken the lead in launching an initiative to safeguard the interests of the affected clients. This initiative aims to aid clients in reclaiming their assets and guiding them through the process of claiming damages resulting from account deactivation or asset denial by the crypto companies. It specifically addresses those creditors whose accounts have been deactivated since 2017.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/AzimGhader"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azim Ghader</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Global CEO of Unidef, shared his personal experience:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I had a notably challenging experience with one centralized crypto-exchange company as they disabled my account without clarification. As a result, the value of my assets, once exceeding 50 Million USD, plummeted to below 300K USD. It&#8217;s astonishing that when regulatory bodies like the OFAC, FinCen or SEC target these types of centralized exchanges, many in the crypto community still support them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unidef is aware that many users have been denied refunds by one or more crypto-exchange companies and their officers, and this initiative aims to rectify this situation. By doing so, Unidef hopes to protect the welfare of the crypto community and reinforce the transformative potential of decentralized assets and crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As part of the initiative, </span><a href="https://unidef.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unidef</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will offer guidance on the process of filing for damages and recovering assets. Unidef believes that decentralized assets and cryptocurrencies will fundamentally redefine the financial system, the Internet, and monetary structure, ensuring everyone&#8217;s ability to control their finances, data, and identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Azim Ghader </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emphasizes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, &#8220;We need to unite and support those impacted by these centralized entities&#8217; actions. It&#8217;s not just about asset recovery or damages, but a strong stand for the decentralized future we advocate for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unidef&#8217;s mission is to accelerate the world&#8217;s transition to a decentralized future, empowering individuals to take complete control of their finances, identity, and data. As we have observed, centralized platforms can freeze accounts, leading to significant losses due to the volatile nature of crypto assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We eagerly anticipate sharing further developments and enhancements in this endeavor, as Unidef continues to defend the rights and interests of those affected by such malpractices. This initiative is a significant stride towards ensuring a fair and ethical crypto industry, and we are honored to be at the forefront of this crucial effort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">​</span><b>Call to Action</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those affected or for anyone with evidence of damage caused by centralized platforms or its operators, please reach out to us at </span><a href="mailto:nova@unidef.org"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nova@unidef.org</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

The bank&#x2019;s head of crypto research now expects bitcoin to reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 the following year. &#x201C;Increased miner profitability per bitcoin mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply and pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices higher,&#x201D; the analyst explained.</strong></p>
<h2>Standard Chartered Boosts Bitcoin Price Prediction</h2>
<p>Geoff Kendrick, head of Standard Chartered&#x2019;s crypto research team and emerging markets FX (West), has raised his bitcoin price prediction. Standard Chartered is a banking corporation with global headquarters in London, England. Operating in more than 57 markets worldwide, the bank&#x2019;s total assets at the end of 1Q 2023 amounted to $821 billion.</p>
<p>Kendrick stated in April that crypto winter had ended, predicting at the time that bitcoin&#x2019;s price could reach <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-bank-crypto-winter-is-over-bitcoin-could-reach-100k-next-year/">$100K</a>. The Standard Chartered analyst now <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/standard-chartered-bumps-up-bitcoin-forecast-120000-2023-07-10/">expects</a> the price of the largest cryptocurrency to reach $50,000 this year and $120,000 by the end of 2024. He believes that the price surge could incentivize bitcoin miners to hoard more of the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s supply.</p>
<p>&#x201C;As well as maintaining the Bitcoin ledger, miners play a key role in determining net supply of newly mined <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. Specifically, based on their profitability, miners decide how much of the new <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply reaches the market,&#x201D; Kendrick wrote on Monday, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Increased miner profitability per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply and pushing <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> prices higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that the reason behind his projected <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> price increase was that miners worldwide, who mint 900 new bitcoins daily, would soon need to sell fewer coins to cover their costs, including electricity needed to power mining equipment.</p>

<p>Kendrick estimated that bitcoin miners have been selling 100% of their newly mined coins. However, if the price of bitcoin hits $50,000, he expects them to only sell 20%-30% of their output. The Standard Chartered analyst detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the equivalent of miners reducing the amount of bitcoins they sell per day to just 180-270 from 900 currently.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Over a year, that would reduce miner selling from 328,500 to a range of 65,700-98,550 &#x2014; a reduction in net <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> supply of roughly 250,000 bitcoins a year,&#x201D; he added.</p>
<p>Standard Chartered <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-bank-cryptocurrency-exchange-brokerage/">launched</a> a cryptocurrency exchange and brokerage service in June 2021. The bank&#x2019;s CEO, Bill Winters, previously said that the adoption of digital currencies is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/standard-chartered-bank-ceo-cryptocurrency-adoption/">absolutely inevitable</a>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $30,506, up 18% in the past 30 days and 84% year-to-date. Last week, crypto firm <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/matrixports-year-end-2024-prediction-bitcoin-to-reach-125000-as-strong-performance-fuels-bullish-sentiment/">Matrixpoint</a> predicted that bitcoin will reach $125,000 by the end of 2024. Meanwhile, venture capitalist Tim Draper has insisted that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> will hit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">$250,000</a> in about two years.</p>

The company announced it would not involve its largest franchises in blockchain initiatives, avoiding a possible devaluation of its intellectual properties (IPs), shelving in-house developed games and developments from third parties.</strong></p>
<h2>Sega Changes Its Blockchain Gaming Strategy</h2>
<p>Sega, the Japanese game development and publishing company, once a supporter of blockchain games, is now withdrawing its support for initiatives of this kind. In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-06/sega-joins-blockchain-games-pullback-as-crypto-winter-persists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Bloomberg, co-Chief Operating Officer Shuji Utsumi stated that the company was pulling the plug on games using this technology.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Utsumi also declared that Sega would not license its most prominent intellectual properties (IPs) to third parties involved in these kinds of games to avoid &#8220;devaluing&#8221; its content. However, Utsumi acknowledged that lesser franchises like Three Kingdoms and Virtua Fighter could be lent to be used in non-fungible token (NFT) projects.</p>
<p>Utsumi&#8217;s statements are a departure from the former stance that the company had on blockchain games, being involved in several projects as a developer and licensing its IPs to third parties. On April 2022, Sega <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sega-hints-at-inclusion-of-nft-and-metaverse-elements-in-its-super-game-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at including NFT and blockchain elements as part of its &#8220;super game&#8221; concept, contemplating investing more than $800 million in this initiative.</p>
<p>Also, in October, Sega <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-gaming-giant-sega-to-launch-first-blockchain-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of its first licensed blockchain game, using its Sangokushi Taisen franchise and being built using <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gamefi-focused-oasys-blockchain-launches-mainnet-with-support-of-sega-ubisoft-and-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oasys</a> technology, a gaming-oriented blockchain project.</p>

<h2>Blockchain Games Are &#8216;Boring&#8217;</h2>
<p>Utsumi explained his position on blockchain games and the reasons behind the company&#8217;s change of heart. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The action in play-to-earn games is boring. What’s the point if games are no fun? We’re looking into whether this technology is really going to take off in this industry, after all.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Utsumi stated Sega has not closed the door on including blockchain elements in its games when the technology matures. He declared that the company &#8220;should not ever underestimate&#8221; blockchain advocates and their proposals for the gaming space, even if they &#8220;sound a bit extreme.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast, Square Enix, another Japanese gaming company known for supporting the inclusion of blockchain and NTF elements in AAA games, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/square-enix-to-deepen-its-blockchain-efforts-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in January that it would deepen its blockchain push, revealing it had multiple blockchain games based on original IPs under development.</p>

Rickards stated that Biden is to blame for the upcoming marginalization of the U.S. dollar at the hands of a BRICS bloc common currency to be proposed on August 22.</strong></p>
<h2>Jim Rickards States Biden &#8216;Destroyed the Dollar&#8217;</h2>
<p>Best-selling author and economist Jim Rickards has given his opinion about the Biden administration&#8217;s handling of U.S. monetary policy. Rickards, an investment expert with 35 years of experience, accused President Joe Biden of taking down the U.S. dollar as a global reserve currency.</p>
<p>On social media, Rickards <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesGRickards/status/1677860685148049408?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Biden is now a world historic figure. He has destroyed the dollar, not an easy task.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The currency expert noted that one of the biggest rivals for the dollar is the birth of a BRICS bloc-wide currency that could potentially link the economic transactions of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (the BRICS bloc). Rickards stated that a gold-backed BRICS common currency will be previewed on August 22 and that it will be implemented in stages.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/russembkenya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1675727818888716288%7Ctwgr%5Edea5c53961602aa205727bcd0725622df9bd6942%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.bitcoin.com%2Fbrics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reports</a> coming from the Russian embassy in Kenya support this allegation. In contrast, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that there was no immediate push to create a common currency, explaining that any alternatives in this area would be part of &#8220;a medium to long-term ambition.&#8221;</p>

<h2>SCO and BRICS Merge</h2>
<p>According to Rickards, BRICS and the <a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shanghai Cooperation Organization</a> (SCO), two of the most significant economic blocs in the world, will merge into an unnamed cooperation group. Rickards believes the size of this new organization will inspire other countries to unite, consolidating an economic unity that will hurt the status of the U.S. dollar as a reserve and transactional currency.</p>
<p>However, Rickards maintains that the dollar will continue to be used as a second-hand currency, being &#8220;marginalized.&#8221; This is one of the scenarios that Rickards predicted in his 2011 best-seller Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis, where he describes the rise of a multicurrency world as dollar dominance continues to fade.</p>
<p>Others have also warned about the destruction of the dollar and its value. Jim Rogers, an investor who <a href="https://www.jimrogers.com/unreal-estate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicted</a> the 2008 financial crisis in 2002, recently warned about the effects of the demise of the U.S. dollar, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-is-going-to-suffer-as-dollars-value-erodes-further/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that the country is &#8220;going to suffer&#8221; due to inflation and debt problems.</p>

<h2>Economic Shift: Goldman Sachs Predicts India&#8217;s Ascent to World&#8217;s No. 2 Economy</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/how-india-could-rise-to-the-worlds-second-biggest-economy.html">report</a> titled &#8220;How India Could Rise to the World&#8217;s Second-Biggest Economy,&#8221; Santanu Sengupta, an economist with Goldman Sachs Research, projects substantial expansion for India&#8217;s economy. The report forecasts a surge in India&#8217;s gross domestic product, making it the world&#8217;s second-largest economy by 2075.</p>
<p>This growth is largely credited to India&#8217;s advantageous demographic makeup, balancing its working-age population and those too young or old to work. The study indicates that the key for India is to boost labor force participation and offer ample training and skill development opportunities.</p>
<p>“Over the next two decades, the dependency ratio of India will be one of the lowest among regional economies,” Sengupta detailed. “India has made more progress in innovation and technology than some may realize,” the economist added.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597160 size-full" title="India Poised to Leapfrog Major Economies, Becoming World's Second-Largest by 2075, Goldman Sachs Report Predicts" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected.jpg" alt="India Poised to Leapfrog Major Economies, Becoming World's Second-Largest by 2075, Goldman Sachs Report Predicts" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/projected.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The Goldman report asserts that India has seen significant growth in innovation, technology, and worker productivity. In economic terms, this suggests higher output for each labor and capital unit. The report also emphasizes that capital investment, driven by expected savings increases due to falling dependency ratios, rising incomes, and financial sector development, will be instrumental in fueling growth.</p>
<p>“Given healthy balance sheets of private corporates and banks in India, we believe that the conditions are conducive for a private sector capex cycle,” Sengupta notes.</p>
<p>The economist indicates that the primary challenge and risk to India&#8217;s economic growth forecast is productively engaging the labor force. Sengupta asserts that this involves creating job opportunities and enhancing job-related skills. The upside growth potential lies in digitizing the economy. The bank&#8217;s researcher cites Aadhaar, the world&#8217;s largest biometric ID system, which Sengupta claims has improved public service delivery and expanded access to credit.</p>
<p>Lastly, the report underscores India&#8217;s domestic demand-driven economy, the influence of global commodity prices, and the country&#8217;s energy needs as crucial factors in understanding its economic landscape. India currently holds the position of the world&#8217;s fifth-largest economy, and Goldman&#8217;s researchers posit that &#8220;India&#8217;s savings rate is likely to increase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldman&#8217;s examination of India follows <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">commentary</a> from British economist Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill, who conceived the acronym BRIC. O&#8217;Neill discussed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/what-is-de-dollarization-exploring-the-shift-away-from-the-us-dollars-global-dominance/">de-dollarization</a> and anticipates the Chinese yuan and the Indian rupee will become “much more important currencies for the world.”</p>

<h2>Paxful&#8217;s Alleged Removal of Reserve Funds From Status Page Raises Concern</h2>
<p>Following reports that Paxful, the peer-to-peer crypto marketplace, has removed the reserve funds amount from the status page, former CEO Ray Youssef advised users to cease trading. In his <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1677424162015461377?s=20">reply</a> to a Twitter user who warned of an FTX-style collapse, Youssef suggested that users should consider switching to self-custody until &#8220;we get to the bottom of this.&#8221;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597048 size-full" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12.png" alt="" width="1180" height="426" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-300x108.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-1024x370.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12-768x277.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/screen-shot-2023-07-10-at-13-21-12.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1180px) 100vw, 1180px" /></p>
<p>In addition to exposing the alleged removal of reserve funds from Paxful’s website, the unidentified social media user also claimed to have seen tweets from former employees who complained of not being paid all their dues after they left. The user also claimed to have heard rumors that Paxful was dipping into customer funds.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/raycivkit/status/1677423787208318978">tweet</a>, Youssef, in an apparent response to Paxful’s pledge to unfreeze $4.5 million in customer funds, reiterated his lack of confidence in the process, declaring:</p>
<blockquote><p>I do not trust lawyers. Paxful is now just paying legal bills. No African or any non-American should trust any IS corporation. Don’t say you were [not] warned folks. My reputation I value over any shares in any company.</p></blockquote>
<p>In early April, trading on the P2P marketplace was suspended due to regulations and what Youssef attributed to the departure of key personnel. However, after Paxful announced the resumption of services, Youssef, who had already left the organization, said he could not vouch for anything that is happening there now.</p>
<p>Since leaving Paxful, Youssef, who has more than 50,000 followers on Twitter, has not only urged users to abandon the platform but has routinely promoted Civkit which he founded. Although many of the followers have lauded Youssef&#8217;s efforts, some have accused him of being an &#8220;attention seeker.&#8221; He has also been accused of seeking to use his influence to harm rivals.</p>

<h2>’Central Banks Are Diversifying Currency Holdings’</h2>
<p>Invesco, an asset management firm with $1.5 trillion in global assets under management, published its 11th annual study of sovereign investors on Monday. The &#8220;2023 Invesco Global Sovereign Asset Management Study&#8221; includes insights from 142 chief investment officers, heads of asset classes, and senior portfolio strategists representing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks. Together, these institutions oversee around $21 trillion in assets as of March 31.</p>
<p>Noting that &#8220;Central banks are diversifying currency holdings, stirred by geopolitical uncertainties and attractive opportunities in emerging markets,&#8221; Invesco described:</p>
<blockquote><p>Amid volatile yields, 2022 saw a flight to gold, questions around the U.S. dollar’s future as the world’s reserve currency, and increased diversification of currency holdings.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the study, central banks see gold as a safe-haven asset, which led to record purchases in 2022, &#8220;with net acquisitions of 1,136 tonnes, marking a 12th consecutive year of a net increase in gold holdings.&#8221; While emphasizing that almost 20% of these net purchases came from Turkish and Chinese central banks, Invesco noted that other central banks, particularly in the Middle East and emerging markets, were also noteworthy gold buyers in 2022.</p>
<p>The study also explores de-dollarization. &#8220;The freezing of Russian assets by Western nations has thrust the world’s reliance on the U.S. dollar as the dominant reserve currency into the spotlight, raising questions about its long-term viability amidst high U.S. debt levels,&#8221; Invesco explained, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>A growing percentage of central banks year-on-year believe that the U.S. debt levels are negatively impacting the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>“However, central banks generally agree that there is no clear alternative to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency, with 53% disputing that the dollar will be weaker in five years, up from 46% last year,” the asset management firm continued. One central bank based in an emerging market was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>People have been looking for alternatives to the dollar and euro for a long time and they would’ve gone to them already if there were any suitable alternatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>The study also examines the potential for the Chinese yuan to replace the U.S. dollar as the world’s dominant currency. “The Chinese renminbi, with its increasing allocations in recent years, is often considered a potential future alternative,&#8221; the asset manager detailed, adding that in the long term (10 years or more), “most central banks do not anticipate a significant shift in global trade currencies,” but “a considerable proportion do expect a shift towards renminbi (27% of central banks), but expectations differ based on the region.”</p>
<p>Invesco pointed out that &#8220;sentiment surrounding the renminbi becoming a true reserve currency has declined year on year, with a significantly greater proportion of central banks disagreeing that it will achieve that status within five years.” In addition, the firm stressed that &#8220;barriers such as liquidity, property sector debt, and political risk hinder the renminbi’s potential to overtake the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency.&#8221; Nonetheless, the asset manager concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite these concerns, central banks still expect to increase renminbi holdings over time.</p></blockquote>

Egypt, the world&#x2019;s 14th most populous country, grapples with soaring prices for goods and services across the region. Additionally, the bitcoin exchange rate in Egypt is approaching the record high set in November 2021.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Egyptian Pound Plummets as Inflation Reaches Highest Level in Decades, Bitcoin Nears All-Time High</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Recent <a href="https://apnews.com/article/egypt-economy-inflation-record-russia-ukraine-8024c29526c135bb87f74c55cfd3af57">inflation figures</a> show Egypt is currently grappling with soaring inflation rates. The annual inflation rate surged to 36.8% in June. Citizens face rising food prices, a depreciating currency, higher fuel costs, and a growing fiscal deficit. Since June 2022, when the inflation rate was at 14.7%, the cost of goods and services in Egypt has more than doubled.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Egyptian pound (EGP) has <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD">declined significantly</a> against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2023, according to the latest exchange rates. The EGP&#x2019;s value has dropped 80.25% against the dollar since Dec. 26, 2003, with 42.09% of that decline occurring within the past five years. The currency has depreciated nearly 20% against the U.S. dollar since the start of 2023. Additionally, the inflation rate in Egypt has reached the highest level recorded since 1958.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In response to the inflation crisis, the Egyptian government has taken measures such as <a href="https://mepc.org/commentary/rising-inflation-egypt-impacts-responses">reducing state spending</a>. Moreover, the Central Bank of Egypt increased the benchmark bank rate four times in 2022. Despite the significant rise in inflation in Egypt, the exchange rate of the Egyptian pound (EGP) against Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) indicates <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is nearing a record high. The current exchange rate is nearing the all-time high set in November 2021, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> surpassed one million EGP per unit. As of July 10, 2023, the exchange rate is <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-EGP">936,506 EGP per Bitcoin</a>.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
Egypt&#x2019;s ongoing currency crisis and rampant inflation have severely impacted its citizens. An Egyptian family <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/egyptians-struggle-to-afford-food-this-ramadan-as-crisis-worsens-831e5a54">told</a> the Wall Street Journal in April they were &#x201C;hardly surviving this crisis&#x201D; and were running low on food. In order to mitigate the severe inflationary conditions, on January 16, 2023, the government announced a plan to sell discounted bread to low-income Egyptians most affected by the economic upheaval.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to government statistics, nearly 30% of Egyptians live below the poverty line. Egyptian policymakers have also been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Since 2016, Egypt has received multiple financial support packages from the IMF. The most recent of these, a $3 billion loan, was <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/01/31/egypt-imf-bailout-highlights-risks-austerity-corruption">approved</a> by the IMF in December 2022.&#13;<br />
