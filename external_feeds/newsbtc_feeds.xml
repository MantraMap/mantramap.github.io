					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price gained pace and traded above $23,000. BTC is consolidating gains and might start another increase towards $23,500. Bitcoin traded to a new yearly high at $23,428 before it started a downside correction. The price is trading above $22,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $22,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $22,000 support zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Additional Gains Bitcoin price started a major increase above the $21,500 resistance zone. BTC gained pace and even broke the $22,000 resistance zone, similar to ethereum at $1,550. The price surged above the $22,500 level and settled well above the 100 hourly simple moving average. It traded to a new yearly high at $23,428 and recently started a minor downside correction. There was a minor move below the $23,000 level. Bitcoin price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $20,395 swing low to $24,248 high. However, the price is still trading above $22,000 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $22,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. An immediate resistance is near the $23,000 level. The next major resistance is near the $23,200 zone, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com In the stated case, the price may perhaps rise towards the $23,500 level. Any more gains might send btc price towards the $24,500 level. Downside Correction in BTC? If bitcoin price fails to clear the $23,000 resistance, it could continue to move down. An immediate support on the downside is near the $22,400 zone. The next major support is near the $22,000 zone and the trend line. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $20,395 swing low to $24,248 high, below which the price might gain bearish momentum and test $21,200. Any more losses might send the price to $20,500 in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $22,400, followed by $22,000. Major Resistance Levels – $23,000, $23,200 and $23,500.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[According to a report by Bloomberg, crypto exchange Binance has announced that one of its fiat trading partners, Signature Bank, will no longer be processing transactions of less than $100,000 as the bank attempts to reduce its exposure to the cryptocurrency market. Binance said this is a broad action affecting all crypto exchanges dealing with Signature bank. And that efforts are underway to find an alternative solution immediately for members of its user community whose accounts are serviced by this bank. “One of our fiat banking partners, Signature Bank, has advised that it will no longer support any of its crypto exchange customers with buying and selling amounts of less than 100,000 USD as of February 1, 2023. This is the case for all of their crypto exchange clients. As a result, some individual users may not be able to use SWIFT bank transfers to buy or sell crypto with/for USD for amounts less than 100,000 USD,” the statement sent by Binance to Bloomberg News on Saturday, said. Signature Bank is one of the biggest fiat banking partners in the crypto industry in collaboration with many industrial giants, including Binance, Kraken, Coinbase, Circle and the now-bankrupt FTX exchange.  Following the heavy losses in the crypto market in 2022, Signature Bank lost about 64% of its shares (SBNY) value after paying out $8.1 billion worth of digital assets in service of withdrawal orders during the last quarter of the year. To avoid similar losses in the future, Signature Bank has begun a massive withdrawal process from the cryptocurrency industry. To this effect, the New York-based bank even plans on voluntarily reducing its crypto deposits by $8 billion to $10 billion.  Related Reading: THETA Breaches $1 Level Courtesy Of Solid On-Chain Developments How Does Signature Bank’s Action Affect Binance Coin (BNB)? Following the announcement of Signature Bank’s minimum transaction limit by Binance, there has been no significant effect on the BNB token. According to CoinMarketCap, BNB is trading at $302.89, having lost only 0.11% of its value in the last 24 hours. BNBUSD trading at $303.0 &#124; Source: BNBUSD Chart on Tradingview.com.  Ordinarily, BNB’s price movement is within the range of an expected reaction as Signature services only 0.01% of the average monthly customers on Binance. Thus, causing no need for panic among investors.  However, it may be too early to tell the full effects of Signature’s action on the BNB token, especially considering the ongoing social media rumors on Binance’s “true” relationship with the American banking giant.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Shows Aggressiveness With 20% Jump In The Weekly Charts Binance In Trouble?  Apparently, it is believed by some crypto enthusiasts that Binance has been dealing with Signature via an account belonging to “Key Vision Development Limited”, a Seychelles-based company that has been defunct since September 2021.  According to rumors, Signature Bank imposed a $100,000 minimum transaction limit on crypto transactions only after forcefully closing Binance&#8217;s “phony” account. Some also say that Binance is the only exchange affected by this new transaction limit policy, especially since there have been no official statements from other crypto exchange clients of Signature bank.  That said, it is worth stating that all these statements are still rumors with no confirmation by any credible authority. However, Binance users as well as BNB investors, are advised to watch out for any developments in that space.  Featured Image: Reuters,  Chart from Tradingview.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[After 216 days, the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio finally broke above 1, making this accumulation the second longest after it took BTC prices 300 days to bottom up after the bear run of 2014-2015. It also signals the likelihood of another refreshing BTC rally after gains of last week. Bitcoin&#8217;s MVRV Breaks Above 1 The breakout coincided with BTC prices surging to as high as $23,300 on Saturday, January 21, a positive development, especially for optimistic holders.  As of writing on January 22, prices have cooled off, and the coin is trending at around $22,700, albeit with relatively low trading volumes. Still, the retracement puts BTC within a bullish formation following impressive gains on January 20 when the coin printed higher, defying gravity and confirming demand. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $23,000 As Crypto Market Cap Revisits $1 Trillion Mark The MVRV ratio changes depending on Bitcoin&#8217;s market forces. The prevailing sentiment is that BTC is bottoming up. Bulls could be preparing for another leg up, injecting the much-needed volatility and volatility into the crypto markets. However, the absence of confirming indicator presented problems.  Technical and fundamental analysts may use the MVRV ratio to time market entries and exits. Typically, whenever the MVRV ratio is below 1, then it implies that prices are at their bottom.  Any reversal from sub-1 to above 1 with increasing valuation may signal price bottoms and, possibly, more room for upsides in the coming days. This signal could be a precursor to guide swing and long-term traders to hold on to their long positions and wait for more gains before exiting once BTC becomes overvalued based on on-chain readings.   Conversely, historical values reveal that whenever the MVRV is above 3.7, there is a real probability that the Bitcoin market will be overheating. Subsequently, it could be the best time to exit and take profits.   Bitcoin Sentiment Shifting To MVRV ratio is dynamic, changing depending on the fluctuating valuation of BTC. At any point, the MVRV ratio is calculated by dividing the market value and the realized value of bitcoin. The market value measures the prevailing sentiment amongst holders, which, as history shows, changes depending on spot rates. Meanwhile, the realized value considers each coin&#8217;s actual spending. Calculating the realized value takes into account the acquisition cost of each coin in question. If the MVRV ratio is below 1, should coins be sold, most holders will realize losses.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze May Reach $30,000, Top Crypto Trader Predicts The more the MVRV ratio increases, the more holders and traders will be willing to sell as they get more into the money. Subsequently, the ratio is a good gauge of whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued in the short, medium, or long term.  Streams from IntoTheBlock show that, on average, 62% of BTC holders are making money, with 36% losing money.

					<description><![CDATA[The altcoin market has been following the major cryptocurrencies in their recent rally. Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of those tokens that maintained a solid performance in the last week. According to CoinGecko, SHIB is up 19.5% in the weekly timeframe and over 47% in the monthly at the time of writing. This strong growth is fueled by external factors along with the nearing launch of Shibarium, the ecosystem’s upgrade that would bring a list of features for the ShibArmy.  Related Reading: What Is SingularityNET And Why Is Its AGIX Token Exploding By 116%? Who Let The Dogs Out?  Shytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous chief developer of the Shiba Inu meme coin, has been constantly teasing the release of Shibarium since the start of the year. The nearing launch of the upgrade led the price to climb.  As the Shiba Inu community excitedly anticipates the beta release of Shibarium, Kusama is promoting the notion that the release of the Layer 2 scaling solution may be closer than previously believed. The primary developer for SHIB tweeted a link to the official Shibarium Telegram handle and instructed fellow SHIB developer Trophias to &#8220;open the chat.&#8221; The Shibarium upgrade would leverage the Ethereum network’s security while scaling Shiba Inu’s ability to handle transactions. This would lower fees significantly while making the network faster and more efficient.  Image: TrackShiba.com It would also offer utility as the upgrade would mean more SHIB tokens burnt. As of January 21st, the total burned SHIB is over 410 trillion, according to SHIB burn tracker, TrackShiba. With the beta launch of the network upgrade being used as an introduction to the features Shibarium will have, SHIB is expected to continue to soar in price in the next few days.  SHIB’s Next Target Should Be This Level The token’s current price movement is a result of hitting the $0.00001293 resistance. As of writing, SHIB may be in some short term pain as the resistance proves itself difficult for SHIB bulls. In the coming days, bears might be able to test the token’s current support at $0.00001184.  If the bears ever broke through this support, pain in the medium term would be inevitable as bears would have access to the $0.00000968 support which, if broken, would make the token revert to pre-2023 price levels.  Investors and trades should target the $0.00001293 resistance after consolidating above $0.00001184. This would alleviate any downward pressure on the token, giving SHIB bulls legroom for an explosive upward movement.  SHIB total market cap at $6.6 billion on the weekend chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $23,000 As Crypto Market Cap Revisits $1 Trillion Mark For now, investors and traders should be focused on consolidating for a continuation of the current rally. With the high correlation of Shiba Inu with Bitcoin, the king coin’s price movement would also cause ripples with SHIB’s price movement.  Monitoring how Bitcoin will move should also be done as any movement by BTC would reflect in SHIB’s price.  Featured image: Coinpedia]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In recent times, the Solana price has witnessed a considerable upward push, which made the coin breach important resistance levels. Over the last 24 hours, SOL has rallied close to 20%, and in a week&#8217;s time, the altcoin has appreciated close to 40%. As Bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained above $20,000, most altcoins have shown positive price momentum on their respective charts. If Bitcoin continues to climb higher, then short-term bullish momentum will prevail across the market. Related Reading: Polkadot Could Present Buying Opportunity As Bullish Outlook Continues The technical outlook of Solana has pointed towards the bulls, but the chart also reveals that as the coin has been overbought, SOL would eventually witness a price correction. Accumulation remains high on the chart as demand for the coin has been at a multi-month high. Solana could present its buyers with buying opportunities; the coin might retrace on its chart and then rise again. The market capitalization of Solana increased, which meant that there had been an increase in buying strength. Currently, Solana has been trading at a 90% discount to its all-time high, which was secured in 2021. Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SOL was priced at $25 at the time of writing. Solana pierced through many resistance levels. The $25 price mark has acted as stiff resistance for the coin; it is imperative that SOL stay put above that region to avoid bullish momentum from fading. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $31, but before the altcoin gets to that level, SOL is bound to trade south. Local support for the coin stood at $21. The support region that ranges between $21 and $18 will present traders with entry opportunities. The amount of Solana traded in the last session increased and was green, which meant that the coin depicted bullish momentum. Technical Analysis SOL continued to display overbought tendencies, the asset was overvalued. Despite a tiny correction in demand, accumulation for the coin shot past the overbought region again. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was parked at the 70-mark, which was a sign that buyers exceeded sellers heavily on the daily chart. Similarly, the price of the asset was above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. Solana was also above the 50-SMA line (yellow), which is a sign of a bullish extension. On the flip side, SOL displayed a death cross where the 50-SMA crossed above the 20-SMA line, and that meant an incoming fall in price. Bulls were still around for Solana, but buy signals for the altcoin were declining in size. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) depicts price momentum and reversals. The MACD displayed decreasing green histograms, which meant that buy signals were declining on the chart.

					<description><![CDATA[The crypto market has been remarkably bullish since the turn of the new year. In the last three weeks, several assets have experienced price rallies, like Bitcoin, which gained over 37% to trade above $21,000 for the first time in two months. While that is an impressive feat, altcoins have been the real stars of the market, with many pulling off a stunning market performance. Aptos (APT), one of the trailblazing tokens of 2023, has just recorded a 54.73% gain in the last 24 hours based on data from CoinMarketCap. APT has been one of the best-performing coins in 2023, gaining by over 248% since the start of the year. Although it is a relatively new token, Its price growth in 2023 outshines that of many market giants, including Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP) and, of course &#8211; Bitcoin (BTC).

					<description><![CDATA[The popularity of artificial intelligence applications has been growing as popular platforms like SingularityNET and ChatGPT become mainstream. With Microsoft investing $10 billion on ChatGPT, we should expect AI applications to become more mainstream in the next few years.  AGIX, the native token of the SingularityNET, is capitalizing on this as it tallied huge gains since the start of 2023. According to CoinGecko, the token is up 116% in the past week (at the time of writing, Friday) with the biggest gains made at the bi-weekly time frame at 360%.  Related Reading: HNT Balloons As Token Gets 36% More Helium In Run-Up To Network Migration What Is SingularityNET? SingularityNET is the first decentralized AI market that is built on top of the Cardano blockchain. The project was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel, a cognitive scientist and one of the leading figures in AI research. The project is set to create an AGI or an artificial general intelligence.  Image: SingularityNET/Twitter As of writing, the SingularityNET ecosystem comprises 13 protocols that are either being built or are already deployed as a full-fledged component of the ecosystem.  Getting Smarter By The Day On-chain developments have been very bullish for the SingularityNET ecosystem. According to the ecosystem’s recent blog post, the journey of SingularityNET in creating an AGI is getting closer by the day.  The development of the MeTTa, a custom coding language specifically built for SingularityNET’s goals, have been successful so far. Image: Thoughtworks Arts The alpha release of the coding language will be accompanied by the release of the Distributed Atomspace (DAS) knowledge store this 2023.  This technology would enable the AGI to store data for the long-term. These developments in the realm of AI will certainly make the creation of SingularityNET’s AGI easier.  How Did These Affect AGIX?  The ecosystem’s native token AGIX is currently one of the most bullish tokens on the market. As of Saturday, AGIX is trading at $0.2139, rising 32% in the last week, and facing rejection at two strong resistances at $0.2362 and $0.2546.  The current rally of the token is unsustainable and bears might be able to retest its support $0.1404.

					<description><![CDATA[The Polkadot price has breached the $5 resistance mark in the past trading sessions. Over the last 24 hours, DOT has appreciated by 3.8%. The price of Bitcoin has been surging, which has caused other altcoins to also move upward on their respective charts. When Bitcoin crossed the $18,000 price mark, other altcoins broke past their immediate resistance marks. Polkadot price momentum remains bullish in the shorter time frame. The technical outlook for DOT showed that despite a price correction, accumulation on the chart increased. Related Reading: This Metric Suggests Bitcoin Could Be In Danger Of Another Selloff Polkadot demand also showed an increase on its chart. The asset&#8217;s price has to remain above the $5.40 support line and breach the $6.20 resistance level if the coin has to maintain a bullish stance for a longer time frame. The daily chart of DOT also points towards an incoming fall in price, which means that traders might be presented with shorting opportunities. Currently, DOT is trading at an 89% discount from its all-time high secured in 2021. Polkadot Price Analysis: One-Day Chart DOT was exchanging hands at $5.89 at the time of writing. Polkadot had formed a cup and handle pattern, which means that the bullish momentum can continue, which is why Polkadot resumed its northbound journey on the daily chart. Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $6. Toppling the $6 mark can take the coin to $6.20. As Polkadot was overbought, demand for the coin could trickle down. This can cause the price to fall for a few trading sessions before it starts to rise again. In case of a price retracement, DOT will encounter its local support at $5.40 and then at $5.33. These two levels can be an entry point for buyers, as the altcoin will rise in value after it touches these support lines. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was still green, indicating that buying pressure remained. Technical Analysis The asset had secured a multi-month high in registering demand in the past week. The coin was overvalued a week ago, and as a result, demand has retraced slightly. The Relative Strength Index fell back from the 80 mark, which was a sign of the asset being overbought. At press time, DOT again registered an uptick, indicating that buying strength was building again. On that note, the price of DOT was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line, hinting that buyers were driving price momentum in the market. The coin was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line. Despite that, the 50-SMA line crossed above the 20-SMA line, which signified a death cross. A death cross means an incoming fall in value. This reading corresponds to traders finding the chance to short the asset. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which depicts price momentum and reversals, showed declining buy signals.

<p>DOT was exchanging hands at $5.89 at the time of writing. Polkadot had formed a cup and handle pattern, which means that the bullish momentum can continue, which is why Polkadot resumed its northbound journey on the daily chart.</p>
<p>Overhead resistance for the coin stood at $6. Toppling the $6 mark can take the coin to $6.20. As Polkadot was overbought, demand for the coin could trickle down.</p>
<p>This can cause the price to fall for a few trading sessions before it starts to rise again. In case of a price retracement, DOT will encounter its local support at $5.40 and then at $5.33.</p>
<p>These two levels can be an entry point for buyers, as the altcoin will rise in value after it touches these support lines. The amount of Polkadot traded in the last session was still green, indicating that buying pressure remained.</p>

<p>The asset had secured a multi-month high in registering demand in the past week. The coin was overvalued a week ago, and as a result, demand has retraced slightly. The Relative Strength Index fell back from the 80 mark, which was a sign of the asset being overbought.</p>
