<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>DCG is facing investigation by the SEC and RED over internally transferred funds to its subsidiaries.</em></li>



<li><em>The financial investigation centers around DCG and Genesis.</em></li>



<li><em>Investigators have requested interviews and documents from Digital Currency Group</em> <em>and Genesis.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Officials with the Eastern District of New York (EDNY) of the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission are examining money transfers between Digital Currency Group (DCG) and the group&#8217;s Genesis subsidiary, Bloomberg reported late January 6.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-490.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="600" height="315" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-490.png" alt="DCG Under Investigations Internal Money Transfer By US And SEC" class="wp-image-158833" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-490.png 600w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-490-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" title="DCG Under Investigations Internal Money Transfer By US And SEC 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The report said prosecutors at the DOJ&#8217;s Eastern District office in New York had requested interviews and documents from DCG and Genesis. At the same time, the SEC is at a similarly early stage of the investigation check. The report, citing people familiar with the matter, said that<strong> both Genesis and DCG were &#8220;allegedly engaged in misconduct.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>According to the report, the questions focus on the financial interplay between Genesis and DCG.</p>



<p>The investigation is still in the early stages. A person familiar with<strong> the investigation said the inquiry into DCG began long before FTX went bankrupt.</strong></p>

<p>Genesis had previously faced a $1.2 billion loss due to loans made to the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital hedge fund.</p>



<p>Following the crash of FTX in November 2022, Genesis announced that its lender would suspend withdrawals. This has a knock-on effect on companies like Gemini, which relies on Genesis for its Monetization platform.</p>



<p><strong>Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss and DCG founder Barry Silbert have begun to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157548-cameron-winklevoss-criticizes-barry-silbert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clash openly</a> over issues arising from this suspension</strong>.</p>

<p>Genesis has also made several significant layoffs over the past few months, replacing executive leadership and halving its headcount since August.</p>



<p>Genesis has also tapped advisors to explore options, including filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. As of early December, <strong>Genesis creditors have filed claims totaling up to $1.8 billion.</strong></p>



<p>The collapse of FTX has engulfed the entire crypto market in recent months. However, the investigation into this collapse is still complicated as there are too many parties involved, the company&#8217;s operating documents are unclear and the person believed to be responsible is the Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) recently pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p>This means that for every dollar of crypto, financial institutions <strong>need to hold $1.25 in regular cash to ensure that there are enough reserves to cover losses or other problems.</strong></p>



<p>In a recent statement, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), explained that until the framework is finalized, MAS requires Singapore-registered banks to accept 1,250 % for high-risk crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Pending the finalization of the framework, MAS requires Singapore-incorporated banks to apply a 1,250 percent risk weight for exposures to riskier crypto assets such as bitcoin and ether. Based on MAS&#8217; minimum total capital adequacy requirement of ten percent for systemically important banks incorporated in Singapore, Singapore-incorporated banks are required to hold $125 of capital against an exposure of $100 to a crypto asset like bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<cite>He said.</cite></blockquote>

<p>According to MAS,<strong> the minimum capital adequacy ratio requirement for systemically important banks established in Singapore is 10%</strong>, which means for every $100 of crypto asset exposure held by banks holding, they must have $125 of capital.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;For less risky crypto assets, such as tokenized corporate bonds that meet a set of conditions to ensure that they pose the same level of financial risks as traditional corporate bonds, the prudential treatment is similar to that of the conventional non-tokenized asset. &#8220;</p>
<cite>Shanmugaratnam further stated.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Singapore is also one of the countries witnessing quite severe consequences in the recent collapse of the mighty FTX empire. The company collapsed in mid-November and has created huge ripples through the crypto arena. The company has caused many other companies, such as Block Fi, to be badly affected and file for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>On Friday, <strong>Gary Harmon, 31, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and obstruction of justice for stealing 712 bitcoins from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). </strong>The bitcoins were seized by law enforcement from Harmon&#8217;s brother, Larry Harmon, CEO of darknet crypto mixing service Helix, following his arrest in 2020.</p>



<p><strong>Larry Harmon <a href="https://news.coincu.com/135728-helix-crypto-mixer-founder-sued/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded guilty</a> to one count of conspiracy to launder monetary instruments in August 2021</strong>. According to his lawyers, his cooperation is &#8220;active and ongoing.&#8221; But while Larry was cooperating with the government, his brother was <strong>stealing cryptocurrency from Larry&#8217;s confiscated wallets.</strong></p>



<p>According to a new memo published by prosecutors in August 2021, Gary Harmon used recovered original words to recreate multiple wallets belonging to his brother.</p>



<p>In April 2020, he made eight transfers from Larry&#8217;s forfeited wallet Trezor kept in an IRS filing cabinet to his wallet. In total, <strong>Gary Harmon obtained 712 bitcoins (equivalent to $5.4 million at the time) from the IRS.</strong></p>

<p>Prosecutors say that Gary initially vehemently denied withdrawing his brother&#8217;s wallet, even when presented with evidence that he did so.</p>



<p>After gaining access to his brother&#8217;s wallet, <strong>upstart Gary borrowed $1.2 million through BlockFi, using bitcoin as collateral, to buy a luxury apartment in Cleveland. He also &#8220;spent bitcoins wildly&#8221; at strip clubs and on private jet flights.</strong></p>



<p>In July 2021, federal agents arrested Gary Harmon and searched his residence in Ohio. They found wallets containing about <strong>$6,000 in bitcoin.</strong></p>



<p>As part of his plea agreement, <strong>Gary Harmon agreed to forfeit more than $12 million in cryptocurrencies, including 647 bitcoins, two ethers, and 17.4 million dogecoins.</strong></p>



<p>Gary Harmon has yet to be convicted, and<strong> he faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison.</strong></p>

<p>Velvet Sea Ventures and 1confirmation <strong>led a $9 million Series A funding round for SuperRare in March 2021</strong>. Celebrity investors Mark Cuban, Marc Benioff, and Ashton Kutcher were also a part of the round.</p>



<p>SuperRare sets itself apart from rivals by concentrating more on collaborating with artists, although larger platforms like OpenSea were better equipped to capitalize on the bull market. Even though <strong>OpenSea</strong> was able to raise money at a potentially exaggerated valuation of over $13 billion, the downturn has not spared the company. <strong>In July, the company fired 20% of its employees, leaving it with 230 workers</strong>.</p>

<p>As mentioned in earlier Coincu News articles, the lawsuits surrounding the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157904-ftx-task-force-recover-victim-assets-formed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX collapse </a>are becoming increasingly complex, making it difficult to compensate victims and determine the responsibility of those involved increasingly tricky.</p>



<p>Previously, the SBF, said to be critical in the collapse of FTX, was charged by U.S. prosecutors with eight counts. But in his most recent trial on January 6, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/157878-sam-bankman-fried-pleads-not-guilty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he refused to plead guilty</a>, and his subsequent trial is scheduled for early October. This period seems long enough for him to prepare thoroughly for further arguments.</p>

<p>One witness noted that the majority of the cash came through <strong>Just Lend</strong>, a Tron-based lending business, and was transferred to the wallet via <strong>Binance</strong> before being forwarded to <strong>Huobi</strong>.</p>



<p>This occurs at a critical juncture for <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/158722-huobi-has-around-60-million-usd-withdrawn/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/158722-huobi-has-around-60-million-usd-withdrawn/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Huobi</a></strong>. <strong>Sun allegedly purchased the exchange through a middleman firm, a claim he rejects, insisting that he is only an advisor</strong>. Nevertheless, there have been many significant developments since then, including layoffs and a requirement that salaries be paid in stablecoins rather than fiat money.</p>



<p>These modifications and concerns that internal communications may have been cut off caused the price of the Huobi token to decline (HT). Over the last 48 hours,<strong> it dropped from a high of $5.39 to a low of $4.33</strong>. Since then, the token has recovered and is at <strong>$4.80</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.coincu.com/157032-ark-bought-160000-coinbase-shares/"><strong>Cathie Wood&#8217;s ARK Fintech</strong></a> Innovation exchange-traded fund sold around <strong>404,000 shares</strong> of Silvergate on Thursday, January 6,<strong> lowering the ETF&#8217;s holdings by more than 99%</strong>. The fund&#8217;s remaining holdings amount fewer than <strong>4,000 shares</strong> worth around <strong>$43,000</strong>, or less than <strong>0.01% of the fund&#8217;s total portfolio</strong>.</p>



<p>Silvergate&#8217;s preliminary fourth-quarter statistics revealed yesterday that the company&#8217;s total customer deposits <strong>decreased from $11.9 billion to $3.8 billion</strong>, forcing it to sell a quarter of its assets at a substantial loss. And <strong>cut 40% of the workforce</strong> (about 200 employees). Yesterday, its <strong>stock price </strong>fell below the issue price of<strong> $12, a decline of more than 45%</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Silvergate shares fell by a record 43%</strong> on Thursday, and they fell by as much as 6.9% further on Friday. The price has been falling for more than a year as the crypto business continues to tank. Since its all-time high of $222.13 in November 2021, the stock has dropped more than 94%, <strong>wiping off about $5.5 billion</strong> in market value.</p>

<p>Wood&#8217;s decision to nearly totally dump her holding is a sharp reversal from only two months ago, when her ARK Fintech Innovation fund purchased more than <strong>200,000 shares </strong>of the bank in a week as<strong> the collapse of Sam Bankman-FTX Fried&#8217;s exchange</strong> heightened fears about crypto businesses&#8217; solvency. She earlier sold over <strong>190,000 shares of Silvergate</strong> in <strong>mid-December</strong>, when the stock was selling at nearly <strong>$19 per share</strong>, <strong>roughly 50%</strong> more than Thursday&#8217;s closing price.</p>



<p>&#8220;The conditions surrounding Silvergate are exceedingly complex, and the near-term outlook is difficult to anticipate,&#8221; Sutton said in a client note. &#8220;It must struggle with the continuation of crypto winter, regulatory inquiries, and possibly legislative action, all of which materially undermine the future growth profile.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Francois Villeroy de Galhau</strong>, the governor of the Bank of France, has begun the process of setting <a href="https://news.coincu.com/158402-paypals-previous-president-believes-decline/">harsher rules</a> for crypto firms operating in France. The <strong>European Union&#8217;s Crypto Asset Market Regulation (MiCA)</strong>, which will serve as a springboard to enable a block-wide licensing regime for cryptocurrency companies and is expected to be voted on in February of this year for implementation<strong> in 2024</strong>, will come before this. MiCA stands for Market Infrastructure for Crypto Assets.</p>



<p>The application for a <strong>Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP)</strong> license in France is now available, although no vendors have been licensed. There are approximately <strong>sixty businesses in France</strong> that &#8220;apply&#8221; to the French market regulator, the AMF, for licenses with looser requirements. The former CEO of Celsius is being sued for fraud by the New York Attorney General, which affects <strong>26,000 customers</strong>.</p>

<p>Given the turmoil that is now occurring in the cryptocurrency market, the <strong>Governor of the Bank of France</strong>, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, stated that there is a need to expedite licensing in France and the bank of France. &#8220;All of the problems that take place in 2022 create a single belief: France intends to go to mandatory DASP license as soon as possible, rather than just registration,&#8221; Villeroy stated. &#8220;<strong>All of the crises that take place in 2022 develop a simple belief.</strong>&#8220;</p>
