					<description><![CDATA[BNB Price has been seeing a lot of declines since Binance came under fire for the audit published by Mazars. Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD) had spread like wildfire, leading to more than $5 billion in withdrawals from the crypto exchange. Nevertheless, Binance was able to withstand the onslaught and amid all of this, activity on the Binance Smart Chain has fallen drastically, painting a bearish picture for the BNB price. Binance Chain Activity Drops By 15% Last week, there had been a lot of activity on the Binance Smart Chain which saw daily active addresses climb as high as 1.2 million at the start of the weekend. However, as the new week is ushered in, this metric has taken a swift beating and the number of daily active addresses has declined dramatically. Related Reading: Polygon Profitability Tanks As MATIC Nosedives 5.6% Data from YCharts show that in the last 24 hours, Binance Smart Chain active addresses were down by more than 15.70%. This showed a complete reversal in the high usage recorded between Friday and Saturday when activity on the chain had surpassed all other blockchains. Currently, the number sits at 947,414 daily active addresses on the blockchain. So from Friday to now, active addresses are down by more than 150,000.  BSC daily active addresses falls 15% &#124; Source: YCharts New unique addresses per day were also down during this time and are down by 15.27% in the 24-hour period. Likewise, transactions per day also took a beating, falling 15.27% during this time while transaction fees realized on the network declined by 10.86%. Interestingly, the daily active BEP-20 addresses on the Binance Smart Chain saw the most upside for the time period with a 9.84% growth, as well as the BSC average transaction fee seeing a 6.58% rise to $0.1457 per transaction. How Will BNB Price Respond? At the start of the weekend when activity on the Binance Smart Chain had begun to surge, there was a notable increase in the BNB price during this time. The digital asset had clocked a local peak of $264 on Friday before active addresses had begun to lose momentum. BNB price trending below $250 &#124; Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com By Saturday, the more than 100,000 declines in daily active addresses were followed by a sharp drop in the price of BNB. This drop to the $220 territory showed a correlation between the activity on the blockchain and the price of the coin.

However, just like the weekend, such a decline would only be temporary and a sharp recovery will expectedly follow not much later. Another 10% drop from current prices will see the digital asset revisit the $220 territory once more. BNB is changing hands at a price of $246 at the time of this writing. It’s down 0.49% in the last day and 12.37% in the last week, according to data from Coinmarketcap. Featured image from Binance, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[For many Bitcoin investors who lived it, this crypto winter feels more painful than the 2018 bear market, despite making a shallower fall from peak to through. From a monthly momentum perspective, the bearish trend is now the strongest on record. Let&#8217;s take a look at what this means and where the market is at by comparison. Log MACD Points To Worst Crypto Winter In History As a speculative asset class, cryptocurrencies are volatile – wildly driven by speculation and polar opposite ends of greed and fear. There is no denying the current market is some of the most fearful since Bitcoin&#8217;s inception. It was born in wake of the 2008 financial crisis and the top cryptocurrency is now facing its first potential recession.

The result, is quite possibly the worst bear market in Bitcoin&#8217;s history, according to the LMACD. Monthly bearish momentum is the strongest ever &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com LMACD is the logarithmic version of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator. The original tool was created by Gerald Appel in the late 1970s, while this version is best used to compare historical momentum. When viewing the monthly LMACD for BTCUSD, the dashed zero line shows that in 2018, Bitcoin never even made it into bear territory. During this bear market, the MACD line in blue is also at the lowest point ever historically. The signal line in orange has never moved below the zero line, and could very well do so in this cycle. Has The Bitcoin Bull Trend Officially Ended? According to the Average Directional Index and each Direction Movement Indicator, bears are stronger than ever before, and have had the upper hand in crypto for the longest stretch ever.

The bull trend has ended, but will a new one begin? &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com Although the ADX shows the bull trend never quite concluded in 2018, the weaker trend strength overall explains why the returns stemming from the 2018 bottom, weren&#8217;t anywhere near the same as the rally from the 2015 bottom, which had significant strength at its back. With the bullish trend fizzling out, when bulls regain control and a new trend blossoms, it could be far more sustainable than what we have witnessed the last several years in crypto.

<p>Although the ADX shows the bull trend never quite concluded in 2018, the weaker trend strength overall explains why the returns stemming from the 2018 bottom, weren&#8217;t anywhere near the same as the rally from the 2015 bottom, which had significant strength at its back.</p>
<p>With the bullish trend fizzling out, when bulls regain control and a new trend blossoms, it could be far more sustainable than what we have witnessed the last several years in crypto.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Bitcoin continues to grind slowly to the downside while other major digital assets follow.

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum price closely followed that of bitcoin throughout the week and this saw the digital asset fall below the $1,200 level once more. Presently, the entire market looks to be consolidating but Ethereum has been put under some pressure following the activation of two whale addresses. These addresses which had not transacted for about half a decade had suddenly moved tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH between them. Five-Year-Old Whales Move $27 Million In the early hours of Monday, Lookonchain, an on-chain data tracker, took to Twitter to post the re-awakening of long-dormant Ethereum addresses. These addresses both held at least $10 million worth of ETH on their balances and had not seen any type of activity in the last five years, until today. Related Reading: Double-Digit Losses Brings Doge Below Critical Level, More Pain To Follow? Both wallets, seemingly out of nowhere, had first transferred out 1 ETH to a new wallet in what looks like test transactions. What followed was another large transaction that would empty out their balances.  The first wallet would transfer a total of 9,877 ETH in a single transaction, worth $11.7 million at current prices, while the second wallet would transfer out a total of 13,103.99 ETH in its second transaction, worth $15.5 million at press time. This brought their cumulative total transactions to more than $27 million. ETH stalls at $1,185 &#124; Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com All of the ETH was transferred to new, unknown wallets with no prior history besides the 1 ETH test transaction. The ETH is now sitting in these new Ethereum addresses and has not been touched so far. Bad News For Ethereum? The movement of such a large amount of ETH has stopped the digital asset in its tracks. So far, there has not been any meaningful movement in the Ethereum price which shows a lot of wariness on the part of investors and traders alike. However, despite the ETH from these whales being significant, it does not look to have any market impact since the coins were just moved from one storage wallet to another, as it seems. There has been no movement to centralized exchanges, and if this was a sale, it was an OTC trade which eliminates the pressure such a sale would have had on the open market.

The $1,200 support was flipped and is now a resistance level that bulls must beat to attain any momentum. This also drags the digital asset well below the 100-day moving average of $1,439, showing bearishness for the medium to long term. ETH’s price is currently trending at $1,180. It is down 5.22% in the last 7 days and saw trading volumes of approximately $4 billion in the last 24 hours. Featured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The native currency of the Tron network, TRX, is one of the few cryptocurrencies in the current altcoin market to experience a price hike. As of this writing, TRX has gained 0.2% on a daily basis, with a 6.1% increase seen on a monthly timeframe. A recent development might have something to do with this, as it pertained to the TRX environment. According to a tweet, the ecosystem has reportedly passed Binance&#8217;s BSC to become the No. 2 cryptocurrency in terms of total value locked. Despite this progress, the price of TRX was rejected at $0.055175, causing a fall to its current market price of $0.053740. The entire locked value of Tron has recently breached $4.30 billion, surpassing BSC by approximately $260 million. #TRON surpasses #BSC to become the 2nd largest chain by Total Value Locked on-chain! @justinsuntron seems to be one of the only people that&#8217;s doing well considering the fall of all the heroes of 2021 #TRX #TVL pic.twitter.com/L1I1L50yHE — Intuit Φ (@Intuit_Trading) December 17, 2022 Related Reading: Can Ethereum Prevent More Losses As Altcoin King ETH Slips 7% In Last 7 Days?

Meanwhile, TRX is somewhat correlated with ETH. The token itself has moved upward in the past weeks, making it one of the outliers in the altcoin market that did not depreciate when ETH was struggling. However, the token may be destined for further hammering. On December 16 it dropped a staggering 6.5 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates on this date. With more anticipated interest rate hikes, the coming days or weeks could be more difficult. Nonetheless, if this momentum continues, the Tron ecosystem will endure additional pain, as is already the case. Investors and traders can short TRX as downward price movements are more likely than bullish price increases. However, the debut of TNCH will certainly attract Chinese crypto enthusiasts who were previously prohibited by regulation.]]></description>

<h2>What Is The Impact On TRX?</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, TRX is somewhat correlated with ETH. The token itself has moved upward in the past weeks, making it one of the outliers in the altcoin market that did not depreciate when ETH was struggling.</p>
<p>However, the token may be destined for further hammering. On December 16 it dropped a staggering 6.5 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve hiked interest rates on this date.</p>
<p>With more anticipated interest<a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/stock-market/2022/12/15/493394/stocks-fall-as-fed-chief-hints-at-more-rate-hikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> rate hikes</a>, the coming days or weeks could be more difficult.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if this momentum continues, the Tron ecosystem will endure additional pain, as is already the case.</p>
<p>Investors and traders can short TRX as downward price movements are more likely than bullish price increases. However, the debut of TNCH will certainly attract Chinese crypto enthusiasts who were previously prohibited by regulation.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Besides the macroeconomic headwinds, when it comes to crypto, there are two main concerns at the moment: Binance and DCG. The situation surrounding Genesis Trading, Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Grayscale, which is still unresolved after a month, is depressing the market sentiment around Bitcoin. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, information has now leaked out again which might be a double-edged sword for investors. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the company would explore new options to return a portion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust&#8217;s capital to shareholders, as the GBTC currently trades at a record 49% discount to net asset value (NAV). That option is up for debate if the company fails to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund, according to a letter to investors. Related Reading: Binance Controversy Continues As Experts Warn Of Serious Fallouts Due To FUD As reported by WSJ, the option could include a tender offer for up to 20% of the trust&#8217;s $10.7 billion outstanding shares. A tender offer would be a direct appeal to shareholders to sell their shares at a specified price within a specified time period. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly rejected Grayscale&#8217;s applications to convert GBTC into a spot ETF, which is why Sonnenshein may now be considering the move. In June, Grayscale sued the SEC just hours after its ETF application was rejected. Last week, the SEC responded to the lawsuit for the first time, reiterating its position in a filing. Grayscale accuses the SEC of double standards by allowing futures ETFs on the market and repeatedly rejecting proposals for ETFs that invest in spot Bitcoin. The SEC&#8217;s rationale is that futures ETFs are closely monitored by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs lack this level of government oversight, the plea states.

Meanwhile, Sonnenshein emphasized: Grayscale products, including GBTC, remain safe, secure, and unencumbered. We remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is in the best interest of investors, and we remain 100% committed to that endeavor. Bitcoin Price Sits Above $16,700 Despite the news, the Bitcoin price held steady above $16,700 at press time. As recently as Friday, the broader crypto market experienced a sell-off after rumors surfaced that DCG might sell assets such as NEAR, Filecoin, and Ethereum Classic on a larger scale. However, apart from falling prices, there was no evidence to back this up. Nevertheless, there were some crypto Twitter analysts speculating about a sell-off by Grayscale&#8217;s parent company.

					<description><![CDATA[Further pain was inflicted on the markets as major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum slipped on macroeconomic pressures and other factors. As of time of writing, the top altcoin Ether has lost nearly 7% in the weekly timeframe. This is reflected in the other altcoins as most, if not all, move alongside ETH. However, if the crypto slides further downwards, will it deal a heavy blow on the broader market as well? Related Reading: Uniswap Stuck In The Ground As UNI Copes With Falling Network Activity The FTX Shockwave Still Felt Since the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Ethereum has been in the red, but then that seems normal as other cryptos are, as well. The decline in ETH&#8217;s value, however, began after it reached a record high of $4,635 in December of last year. Since then, the crypto has had massive highs and lows, but mostly the latter. With Ethereum network fees plummeting to $2.9 million per day from $12.8 million on June 13, the price of ether plunged. The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum-based smart contracts were also down by 4.5% in the last 24 hours. Other Factors At Play For ETH More suffering has been inflicted on ETH as a result of recent occurrences. For instance, the U.S. Federal Reserve raising interest rates last week took a toll on its price, allowing the bears to continue testing the present support price range of $1,164. Further market pain is to be predicted if the coin breaks its current support. The bulk of altcoins on the top 10 list of Coingecko are heavily correlated to ETH, so this is significant for the altcoin market. Thus, if ETH declines, other cryptocurrency holders may interpret this as a sign of market weakness, resulting in greater market misery. ETH is trading at $1,184, down 0.2% in the last 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin has been having a hard time recently, and it would appear that its struggles haven&#8217;t stopped yet as the coin has now dropped below Shiba Inu in terms of market cap. Litecoin Has Taken A 15% Beating During The Past Week While the last week has been red for most of the coins in the crypto market as the FUD due to the controversy around Binance&#8217;s Proof-of-Reserves has spread, LTC has taken an especially hard hit during the period. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $63, down 1% in the last 24 hours. Here is a chart that shows how the price of the asset has changed in the last five days: The value of the crypto seems to have gone down recently &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As the above graph displays, it was only a few days ago that Litecoin was still above the $75 level. The coin had been consolidating between this level and $80 since the last week of November, but now this sideways trend seems to have fully broken down as the coin has rapidly dropped in value during the last few days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prints Bearish Technical Pattern, Why It Could Continue Lower The asset has now lost the $65 level, which means it has almost entirely retraced the gains of the 22 November rally. As it currently stands, LTC is down almost 15% during the past week. For comparison, Bitcoin and Ethereum are only down 1% and 4%, respectively, in the same period. In terms of monthly returns, Litecoin holders are still in a profit of about 2%. The coin is still in the green for this period thanks to the strong November rally, which some thought would lead to a pre-halving bull run for the coin, as its halving, an event where its block production rate will be cut in half, is scheduled for next year. As it turns out, this rally wasn&#8217;t what some believed it would be, since LTC has already lost most of its gains. LTC Is Now Below Shiba Inu (SHIB) In Market Cap As a result of Litecoin&#8217;s recent sharp downtrend, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap has rapidly gone down. Since its competitors haven&#8217;t seen losses to such a degree, LTC&#8217;s market cap has seen a relatively sharper decline, leading to it dropping spots on the top cryptocurrency list based on market cap.

<p>In terms of monthly returns, Litecoin holders are still in a profit of about 2%. The coin is still in the green for this period thanks to the strong November rally, which some thought would lead to a pre-halving bull run for the coin, as its <a href="https://newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-bitcoin-halving-the-key-for-a-btc-price-bottom/">halving</a>, an event where its block production rate will be cut in half, is scheduled for next year. As it turns out, this rally wasn&#8217;t what some believed it would be, since LTC has already lost most of its gains.</p>
<h2>LTC Is Now Below Shiba Inu (SHIB) In Market Cap</h2>
<p>As a result of Litecoin&#8217;s recent sharp downtrend, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market cap has rapidly gone down. Since its competitors haven&#8217;t seen losses to such a degree, LTC&#8217;s market cap has seen a relatively sharper decline, leading to it dropping spots on the top cryptocurrency list based on <a href="https://newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-decline-sinks-15th-market-cap-list/">market cap</a>.</p>

<p>The below table shows where the asset stands in the wider crypto market at the moment.</p>

<p>Litecoin had recently dropped to 14th on this list, but its continued decline has meant that it has now lost the spot to meme coin Shiba Inu.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Binance rumors were the all-dominant topic last week after the FOMC meeting. Rumors of insufficient proof of reserves and the pullback from accounting firm Mazars, allegations of a bank run and insolvency, as well as CZ&#8217;s interview on CNBC have dragged the Bitcoin and crypto sentiment and prices down. Charles Edwards of Capriole Investments pointed out in a Twitter thread that this &#8220;FUD is really bad for the industry,&#8221; pointing out that there is &#8220;nothing&#8221; backed by data that is legitimately worrisome, &#8220;but when fear is great enough, it doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221; &#8220;If current withdrawal rates continue, expect more exchanges to go down &#8211; not from poor practices &#8211; but bankruptcy,&#8221; Edwards contended. Is The Binance FUD &#8220;Thinly Veiled Xenophobia&#8221;? The analyst suggests that all exchanges are being hit extremely hard by current market conditions. They have to deal with a price drop of more than 80%, a drop in trading volumes of more than 90% and a reduction of reserves by more than 50% &#8220;due to irrational panic.&#8221; As Edwards analyzes, even the U.S. exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Kraken have been hit badly. They are currently experiencing a 60% drop in their Bitcoin reserves over the past year. Addressing Bitcoin maxis, in particular, Edwards said: I love Bitcoin. But the maxis screaming for cold storage only, don&#8217;t realize that if everyone actually went to cold storage, your precious Bitcoin price would approach $0. Influencers spreading FUD are literally damaging the industry &#38; their net worth just to pump engagement. At the same time, Edwards emphasized that his opinion on Bitcoin has not changed. He said the current price movement is largely fueled by panic. Still, Edwards spoke from the heart of many crypto enthusiasts when he turned to Changpeng Zhao and said: And CZ, let&#8217;s stop dilly dallying and put this issue to bed with a _real_ audit. Edwards was joined by market analyst Alex Kruger, who denounced the people who view bank runs as healthy stress tests. Those people &#8220;clearly haven&#8217;t thought this through. When funds leave, trading activity diminishes, and so do trading fees. And then, many funds never come back.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin Plummets Below $17,000 After Audit Firm Mazars Pauses Work For Binance Ryan Selkis, the founder of Messari, claimed much of the Binance FUD is &#8220;thinly veiled xenophobia.&#8221; Selkis also added: &#8220;I&#8217;m all for the stress test on deposits and think it&#8217;s bad that such a high percentage of volumes runs through a single exchange. I also don&#8217;t love the tone of some of the critiques. Sorry!&#8221; Notably, on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant recently conducted an analysis of Binance&#8217;s reserves. The company&#8217;s data shows that the amount of BTC Binance said it held as liabilities at the time the PoR report was conducted is consistent with CryptoQuant&#8217;s reserve data. Conclusion: Our analysis should not be interpreted as a favorable opinion of Binance as a company or the BSC/BNB networks. Our data merely shows that the amount of BTC Binance says it holds as liabilities at the moment the PoR report was conducted matches our reserve data. &#8212; CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) December 15, 2022 Why Doesn&#8217;t Binance Take A Big Four Auditor?
