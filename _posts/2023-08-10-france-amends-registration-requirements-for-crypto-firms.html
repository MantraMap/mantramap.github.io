<p>The French financial regulator announced amendments to its registration requirements for digital asset service providers as it prepares for MiCA&rsquo;s implementation. </p>
<p>France&rsquo;s Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) announced it would introduce &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements for crypto firms as it prepared for the implementation of the EU&rsquo;s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework.</p>
Amendments to Align with MiCA
<p>The AMF has amended its registration requirements for digital asset service providers (DASPs) to better align with the EU&rsquo;s upcoming regulatory framework. The regulator said its &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; requirements will take effect on January 1, 2024.</p>
<p>In its announcement, the AMF said the changes have two objectives:</p>

<p>&ldquo;to incorporate into the General Regulation and its policy the provisions applicable to DASPs subject to &ldquo;enhanced&rdquo; registration. This regime will become mandatory from January 1, 2024, for new players wishing to provide the four services subject to mandatory registration;&rdquo;</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>&ldquo;align the requirements for DASPs licence with those for European authorisation for crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) under the MiCA Regulation, and allow a fast track procedure to be implemented towards CASP authorisation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>France already has a relatively comprehensive licensing regime for crypto firms and is implementing changes to its regulation to comply with MiCA which will take effect within the next 12 &ndash; 18 months.</p>
EU Signs MiCA Into Law
<p>The European Union announced in May that it formally signed MiCA into law. MiCA has been in the works for a long time and will introduce a comprehensive framework for licensing and regulating crypto businesses operating within the EU.</p>
<p>France has been one of the most welcoming countries for regulating the crypto sector. The governor of the Bank of France called for a stricter and more comprehensive licensing regime for crypto companies after 2022&rsquo;s market turmoil.</p>
<p>Recognising the need for heightened regulatory scrutiny, the French National Assembly voted on new measures for crypto regulation, including a new set of compliance frameworks for new crypto firms seeking registration in France.</p>
