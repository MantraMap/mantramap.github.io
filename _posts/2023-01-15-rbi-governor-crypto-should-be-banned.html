<p>India&rsquo;s regulators have yet again made their opinions on crypto known. The latest to reiterate the country&rsquo;s position on crypto is the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Shaktikanta Das, who has called for a complete ban. </p>
<p>The Governor of the RBI, Shaktikanta Das, while addressing the Business Today Banking and Economy Summit on Friday, again made the central bank&rsquo;s stance on cryptocurrencies clear, reiterating the significance of banning the industry. Das described the crypto trade as &ldquo;nothing but gambling&rdquo; adding that the definition of crypto remains &ldquo;very unclear.&rdquo; Das went as far as to say their perceived &ldquo;value is nothing but make-believe.&rdquo; The Governor used very dismissive language while describing cryptocurrencies and argued that there is no valid reason to acknowledge crypto as an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; or even a &ldquo;financial product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Das also asserted:</p>

<p>Since we don&rsquo;t allow gambling in our country, and if you want to allow gambling, treat it as gambling and lay down the rules for gambling. But crypto is not a financial product.</p>

<p>The Governor warned that legalizing cryptocurrencies would lead to more dollarization of the economy adding that crypto masquerading as a financial asset is a misplaced argument. Das also referred to the risk that could see the RBI lose control over the country&rsquo;s money supply. The substantiate this argument he mentioned the fact that &ldquo;20 percent of transactions are happening through crypto,&rdquo; none of which are authorized or regulated by the central bank. Governor Das further made reference to the age-old argument against cryptocurrencies &ndash; their price volatility, noting:</p>

<p>The volatility in prices is based on the make-believe concept where a particular crypto&rsquo;s price can go up or down. So, anything that comes without any underline whose valuations is entirely dependent on make-believe is just 100 percent speculation or it can be bluntly termed as gambling.</p>

<p>The Governor also recently made a bold statement saying that cryptocurrencies should be banned, and if allowed to grow, might cause the next financial crisis.</p>
