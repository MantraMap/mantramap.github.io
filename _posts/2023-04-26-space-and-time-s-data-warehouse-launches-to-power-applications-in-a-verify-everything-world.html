<p>Austin, United States, April 26th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Space and Time, a leader in decentralized data, today announces the beta release of its data warehouse and developer suite. Space and Time allows developers to leverage provable computation against on-chain and off-chain data to power dapps, smart contracts and verifiable AI models. As AI becomes increasingly integrated in modern business applications and processes, the Space and Time data warehouse aims to ensure that AI models are trained on accurate, verifiable, tamperproof data. To participate in the Space and Time beta, sign up through this link: https://www.spaceandtime.io/access-beta</p><p>Space and Time is a decentralized hybrid (HTAP) data warehouse that powers low-latency transactional queries and scalable analytics in a single cluster. Space and Time has developed a novel zero-knowledge proof called Proof of SQL, which cryptographically proves that query computation was done accurately and that both the query and the data are verifiably tamperproof.&nbsp;</p><p>Space and Time comes pre-loaded with blockchain data indexed from major chains, decoded and provided for free. The data warehouse also includes pre-built APIs for SQL operations, blockchain data, Kafka streaming and security, as well as a Tamperproof Python service for easily extracting, transforming and loading data or running complex computations.</p><p>&ldquo;We are thrilled to open the Space and Time data warehouse and suite of data services to developers everywhere,&rdquo; said Nate Holiday, CEO and Co-founder of Space and Time. &ldquo;Space and Time is enabling a new era of data verifiability. As smart contracts and AI are increasingly integrated into business processes, Space and Time aims to ensure that they&rsquo;re connected to and trained on verifiable data and computation.&rdquo;</p><p>Space and Time&rsquo;s dapp, a next-generation data frontend, provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with on-chain and off-chain data. OpenAI enabled, the dapp allows developers to easily generate SQL queries, Python scripts, streams, oracle jobs, smart contracts, dashboards, and more from simple natural-language inputs.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI, a Microsoft-backed AI research and deployment company, is already making waves beyond the tech industry. Earlier this year, management consulting firm Bain &amp; Company announced a services alliance with OpenAI to offer AI capabilities to its global clients, including Coca-Cola.</p><p>&ldquo;AI is shaping the future of business operations in an unprecedented way,&rdquo; said John Kanan, Senior Partner at Bain &amp; Company. &ldquo;As we move further into the age of AI, enterprises need to develop a focused strategy for leveraging its benefits. The assurance that AI is being trained on verifiable data and computation should instill confidence in enterprises seeking to incorporate it into critical business processes.&rdquo;</p><p>Space and Time is showcasing its newly launched data warehouse at this year&rsquo;s Consensus conference in a live demo with Shrapnel, the highly anticipated blockchain-enabled AAA first-person shooter game. Attendees of the conference will be able to play the Shrapnel prototype as Space and Time generates live analytic insights around gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Web3 analytics are going to be critical to the success of blockchain games and Space and Time has the best service available.&rdquo; said Mark Long, CEO of Shrapnel. &ldquo;Just like any Web2 free-to-play game, realtime analytics are how you improve the player experience. You need lightning-fast execution of data from on-chain transactions to in-game activity to leaderboards and more. And players want to know that all the data is accurate and verifiable. Space and Time is just the perfect complement to Shrapnel&rsquo;s own blockchain and live-ops tech.&rdquo;</p><p>Space and Time&rsquo;s ability to join tamperproof on-chain and off-chain data and connect the results back to smart contracts enables new, robust possibilities for blockchain gaming. Space and Time can relay information to and from a game&rsquo;s servers and its smart contract in real time, to improve the game&rsquo;s recommendation engines and match-making, help players understand what NFTs, weapons, and upgrades they should be buying, and facilitate more complex earning schemes on-chain.</p><p>Space and Time Product Day, presented by HashKey Capital, is an exclusive event showcasing the latest cutting-edge technology in data warehousing and Web3. Product Day, which takes place on Wednesday, April 26 during the Consensus conference, will be followed by an open Space and Time Ecosystem Night presented by Chainlink.&nbsp;</p>About Space and Time<p>Space and Time is the first Web3-native decentralized data warehouse that joins tamperproof on-chain and off-chain data to deliver enterprise use cases to smart contracts. Space and Time has developed a novel cryptography called Proof of SQL&#8480; that allows developers to connect analytics directly to smart contracts, opening up a wealth of powerful new use cases and business logic on blockchain technology. Space and Time is built from the ground up as a multichain data platform for developers in financial services, gaming, DeFi, or any project requiring verifiable data across enterprise, blockchain and AI.</p><p>For more information, visit: Website | Twitter | Discord | Telegram | LinkedIn | YouTube</p>About Shrapnel<p>Shrapnel is the world&rsquo;s first blockchain-enabled AAA first-person shooter game.
