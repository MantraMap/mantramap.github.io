<p>On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $17,280 level. The first major resistance is near the $17,450 zone, above which the price may perhaps start another steady increase. In the stated case, the price could rise towards the $18,000 resistance. The next major resistance is near $18,250, above which the price rise towards the $18,500 zone in the near term.</p>
<h2>Dips Supported in BTC?</h2>
<p>If bitcoin fails to clear the $17,280 resistance, there could be a fresh bearish reaction. An immediate support on the downside is near the $17,100 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $17,000 zone and the 100 hourly simple moving average. A downside break below the $17,000 support might call a drop towards $16,700. Any more losses might push the price towards the $16,200 zone in the near term.</p>
