<ul><li>Senator Ted Cruz has introduced a bill to enable crypto payments at restaurants and vending machines on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</li><li>The bill also recommends gift shops accept cryptocurrency from customers.&nbsp;</li><li>No particular cryptocurrency has been mentioned in the bill.&nbsp;</li><li>Senator Cruz purchased Bitcoin in 2022 and has publicly supported Bitcoin mining.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Ted Cruz, the Republican Senator from Texas, has introduced a bill in the Senate for vendors in Capitol Hill to accept cryptocurrency payments. In a major push for wider adoption of crypto, the Texas lawmaker filed a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/volume-169/issue-16/senate-section/article/S103-3" rel="nofollow noopener">concurrent resolution</a> earlier this week cited as the “Adopting Cryptocurrency in Congress as an Exchange of Payment for Transactions Resolution” or the “ACCEPT Resolution”.</p>



<h2><strong>Crypto payments at restaurants, gift shops, and vending machines</strong></h2>



<p>The proposed bill calls for officials within the House of Representatives and the Senate to work with “persons that will accept digital assets as payment for goods” and food services. This includes the Architect of the Capitol, the Secretary of the Senate, and the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives.</p>



<p>The bill does not need the President’s signature to come into effect. Approval from the Senate and the House of Representatives would do. If approved, the bill would enable crypto payments at restaurants and vending machines within Capitol buildings. It also encourages gift shops in the Capitol area to accept cryptocurrency as payment from customers. As of now, no particular cryptocurrency has been named in the bill.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I like Bitcoin because the government can’t control it.&#8221;</p><cite>Senator Ted Cruz</cite></blockquote>



<p>Senator Ted Cruz has publicly supported <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-developer-loses-3-6-million-bitcoins-hack/">Bitcoin</a> and its mining. A <a href="https://efdsearch.senate.gov/search/view/ptr/fcb0d9dc-aba4-4fa0-a15b-afed9107a34a/" rel="nofollow noopener">financial disclosure</a> from early 2022 shows that he bought between $15,000 and $50,000 worth of BTC. At the time Bitcoin was trading at $36,000. At the <a href="https://www.texasblockchainsummit.org/past-speakers" rel="nofollow noopener">Texas Blockchain Summit</a> held in November 2022, the senator publicly supported Bitcoin mining. He presented his home state as the optimal region to facilitate Bitcoin mining with an abundant energy supply and substantial investment. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>MinSwap and MuesliSwap will support Cardano&#8217;s stablecoin Djed with token listings as well as liquidity pools to attract investors.</li><li>Crypto exchange Bitrue will also list the coin and its governance token Shen.</li><li>Developers expect to launch Djed sometime next week across over 40 Cardano-native DeFi protocols.</li></ul>



<p>Cardano’s crypto-backed stablecoin Djed will receive backing from two decentralized exchanges &#8211; MinSwap and Muesliswap. Both DEXs disclosed support for the token ahead of its launch expected to happen next week. </p>



<p>The two exchanges plan to list Djed as well as the token’s governance crypto dubbed Shen. MinSwap which is currently the biggest dex on ADA’s chain promised to list pairs for both Djed and Shen. Both tokens will also be added to a liquidity pool to attract investors and field returns for liquidity providers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers plan to support up to 25% APR on ADA/DJED and ADA/SHED pairs to propel the stablecoin, per reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DeFiLlama data showed that MinSwap boasts over $30 million worth of tokens in total value locked (TVL). MuesliSwap has around $6.5 million in TVL at press time. Another crypto exchange, Bitrue, also <a href="https://cotinetwork.medium.com/djed-is-scheduled-to-launch-next-week-b9a4667710c3" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cotinetwork.medium.com/djed-is-scheduled-to-launch-next-week-b9a4667710c3" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> support for the Djed stablecoin. CoinMarketCap ranked Bitrue at 26 among crypto exchanges and the platform has over $1.7 billion in daily trading volume. </p>



<h2>Cardano’s Crypto-Backed Stablecoin -Djed</h2>



<p>Developers have touted Djed as one of the first crypto-backed stablecoins on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cardano-1-billion-market-cap-bear-rally/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cardano-1-billion-market-cap-bear-rally/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano</a>. Teams from blockchain company Coti and Input Output collaborated to build the coin. Per reports, Djed was worked on for more than a year before developers announced plans to launch. </p>



<p>The token leverages an over-collateralization mechanism. In other words, issuing the token requires excess collateral of at least 400%. Djed’s collateral will be held in cryptocurrency in a similar fashion to Maker’s Dai stablecoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upon launch, Djed will roll out across over 40 Cardano decentralized finance platforms and gain exposure to ADA’s $72 million ecosystem. Djed’s developers also promised a dashboard and a snapshot mechanism to allow Shen holders to track rewards.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>As part of our effort to stake the ADA that is deposited to the Djed smart contract and generate extra rewards for $SHEN holders, we are developing a snapshot mechanism and UI that will be added to djed.xyz, where $SHEN holders will be able to track these extra rewards.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The crypto exchange was raided by South Korean prosecutors investigating price manipulation linked to an unnamed coin.</li><li>Authorities noted that the operation was a &#8220;search and seizure&#8221; of transaction records tied to the token and had little to do with Bithumb itself.</li><li>The crypto exchange is also being scrutinized for tax evasion and its Chairman Kang Jong-Hyun was accused of fraud in a separate case.</li></ul>



<p>Bithumb offices in South Korea were stormed on Thursday by local authorities investigating token price manipulation, media house Yonhap news <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230126165500004?input=1195m" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> late yesterday. The crypto exchange is one of five crypto trading venues still running in South Korea after a major crackdown on digital asset service providers in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per the report, prosecutors conducted “a search and seizure to secure the transaction details of a specific coin”. An official added that the raid was not targeted specifically at Bithumb and that other crypto exchanges might be probed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The coin in question was not named for reasons that authorities are yet to share. South Korean investigators only noted that illicit profits were gained from price manipulation. It’s unclear whether the suspect is an individual or a group.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Bithumb Under Tax Evasion Probe</h2>



<p>Earlier in January, The National Tax Service opened an investigation on the crypto exchange for possible code violations. The watchdog pointed to transactions both local and international across Bithumb’s Korean division, its holding company, and other affiliates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The platform was also probed in 2018 for back taxes but the charges were dropped. Former Chairman Lee Jung-Hoon was also cleared of charges in a $100 million fraud case at the start of January 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>South Korean Prosecutors On High Alert After Terra</h2>



<p>Local authorities have opened <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/crypto-exchanges-south-korea-regulators/">a myriad of probes</a> on the crypto industry following the $40 billion implosion of Do Kwon’s TerraLuna and TerraUST. Kwon remains wanted in 195 countries due to an Interpol arrest warrant. South Korean law enforcement also moved to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/the-pressure-on-do-kwon-intensifies-as-south-korean-authorities-move-forward-with-the-plan-to-invalidate-the-luna-founders-passport/">invalidate his passport</a> and<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/south-korean-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-terraform-founder-do-kwon/"> issued papers for Kwon’s arrest</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The raid on Bithumb comes months after prosecutors stormed the offices of seven exchanges in search of records connected to Do Kwon’s empire.</p>

<ul><li>Aave purchased 2.7 million CRV earlier today to clear a bad debt from last year.&nbsp;</li><li>The bad debt was the result of a failed exploit by Avraham Eisenberg.&nbsp;</li><li>The governance vote to clear the debt saw overwhelming support from The DeFi protocol’s community.&nbsp;</li><li>AAVE’s price has gone up more than 10% since the execution of the proposal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Aave has executed Aave Improvement Protocol (AIP) 144, which seeks to clear the bad debt of 2.7 million Curve DAO Tokens (CRV) on the Ethereum v2 liquidity pool. The bad debt was the result of an exploit orchestrated by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-files-charges-against-mango-markets-exploiter-avraham-eisenberg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avraham Eisenberg</a>&nbsp;in November 2022. Eisenberg is also responsible for exploiting Mango Markets to the tune of $117 million in October last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Aave community approves the proposal with no opposition</strong></h2>



<p>The exploit by Avraham Eisenberg involved several high-volume short CRV positions on the DeFi lending protocol in order to liquidate the positions of developers by forcing a short squeeze. However, Eisenberg was himself liquidated after a sudden spike in price. The result was a CRV bad debt worth approximately $1.6 million at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposal to clear this debt was initially put forward at Aave’s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-repay-excess-crv-debt-on-ethereum-v2/10955" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">governance forum</a>&nbsp;last month. Following a positive response from the community, the proposal went live for voting on 22 January 2023 and saw 100% of the community in favor. The&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=146" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">execution</a>&nbsp;soon followed, which involved using the protocol’s USDC holding to acquire 2.7 million CRV. A swap contract with a cap of $3.1 million was deployed to acquire the tokens with a maximum price of $1.15 per CRV.</p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aave/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AAVE</a>&nbsp;has seen a significant price appreciation following the execution of AIP 144. The token rose more than 10% going from $79.8 to $88.7 the following day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This isn’t the only governance vote that was inspired by Eisenberg’s attempted exploit. Within 24 hours of the exploit, a governance proposal was posted on the forum. The <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">proposal</a> sought to decommission low liquidity asset pools including CRV. It was executed following approval from the community. </p>

<p>Lawyers of FTX recently filed a <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/9hVtHdm/746caf04-a236-4598-a1bc-825f889bf35d-1-pdf#page=77" rel="nofollow noopener">creditor matrix</a> in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. The filing contains the highly anticipated list of creditors that are owed money by the bankrupt crypto exchange. The 116-page long document revealed the names of celebrities, airlines, federal agencies, and fellow crypto firms, all creditors of Sam Bankman-Fried’s <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-ceo-says-exchange-may-be-restarted/">bankrupt crypto exchange</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX owes money to Coinbase, Yuga Labs, Microsoft, etc. </strong></h2>



<p>The list was put together by Alvarez &amp; Marsal North America, the financial advisory firm hired by FTX. The creditor list shows the lavish lifestyle that Sam Bankman-Fried and his firm’s management engaged in. Not only does it prove the reckless spending of the firm’s management, but it also provides an insight into the severity and the reach of the impact of the crypto exchange’s collapse. </p>



<p>Firms from various sectors including hospitality, airlines, IT, entertainment, and news can be found on the list. This includes luxury resorts like Hyatt, tech giants like Google and Apple, sports companies like the Miami Heat and Mercedes AMG F1, and fellow crypto firms like Coinbase, Huobi, and Binance among others. Funnily enough, names like DoorDash and UberEats on the creditor list point to the exchange&#8217;s unpaid food bills.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The list also contains the names of regulatory agencies from around the world including Japan’s Financial Services Agency, Canada’s Ontario Securities Commission, and the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission. Within the U.S., FTX owes money to more than a dozen federal agencies spread across the country. Kevin O’Leary, Tom Brady, and Naomi Osaka are some of the celebrities that are owed by the exchange. The creditors also include Open AI, a popular artificial intelligence startup that was in the news recently following a partnership with Microsoft, another one of FTX’s creditors.</p>

<p>Initially, the decentralized exchange which runs atop Solana’s blockchain offered Eisenberg and his team $47 million as a bug bounty. The offer was based on the condition that Eisenberg returns $67 million in stolen digital assets which he did.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Mango Markets seeks to reclaim the remainder of Avraham’s stolen loot in damages.</p>



<p>Eisenberg admitted to being involved in the incident but claimed he executed “a highly profitable trading strategy” rather than an exploit on the decentralized exchange. Later in December 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice slammed Eisenberg with market manipulation charges and he was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mango-markets-avraham-eisenberg-arrested/">arrested shortly after in Puerto Rico</a>.</p>



<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) also accused the self-proclaimed game theorist of leveraging token swaps to steal funds from Mango Markets via a “manipulative and deceptive scheme”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the CFTC’s complaint, Eisenberg violated federal commodities laws and his actions constituted a <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-files-charges-against-mango-markets-exploiter-avraham-eisenberg/">blatant manipulation</a> of spot prices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Mango Markets Hit In Worst Month For DeFi Hacks</h2>



<p>Mango Markets was one of several decentralized finance platforms hacked in October 2022, now known as the worst month of DeFi hacks in crypto’s history. Indeed, illicit actors stole north of $3 billion in digital assets from </p>



<p>Hacktober crowned a turbulent year for DeFi amid slumped crypto prices and uncertainty in the broader financial market. Ronin bridge was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ronin-network-hacked-for-173-6k-ethereum-and-25-5m-usdc/">exploited</a> for over $600 million in March 2022, the largest single hack in DeFi to date.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other decentralized protocols like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/north-koreas-lazarus-group-moves-funds-tied-to-100-million-harmony-bridge-hack/">Harmony</a>, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/largest-cryptocurrency-hack-of-2022-so-far-more-than-321m-stolen-from-wormhole-bridge/">Wormhole</a>, and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/wintermutes-suffers-160-million-hack/">Wintermute’s DeFi operations</a> were also exploited for hundreds of millions.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The Aptos token (APT) has reached an all-time high price of $17.2.&nbsp;</li><li>The token has skyrocketed more than 370% since the beginning of the year.</li><li>A series of high-profile partnerships over the past month have contributed to this unprecedented rally.&nbsp;</li><li>On-chain metrics suggest that traders expect the momentum to run out soon.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Aptos became arguably the most talked about layer 1 blockchain today after its native token&nbsp;<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">APT</a>&nbsp;reached an all-time high price of $11.2. The token has been in a rather impressive uptrend since the beginning of this year, going from $3.4 on 1 January all the way to $17.2.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Aptos skyrockets 400%</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The unprecedented rally of more than 370% this early into 2023 has made Aptos rather popular among crypto circles on social media, given the overall bearish sentiment in the market. Earlier today, APT became the center of a feud among high-profile crypto influencers who alleged&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/HsakaTrades/status/1618055402129874949" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">manipulation</a>&nbsp;of the token’s price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The rally can be attributed to the partnerships that Aptos secured over the past month. The deployment of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://pancakeswap.finance/voting/proposal/0x959b9da76401a7a3fb73e417b69ef51859383bd523d887350ae9f69148fc26a8?chain=bsc" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PancakeSwap</a>&nbsp;earlier this month marked the beginning of the rally. The popular decentralized exchange (DEX) announced that it had agreed to a multichain deployment to the layer 1 blockchain, leading to a price appreciation of 48% in the following days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was followed by integration into&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/AtomicWallet/status/1613854034179522560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1613854034179522560%7Ctwgr%5E484c9fcfc6f2f3504d7a1e71372336549175bbfe%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdecrypt.co%2F119879%2Faptos-soars-week-leading-layer-1-token-rally" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomic Wallet</a>&nbsp;and growing interest in NFT marketplaces on Aptos. Despite being&nbsp;<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/aptos-mainnet-butt-of-jokes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a>&nbsp;just three months ago, the blockchain has managed to grow significantly. With a market capitalization of $2.7 billion, APT has become the 26th largest crypto. The growing popularity has attracted opportunistic traders, leading to a 142% surge in the token’s trading volume over the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, the latest trading volume came in at $2.1 billion, rather close to the token’s market cap. The high trading volume isn’t necessarily a positive metric. Data from on-chain analytics firm&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coinglass</a>&nbsp;shows that the total open interest on APT futures has increased by more than 81% since yesterday. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Liquidation data</a>&nbsp;on Coinglass revealed that the token had $14.5 million worth of shorts against longs totaling $2.2 million. One might argue that the heavy betting on shorts indicates that traders expect the momentum to run out soon.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Celsius will process the withdrawals of certain customers following authorization by the bankruptcy court.&nbsp;</li><li>A second court order authorized a Flare token airdrop to eligible XRP holders on the platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The firm’s lawyers have floated the idea of issuing a new token to repay its customers.&nbsp;</li><li>The native token CEL and Flare have lost more than 7% of their value since the court orders came out.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a recent court hearing, a bankruptcy judge authorized Celsius to process the withdrawal requests of certain customers. The court order comes as a relief to the bankrupt <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-mashinsky-sued-fraud-ny/">crypto lender</a>’s customers who have been waiting since July 2022 to access their funds.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Celsius to return funds and airdrop Flare </strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174901242380000000152.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">court order</a>, Celsius has been authorized to return the cryptocurrency that its customers had deposited before it filed for bankruptcy last year. Customers will be able to withdraw their funds &#8220;net of any gas fees or transaction costs in order to effectuate the withdrawal or transfer of digital assets&#8221;. However, all withdrawals would have to be in the form of crypto, no fiat withdrawals will be permitted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Martin Glenn also signed a second <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174901242380000000158.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">order</a>, which authorized the bankrupt crypto lender to airdrop Flare tokens to eligible account holders i.e, customers who held at least 1 XRP during the XRP snapshot. The snapshot was taken in December 2020 and qualifies the holders to receive 1 FLR for every XRP in their account.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers representing Celsius floated the idea of issuing a new crypto token to repay the firm’s creditors. The new token was part of a broader plan to restructure the company as a publicly traded “recovery corporation”. Per this plan, creditors would receive Asset Share Tokens (AST) that reflect the value of their assets. The plan is yet to be approved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tokens associated with Celsius and the court hearing have taken a considerable hit. Since the court orders went public, the native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celsius/" rel="nofollow noopener">CEL</a> has lost more than 7% of its value. Meanwhile, the price of Flare (<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flare/" rel="nofollow noopener">FLR</a>) has gone down 8%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The MakerDAO proposal to earn yield from a Yearn Finance vault was backed by the governance community.</li><li>Yearn Finance&#8217;s special investment vehicle or vault has a cap of $100 million.</li><li>The USD Coin treasury allocation from Dai&#8217;s developer will earn a 2% annual yield if approved by an executive vote. </li></ul>



<p>The MakerDAO governance community <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/Qma4jEPY#vote-breakdown" rel="nofollow noopener">backed</a> a proposal to deploy $100 million of Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) in a Yearn Finance yield-generating account called a “vault”. The proposal was submitted on January 9, 2023 as the DAI stablecoin operator looks to diversify its treasury allocations and earn yield. </p>



<p>MIP92 which stands for Maker Improvement Proposal suggested investing $100 million USDC in Yearn Finance’s vault account to earn around 2% yield annually. This means that the protocol stands to make $2 million every year on its YearnFi investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yearn Finance is a yield aggregator developed by the acclaimed “Godfather of DeFi”, Andre Cronje. The decentralized finance protocol runs atop Ethereum’s blockchain and allows users to deposit assets in the service in exchange for yield or interest. </p>



<p>A total of 68 votes were cast with 95,666.284 of Maker’s native token MKR used to back the decisions. 71.56% of the votes supported the proposal to deploy USDC in Yearn Finance while 28.44% stood against the idea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next step for MIP92 involves an executive vote before the proposal is either binned or implemented in Maker’s protocol.</p>



<h2>MakerDAO, Other DeFi Protocols Pick USDC For Investments</h2>



<p>This is not MakerDAO’s first time depositing USDC in DeFi yield-generating platforms. Indeed, the DAI issuer has previous treasury allocations in protocols like Aave and Compound. The project also reviewed a Coinbase proposal to park $1.6 billion USDC to earn 1.5% annual yield back in September 2022.</p>



<p>Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is considering a proposal to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-name-service-proposes-auction/">swap 10,000 Ether</a> (ETH) for 13 million worth of USDC in a Gnosis auction. The ENS community member opined that bolstering the platform&#8217;s USDC reserves will secure operational liquidity enough for 24 months. </p>



<p>Despite being the second-largest stablecoin in the crypto market, protocols seemingly tilt towards Circle’s dollar-backed token when making DeFi bets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Financial Times reported that the U.S. SEC was the sole factor that blocked Circle from going public.</li><li>CEO Jeremey Allaire said in December that his firm could not meet the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;qualification in time&#8221;.</li><li>The crypto payments company was set to go public in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal with Bob Diamond&#8217;s Concord Acquisition.</li></ul>



<p>Crypto stablecoin company Circle named the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as the sole reason why its special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal fell through, the Financial Times <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/10bfdb8e-3a16-4bd2-a979-2d4b4c86ea41" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, CEO Jeremy Allaire announced the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circles-spac-deal-concord-will-not-happen/">termination</a> of the SPAC agreement with Concord Acquisition back in early December 2022. Concord was founded by veteran investment banker Bob Diamond in 2021 amid a pulsating bull market cycle where assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum peaked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In July 2021 Circle unveiled the SPAC proposal with Concord in a deal that would double the crypto company’s valuation to a staggering $9 billion. Allaire’s form submitted its first SEC filing toward the move in August 2021, per reports.</p>



<p>Allaire’s update on the deal in December noted that his firm did not meet an SEC qualification time regarding an S-4 registration filing. Companies file S-4 documents with the SEC to secure authorization to offer new shares.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FT reported that the SEC did not declare Circle’s S-4 registration effective and the crypto company disclosed delayed feedback from the regulator, noting that there was “an awfully long time waiting for approvals”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Allaire said in December that the crypto payments processor retained intentions to go public despite the failed SPAC deal.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Circle Boosts Trust In USDC With Deloitte Partnership&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The USDC issuer stunned competitors when the company announced an auditing partnership with “Big Four” accounting firm Deloitte. Circle revealed the news alongside its first annual “state of the USDC economy” <a href="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-releases-first-annual-state-of-the-usdc-economy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-releases-first-annual-state-of-the-usdc-economy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Our history of pioneering transparency underscores our commitment to providing USDC holders and the general public with open, timely reporting on how we minimize risk and maintain liquidity in the USDC reserve.</p></blockquote>



<p>USDC remained the second-largest stablecoin token in the world with a market cap of around $43 billion, dipping from over $55 billion in June 2022 following a series of spectacular implosions in the crypto market. Only Tether’s USDT currently beats Circle’s USD Coin for the top stablecoin spot.&nbsp;</p>
