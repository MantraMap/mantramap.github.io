Among them, 22 nations have formally applied for membership. He believes that the BRICS group could expand to include more than 50 countries.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Group Attracts More Than 40 Nations</h2>
<p>Anil Sooklal, South Africa&#8217;s top diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, and officials from the South African foreign affairs department shared the latest stats on BRICS membership applications in a press conference in Johannesburg on Thursday. South Africa will host this year’s BRICS summit. The economic bloc comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Sooklal revealed that 22 countries have formally asked to join the BRICS. He was also quoted by Reuters as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>An equal number of countries … have informally expressed interest in becoming BRICS members &#8230; (including) all the major global south countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Countries interested in joining the BRICS include Argentina, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Comoros, Gabon, and Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>The BRICS leaders’ summit will take place on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg, with one of the key topics on the agenda being the discussion of BRICS expansion. Russian President Vladimir Putin, however, will not be attending in person.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sooklal emphasized the rapid expansion of the BRICS bloc. The diplomat was quoted by IOL news outlet as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>With the expansion of BRICS, it could increase to include more than 50 countries.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the topics that has received worldwide attention is the proposed common BRICS currency. Russian news outlet RT recently <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that the BRICS nations are launching a gold-backed currency that will be announced at the August summit. However, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, has insisted that the BRICS <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">does not have an immediate plan</a> to create a common currency to challenge the dominance of the USD.</p>
<p>According to IOL, Sooklal said the topic of BRICS currency is not on the summit agenda. He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will expand on addressing the idea of deepening interaction in trading in local currencies. Countries want to have greater flexibility and to be less dependent on the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said in June that he intends to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting/">raise the issue of de-dollarization</a> at the summit. He has been vocal about countries ditching the U.S. dollar in global trade and using their national currencies instead. The Brazilian leader has also expressed support for the creation of a common BRICS currency.</p>

The global investment bank&#8217;s strategists anticipate &#8220;partial de-dollarization,&#8221; in which the Chinese yuan gradually assumes a more significant role in global trade.</strong></p>
<h2>JPMorgan on De-Dollarization Threat</h2>
<p>Global investment bank JPMorgan has warned that the dominance of the U.S. dollar could be at risk due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as concerns about political instability within the United States.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s strategists, led by Jan Loeys and Joyce Chang, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-18/jpmorgan-strategists-says-market-fails-to-reflect-threats-to-dollar-dominance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> in a report published on Tuesday that the markets are not adequately factoring in the risk of a “rapid and deep” decline in the U.S. dollar&#8217;s status as the preferred currency for global reserves and trade. They detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>If U.S.-China tensions intensify and we get more global fragmentation, it would likely lead to de-globalization in trade and finance … In finance, it could also lead to de-dollarization.</p></blockquote>
<p>The strategists pointed out that the main factor that could jeopardize the dollar&#8217;s dominance is the political dysfunction within the U.S. They cautioned that this dysfunction could hinder efforts to manage the national debt and prevent the government from stabilizing the economy during a crisis. The U.S. recently averted <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-revises-debt-default-date-us-government-could-exhaust-funds-by-june-5/">defaulting</a> on its debt obligations at the last minute as politicians sparred over debt ceiling limits.</p>
<p>Moreover, the JPMorgan strategists emphasized the potential danger arising from an intensifying rivalry between the U.S. and China, which they described as a possible &#8220;Cold War 2.0.&#8221; They noted that China&#8217;s ambitious economic reforms, which include measures like easing capital constraints and promoting market liquidity, could erode the dollar&#8217;s dominance.</p>

<p>JPMorgan has also warned that a shift away from the U.S. dollar or destabilizing shocks to its value could have broad consequences across multiple asset classes. The bank noted that this could lead to a decrease in the dollar&#8217;s value, lower equity multiples, and higher bond yields.</p>
<p>While the USD may lose its dominance, the strategists believe that it is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jpmorgan-expects-dollar-dominance-to-persist-even-if-china-overtakes-us-as-worlds-largest-economy/">unlikely to be completely replaced</a> as the primary reserve currency within the next decade. Instead, they anticipate a more plausible scenario of “partial de-dollarization,” in which China gradually assumes a more significant role in place of the greenback among nations that are not aligned with the U.S.</p>
<p>Various individuals, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-predicts-end-of-us-dollar-dominance-as-more-countries-de-dollarize/">S&amp;P Global economist</a> Paul Gruenwald, have foreseen the potential decline of the dollar&#8217;s dominance. Nobel laureate <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nobel-laureate-paul-krugman-says-us-dollar-dominance-wont-last-forever-but-doubts-chinese-yuan-can-replace-usd/">Paul Krugman</a> also recently said the dollar&#8217;s dominance won&#8217;t last forever but he doubts that the Chinese yuan could replace the greenback.</p>

<h2>Fednow Officially Live</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20230720a.htm">announced</a> Thursday that its new system for instant payments, the Fednow Service, has launched with 35 participating banks and credit unions, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and 16 service providers. Participating financial institutions include BNY Mellon, JPMorgan Chase, Peoples Bank, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo Bank.</p>
<p>“The Fednow Service is designed to maintain uninterrupted 24x7x365 processing with security features to support payment integrity and data security,” the Federal Reserve detailed, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fednow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fed Chair Jerome Powell commented Thursday: “The Federal Reserve built the Fednow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient.” He continued: “Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid.”</p>
<p>Functioning as an interbank payment system, the Fednow Service operates alongside other well-established Federal Reserve payment services like Fedwire and FedACH. The Fed’s announcement described:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve is committed to working with the more than 9,000 banks and credit unions across the country to support the widespread availability of this service for their customers over time.</p></blockquote>

<p>Many people took to Twitter to comment on the new Fednow Service. A number of individuals believe that its launch paves the way for a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/is-fednow-the-first-step-towards-a-central-bank-digital-currency-speculations-rise-ahead-of-launch/">central bank digital currency</a>. However, the Federal Reserve has insisted that the Fednow Service is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/not-related-to-a-digital-currency-us-central-bank-addresses-concerns-over-fednow-payment-network/">not related</a> to a CBDC.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the Fednow Service eliminates the need for cryptocurrencies. Omid Malekan, adjunct professor at Columbia Business School, <a href="https://twitter.com/malekanoms/status/1682056456529387520">explained</a>: &#8220;Arguing that Fednow eliminates the need for crypto (or even stablecoins) is like arguing in 2005 that replacing VHS rented from Blockbuster with DVDs eliminated the need for streaming. P.S. Fednow is 25 year old tech. America is just really late to the game.&#8221;</p>

The authority also emphasized the importance for businesses to inform customers about potential “risks that may arise” with dealing with crypto assets not prohibited outside of Kuwait. </strong></p>
<h2>Kuwait&#8217;s Regulator Warns Businesses of Consequences for Non-compliance Toward Crypto Ban</h2>
<p>On July 18, 2023, Kuwait&#8217;s Capital Markets Authority, the regulator for financial instruments and securities in the Gulf nation, <a href="https://www.cma.gov.kw/en/web/cma/cma-board-releases/resolutions-and-regulations/-/cmaboardreleases/detail/1384960">reiterated its ban</a> on crypto assets. The authority states the rules align with enhancing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The regulations also comply with Financial Action Task Force recommendations and standards.</p>
<p>Kuwait&#8217;s regulator underscores five critical rules which stipulate an “absolute prohibition of using virtual assets as a payment instrument/method.” Moreover, Kuwaiti businesses are forbidden from engaging with virtual assets as an investment vehicle, requiring firms in the Gulf state to avoid “offering this type of service to any customers.” Crypto asset mining and related activities are also strictly prohibited, and Kuwaiti citizens and businesses must abstain from participation.</p>

<p>Any business violating the regulator&#8217;s rules may face penalties, including the potential loss of their business license. The regulator also urges Kuwaiti businesses to educate customers about the purported risks of crypto assets. The bulletin indicates that crypto assets are utilized beyond the borders of the Gulf nation. The regulator emphasizes that these rules are articulated in Article 15 of Law No. 106 of 2013.</p>
<p>Kuwait’s Capital Markets Authority insists crypto assets “are not legal tender, are not issued or supported by any government, are not tied to any asset or issuer, and their prices are always driven by speculation that exposes them to sharp drops.”</p>

Moscow will send Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov instead, the Kremlin confirmed, emphasizing that Putin will join the event via video link. </strong></p>
<h2>Putin to Take Part in BRICS Talks on Enlargement, Currency Matters on Conference Call</h2>
<p>Russia’s head of state will not be among the leaders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BRICS</a> nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) when they meet in person next month, Russian media reported, quoting the office of the South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. The statement elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>By mutual agreement, President Putin will not attend the summit. The Russian Federation will be represented by Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.</p></blockquote>
<p>Putin’s attendance has been in question since his indictment by the International Criminal Court (ICC). In March, the Hague-based intergovernmental organization issued an arrest warrant for him and Russia’s Commissioner for Children’s Rights, Maria Lvova-Belova.</p>
<p>Both have been accused of deportation of Ukrainian children from the conflict zone, among other charges. While Russia does not recognize the authority of the ICC, the Republic of South Africa is under its jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The summit will be held on Aug. 22 &#8211; 24 in South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg, and will focus on important issues such as the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-to-talk-expansion-at-august-summit-host-confirms/">bloc’s expansion</a> and the use of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-to-promote-national-currencies-before-issuing-common-one/">national currencies</a> of the member states in trade.</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin will take part in the BRICS forum in South Africa via video link, his Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told the RIA Novosti news agency, confirming Pretoria’s announcement.</p>
<p>“President Putin has decided to participate in the BRICS summit in the format of a video conference call. This will be a full-fledged participation. Minister Lavrov will be present at the meeting itself,” the Kremlin’s spokesman explained.</p>

<p>South Africa’s commitment to the successful holding of the upcoming “historic” BRICS summit and the recognition of the country’s legal obligations under the ICC’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_Statute" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rome Statute</a> determined the format of Russia’s participation, according to Vincent Magwenya, spokesman for Ramaphosa’s office.</p>
<p>Quoted by Russia’s Radio Sputnik, Magwenya added that he believes that Vladimir Putin’s absence will not interfere with the planned event since the Russian Federation will be represented by Foreign Minister Lavrov.</p>

Until now, there were no confirmed applications of the technology. Techinsights found Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chip in the Whatsminer M56S++ bitcoin mining rig from Microbt, a bitcoin mining machine that produces an estimated 230 to 254 terahash per second (TH/s).</strong></p>
<h2>Report Shows Microbt Leverages Samsung&#x2019;s Advanced 3nm GAA Chip</h2>
<p>Microbt&#x2019;s next-generation mining rig, the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/microbt-unveils-new-whatsminer-bitcoin-mining-rig-with-320-th-s-setting-new-standard-for-hashpower/">Whatsminer M56S++</a>, reportedly employs Samsung&#x2019;s latest semiconductor technology. Techinsights <a href="https://www.techinsights.com/blog/samsungs-3nm-gaa-process-whatsminer-asic-disruptive-event">discovered</a> the mining machine&#x2019;s application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) was made using Samsung&#x2019;s SF3E process. The report highlights that although Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm GAA semiconductor process has been available for about a year, no chips utilizing this technology have been found in the market until now.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" title="Samsung's 3nm GAA Chip Discovered in Microbt&#x2019;s Next-Gen Bitcoin Mining Rig" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/cheechs.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20230720%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230720T135421Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=600&X-Amz-Signature=07d251f04a0c121b808fe5e46c58423c13d0bb75791543b0c99ef0539547f2bb" alt="Samsung's 3nm GAA Chip Discovered in Microbt&#x2019;s Next-Gen Bitcoin Mining Rig" width="1280" height="400"></p>
<p>Techinsights researchers state that the commercialization of GAA technology can aid in the production of 2nm chips and more. &#x201C;This development is crucial because it has the potential to enhance performance, improve energy efficiency, keep up with Moore&#x2019;s Law, and enable advanced applications,&#x201D; Techinsights <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/techinsights-samsungs-3nm-gaa-process-identified-in-a-crypto-mining-asic-designed-by-china-startup-microbt-301880726.html">detailed</a>. The report elucidates further, confirming suspicions that Microbt&#x2019;s semiconductor supplier is indeed Samsung &#x2014; a fact that has long been a subject of speculation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is assumed that Bitmain, Microbt&#x2019;s rival, utilizes chips supplied by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). This isn&#x2019;t the first time cutting-edge chip technology has been discovered in bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) mining machines. Techinsights found the SMIC 7nm process in a Minerva bitcoin mining chip. Eric Chen, a semiconductor research analyst with Digitimes Asia, noted that while this discovery could be classified as commercialization, its scale may be small.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Getting revenues from shipment can be defined as &#x2018;commercialization&#x2019;, but ASIC is a relatively simple kind of chip to produce, in terms of architecture,&#x201D; Chen remarked. Analyst John Wang from Digitimes emphasized that the yield from Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm GAA process remains low. Consequently, Wang believes the tech giant aims to attract a broad customer base to refine its procedures and enhance yield. The report from Techinsights concludes by noting the uncertainty surrounding the use of Samsung&#x2019;s 3nm chips in any additional hardware devices in the market today.</p>

Excerpts from the diary suggest Ellison lacked confidence in her role. After her breakup with Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX co-founder, her enthusiasm for Alameda &#8220;significantly decreased.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Ellison Didn&#8217;t Think She Was Well Suited to Lead Alameda Research</h2>
<p>Caroline Ellison, former CEO of Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, reportedly maintained a diary on Google Documents. The New York Times, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html">report</a> dated July 20, 2023, confirmed with four people familiar with the matter that the publication reviewed the documents.</p>
<p>Attorneys involved in the case against Bankman-Fried have allegedly circulated these Google documents in court. Ellison&#8217;s diary provides insight into her personal and professional life while working under the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency empire.</p>
<p>In February 2022, Ellison expressed her dissatisfaction and overwhelmed feelings in regard to her job. “At the end of the day I can’t wait to go home and turn off my phone and have a drink and get away from it all,” she said.</p>
<p>Diary excerpts note a romantic relationship between she and Bankman-Fried, adding an element of &#8220;weirdness&#8221; and causing &#8220;drama.&#8221; In one document, Ellison further explained her belief that she was not qualified to serve as Alameda&#8217;s chief executive. Ellison wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Running Alameda doesn’t feel like something I’m that comparatively advantaged at or well suited to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the report, when Bankman-Fried&#8217;s $32 billion empire <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">collapsed</a>, Ellison expressed relief that the chaos was ending. “I just had an increasing dread of this day that was weighing on me,” Ellison wrote. “Now that it’s actually happening it just feels great to get it over with.”</p>

<p>Ellison is scheduled to testify against Bankman-Fried in his October trial, along with two other coworkers. In her <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">testimony</a>, published in December 2022, she alleged that Bankman-Fried had instructed her to commingle customer funds since 2019. Furthermore, it&#8217;s possible that Ellison underperformed in her role at the quantitative trading firm and may have held an FTX margin position that was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/document-claims-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-ftx-margin-position-was-negative-1-3b-in-may-2022/">negative $1.3 billion</a> in May 2022.</p>

Traders were buoyed by the news, pushing the token to its highest level since April in the process. Stellar rose to a one-week high today.</strong></p>
<h2>Chainlink (LINK)</h2>
<p>Chainlink (LINK) was one of Thursday&#x2019;s most notable gainers, as the token surged nearly 20% higher.</p>
<p>After falling to a low of $6.88 on Wednesday, LINK/USD rallied to an intraday peak of $8.32 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The move pushed price to its strongest point since last April, when the token hit a high above $8.60.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the latest rally took place as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of its ceiling at 72.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is at 73.03, with an upcoming resistance point of 77.00 a possible destination for bulls.</p>
<p>In the likely event it reaches this point, LINK could surpass last Thursday&#x2019;s peak.</p>

<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>In addition to LINK, stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>) was another big mover during today&#x2019;s session, as it also rose by nearly 20%</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD recorded a high of $0.1793 earlier in the day, which comes following yesterday&#x2019;s low of $0.1414.</p>
<p>Similar to chainlink, this peak pushed stellar to its highest point since last Thursday, when the token hit a then 15-month high.</p>

<p>As a result of this gain, price strength in <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a> is now overbought, which could spell a soon end for the current uptrend.</p>
<p>The RSI is tracking at a reading of 71.87, but is fast approaching a resistance zone at the 73.00 mark.</p>
<p>Traders may already be considering securing profits as price strength heads to this point.</p>

For the past three quarters, Tesla has maintained a digital asset portfolio worth approximately $184 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Tesla Holds Steady on Bitcoin in Q2 2023, Maintains $184M in Digital Assets</h2>
<p>Following the market close on Wednesday, July 19, 2023, electric car manufacturer Tesla reported its <a href="https://digitalassets.tesla.com/tesla-contents/image/upload/TSLA-Q2-2023-Update.pdf">financial results</a> for the second quarter. In this quarter, Tesla manufactured 480,000 vehicles and delivered 466,000. &#x201C;Q2-2023 was a record quarter on many levels with our best-ever production and deliveries and revenue approaching $25B in a single quarter,&#x201D; detailed Tesla&#x2019;s Q2 2023 update.</p>
<p>Besides a better second quarter despite the current &#x201C;macroeconomic environment,&#x201D; Tesla&#x2019;s Q2 financial report indicates that it hasn&#x2019;t sold any bitcoin. The electric vehicle company, helmed by Elon Musk, originally held $1.31 billion in digital currencies in June 2021. Musk then <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-tesla-owns-42k-bitcoins/">hinted</a> that the amount of bitcoin held was &#x201C;close&#x201D; to 42,000. By April 2022, the company&#x2019;s financial statement <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-hodls-bitcoin-balance-sheet-shows-1-26b-in-digital-assets/">revealed</a> it had $1.261 billion in digital assets.</p>
<p>By the second quarter of 2022, Tesla had sold <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tesla-sold-75-of-its-bitcoin-elon-musk-says-we-have-not-sold-any-of-our-dogecoin/">75% of its bitcoin</a>. Musk referenced the Covid-19 lockdowns in China and the importance of maximizing the company&#x2019;s cash position as reasons for the sale. The financial results for the second quarter of 2023 mirror those of the two preceding quarters. In the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023, Tesla maintained a balance of $184 million, with no significant gains or losses reported.</p>

<p>Most of the &#x201C;digital assets&#x201D; mentioned in the financial reports are assumed to be bitcoin, although Tesla also holds an immaterial amount of dogecoin (DOGE). Before Tesla sold 75% of its bitcoin cache, Musk <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/teslas-elon-musk-offers-to-buy-twitter-for-41-billion-says-he-wants-to-make-it-a-private-company/">made his bid</a> to acquire Twitter, the social media company he now controls. Even though Musk sold 75% of Tesla&#x2019;s bitcoin, the CEO stated that the electric vehicle company is &#x201C;certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in future.&#x201D; To date, there have been no significant increases or decreases in Tesla&#x2019;s financials related to bitcoin.</p>
