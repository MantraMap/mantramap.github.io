			            <description><![CDATA[BCH skyrocketed to over $320 earlier today for the first time since April 2022.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While BTC pushed toward $31,000 and even briefly surpassed that level, several altcoins have been on a massive roll in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash stands out as the most notable performer, having surged by over 30% on a daily scale to over $300 for the first time in over a year.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s BCH&#8217;s Show</h2>
<p>The altcoins started a massive run-up last week before stalling for a few days. Today, though, the landscape for many of them is quite different.</p>
<p>While ETH, BNB, XRP, and TRX trade relatively quietly with gains of up to 3%, ADA, DOGE, and DOT have jumped by up to 5%.</p>
<p>However, SOL and LTC have taken the main stage with impressive 15% daily increases. As a result, SOL is up to $19, while LTC trades close to $100.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Bitcoin Cash has stolen the show with a mind-blowing 33% surge to $305. Moreover, BCH even tapped $320 earlier today, charting its highest price tag in 14 months.</p>
<p>ETC has also jumped by a double-digit percentage (13%) and has reclaimed $20.</p>
<p>Most other altcoins are also in the green, which has helped the total crypto market cap add over $30 billion in a day and near $1.2 trillion on CMC.</p>

<h2>BTC Tried $31K Again</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s most impressive price surge for the past few months came 10 days ago when the asset soared from $26,500 to over $30,000. It jumped to $31,500 in the following few days but failed there and remained relatively stagnant in a range between $30,000 and $31,000 ever since.</p>
<p>That changed yesterday when it briefly slipped below $30,000. However, that was short-lived, and the bulls took charge once again. They pushed the cryptocurrency north to $31,250 (on Bitstamp) earlier today, but it failed to continue upwards.</p>
<p>As of now, bitcoin trades just inches away from $31,000, and the rising altcoins have reduced some of its dominance over the market. Nevertheless, the metric is still above 50% on CMC.</p>
<p>The enhanced market volatility has resulted in over $130 million worth of liquidations as nearly 45,000 over-leveraged traders were wrecked in the past 24 hours.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Britain has taken another step towards having a fully regulated crypto framework with the royal approval of the Financial Services and Markets Bill.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On June 28, King Charles III granted Royal Assent to a landmark bill to ‚Äúregain control of the financial services rulebook.‚Äù</p>
<p>The Financial Services and Markets Bill 2023 was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/uk-house-of-lords-approve-crypto-regulatory-bill/" data-wpel-link="internal">approved</a> by the upper chamber of the UK parliament on June 19.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/rocket-boost-for-uk-economy-as-financial-services-and-markets-bill-receives-royal-assent" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">bill</a> includes measures to bring crypto assets and stablecoins into the scope of regulation, giving them powers to oversee the digital asset sector.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1ec-1f1e7.png" alt="üá¨üáß" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> The UK‚Äôs Financial Services &amp; Markets Bill has received Royal Assent, the final step for this major legislation, which brings <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stablecoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#stablecoins</a> into the regulatory perimeter, designates <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#crypto</a> as regulated activity &amp; supervision of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/crypto?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">#crypto</a> promotions<a href="https://t.co/wG4D3sgDgz" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/wG4D3sgDgz</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Rocket Boost for UK Economy</h2>
<p>The Treasury described the bill as a ‚Äúrocket boost‚Äù for the UK economy, which has been battered during the pandemic and its exit from Europe.</p>
<p>It clarified that the bill ‚Äúenables the regulation of crypto assets to support their safe adoption in the UK.‚Äù</p>
<p>Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Andrew Griffith, said: ‚Äú2023 is proving to be a banner year for reforming our financial services.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThis landmark piece of legislation gives us control of our financial services rulebook, so it supports UK businesses and consumers and drives growth.‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>During the formulation of the bill, amendments were made to include crypto as a regulated financial activity and to supervise crypto promotions and advertising. Stablecoins have also been included in the bill‚Äôs oversight of payment regulations.</p>
<p>The legislation could entice more crypto companies to the UK from the United States, which is currently trying to push them out by ‚Äòcarpet bombing‚Äô the industry with <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-crypto-clarity-wants-more-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">lawsuits</a>.</p>
<p>Instead of rolling out its own regulatory framework, policymakers in America have been grappling over which agency will control the asset class. Furthermore, the Securities and Exchange Commission and its chair <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-lawyers-claim-gensler-offered-to-be-company-advisor/" data-wpel-link="internal">Gary Gensler</a> have taken acted on their own to proclaim that all digital assets aside from Bitcoin are securities.</p>
<p>Congress has yet to officially classify them as such, and the uncertainty is causing an exodus of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/crypto-exchange-gemini-launches-eth-staking-pro-in-the-uk/" data-wpel-link="internal">companies</a>, talent, innovation, and capital.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Crypto markets remain in consolidation, having gained just 1% on the day. As a result, total market capitalization remains around $1.21 trillion at the time of writing.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-price-analysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin prices</a> have barely moved, and the asset was trading for $30,400 during the Friday morning Asian session. It has failed to break resistance at this level but has also yet to pull back again.</p>
<p>Ethereum, which has been weaker recently, was flat on the day at $1,846. The only altcoins showing any progress at the time of writing were Solana (SOL) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH).</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Paxos's Pax Dollar (USDP) is a regulated stablecoin. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain fintech company Paxos has announced partnering with online marketplace Mercado Libre to bring the Pax Dollar (USDP) stablecoin to users in Mexico. Transactions will be facilitated by MercadoPago, which happens to be a digital wallet app by Mercado Libre.</p>
<p>The latest move is part of Paxos&#8217; vision to position itself as an &#8220;established leader&#8221; in digital assets throughout the region. Data cited by the company stated that over 60% of its active wallets currently support customers in Latin America.</p>
<h2>Paxos&#8217;s Presence in Latin America</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://paxos.com/2023/06/28/paxos-partners-with-mercado-pago-to-open-access-to-pax-dollar-usdp-for-mexican-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">press release</a>, Paxos said that the adoption of USDP by Mercado Pago in Mexico further builds on the established partnership between the fintech firms, as Mexican users will now be able to access the regulated stablecoin via Mercado Pago.</p>
<p>In a statement, Arnoldo Reyes, Head of Latin America of Paxos, highlighted the increasing demand for &#8220;transformational technology&#8221; by digital asset consumers in the region. He added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Mexico is one of the most active marketplaces for digital assets with millions of users tapping into the ecosystem to gain access to key financial services. The launch of USDP within Mercado Pago represents another way that Mercado Libre continues to democratize access to commerce and financial services through innovative digital asset solutions throughout Latin America.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Paxos-issued stablecoin, USDP, is subject to strict regulatory oversight by the New York State Department of Financial Services. USDP reserves are held in cash and cash equivalents, while its attestation reports are issued by WithumSmith+Brown, PC, which happens to be an independent third-party accounting firm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the company website states that Withum‚Äôs examination is carried out in accordance with attestation standards set up by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).</p>
<h2>Push For Stablecoin Regulations</h2>
<p>The stablecoin market has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/stablecoin-market-cap-marks-the-biggest-increase-in-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">grown</a> significantly over the past decade. Despite much new proliferation, the ecosystem has not managed to steer away from backlash and FUD. In fact, Paxos&#8217;s development comes amidst growing calls for stablecoin-related regulations across the world, especially after <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/global-watchdogs-to-regulate-stablecoins-following-terrausd-ust-fiasco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">TerraUSD&#8217;s</a> (UST) collapse and the subsequent FTX implosion.</p>
<p>Italy‚Äôs top banking authority, for one, <a href="https://twitter.com/bancaditalia/status/1673310957743886336" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">released</a> a new report titled &#8220;Markets, Infrastructures and Payment Systems,&#8221; calling on regulators to implement the same financial conduct standards for stablecoin issuers in the industry. It said that regulating stablecoins is crucial because of its close ties with the DeFi market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) <a href="https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/2/253257/HKMA-seeks-views-on-stablecoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">aims</a> to roll out a regulatory framework for stablecoins by the end of 2024 and is currently in the process of seeking public views regarding the ecosystem.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Canadian House members want the government to protect citizens‚Äô right to self custody, and recognize stablecoins as distinct from other cryptos.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Canadian House committee published a report on Wednesday providing 16 recommendations for how the nation‚Äôs government should regulate the blockchain industry ‚Äì and they‚Äôre remarkably bullish.</p>
<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase praised the report, saying it was ‚Äúencouraged by the forward-thinking approach of the parliamentary committee.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Opening Canada to Crypto</h2>
<p>In its first <a href="https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/INDU/report-15/page-18" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">recommendation</a>, The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Industry and Technology (INDU) asked that the Canadian government recognize blockchain as a growing industry with the potential to create jobs and foster economic growth.</p>
<p>The committee‚Äôs position mimics that of British Prime Minister <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/new-uk-prime-minister-rishi-sunak-crypto-believer-or-cbdc-backer/" data-wpel-link="internal">Rishi Sunak</a>, who spearheaded a newly passed bill to recognize crypto transactions as legitimate, regulated financial activity.</p>
<p>Canada‚Äôs Prime Minister <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/after-bitcoin-seizures-and-freezing-bank-accounts-canada-finally-ends-emergencies-act/" data-wpel-link="internal">Justin Trudeau</a> has generally been dismissive of crypto, but his conservative political rival <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/canadas-new-conservative-party-leader-is-a-crypto-proponent/" data-wpel-link="internal">Pierre Poilievre</a> is proudly pro-Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The composition of the House committee is slightly left-leaning, but in some ways better resembles Poilievre‚Äôs position. Regarding the Bitcoin mining industry, the report suggests maintaining a ‚Äúneutral and equitable position‚Äù to ‚Äúfoster a competitive digital asset mining environment‚Äù and ‚Äúattract investments.‚Äù</p>
<p>It suggested investigating ‚Äúequity between provinces‚Äù in its application of the Excise Tax Act to the mining industry to ‚Äúensure fair taxation.‚Äù In the United States, the Biden Administration recommended a debilitating 30% excise tax specifically targeted at miners in May (which has been <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-scraps-plans-for-bitcoin-mining-excise-tax-congressman-confirms/" data-wpel-link="internal">cast aside</a> for the time being).</p>
<p>Canadian lawmakers also advocated for protecting individuals‚Äô ‚Äúright to self custody‚Äù, and for providing ease of access to ‚Äúsafe and reliable on and off ramps.‚Äù</p>
<h2>Coinbase Responds</h2>
<p>Canada‚Äôs report was a breath of fresh air for Coinbase, which has frequently criticized the lack of regulatory clarity and hostility from the United States, where it is headquartered.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/canadian-lawmakers-back-blockchain-with-landmark-recommendations" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">response letter</a>, the company showed a particular fondness for the committee‚Äôs stablecoin recommendation, advocating a ‚Äúunique regulatory approach‚Äù to such assets.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like fiat currency, present novel regulatory considerations,‚Äù wrote Coinbase. ‚ÄúThis tailored approach will enable effective oversight while promoting innovation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Canada‚Äôs <a href="https://www.osc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-02/csa_20230222_21-332_crypto-trading-platforms-pre-reg-undertakings.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">current position</a> on stablecoins is that they are securities ‚Äì a position not shared by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to also think they‚Äôre securities, given its recent lawsuit against Binance alleging that its stablecoin BUSD fits the bill.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[DYDX will release its public testnet on July 5, which is weeks earlier than previously announced. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DYDX Foundation, the non-profit organization behind the popular decentralized exchange (DEX) DYDX, has announced a new launch date for the public testnet of its Cosmos-based blockchain as it prepares to exit the Ethereum ecosystem later this year.</p>
<p>According to the foundation, the testnet is set to go live next week on July 5, which is earlier than the previous schedule. The team estimated in March that the public testnet would launch by the end of July after the third milestone (private testnet).</p>
<h2>DYDX Announces Public Testnet</h2>
<p>The upcoming release is the fourth phase of DYDX&#8217;s five-stage milestones to test its Cosmos-based blockchain before the full release of the mainnet.</p>
<p>During the private testnet, the team made several improvements to the network, including enabling documentation for market makers and validators, limit orders, dynamic funding rates, and ABCI 2.0 and other features of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cosmos-chains-can-evolve-into-polkadot-parachains-thanks-to-new-sdk/" data-wpel-link="internal">Cosmos-SDK</a>.</p>
<p>The public testnet will allow users to test and explore more features, including accessing order books, account balances, order history, and market data. It will also include many validators running the network&#8217;s software.</p>
<p>Although the upcoming testnet will initially support only Bitcoin and Ethereum markets, the project plans to expand the network to include at least 30 markets in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are happy to announce that we completed Milestone 4 ahead of schedule! Our public testnet is set to go live on July 5 at 17:00 UTC. This public testnet will launch with Bitcoin and Ethereum markets but we anticipate that the open-source software will include approximately 30+ markets as the network gets upgraded,&#8221; DYDX <a href="https://dydx.exchange/blog/public-testnet" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<h2>Exiting Ethereum</h2>
<p>On successful completion of the testnet, the DEX will move on to the last milestone (v5) before the eventual launch of the mainnet, which will see it migrate from Ethereum to Cosmos around September.</p>
<p>DYDX said <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blockchains-and-the-scalability-problem/" data-wpel-link="internal">Ethereum&#8217;s scalability issue</a> was the primary reason it intends to move away from the network.

			            <description><![CDATA[Like ARK, Fidelity has modified its ETF proposal to match BlackRock.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fidelity Digital Assets ‚Äì the $4.5 trillion asset manager‚Äôs crypto-arm ‚Äì has resubmitted its filing to launch a Bitcoin Spot ETF in the United States.</p>
<p>Parts of the filing are virtually identical to BlackRock and ARK Invest‚Äôs respective submissions earlier this month.</p>
<h2>Fidelity Tries Again</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-044.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">19-b4 filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday, the proposal would allow the Cboe BZX Exchange to list and trade shares of Fidelity‚Äôs Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cathie-woods-ark-amends-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-to-copy-blackrock/" data-wpel-link="internal">ARK</a> on Wednesday, Fidelity began by rebutting the Commission‚Äôs justification for denying previous spot ETF applications, such as its own. The SEC‚Äôs main argument is that the applicants thus far have failed to form a surveillance sharing agreement (SSA) with a regulated market of significant size ‚Äì and that CME Bitcoin Futures don‚Äôt count.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn every prior approval order for Commodity-BasedTrust Shares, there has been a derivatives market that represents the regulated market of significant size, generally a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ‚ÄúCFTC‚Äù) regulated futures market,‚Äù read the filing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the filing is taking cues from both BlackRock and ARK before it, with Cboe proposing to enter an SSA with ‚Äúan operator of a United States-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin,‚Äù that represents a ‚Äúsubstantial portion of US-based Bitcoin trading.‚Äù</p>
<p>James Seyffart ‚Äì an ETF Research Analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence ‚Äì published an unofficial estimate of the SEC‚Äôs next deadline to approve this ETF, predicting September 2 as the date. ARK, meanwhile, he slates for August 13 ‚Äì ahead of BlackRock on August 19.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Updated. Was moving too fast before. <a href="https://t.co/WWFIK87xgK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/WWFIK87xgK</a></p>
<p>&mdash; James Seyffart (@JSeyff) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1674472754647539746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">June 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>The Risk of No ETF</h2>
<p>In its filing, Fidelity added that failing to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF is exposing investors to more investment risk ‚Äì not less.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe lack of a Spot Bitcoin ETP exposes U.S. investor assets to significant risk because investors that would otherwise seek crypto-asset exposure through a Spot Bitcoin ETP are forced to find alternative exposure through generally riskier means,‚Äù argued Fidelity.</p>
<p>The firm cited FTX, Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager as examples of such ‚Äúalternative means‚Äù of exposure ‚Äì all crypto firms that went bankrupt and froze client assets last year from a combination of market turmoil and active mismanagement/fraud.</p>
<p>Fidelity plans to act as the custodian for the fund‚Äôs Bitcoin, unlike BlackRock, which plans to outsource that task to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-shares-have-jumped-nearly-40-since-the-sec-lawsuit/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a>.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BlackRock has placed big bets AI saying that nascent tech can be a big driver of returns even when the macro environment is not your friend. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Asset management giant &#8211; BlackRock &#8211; believes that structural shifts like the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to drive returns now and in the future. Its new report described the space as a &#8220;mega force&#8221; whose applications could disrupt entire industries.</p>
<p>BlackRock found that S&amp;P 500 gains have become increasingly concentrated in a handful of tech stocks, exceeding levels seen during the 2000s tech boom. The company believes that this &#8220;unusual&#8221; equity market demonstrates that AI can be a big catalyst of returns even during tough macro environment conditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>In its mid-year outlook <a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/literature/whitepaper/bii-midyear-outlook-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a>, the asset manager&#8217;s investment team wrote that the importance of data for AI and potential winners is &#8220;underappreciated.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Companies with vast sets of proprietary data have the ability to more quickly and easily leverage a large amount of data to create innovative models. New AI tools could analyze and unlock the value of the data gold mine some companies may be sitting on.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>BlackRock Investment Institute also revealed that it has an overweight allocation for AI-related shares in developed markets.</li>
<li>It also suggested that investors should get granular in portfolios in the &#8220;new regime&#8221; of economic volatility and high-interest rates, explaining that such a strategy is likely to be more crucial than relying on broad asset class returns.</li>
<li>The report highlighted that AI-driven productivity gains could boost profit margins and could benefit companies with high staffing costs or a large share of tasks that could be automated while simultaneously admitting that white-collar jobs are at an &#8220;increased risk&#8221; in the process.</li>
<li>Besides BlackRock, several companies have placed big bets on AI.</li>
<li>In April, Bitget <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitget-betting-big-on-ai-with-10m-investment-in-fetch-ai-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">pledged</a> $10 million for the development of the Fetch.ai ecosystem, which offers a service automation infrastructure that is powered by an AI agent network.</li>
<li>Wall Street banking giant JPMorgan was reportedly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/jpmorgan-s-ai-puts-25-years-of-federal-reserve-talk-into-a-hawk-dove-score?sref=323RPL5z" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">developing</a> AI solutions.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Rarotonga, Cook Islands, June 29th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">A solution enabling Web3 wallet integration within existing enterprise platforms.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Blockchain-based, Web3 initiative<a href="https://cirusfoundation.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> Cirus Foundation</a> has developed a Wallet as a Service (WaaS) innovation unit. The initiative entails deploying Web3 wallets for existing businesses and platforms to create a secured value-share layer between their users.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">After the initial release of the Cirus Web3 Wallet, the core functionality of combining user data and digital currencies provides a basis for Cirus to connect with existing platforms and web applications seamlessly.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The initiative marks the first business-to-business approach in developing wallet adoption for the Cirus ecosystem. The team commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúWe believe we need a fast-track to adoption, although our approach will always entail what the end-user desires, the world needs a sovereign solution targeting businesses and platforms alike. In simpler terms, we need to prevent misappropriation by banks and the FTX‚Äôs of the world. This application places the user in ‚Äòpermissioned control of their asset‚Äô while endorsed by the business. Think of the business as saying &#8211; ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt hold your assets &#8211; you do‚Äô. said Co-Founder, Michael Luckhoo</p></blockquote>
<figure style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image_1687974805LN1IeuFlCx.jpg" alt="The Cirus Wallet Linking with existing crypto exchange" width="800" height="429" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">The Cirus Wallet Linking with existing crypto exchange</figcaption></figure>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Without mass-scale adoption, Web3 will continue to suffer, and its true use cases will fail to make a lasting impact. The WaaS category creates an easier entry point for companies to integrate Web3 technology and better serve their client base.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>What defines WaaS? </strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Wallet-as-a-service refers to a platform that has the ability to enable Web3 functionality either inside an existing application or interfacing with a platform. Simply put, the users have ownership and control over their assets, enabling them to decide how their data and currencies are utilized by the business they engage with.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The team has confirmed that they have signed their first enterprise client to service the WaaS program, and although the Cirus wallet recently launched, this has sped up development efforts in this category.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúCompanies are not going to just roll over and hand back assets to their user base, but by educating the benefits to the business as a first-mover in the space, we can create a domino effect &#8211; first movers, willing followers and the unwilling followers. Eventually companies will be accredited for better business by enabling user-controlled management &#8211; almost like a better business bureau approval.‚Äù said David Brown, Head of Tokenomics</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Some examples where WaaS may apply include NFTs or tokens distributed by the business based on engagement, SDK kits for in-app wallet deployment, or wallets that connect the user account (data and currencies) to be exchanged with another party in a more secure format.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The team suggested the first use case will enable a more secure way to trade assets with existing centralized exchanges, therefore preventing user assets from being manipulated or withheld by the platform.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe most obvious choice was to solve how centralized exchanges operate as this was the central point of failure for our industry. We don‚Äôt need to experience¬†a repeat of Mt.Gox, Quadriga or FTX! The world needs a renewed trust in the benefits of Web3, a new standard.‚Äù said Director, Mike Miclea</p></blockquote>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The team commented that the WaaS initiative is part of a greater plan to establish an open and easily accessible economy that encourages the widespread adoption of Web3 technologies. Through this process, they are actively engaged in developing an end-user WaaS program where true customization of Web3 wallets can be achieved by anyone.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><strong>About Cirus Foundation</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Cirus Foundation is the development team behind the Cirus Ecosystem, an accessible onramp designed to accelerate the adoption of Web 3.0 and the Ownership Economy. This consists of the Cirus suite of tools, which work together to give users true ownership over their assets, and the data streams they generate.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[John Deaton has some comments on a recent interview of Jay Clayton regarding the current regulatory approach of some US agencies. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The lawsuit between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission has taken center stage once again as the agency continues with its predatory approach.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Commission filed a lawsuit against Coinbase for dealing with unregistered securities, calling out a number of coins for being securities. Interestingly enough, this list didn&#8217;t include XRP. Nonetheless, the financial watchdog has demonstrated a clear stance against crypto, and it&#8217;s one of war.</p>
<ul>
<li>That said, Jay Clayton, the former Chairman of the US SEC, had something to say about the current regimen at regulatory agencies.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>What we&#8217;re hearing from leaders of the regulatory organisations is &#8220;if we&#8217;re not losing cases, if we&#8217;re not being pushed back by the courts, we&#8217;re not doing enough.&#8221; That is a fundamental shift in how we as Americans view the role of the government. &#8211; Said Clayton.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>He added: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be in a situation where I know the government is bringing cases they think they&#8217;re going to lose. [&#8230;] This is an ethos now &#8211; unless we&#8217;re losing, we&#8217;re not bringing enough cases.&#8221;</li>
<li>Commenting on the matter was John Deaton &#8211; a lawyer representing thousands of XRP holders.</li>
<li>According to him, the Judge in the case between Ripple and the SEC &#8220;was alluding&#8221; to the exact point.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re supposed to have a good faith basis to being a case, meaning you believe you can win by applying the law. You don&#8217;t wait until a judge tells you otherwise.</p></blockquote>
