<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/truthgpt-elon-musk-ai-crypto-tokens-draw-the-ire-of-state-regulators">reported</a> on May 3 that regulators in <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/texas-securities-board-shuts-down-cloud-mining-firm-over-unregistered-offerings/">Texas</a> are cracking down on the individual behind two cryptocurrencies that aim to capitalize on Elon Musk&#8217;s AI projects. The two tokens are called <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-gains-5-as-elon-musk-meets-with-north-american-bitcoin-miners/">Elon Musk</a> AI Token and TruthGPT Coin, with the latter named after Musk&#8217;s proposed ChatGPT competitor of the same name.<br /><br />Joe Rotunda, enforcement director for the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB), has alleged that the tokens are<em> &#8220;part of a fraudulent securities scheme&#8221;</em> and issued a cease-and-desist order in conjunction with other states. <br /><br />The TSSB&#8217;s filing names San Francisco resident and entrepreneur Horatiu Charlie Caragaceanu as the promoter of both assets. Caragaceanu claims that the tokens are powered by a trading platform that uses an AI algorithm developed by Musk to create trading strategies. <br /><br />However, Musk has not created any such system. The TSSB&#8217;s filing also names Caragaceanu&#8217;s company, The Shark of Wall Street, as a promoter of the assets. <br /><br />The regulator noted that Caragaceanu&#8217;s earlier assets, including various NFTs and a Shark of Wall Street token, have lost their value. In recent months, numerous crypto projects have attempted to capitalize on trends related to ChatGPT and other AI projects, including fraudulent examples of ChatGPT honeypot tokens. <br /><br />On May 2, digital artist Rhett Mankind created a meme coin using AI that saw $26 million in trading volume on Uniswap over 24 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-adds-to-bitcoin-holdings-with-150-million-btc-purchase/">MicroStrategy</a>, a company that provides BI solutions, cloud computing, and software services to a range of clients, has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin holders with approximately 140k Bitcoins in reserves. <br /><br />The decision to purchase Bitcoin in bulk was made by former CEO Michael Saylor in 2020, citing concerns over inflation. Saylor believes that the strategy of simply holding Bitcoin has given MicroStrategy an edge over its rivals in the BI industry. <br /><br />Despite the uncertainty regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the US and other countries, Bitcoin has made a comeback recently, spiking by over 70% over the past quarter. This has allowed MicroStrategy to turn a profit this quarter, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/microstrategy-posts-profit-on-benefit-tied-to-bitcoin-holdings?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter">Bloomberg</a>. <br /><br />The company&#8217;s quarterly report indicated a net income of $461 million in Q1, with firm shares trading at $31.79. The company also took advantage of tax benefits resulting from its Bitcoin stash. <br /><br />Bitcoin&#8217;s price appreciation allowed MicroStrategy to repay a loan from Silvergate at a 22% discount and strategically manage its balance sheet by adding 7,500 bitcoins in the quarter. <br /><br />Thanks to Saylor&#8217;s confidence in Bitcoin, the company is now reporting profits while most of its peers are faltering amid inflation and a looming recession.</p>

<p>On May 2, Europol announced that law enforcement agencies worldwide had seized and closed down Monopoly Market, an illegal <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/dark-market-search-site-deepdotweb-gets-seized-by-fbi-for-money-laundering/">dark web</a> marketplace, as part of their efforts to crack down on illicit cryptocurrency transactions.<br /><br />The operation, known as SpecTor, resulted in the seizure of $53.4 million in cash and crypto and the arrest of 288 vendors who primarily sold drugs and firearms on Monopoly Market and other similar websites.<br /><br />Of the 288 arrests, 153 were made in the US, 55 in the UK, and 52 in Germany, with one Californian man accounting for over $2 million worth of sales of methamphetamines and fentanyl. The remaining arrests were made in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Switzerland, Poland, and Brazil. Operation SpecTor involved law enforcement agencies from eight countries.<br /><br />Europol stated that Operation SpecTor began in October 2021 and is part of the same efforts by law enforcement agencies that led to the seizure and closure of Hydra and Genesis Market in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Hydra was the largest illegal marketplace operating on the dark web, while Genesis was the largest identity theft market.<br /><br />As with the operation against Hydra, German police initially seized the server infrastructure of Monopoly Market in December 2021 and began a <em>&#8220;honey pot&#8221;</em> operation in collaboration with Europol and other agencies worldwide. The operation targeted &#8220;high value&#8221; vendors supplying millions of dollars&#8217; worth of illegal goods to multiple markets across the globe.<br /><br />The US Justice Department described Operation SpecTor as an <em>&#8220;unprecedented&#8221;</em> enforcement action by a consortium of US and international law enforcement agencies against dark web drug markets and illicit crypto transactions.<br /><br />During a press conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?527819-1/attorney-general-garland-news-conference-targeting-fentanyl-trafficking">stated</a> that the DoJ&#8217;s efforts to combat the fentanyl epidemic and the Sinaloa Cartel had revealed that criminals were increasingly turning to the dark web and selling drugs in exchange for cryptocurrencies. Garland added that the DoJ intended to pursue every criminal on the dark web, no matter where they tried to hide in the <em>&#8220;farthest reaches of the internet.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Creditors of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/celsius-network-ceo-has-revival-plans-post-crypto-crash/">Celsius Network</a> LLC are seeking a subpoena against FTX to obtain information that may identify users involved in suspicious cryptocurrency trades that may have manipulated the price of Celsius’ native token last year. <br /><br />The creditors&#8217; committee said they want to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/celsius-creditors-seek-to-unmask-suspicious-ftx-crypto-trades?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic"> subpoena FTX</a> for information to identify users behind ten cryptocurrency wallets that they allege engaged in suspicious trades of Celsius’ CEL coin between April and August. <br /><br />The committee said they retained blockchain consultant Elementus Inc., which identified 947 transactions over a three-day period <em>“involving a near one-to-one relationship”</em> between CEL token deposits and withdraws between the ten private crypto wallets and wallets on the FTX exchange. <br /><br />The CEL trades in question occurred between the date Celsius paused customer withdrawals on June 12 and the company’s Chapter 11 filing on July 13, when the price of the token was 81 cents.<br /><br />The company has valued the token at 20 cents in its proposed Chapter 11 plan, but a committee representing Celsius creditors alleges that suspicious trades of the token on FTX may have artificially inflated the price to 81 cents between June and July 2020.<br /><br />FTX has not yet agreed to engage in informal discovery, and the bankruptcy case is being heard in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/kraken-secures-regulatory-nod-to-run-operations-in-ireland/">Kraken</a>, the cryptocurrency exchange, is pushing back against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the US, stating that the government agency’s requests for information about the exchange&#8217;s users amount to an <em>&#8220;unjustified treasure hunt.&#8221;</em> <br /><br />After failing to negotiate a narrower inquiry with the IRS, Kraken has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/crypto-exchange-kraken-blasts-irs-summons-as-treasure-hunt">requested</a> a federal court in San Francisco to order the IRS to back off. The IRS is investigating users who might be underreporting their tax liability. <br /><br />In a petition filed in February, the IRS said it wants to identify Kraken accounts that conducted at least $20,000 of cryptocurrency trading in any single year from 2016 to 2020. However, Kraken argues that the IRS has gone beyond the boundaries set by a US District Judge in a similar fight with Coinbase six years ago. Kraken argued in a court filing that <em>&#8220;Rather than abide by Coinbase&#8217;s ground rules, the IRS doubles down, making even more expansive requests and relying on a thinner rationale.&#8221;</em> <br /><br />In the Coinbase case, the IRS reduced its initial request, but Coinbase continued to resist. Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley ultimately ruled that the summons targeting over 14,000 of the exchange&#8217;s users was legitimate, as the IRS had a legitimate interest in investigating taxpayers who may not be reporting their Bitcoin gains. Kraken&#8217;s lawyers say the IRS <em>&#8220;wants more—and for a much bigger universe of users.&#8221;</em> Kraken agreed to pay $30 million in February to settle allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that its staking service was an illegal sale of securities. <br /><br />Corley has scheduled a hearing next month to hear arguments in the Kraken case, which is United States of America v. Payward Ventures Inc., 23-mc-80029, US District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). Kraken is one of the top crypto exchanges globally, with a daily trading volume of approximately $650 million, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>The HM Revenue and Customs, the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets/the-taxation-of-decentralised-finance-defi-involving-the-lending-and-staking-of-cryptoassets--2">taxation</a> division of the United Kingdom, has released a consultation document seeking views on the taxation of lending and borrowing on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. <br /><br />The consultation aims to create a tax regime that aligns the taxation of crypto assets used in DeFi lending and staking with the underlying economic substance while reducing the administrative burden on users. <br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/uk-treasury-reveals-plans-to-propose-stablecoin-regulation/">UK government</a> aims to establish a clear tax and regulatory treatment of the DeFi field to position the country as a leader in safe, sustainable, and rapid innovation in crypto assets and blockchain technologies.<br /><br />The proposed legislative modifications suggest that the crypto used in DeFi transactions would no longer be treated as a disposal for tax. Instead, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) would apply in addition to tax disposal when the crypto assets are economically disposed of in a non-DeFi transaction. <br /><br />This consultation marks the second stage of a five-step process, and the final decision on whether to proceed with legislative changes will be made after the consultation. The other steps include drafting legislation, implementing and monitoring, and reviewing and evaluating the change.<br /><br />Investors, professionals, and firms engaged in DeFi activities, including technology and financial service firms; trade associations and representative bodies; academic institutions and think tanks; and legal, accountancy, and tax advisory firms are invited to submit their views on the matter by 22 June 2023. <br /><br />The Economic Secretary to the UK Treasury, Andrew Griffith, revealed that the authorities are planning to impose a regulatory framework on the crypto industry in the next 12 months. The lawmaker believes that the upcoming regulation will foster the development of the asset class and turn the UK into a global cryptocurrency hub.</p>

The latest increase in hashrate was attributed to the activation of 2,100 new miners and bringing existing miners to full capacity. <br /><br />The company is now targeting a hashrate of 6 EH/s by the end of the year, as it takes advantage of further expansion opportunities. Bitfarms has purchased 6,200 new miners, which are expected to bring its total hashrate to 5.7 EH/s once activated, and <a href="https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_88e732cba54d233f2260ca3a643f30d1/bitfarms/news/2023-04-24_Bitfarms_Receives_Permit_To_Power_Up_To_100_MW_In__186.pdf">more orders</a> for new equipment are in progress. <br /><br />With energy costs of less than $0.03 per kWh, Bitfarms has a &#8220;best-in-class average cost of Bitcoin mined&#8221;. The company, which is listed on the Nasdaq and the Toronto Stock Exchange, has ten mining facilities in Canada, the U.S., Paraguay, and Argentina, using hydroelectric power to mine Bitcoin at its other sites and natural gas in Argentina.<br /><br />The Argentina project, announced in April 2021, has an initial contract of eight years.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the demand for cryptocurrencies has grown over the years, it has become increasingly important for traders to understand how to sell cryptocurrencies such as Tether in Dubai.</p>
<p>Tether, a stablecoin that is pegged to the US dollar, is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in Dubai. If you are looking to sell Tether in Dubai, here are some tips to help you do it the right way.</p>
<h2>Understand the Basics of Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>
<p>Before you decide to <a href="https://sellusdtindubai.com/">sell Tether in Dubai</a>, it is important to understand the basics of the process. Tether can be sold on cryptocurrency exchanges or through peer-to-peer marketplaces. You will need to have a Tether wallet and an account with a reputable exchange or marketplace to sell your Tether. Make sure to do your research to find a trustworthy platform to sell your Tether.</p>
<h2>Fees and Charges to Consider When Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>
<p>When selling Tether in Dubai, you will need to consider the fees and charges associated with the transaction. These fees can vary depending on the exchange or marketplace you use. Some platforms charge a percentage of the transaction amount, while others charge a flat fee. Make sure to read the terms and conditions carefully before you start selling your Tether to avoid any unexpected charges.</p>
<h2>How to Know if You&#8217;re Getting the Best Price</h2>
<p>Buying USDT in Dubai is not as complicated as it seems, but you should always look around to make sure you&#8217;re getting the best deal. How do you know if the price you&#8217;re looking at is the cheapest?</p>
<h3>Check the markets</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s important to take a look at different exchanges and markets, both local and global, when you buy USDT. By comparing different exchanges, you can be sure that the one you choose offers competitive prices. This can help you avoid overpaying or getting scammed.</p>
<h3>Compare fiat currency to crypto prices</h3>
<p>Price comparison tools can be used to compare prices of fiat currencies and crypto in real-time. This makes it easier for you to identify favorable opportunities when buying USDT on exchanges.</p>
<h3>Look out for discounts and promotions</h3>
<p>Sometimes, exchanges offer discounts or other promotions for buying specific amounts of cryptocurrency. Keep an eye out for these, as they could lower your costs significantly in the long run.</p>
<p>To stay safe, always make sure that the exchange you choose is reputable and trustworthy before making a purchase. With the right approach and enough research, anyone can buy USDT in Dubai without breaking a sweat!</p>
<h2>Comparing the Fees and Exchange Rates</h2>
<p>Another important factor to consider when you buy Bitcoin in Dubai or USDT in Dubai is the fees and exchange rates. It&#8217;s important to compare prices between different platforms, as fees and exchange rates can vary widely.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>The fees associated with buying USDT in Dubai may include platform fees, network fees, processing fees and withdrawal fees. Generally, you can expect the total cost of purchasing USDT to be around 2-4% depending on the platform you&#8217;re using.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand—that means that it can fluctuate over time. Before purchasing USDT, make sure to compare the current rate with other platforms so that you know you&#8217;re getting a good deal.<br />
Making sure to factor in all of these costs as well as comparing prices between different platforms before making your purchase is important for making a smart decision when buying <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/best-ways-to-sell-usdt-in-dubai/">USDT</a> in Dubai.</p>
<h2>What Payment Methods Are Available When Selling Tether?</h2>
<p>When selling Tether in Dubai, you will need to consider what payment methods are available. Most exchanges and marketplaces accept bank transfers and credit/debit cards, while some also accept payment through digital wallets. Make sure to choose a payment method that is convenient and secure for you.</p>
<h2>How to Withdraw Funds After Selling Tether in Dubai</h2>
<p>After selling your Tether, you will need to withdraw the funds to your bank account or digital wallet. The process for withdrawing funds can vary depending on the exchange or marketplace you use.</p>
<p>Some platforms allow you to withdraw funds directly to your bank account, while others require you to transfer the funds to a digital wallet first. Make sure to follow the instructions carefully to avoid any delays or issues with the withdrawal process.</p>
<h2>Advantages of Investing in Stablecoins Like Tether</h2>
<p>Investing in Stablecoins like Tether can be a great way to hold value and diversify your portfolio in Dubai. Not only is it a secure and reliable form of cryptocurrency, but investing in stablecoins can also provide you with many advantages.</p>
<h3>Low volatility</h3>
<p>Stablecoins such as Tether have low volatility, meaning that the prices do not fluctuate as much compared to other types of cryptocurrencies. This makes it a great choice for those who are looking for less risk when it comes to their investments.</p>
<h3>Less expensive transactions</h3>
<p>With some cryptocurrencies, you might experience high costs due to the amount of fees associated with each transaction. Stablecoins like Tether are much cheaper and more economical, making them ideal for people who want to make quick and affordable transactions.</p>
<h3>International payments</h3>
<p>Tether is accepted all over the world, making it one of the most popular options for sending money overseas or across borders. This means that you can easily use Tether to send money to different countries without having to worry about exchange rate fluctuations or high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Overall, if you are looking for a secure and reliable form of cryptocurrency that offers low volatility, low transaction costs, and international payment capabilities, then investing in Stablecoins like Tether could be the perfect option for you!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, selling Tether in Dubai can be a straightforward process if you understand the basics, consider the fees and charges, choose the right payment method, and follow the instructions carefully when withdrawing funds.
