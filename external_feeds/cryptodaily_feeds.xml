			  <description><![CDATA[<p>On May 26, 2023, during the annual Cannes Film Festival, the World Investment Congress Awards ceremony took place. The winner of the Investment Persona Congress Awards was Ukrainian IT businessman Mykola Udianskyi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The award ceremony for the Investment Congress Awards 2023 was an unforgettable night dedicated to the best and brightest representatives of the investment industry. At the gala dinner, led by event organizer Anna Stukkert and Investment Congress President Thomas Miss, companies, funds, platforms, brokers, consultants, the fashion industry, PR and media outlets that made a positive contribution to the investment industry were recognized.</p>
<p>One of the most anticipated parts of the evening was the announcement of the Investment Persona Congress Awards. This year, the winner was Mykola Udianskyi, a renowned Ukrainian entrepreneur in the field of information technology and technology, a scientist, and philanthropist. Mr. Udianskyi was recognized for his contributions to blockchain and cryptography, as well as his charitable activities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 'Person of the Year' award according to the Congress Awards 2023 goes to Mykola Udianskyi, who is a visionary Ukrainian technology entrepreneur,&rdquo; commented Thomas Miss. "Mykola is the president of the EHOLD Group with 10 offices in 9 countries. EHOLD employs over 500 people serving a user base exceeding 10 million users in an impressive project portfolio.He is also the founder of the Qmall exchange, which is a Ukrainian market phenomenon. Despite such a difficult year for the country, the exchange was able to gather an active community of 400 thousand users.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The organizers also acknowledged Mykola Udianskyi's charitable activities and his active civic position during the war with Russia.</p>

<p>"Mr. Udianskyi constantly helps Ukrainians who have lost their homes, income, and jobs during the war. Despite significant risks, he continues to invest funds in the restoration of his hometown, Kharkiv. He also supports Ukrainian soldiers and openly speaks about the war from internationally recognized platforms," said Anna Stukkert. "This is truly inspiring and deserving of respect and support from the global business community."</p>

<p>It should be noted that this is not the first award for Mykola Udianskyi. In 2022, he was recognized as the best digital currency expert at the World Influencers and Bloggers Awards and ranked first in Hacker Noon's 2019 list of the top 10 blockchain entrepreneurs in the CIS.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BCH has seen a spectacular surge recently, registering weekly gains of 114.3%. </p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has become this week&rsquo;s highest gainer in the top 300 tokens by market cap following a 114.3% surge in price. The token continues its uptrend, spurred by its listing on EDX Markets.</p>
BCH Reaches One-Year High
<p>The token reached a one-year high this week, just days after it listed on the EDX Markets exchange. EDX is backed by several Wall Street heavyweights such as Fidelity Digital Assets, Citadel Securities, Sequoia Capital, and Charles Schwab.</p>
<p>Unlike other crypto exchanges, EDX only allows investors to trade bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), and BCH.</p>
<p>Crypto research firm Santiment found BCH has benefitted from EDX&rsquo;s launch, rising trading volumes and social media interest.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ðŸ“ˆ With the assistance of #EDXMarkets, launched on June 20th, #BitcoinCash has been the biggest beneficiary with a massive +79% price gain in 4 days. Notably, $BCH has seen a 3-year high in social discussion rates, &amp; volume has easily eclipsed 2023 highs. https://t.co/6fz4RL28tH pic.twitter.com/MNn59zRy8T</p>

</p>
<p>The firm further found BCH&rsquo;s sudden price move attracted retail trader attention, with the token&rsquo;s trading volume this year hitting a record.</p>
BCH Surge Driven by South Korean Traders
<p>Industry analyst Colin Wu tweeted today that BCH&rsquo;s price increase may be due to trading activity on South Korean exchanges.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">South Korea may be the reason for the BCH PUMP. In the past 24h, the largest exchange in South Korea, Upbit, has recorded a trading volume of over $350 million for the BCH/KRW, contributing to 23.58% of the total trading volume for BCH.

<p>Wu noted South Korea&rsquo;s largest exchange Upbit recorded massive trading volumes on the BCH/KRW pair over the past 24 hours. He said more than $350 million in volume accounted for nearly a quarter of the total volume for BCH over that time.</p>
<p>BCH surged an incredible 31% over the past 24 hours, allowing it to top $300 for the first time since April 2022. The token, however, remains down 92% from its all-time high of $3,785 in December 2017.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Mimo Exchange, one of Web3&rsquo;s fastest, cheapest and most secure decentralized crypto exchanges, is excited to announce the launch of its transformative NFT trading platform enabling more accessible, faster, cheaper transactions and a more user-friendly interface than any other similar marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7">Mimo's NFT marketplace will provide a seamless and secure platform for buying and selling NFTs. But better yet, thanks to IoTeX's high-performing blockchain, the Mimo NFT trading platform solves the current challenges in the sector, enabling lower transaction fees, faster transaction times, and an enhanced user-friendly interface.</p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT marketplace will revolutionize the NFT industry by offering more efficient NFT trading, its low handling fee of only 1.5% of the transaction price, as well as with its exciting launch activities. Mimo is the ideal platform for NFT enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade digital assets.</p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT marketplace also addresses the non-fungible token industry's current issues, such as high transaction fees, slow transaction times, and security.</p>
<p class="s7">One of the critical barriers to mainstream adoption is the user interface. To this point, Mimo provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for experienced and novice users to discover and collect NFTs. We've designed our intuitive interface to provide a seamless user </p>
<p class="s7">The Mimo NFT Marketplace has integrated ioPay, IoTeX's official multi-chain and cross-chain crypto wallet, and all other Web3 wallets, including Metamask.</p>
<p class="s7">People who use IoPay, one of Web3&rsquo;s most unique, secure, and versatile crypto wallets that also has multichain support, for example, can directly buy and sell their NFTs on the Mimo NFT marketplace from within this crypto wallet without additional wallets or exchanges. </p>
<p class="s7">Mimo now supports purchasing cryptocurrencies with a credit card, providing even more convenience for using the Mimo NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="s7">An exciting aspect of the Mimo NFT marketplace is that it supports projects leveraging W3bstream, which means Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) startups or projects can issue their NFTs and list them directly on the Mimo NFT marketplace. It provides a new and unique way to interact and expand audiences.</p>
<p class="s7">Mimo has partnered with well-known NFT and blockchain projects to create a joint marketing campaign. This joint marketing campaign will offer users exciting opportunities and rewards for participating in Mimo's NFT marketplace.</p>
<p class="s7">To celebrate the launch, Mimo is offering 90% off on the entire transaction fee throughout July, encouraging affordable transactions for all. This limited-time offer enables users to join the Mimo community and experience the benefits of faster, cheaper, and more user-friendly NFT trading.</p>
<p class="s7"></p>
<p class="s7">Users can also look forward to several activities and giveaways during the launch event, including limited edition NFTs, exclusive access to pre-released NFTs, and competitions. The Mimo community will also have the chance to engage with our team through live AMAs, Q&amp;A sessions, and beta testing opportunities.</p>
<p class="s7">With the rise of NFTs as a new asset class, there is a need for a dedicated NFT marketplace on IoTeX to support the growing demand for NFTs in several Web3 sectors, such as art, gaming, music and for the Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) sector, which is today the most promising crypto category in the entire blockchain space. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Just as bitcoin was looking as though it was going to break the critical $31,000 price level, the SEC threw a wrench into the works with its rejection of all the latest ETF filings.</p>
Oh no! Another rejection
<p>The crypto market was alive and buzzing once again, looking as though it had finally emerged from a harsh crypto winter on the back of institutional ETF filings that looked as though this time might be approved.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler at the SEC was having none of it. Blackrock, Fidelity et al could be damned. The Biden administration is absolutely determined to try and break the crypto industry, and even if the biggest institutional money in the country wants in, it&rsquo;s not going to happen on Gensler&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>The news dropped like a bomb onto the crypto market. The Wall Street Journal was first to report it with the headline:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;SEC Says Spot Bitcoin ETF Filings Are Inadequate&rdquo;</p>

<p>Assuming that Blackrock and the rest had done their homework on the Bitcoin Spot ETF, it was hard to imagine what on earth else might be required by the SEC.</p>
Crypto market plummets
<p>In a matter of seconds bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market plummeted lower. Bitcoin immediately dropped to the exact bottom of its bull flag, made a beautiful touch, and then bounced back. It is currently sitting at the $30,200 price mark, which also happens to be the 0.618 Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>The altcoins fell even more drastically. The Total 3 chart (all cryptocurrencies except BTC and ETH) fell like a stone, losing over 4%, equivalent to around $13 billion in value.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH), probably the coin riding the highest up until the SEC announcement, rapidly fell over 13%, dropping from $314 to $272, before bouncing back around half way to $293.</p>
Was the news as bad as all that?
<p>Senior Bloomberg Analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted out soon after the announcement saying that in his view the news was not as bad as the headline suggested. He said that the SEC was really after the name of the crypto exchange for the &ldquo;surveillance-sharing agreement&rdquo; and required more details on SSA.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hold up a second, this isn't as bad as headline. The key paragraph is deep in story. Basically SEC wants them to name the "crypto exchange" and give more details on SSA. That's understandable, arguably good news. I was under impression they'd have to update that as well. pic.twitter.com/bh9qn65Xh2</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>It does look as though the market is starting to digest this, and if the ETFs aren&rsquo;t being outright rejected then a surge in the opposite direction might be expected to take place. Hold on to your hats!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solana&rsquo;s Cardinal protocol just announced its decision to wind down operations and shut down, citing economic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
Cardinal Starts 2-Months &ldquo;Notice Period&rdquo;
<p>Nearly a year after raising $4.4 million, Solana&rsquo;s NFT utility provider, Cardinal Labs, has decided to pack it in. The protocol was launched in early 2022 as an infrastructure provider to improve NFT utility on the Solana network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday, the Cardinal team took to Twitter to announce that they would be winding down operations and eventually shut shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wrote,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today is the first day of our 2 month &ldquo;notice period&rdquo; (6/28-8/26) during which we recommend any and all depositors of assets into our systems manually withdraw them. All of our website product UIs will remain live during the period so that no one should have any issue doing so.&rdquo;</p>

&ldquo;Product Market Fit Difficult&rdquo;
<p>The team tweeted that the macroeconomic conditions have been very challenging for the protocol. They claimed that product market fit has been difficult, and although there has been some usage of the protocol&rsquo;s staking, rentals, and identity products, the market has not scaled up as they had hoped it would. Until blockchain tech adoption happens on a larger scale, the protocol&rsquo;s offerings are &ldquo;stuck in the context of the crypto maximalist community.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team also noted that the code behind the protocol will always be open source and accessible by all, even after the deployments are no longer live. They also reassured users that their assets were safe and would be returned to owners by the end of the process.&nbsp;</p>
Wind Down Schedule&nbsp;
<p>August 26 would mark the end of the two-month notice period, so users will need to complete all withdrawals by that date. The team has also dropped the closing schedule, which revealed that activities like creating staking pools, token management, NFT rentals and rental extensions, management of social media handles, and new deposits would be suspended on July 19.</p>
<p>The team tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As we move towards closing up shop, our focus now shifts to carrying out a wind down as smoothly as possible so that the Solana ecosystem doesn&rsquo;t skip a beat&hellip;We realize that many people and teams rely on our protocols, and we want to minimize the impact of this transition on the ecosystem as much as possible, so we&rsquo;ve worked deliberately to find a path that does just that.&rdquo;</p>

Another Solana Project Shuts Down
<p>Twitter user and crypto expert JagoeCapital pointed out that Solana-related protocols are not faring well in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cardinal announced a $4.4 Million raise just 11 months ago led by Solana Ventures and ProtagonistXYZ with headline participation from Alameda Research, Animoca Brands and Delphi Digital. Today they announced they will be shutting down. It&rsquo;s becoming a common theme with Solana projects.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Blockchain Association, a prominent lobbyist group for the cryptocurrency industry in the United States, has called on SEC Chair Gary Gensler to recuse himself from enforcing rules on the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission under Gensler has taken a hostile approach to crypto, filing lawsuits against several prominent crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>
Blockchain Association Pens Open Letter&nbsp;
<p>The call for the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair to remove himself from crypto-related matters was issued in the form of a statement released by the Blockchain Association. It comes after cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a notice of intent on Wednesday, requesting a court to dismiss the regulator&rsquo;s lawsuit against the exchange. In the letter, the Blockchain Association contends that Gensler has repeatedly asserted that everything other than Bitcoin is a security and that his statement gives the appearance that he cannot approach the issue with an open mind. The letter alleged that repeatedly expressing the same view meant that the SEC chair had prejudiced the central issue regarding digital asset-related enforcement proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, the letter alleged that Gensler&rsquo;s vote on whether or not to proceed with filing an action was biased. The Blockchain Association also stated that any SEC enforcement action must follow the &ldquo;Wells Process,&rdquo; which would give the target of the enforcement action enough time to present evidence and arguments for their case. However, thanks to Gensler&rsquo;s unbiased perspective, core questions related to the crypto industry would not receive a fair assessment from the SEC. Chief Policy Officer at the Blockchain Association, Jake Chervinksy, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear that the digital assets industry cannot expect a fair assessment from Chair Gensler. His steadfast view that all digital assets except bitcoin are securities means that he cannot approach enforcement decisions with a fair and impartial mind, as required by the SEC&rsquo;s Wells process and federal law. The time has come for Chair Gensler to recuse himself from all decisions related to digital asset-related enforcement matters. If he refuses, then I expect enforcement targets will begin raising the matter of his recusal in SEC proceedings and in federal district courts.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase And The SEC&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission had sued Coinbase, alleging that the platform offered users at least 13 crypto assets that are securities and should have been registered with the SEC. It had also sued Binance on similar charges just a day prior. In its reply, Coinbase stated that the Securities and Exchange Commission was well aware of the crypto exchange&rsquo;s digital asset operations thanks to its public offering registration, which was done in April 2021. It further added that out of the cryptocurrencies that the SEC called securities, 6 were already trading on Coinbase when the agency reviewed the exchange&rsquo;s public offering registration. Coinbase stated in its filing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The only change is in the SEC&rsquo;s position regarding its powers. That position is untenable as a matter of law, and its assertion through this enforcement action offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&rdquo;</p>

SEC Action On Crypto&nbsp;
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has undertaken considerable legal action against crypto exchanges during the ongoing year. Kraken was fined $30 million for offering crypto staking programs, with the SEC stating that the exchange was offering users unregistered securities. The agency also issued a warning to the Paxos Trust Company, an issuer of the Binance stablecoin, that it faces possible legal action. This led to Paxos freezing the minting of the stablecoin, which the SEC stated was an unregistered security. Coinbase criticized the SEC&rsquo;s actions in its filing, saying that the SEC&rsquo;s action in the current scenario was unlawful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than test its new view through notice-and-comment rulemaking, the SEC has chosen to roll out its ever-aggressive agenda through punitive retroactive enforcement actions. Agency enforcement authority is important but not boundless. The SEC&rsquo;s action here is beyond those bounds and unlawful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Blockchain Association was also critical of the SEC, stating that the federal agency&rsquo;s actions under Gensler had further muddied regulatory waters and forced lawful crypto companies operating in the country to reconsider their operations and move to friendlier jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>
The Political Divide&nbsp;
<p>Gensler&rsquo;s hostile approach to crypto has found support with many Democrats, who have lauded his efforts. However, lawmakers on the other side of the aisle have roundly criticized the SEC and Gensler&rsquo;s approach. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson also introduced a bill called the SEC Stabilization Act on the 13th of June. The bill sought to restructure the federal agency and remove Gensler as chair.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance&rsquo;s crypto custody licence application has reportedly been rejected by the German BaFin regulator.</p>
Another setback
<p>Still the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, Binance is continuing to labour into strong headwinds, suffering regulatory pushback in some European countries, and of course currently being sued by the US regulator.</p>
<p>The latest setback for Binance was reported by the German-based Finance Fwd website. The article stated that the BaFin regulator had either officially denied a crypto custody licence application, or had verbally notified Binance that its licence had been rejected.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Binance was quoted as saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin's requirements. It is an ongoing process&rdquo;</p>

<p>They added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The rejection in Germany will be a difficult pill to swallow for Binance&rsquo;s CEO Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ. The ongoing defence of his company and him personally in the US is a weight around the neck of the crypto exchange.</p>
Battlegrounds need to be won
<p>With such a globally important regulator as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accusing CZ of embezzlement of customer funds among other allegations, obtaining regulatory licences in other countries is going to be difficult, at least until it is known how the accusations are likely to pan out.</p>
<p>Given that Binance is such an important exchange in the crypto ecosystem many may be hoping that it is able to resist the SEC. Both Binance and Coinbase are very important battlegrounds that need to be fought and won if the crypto industry is to reinject some momentum into the beleaguered asset class.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Slovakian Parliament this week voted in favour of a bill that would lower taxes on income derived from cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Members of the Slovak Republic&rsquo;s National Council, or parliament, voted to approve an amendment that would lower cryptocurrency taxes, along with other measures that would affect crypto holders.</p>
Crypto Income Tax Reduced to 7%
<p>Bloomberg Law reports that Slovakia&rsquo;s National Council voted in favour of reducing personal income tax on profits derived from the sale of crypto held by a user for at least one year. As it stands, cryptocurrency profits are taxed on a sliding scale of either 19% or 25%.</p>
<p>The approved amendment will see taxes lowered significantly to 7%.</p>
<p>The amendment further declares payments received in cryptocurrencies up to 2,400 euros, or $2,600, will not be taxed. Additionally, the bill excludes cryptocurrency income from a health insurance contribution of 14%.</p>
Slovakia Will Lose 30 Million Euro Through Tax Cuts
<p>The newly amended tax policy comes only weeks after parliament passed a constitutional amendment that codifies citizens&rsquo; right to use cash as payment. The amendment was made due to talk about a digital euro.</p>
<p>According to a local Slovakian media outlet, the Ministry of Finance estimates it will lose around 30 million euros annually due to the tax cut. &nbsp;</p>
US Lags as Europe Makes Regulatory Strides
<p>Slovakia, as one of the 27 member states of the European Union (EU), has been promoting cryptocurrency regulations across the region. The EU voted in favour of its landmark MiCA bill, which will make Europe a hub for digital assets. The bill will take effect in 2024.</p>
<p>The UK also made a significant step toward its crypto goal. The House of Lords voted to enact the Financial Services and Markets Bill, which will see cryptocurrencies become a &ldquo;regulated activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore and even Dubai compete for their share in the booming crypto market, the situation is less than ideal in the US. With full backing from the Biden administration, the SEC drives the industry away from its shores and ultimately into the arms of those who embrace it.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Melania Trump, the former first lady of the United States, has launched a new NFT collection to celebrate the country&rsquo;s Independence Day, inspired by the nation&rsquo;s iconic landmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collection, called &ldquo;The 1776 Collection,&rdquo; consists of a six-piece range of NFTs consisting of images sourced from across the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>
Trump Family NFTs Make A Comeback&nbsp;
<p>The Trump family is back in the NFT space with the launch of Melania Trump&rsquo;s new NFT collection inspired by the upcoming Independence Day holiday. The launch of the new collection comes only a couple of months after former president Donald Trump released the second set of his NFT trading cards. The new set of collectibles launched by the former first lady is part of &ldquo;The 1776 Collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NFTs are based on the Solana blockchain and feature several iconic images, including prominent landmarks such as Mount Rushmore and the Statue of Liberty, affixed to animated placards. Each NFT is priced at $50, with the collection comprising seven different designs, making up a total of 3500 NFTs. The NFTs can be purchased through a website called USA Collectibles, with Melania Trump retweeting the company&rsquo;s original tweet about the NFT collection going on sale. The USA Collectibles website also offers POTUS TRUMP NFTs, which feature photos of former President Trump and the former first lady. Melania Trump stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The 1776 Collection of artwork draws inspiration from several iconic landmarks of our nation, which I had the privilege of visiting during the time I served as first lady. Each piece provides a view into our nation&rsquo;s history, culture, and patriotism. I am proud to celebrate our great nation and remain inspired by the words contained within the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The collection went live on the 29th of July.&nbsp;</p>
Portion Of Proceeds To Benefit Foster Kids&nbsp;
<p>According to reports, a portion of all proceeds from the collection will go towards Fostering The Future, an initiative by BeBest. The initiative helps children in the foster care community secure educational opportunities and scholarships. Primarily, the Fostering the Future initiative aims to grant computer science scholarships to children coming out of the foster care system, helping them achieve the academic foundation needed to secure technology-based jobs. The former first lady also added that her commitment towards the foster community has grown stronger since leaving Washington DC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melania Trump also added that she supports former President Trump&rsquo;s reelection campaign and looks forward to working with him once again and restoring hope for the future and leading America. She stated that if she could serve as the first lady again, she would continue to prioritize initiatives that focus on the well-being and development of children, ensuring that they reach their full potential.&nbsp;</p>
The Trumps And NFTs&nbsp;
<p>The Trumps have considerable history in the NFT ecosystem going back at least a couple of years. It was Melania Trump who first jumped into the NFT space with the release of her first NFT in December 2021. The NFT was also based on the Solana blockchain. However, Solana Labs, the entity behind the Solana blockchain, clarified that it was not a Solana-led initiative. The former first lady released more NFTs in 2022 before former president Donald Trump released his popular digital trading cards collection, consisting of around 45,000 NFTs. The collection was launched on Polygon, an Ethereum scaling solution, and each NFT was priced at $99. Furthermore, each NFT in the collection was tied to special perks, such as a potential dinner with the ex-president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the collection was widely ridiculed, it sold out within 24 hours and became the talk of the NFT space, causing their resale value to surge. At the peak of their popularity, the cards were starting at a price of over $1000 on secondary marketplaces. The former president then released a second collection, consisting of 47,000 NFTs, causing the original NFTs&rsquo; price to fall considerably. At present, the original Trump NFTs start at around $185, while NFTs from the second collection start at approximately $54.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Prominent crypto wallet service provider, Ledger, has announced its latest venture into the world of institutional trading technology.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Dubbed "Tradelink," this new trading and settlement network technology is set to revolutionize the landscape for asset managers, custodians, and exchanges/OTC. Aiming to streamline operations and boost efficiency, Tradelink will allow trading on multiple exchanges without the need for on-chain liquidity re-balancing.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This will ensure that users maintain custodial ownership of assets while engaging in off-exchange trading. Additionally, Tradelink seeks to mitigate trading collateral risks across various third-party platforms, offer easy integration with preferred counter-parties, and significantly reduce transaction fees.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company&rsquo;s official announcement stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Today, we are proud to announce that Ledger is entering the institutional trading technology market with the first open network to enable custodial trading via exchange and custodial partners. This solution will provide unparalleled control, security, flexibility, and transparent governance over an enterprise&rsquo;s digital asset trading."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger's VP of Enterprise Revenue, Sebastien Badault, emphasizes how Tradelink will empower users, asserting:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;By unlocking better trading options for enterprises, we are empowering asset managers, custodians, and exchanges to navigate the changing landscape with confidence while making the whole ecosystem a safer and more transparent place.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">At launch, Tradelink will be accessible to all Ledger Enterprise clients at no additional cost. Initial partners will include well-known asset managers such as Laser Digital and Hodl Group, digital asset trading and orchestration platforms like Wyden, and platform partners including Crypto.com, Bitstamp, Huobi, and more.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The launch of Tradelink comes after Ledger's recent controversial update, which raised security concerns among its users. However, the company remains undeterred and has just closed a $109 Million Series C extension fundraising round, pushing its valuation to $1.4 billion.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Badault further elaborates on the company's vision for Tradelink:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;We are creating a future-proof solution that will give Ledger Enterprise customers flexibility and security allowing institutions to de-risk their businesses. For almost a decade, Ledger has been building security and governance solutions for the crypto ecosystem. It is this core security foundation that can now be used to reduce counterparty risk and enable custodial trading for institutional investors.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ledger&rsquo;s innovative Trading Operation technology, coupled with its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance, positions the company at the forefront of an increasingly evolving market, navigating the ever-changing regulatory and overall market landscape with confidence.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Diving Deeper into Blockchain Technology</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In the quest to foster innovation in the financial technology space, Mastercard is poised to launch the beta version of its Mastercard Multi Token Network (MTN) in the UK in the coming months. The venture is being touted as an "app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard's Executive Vice President and Head of Crypto and Blockchain, emphasized the value of the underlying technology that powers crypto, stating that it is "actually quite useful." </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Developers leveraging MTN will gain access to a myriad of tools that the company has been developing, one of which includes a private Ethereum-based blockchain, specifically crafted for the creation of novel applications.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency project led by Sam Altman, co-founder of the AI bot ChatGPT, has announced a partnership with digital identity provider Auth0 to effectively manage World ID logins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Altman's innovative venture aims to offer a global, financial identity to citizens around the globe. Worldcoin's open-source protocol, backed by a network of developers, economists, and engineers, is designed to foster collective ownership worldwide, enabling equal access regardless of class or economic status. Utilizing an iris scanning device, the World ID, Worldcoin aims to ensure secure access to several Web2 platforms while combating the issue of bots impersonating genuine users. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Notably, the Worldcoin ecosystem also comprises the WorldApp payments network, promoting financial inclusion by facilitating cryptocurrency transactions. As part of its dedication to the significant challenges of the web3 world, Worldcoin supports the Optimism Collective, an initiative aiming to enhance Ethereum's scalability by reducing transaction costs.</p>
Worldcoin Collaborates with Auth0 for ID Verification 
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The crypto project has announced the launch of the "Sign in with Worldcoin" feature in Berlin, which uses the World ID biometric scanning system. This function is also set to be integrated with the Auth0 marketplace, the world's largest provider of digital identity solutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The &ldquo;Sign in with Worldcoin&rdquo; feature, based on zero-knowledge cryptographic proofs, will help users verify their digital identities while maintaining their privacy. This approach eliminates the risk of user data being shared with third-party services without consent, ensuring that all World ID-registered users are real people. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Auth0's services offer an alternative way for Worldcoin developers to create financial solutions tailored to a broad spectrum of individuals. Worldcoin's innovations introduce an effective measure against the spread of bots within virtual environments, a problem estimated to cause digital advertising fraud amounting to $100 billion worldwide by 2023.</p>
Mysterious Safe Deployments Linked to Worldcoin
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In other news, Worldcoin recently confirmed its role behind a series of Safe deployments to the Optimism network. A Safe, previously known as &ldquo;Gnosis Safe&rdquo;, is a multisignature smart contract wallet, widely used by development teams for added security in transactions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A social media post from Tiago Sada, head of product for Worldcoin developer Tools for Humanity, revealed Worldcoin was behind the Safe deployments. Initially, these transactions led to speculation, including concerns about a possible Sybil attack or address-farming technique to profit from misdirected coins.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Worldcoin, which extensively uses Safes to offer gas-free transactions to verified humans, recently announced it was migrating its app from Polygon to Optimism. This migration seemed to be the cause behind the deployment of numerous Safes, reassuring the community that the network was not under any form of attack. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The ongoing evolution of Worldcoin signifies a promising direction towards secure digital identities, advancing privacy, and combatting fraudulent activity in the realm of social and web3 applications.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Most crypto enthusiasts are familiar with older crypto giants that have made a lot of money for investors since their introduction to the crypto market. While these crypto giants have created a lot of profit for investors, it has become necessary for investors to seek out new DeFi projects to earn money from. Thankfully, new crypto projects with viable utilities are constantly added to the market, giving investors more options.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) is one of the latest crypto projects whose presale has already made money for investors after its Beta stage. InQubeta's presale indicates it could be more profitable than an older crypto giant like Cardano (ADA). More investors are putting their money into InQubeta to increase their profit margins in the coming months.</p>
<p>InQubeta's (QUBE) Presale Forges Ahead in the Crypto Market</p>
<p>InQubeta has successfully launched a presale that crypto enthusiasts are eager to participate in. With an ecosystem designed to offer an easy pathway to the AI market, InQubeta is slowly gaining the trust of reputable crypto investors. InQubeta's presale has recorded unprecedented success in the crypto market, increasing investors' chances of becoming wealthy through this project.</p>
<p>The QUBE token presale is divided into 10 stages, and each stage has an allocated number of tokens to be sold at a different price. The price of QUBE increases at the beginning of a new presale stage, ensuring the token's value grows as the presale progresses. The first presale stage, the Beta stage, was recently completed, pushing QUBE into its second presale phase, Stage 1.</p>
<p>The DeFi coin price of QUBE in its current stage is $0.00875, and there are 100,000,000 QUBE tokens to be sold. InQubeta's presale has raised over $600,000, and it will only raise more before the presale stages are complete. In the next stage, QUBE will be sold for $0.0098, drawing closer to its launch price of $0.0308. InQubeta is one of the most profitable new DeFi projects, as its presale also features bonuses for investors.</p>
<p>Once the presale ends, InQubeta's ability to link AI startups and investors will make it even more popular among investors. With an NFT marketplace that allows AI startups to connect with potential investors, InQubeta is set to become one of the best DeFi projects the crypto market has ever seen. InQubeta's NFT marketplace is built on the Ethereum blockchain, increasing its credibility and efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All transactions within InQubeta are paid for using the QUBE token. This increases the token's value, solidifying InQubeta's position as an excellent project to add to your portfolio in 2023. As more investors notice InQubeta's value, its DeFi coin price is only likely to increase, making it an excellent investment option for the future. Some believe it could 10x by the end of the year, and it definitely has all the key components of a crypto that could explode in value.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardano (ADA) Maintains its Position as a Crypto Giant</p>
<p>Cardano was created using a research-based approach to crypto development. The crypto giant is one of the most popular blockchains for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps). It also offers a highly sustainable network with increased transaction processing speeds.</p>
<p>Cardano seeks to build a network that is not limited by bandwidth, promising a wider reach for blockchain developers in the crypto market. Cardano has remained one of the most profitable cryptocurrencies since it was launched. Its native token, ADA, runs operations on the platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Cardano is one of the best DeFi projects in the crypto market; however, investors are looking for new cryptos to diversify their portfolios. InQubeta's presale has created a more profitable opportunity for investors to earn more money. This is why InQubeta's presale is selling out fast and gaining momentum among investors.</p>
<p>The QUBE token may be the most profitable crypto token of 2023. Its ecosystem promises to give investors better investment opportunities that will increase the value of their holdings. Investing in its presale now is a great way to ensure you are not left out when InQubeta's price rises.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the Ethereum (ETH) network continues to evolve, changes in its validator limit can significantly impact its performance, transaction fees, and adoption. By analyzing the latest market trends, the article will provide insights into Ethereum's (ETH) future price trajectory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a presale token, Uwerx, is taking the crypto market by surprise with its astounding presale success. The project has made significant progress and updates to spice up its platform before launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to navigate Uwerx&rsquo;s success and Ethereum's (ETH) potential price prediction in light of the validator limit change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Predicting Ethereum's (ETH) Price Post Validator Limit Change
<p>As Ethereum (ETH) continues to make waves in the crypto market, one key factor closely watched by investors and analysts is the impact of the Validator Limit Change on its future price projection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change refers to a crucial adjustment in the Ethereum (ETH) network to address scalability challenges and improve transaction throughput.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has snowballed in recent weeks to hit new highs that strengthen its stance on the market. Ethereum (ETH) trades for $1,881.11 with a trading volume of $12 billion. As the second-largest crypto, Ethereum (ETH) has a market cap of $226 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Validator Limit Change is expected to further enhance Ethereum's (ETH) scalability, enabling the network to process more transactions efficiently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This upgrade has generated a positive sentiment among market participants, as it addresses long-standing concerns about network congestion and high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Analysts predict that the update could affect Ethereum (ETH) positively. Some experts anticipate Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $1,966 as the network's improvements take effect.</p>
<p>Regardless of the positive Ethereum (ETH) outlook, Uwerx promises to improve as investors expect a price surge in the coming months.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY WERX TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Price Prediction: Presale Sell-Out Nears
<p>The Uwerx revolution is in full swing, propelling the future of work toward unprecedented heights. With the presale nearing its end, Uwerx is gearing up to express its gratitude to early supporters through a Test Airdrop, acknowledging their unwavering trust and commitment to the project.</p>
<p>Uwerx's unwavering dedication to stability and long-term growth is evident in its decision to lock liquidity for an astonishing 25 years. This commitment ensures a reliable platform for users, fostering a sense of trust and confidence in the ecosystem. The team's tokens are locked for 9 months, demonstrating their deep-rooted belief in Uwerx's potential.</p>
<p>Breaking free from the traditional fee structures, Uwerx charges an industry-leading transaction fee of just 1%. This remarkable difference, compared to platforms like Upwork and Fiverr, with significantly higher costs, empowers users to retain a more significant portion of their hard-earned income, fostering financial independence.</p>
<p>Introducing the game-changing Uwerx Vault allows users to securely store their WERX tokens while earning rewards based on platform variables. This innovative feature ensures the safety of assets and encourages active participation and engagement, fueling a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem.</p>
<p>Ensuring the highest level of security, Uwerx subjected its platform to rigorous audits by reputable firms like SolidProof and InterFi Network. These comprehensive assessments provide users with peace of mind, knowing that their transactions and assets are protected within a robust and reliable infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Uwerx community thrives, with over 7,000 sign-ups, an active Twitter presence, and a vibrant Telegram group. This engaged and supportive community forms the backbone of Uwerx's success, fostering collaboration and collective growth.</p>
<p>Uwerx's presale has been nothing short of extraordinary, surpassing expectations and capturing the crypto community's attention. In Stage 5 of the presale, Uwerx offers tokens at an enticing price of $0.041 each. This presents a unique opportunity for investors to join the Uwerx ecosystem at an accessible rate. And with a generous 15% bonus accompanying each purchase, the value proposition becomes even more compelling.</p>
<p>Consider joining the presale now to take advantage of the anticipated price increase from $0.0415 to $0.047725. To benefit from the potential yield, ensure that you place your orders before Wednesday, 28th at 18:00. Any orders placed after this time will be completed at the corresponding price.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK) is currently one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, things in the crypto industry change rapidly, so you can never rely on only one coin.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) recently entered the cryptocurrency world, and although still in presale, it already faces an 80% price increase. Therefore, experts estimate that once Tradecurve (TCRV) tokens reach reputable exchanges, they can surge by 100x.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chainlink (LINK) Price Predictions
<p>After establishing a partnership with Stella in order to secure its DeFi strategies, Chainlink (LINK) rebounded on a bullish run. But that didn&rsquo;t last for too long.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, Chainlink (LINK) decreased by 0.79%, currently standing at $6.09. The main reason for its price decline is Golteum&rsquo;s joining the Chainlink (LINK) BUILD program, which significantly pressures the Chainlink (LINK) coin. However, this should leverage the Chainlink (LINK) industry-leading technology and provide investors with secure, efficient, and transparent trading options.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, experts believe that Chainlink (LINK) will have a positive price movement in the upcoming period if this collaboration proves to work. Additionally, ChatGPT has bright expectations about the coin as well. It forecasts that Chainlink (LINK) will reach $12 if the tokens&rsquo; supply remains constant.</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The past few weeks have been amazing for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tradecurve?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tradecurve&lt;/a&gt; project and community. ðŸ’Ž&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have over 12,000 users who have signed up for the presale, 4,400 holders, and have raised over $2.7 million. ðŸ”¥&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a LIMITED time only, the team is offering a 50% deposit bonus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ðŸ‘‰ðŸ§µðŸ‘‡ &lt;a href="https://t.co/CCwI4aICZr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CCwI4aICZr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tradecurve (@Tradecurveapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tradecurveapp/status/1673464018651205632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 26, 2023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>

Tradecurve (TCRV) Brings Waves to the Crypto Industry
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) is a new project representing a decentralized platform that offers numerous trading options from a single account. More precisely, you can trade cryptocurrencies, CFDs, forex, options, commodities, EFTs, indices, and bonds. Due to combining all of these options in one platform, Tradecurve (TCRV) is the first project to offer something like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Tradecurve (TCRV), you can enjoy total anonymity because the platform doesn&rsquo;t implement the lengthy KYC verification method. Also, Tradecurve has some pretty amazing benefits for investors. For instance, you can utilize copy trading that helps you implement successful traders&rsquo; techniques, high leverage starting at 500:1, and AI algorithmic or automatic trading. All you need to do is put crypto as a deposit and enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Tradecurve (TCRV) doesn&rsquo;t stop here. The platform is considering developing a metaverse trading academy that will help less experienced traders connect with industry experts and learn their strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the main reason why Tradecurve (TCRV) draws so much attention is its native TCRV tokens that have faced an 80% price increase while still in presale. You can purchase the TCRV tokens for $0.018. In addition, Tradecurve has already raised $2.8 million from its goal of $20 million, which puts it in a great position to compete with the industry&rsquo;s giants &ndash; Binance and Kraken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto analysts forecast that TCRV tokens will experience a 50x surge while in presale and an additional 100x once they get listed on a tier 1 CEX. So why don&rsquo;t you hurry up and take advantage of the Tradecurve (TCRV) 50% deposit bonus that is available until the 3rd of July?&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chainlink (LINK) is currently one of the best cryptocurrencies. However, things in the crypto industry change rapidly, so you can never rely on only one coin.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) recently entered the cryptocurrency world, and although still in presale, it already faces an 80% price increase. Therefore, experts estimate that once Tradecurve (TCRV) tokens reach reputable exchanges, they can surge by 100x.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
Chainlink (LINK) Price Predictions
<p>After establishing a partnership with Stella in order to secure its DeFi strategies, Chainlink (LINK) rebounded on a bullish run. But that didn&rsquo;t last for too long.</p>
<p>In the last 24 hours, Chainlink (LINK) decreased by 0.79%, currently standing at $6.09. The main reason for its price decline is Golteum&rsquo;s joining the Chainlink (LINK) BUILD program, which significantly pressures the Chainlink (LINK) coin. However, this should leverage the Chainlink (LINK) industry-leading technology and provide investors with secure, efficient, and transparent trading options.</p>
<p>On a more positive note, experts believe that Chainlink (LINK) will have a positive price movement in the upcoming period if this collaboration proves to work. Additionally, ChatGPT has bright expectations about the coin as well. It forecasts that Chainlink (LINK) will reach $12 if the tokens&rsquo; supply remains constant.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The House of Lords passed the Financial Services and Markets Bill today, which aims to regulate bitcoin and crypto in the UK.</p>
Rocket boost for the economy
<p>The upper house of the British government, the House of Lords, has voted to pass into law the Financial Services and Markets Bill that will see the UK embark on a path of acceptance of cryptocurrencies as &ldquo;regulated activity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a bold move from the UK really puts it on the map as regards its announcement last year which stated that it wished to be a global hub for crypto, and flies completely contrary to the anti-crypto environment that permeates the Biden administration in the US.</p>
<p>Hailed as a &ldquo;Rocket Boost for [the] UK economy&rdquo; on the UK Gov website, the bill aims to make a &ldquo;technologically advanced financial services sector&rdquo; that is &ldquo;open&rdquo;, and which will &ldquo;grow the economy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As well as moving away from the US rejection of the crypto industry, the UK will repeal all the old laws that were passed in Brussels when it was a member of the EU. The UK Gov statement on its website affirmed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;By repealing old EU laws set in Brussels it will unlock billions in investment &ndash; cash that can unlock innovation and grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The statement also read that today&rsquo;s act will regulate crypto assets so that they can be safely adopted in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as first suggested by Hester Peirce, US SEC commissioner and staunch defender of the innovations brought by the crypto sector, the UK will &ldquo;establish Sandboxes&rdquo; where crypto financial technologies can be tested before being released to the market.</p>
Crypto gold rush begins as US looks on
<p>As the UK government and regulators start to rewrite the financial rule book in order to grease the rails of innovation with full transparency and oversight of its regulators, this move has the potential to set a crypto gold rush in motion.</p>
<p>The European Union has its MiCA regulations coming into force in 2024, Hong Kong, with Chinese backing, is opening itself up as a potential go-to crypto hub in Asia, and other jurisdictions such as Singapore and Dubai are also competing for a share of the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Back over the pond in the US things are starting to look more and more gloomy as the SEC with full backing from the government drives the most innovative industry since the Internet away from its shores and into the welcome embrace of the aforementioned countries. The crypto industry will go where it is most welcome - and this certainly is not in the United States of today.</p>
