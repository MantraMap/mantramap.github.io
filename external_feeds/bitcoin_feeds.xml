The move came during a volatile market session, which saw crypto&#x2019;s global market cap remain largely unchanged. Solana was a notable exception however, racing to a one-month peak.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) rallied back above $300.00 on Thursday, prior to the global crypto market moving to consolidate.</p>
<p>Following a low of $250.23 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD jumped to an intraday peak at $300.85 earlier in the day&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of the rally, price moved to its strongest point since the start of the week, and closer to a recent 15-month high.</p>

<p>Earlier gains have now been erased, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> falling to a current reading at $279.71 as of writing.</p>
<p>One of the catalysts for this is the fact that the relative strength index (RSI) moved closer to a ceiling at 73.00, after bouncing from a floor at 70.00.</p>
<p>The index is now tracking at 71.69, and will likely consolidate around this area for the remainder of the day.</p>

<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) moved past the $20.00 level earlier in the day, hitting a one-month high in the process.</p>
<p>SOL/USD surged to an intraday high at $20.32, which comes after falling to a bottom at $18.50 the day prior.</p>
<p>This rally has resulted in the world&#x2019;s ninth largest cryptocurrency hitting its highest level since June 6.</p>

<p>Since this earlier high, SOL has since slipped, with bulls unable to sustain a breakout of the $20.00 price point.</p>
<p>This was in part due to the RSI failing to breach its own resistance zone, which was around 61.00.</p>
<p>SOL&#x2019;s price strength is now sitting at 57.72, and appears to be heading for a lower floor near the 52.00 area.</p>

These licenses are a part of Twitter&#8217;s endeavor to secure money transmitter licenses in all 50 U.S. states. With these recent approvals, Twitter can now function as a payment provider within the three aforementioned states.</strong></p>
<h2>Twitter Secures Money Transmitter Licenses in Key States Amidst Meta’s Threads Launch Gathering 10 Million Users</h2>
<p>The social media platform owned by Tesla&#8217;s Elon Musk has received three state money transmitter licenses, as stated in an <a href="https://twitter.com/TitterDaily/status/1676680872878292995?s=20">announcement</a> on Wednesday. Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/TitterDaily/status/1676682276292411394?s=20">shared</a> that Twitter aims to launch a payments system by the end of the year, following approvals from both the United States and international markets. These approvals were granted by Michigan, New Hampshire, and Missouri, enabling Twitter to operate as a payment provider in those specific regions.</p>
<p>In essence, a state-approved money transmitter license grants official authorization to an entity or individual to legally participate in the money transmission or payment instrument business. Twitter has the potential to explore various concepts such as issuing prepaid cards and providing remittance services involving foreign currencies. This strategic move is in line with Musk&#8217;s vision for &#8220;X&#8221; or the &#8220;Everything App,&#8221; as he previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-hints-everything-app-x-is-coming-says-buying-twitter-accelerates-creation-of-x/">stated</a> in October that “Twitter is an accelerant to fulfilling the original X.com vision.”</p>
<p>The concept of the Everything App aims to become a comprehensive destination encompassing various functionalities such as social media, payments, news, messaging, and more, similar to China&#8217;s Wechat application. The state approvals for the money transmitter licenses arrive concurrently with Twitter&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-sparks-controversy-with-twitter-rate-limits-censorship-expert-says-musk-has-stepped-on-a-rattlesnake/">implementation of rate limits</a> on the platform. The recently imposed and controversial limits allow verified users to read up to 6,000 tweets per day, while unverified users are restricted to 600. Furthermore, new unverified users have a daily limit of 300 posts, and individuals who are not signed into Twitter are unable to access any tweets.</p>

<p>In addition, Meta&#8217;s Instagram has introduced a rival to Twitter known as Threads, and Mark Zuckerberg, Meta&#8217;s CEO, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66112648">asserts</a> that 10 million users have already registered for the service. &#8220;It&#8217;ll take some time, but I think there should be a public conversations app with 1 billion+ people on it,” stated Zuckerberg this week. &#8220;Twitter has had the opportunity to do this but hasn&#8217;t nailed it. Hopefully, we will.&#8221; Meta has already secured Money Services Business (MSB) licenses in multiple U.S. states, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/facebook-obtains-money-transmitter-licenses-in-15-states/">commencing the process</a> back in 2012.</p>

The report on last month&#x2019;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that &#x201C;almost all participants&#x201D; are in favor of further hikes this year. Ethereum also rebounded following the minutes.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) climbed higher on Thursday, as traders continued to react to the latest FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p>The minutes revealed that &#x201C;Almost all participants noted that in their economic projections that they judged that additional increases in the target federal funds rate during 2023 would be appropriate.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to an intraday peak at $31,460.05, which comes following a low at $30,225.61 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>

<p>As a result of this high, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> rose to its strongest point since last June, when the price was trading above $32,000.</p>
<p>Bulls appear to be once again targeting this point, however will first need to break out of a ceiling at $31,500.</p>
<p>So far they have been unable to do this, pushing the price to a current level at $30,750.56.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) briefly rose in today&#x2019;s session, however has since slipped, as market momentum began to shift.</p>
<p>Following an earlier high at $1,956.01, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD has dropped to a bottom at $1,909.66 at the time of writing.</p>
<p>The downturn came as traders once again failed to breach a key resistance level at the $1,960 mark.</p>

<p>This came as the relative strength index (RSI) failed to break a ceiling at the 61.00 level, earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 55.43, and seems to be heading for a floor at the 53.00 mark.</p>
<p>Should it reach this point, there is a good chance that the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will be trading below $1,890.</p>

Grewal&#x2019;s reasoning comes from the Supreme Court of the United States&#x2019; (SCOTUS) decision thwarting President Biden&#x2019;s student loan forgiveness program using the so-called &#x201C;major questions doctrine.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Coinbase CLO Blasts SEC&#x2019;s &#x2018;Investment Contract&#x2019; Interpretation</h2>&#13;
<p>Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, has railed against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x2019;s (SEC) position regarding classifying some cryptocurrency assets as securities. According to Grewal, the SEC&#x2019;s assessment of what constitutes an investment contract is wrong and transgresses current regulations.</p>&#13;
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1676128236680495106?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The SEC&#x2019;s interpretation of &#x2018;investment contract&#x2019; violates the law.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Furthermore, Grewal affirms that the SEC&#x2019;s actions go beyond violating thew law, given that it claims it has the authority to enforce rules for all cryptocurrency assets classified as securities. He explained:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The &#x2018;economic and political significance&#x2019; of falsely claiming authority over all digital assets other than <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> is not just &#x2018;staggering,&#x2019; but untethered to the fundamental requirement that there be enforceable rights between enterprise and purchaser.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Grewal&#x2019;s reasoning comes from his examination of the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) ruling in the Biden v. Nebraska <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/22-506_nmip.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a>, where the court struck down the Biden administration&#x2019;s $430 billion student loan forgiveness program.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>The Major Questions Doctrine</h2>&#13;
<p>Grewal believes the reasoning for applying the major questions doctrine in the Biden v. Nebraska case can be used in Coinbase&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">case</a>, where the exchange is battling the SEC, being accused of unregistered brokerage and securities violations.</p>&#13;
<p>According to Harvard Law School professor Noah Feldman, the major questions doctrine <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/30/supreme-court-student-loan-ruling-shows-new-judicial-activism/935a32e6-1765-11ee-9de3-ba1fa29e9bec_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">idea</a> is that &#x201C;if the executive branch does something the court considers really big and really new, then the court will look to see if Congress really authorized it. Absent clear congressional authority, the court will strike it down.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>Coinbase <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-alleges-sec-lacks-any-powers-to-regulate-digital-asset-exchanges-in-recent-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the major questions doctrine in its recent filing against the SEC&#x2019;s complaint, arguing that the SEC&#x2019;s new interpretation of the securities law would have to be rejected because Congress would have to regulate the issue first to establish standards regarding digital assets.</p>&#13;
<p>Grewal added to this idea, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1676129462008655877?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explaining</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Congress isn&#x2019;t just capable of fixing standards by theoretically passing legislation in the future, it&#x2019;s actively working to do that right now. This isn&#x2019;t even a close call.</p>&#13;

It is one of the first debt Security Tokens aimed at retail investors who wish to invest alongside institutional investors in the most sought-after real estate developments in the United States. The Tokens will have a 5-year life, earn an annualized cash yield of 10%, and a 5-year IRR of 150%. RMCG has aligned with diversified developers like </span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Donahue_Peebles"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donahue Peebles</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the largest minority real estate developer in the United States, and </span><a href="https://www.rpcholdings.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Royal Palm Companies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, one of Florida&#8217;s premier real estate development firms, to invest the net proceeds of the FraXion Security Token Offering (STO).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Demetrius Ford, RMCG’s Managing Director of Digital Assets, stated that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is a very exciting time for RMCG and FraXion, but an even more exciting time for retail real estate investors who have traditionally been locked out of institutional-grade real estate investment opportunities due to high minimum investments and other barriers to entry. FraXion is all about access. By pooling the investment capital of many, we can invest substantial sums as one, which grants our investors entry into the institutional world.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FraXion has already sold 250,000 tokens within the first weeks of the STO, and the company has also secured a funding round of $250,000 from Park Place Consultants to assist with the marketing and promotion of the FraXion Token. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are excited for the launch of the Fraxion Token and the opportunity it brings to the marketplace; a new way of Real Estate Investing. We are humbled and honored to be part of such an extraordinary team at Randolph &amp; Main, and these are the types of projects we look to support.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">” said Rashidah &#8220;Roz&#8221; Billups, Principal at Park Place Consultants.</span></p>
<p><b>Tokenization of Real Estate</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FraXion Token is a game changer in the Fintech space. Tokenization of high-quality real estate, coupled with the cutting-edge technology of the blockchain, is attractive to investors that usually shy away from the crypto market. FraXion is a cutting-edge platform for investors to build generational wealth in Real Estate using Blockchain. FraXion creates “Digital Asset Partners” and allows token holders to invest in prime income-producing properties as well as land suitable for immediate commercial development through strategic alliances and partnerships with some of the most successful real estate developers in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The FraXion Ecosystem provides fractionalization, liquidity and access to global investors. The FraXion Token is an application blockchain asset that is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Ownership of a blockchain asset is established by recording on the blockchain ledger the owner’s unique identifier address and the amount of the asset held by such an address.</span></p>
<p><b>More About FraXion</b></p>

According to the Namibian Finance Minister, safeguarding the interests of consumers and combating market abuse are some of the reasons why parliament has taken this step.</strong></p>
<h2>Mitigating Money Laundering Risks</h2>
<p>The Namibian parliament is reported to have passed a bill aiming to legalize cryptocurrencies and establish a framework for regulating these types of assets. According to the country’s Finance Minister, Iipumbu Shiimi, the law is expected to help authorities safeguard the interests of consumers and to combat market abuse.</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://namibian.com.na/parliament-approves-law-to-regulate-cryptocurrency/">remarks</a> published by The Namibian, Shiimi also suggested that the law will enable authorities to deal with money laundering risks associated with digital assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;The aim of the legislation was to create a regulatory framework to protect consumers, and the risk of money laundering is mitigated,&#8221; the Minister reportedly said.</p>
<p>The legislative body’s move to regulate digital assets seemingly contradicts the Bank of Namibia (BON)’s which declared in the second half of 2022 that cryptocurrencies had no legal tender status in the country. The Namibian central bank however <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/namibian-central-bank-virtual-assets-remain-without-legal-tender-status-but-merchants-can-still-accept-them-as-payment/">said</a> it would not stand in the way of merchants and traders who accepted crypto assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Namibian parliament’s passage of the bill has been lauded as a step in the right direction. However, some Namibian experts like Jesaya Hano-Oshike warned the enactment of the law should not result in unnecessary obstacles.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation should not stifle innovation in the space, but rather encourage and foster innovation when it is done in the scope of the legislation,&#8221; Hano-Oshike.</p>
<p>Financial analyst Arney Tjaronda welcomed the passage of the bill but said authorities must not ignore digital assets’ likely impact on the country’s financial system.</p>

Crypto exchanges that fail to abide by the requirement will either be fined or closed down, Unathi Kamlana, the Financial Sector Conduct Authority commissioner, said. </strong></p>
<h2>The Importance of Regulation</h2>
<p>The South African financial services regulator, Financial Sector Conduct Authority (FSCA), has said cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country must secure operating licenses before the end of the year. According to Unathi Kamlana, the FSCA commissioner, entities that fail to abide by this requirement will either be fined or closed down.</p>
<p>The latest crypto-related comments by Kamlana just a few months after a fintech analyst with the South African Reserve Bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-regulations-governing-tokenized-deposits-and-crypto-assets-in-south-africa-set-to-effect-in-january-2025/">revealed</a> that regulations governing tokenized deposits and crypto assets will become effective on Jan. 1, 2025. However, the analyst warned that regulators will still need to learn and understand the risks that come with the technology which underpins digital assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his remarks during an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-04/south-africa-to-require-crypto-exchanges-licensing-by-year-end">interview</a>, Kamlana explained why the regulator has finally taken this step. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is potentially serious harm to financial customers when using crypto products, and therefore it makes sense for us to introduce the regulatory framework.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FSCA commissioner, however, acknowledged that the effectiveness of this and related measures will only be determined after a certain period of time. According to the Bloomberg report, the FSCA has already received 20 applications and more will be received before the Nov. 30 deadline.</p>
<p>In addition to seeking to regulate the crypto industry, Kamlana also revealed his organization’s involvement in efforts aimed at raising the public’s awareness of crypto products. He also offered his thoughts on why the public needs crypto education.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is an area where you can lose quite a bit of money, so you must think twice before exposing yourself to it,&#8221; Kamlana reportedly said.</p>

<h2>Iranian President Calls for De-Dollarization at SCO Summit</h2>
<p>Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi emphasized the need to de-dollarize in his remarks at the 23rd virtual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State on Tuesday. Iran became a new permanent member of the SCO at the summit, which was hosted by India and chaired by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p>
<p>The summit was also attended by China’s President Xi Jinping, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Kyrgyzstan’s President Sadyr Japarov, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon, and Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev.</p>
<p>During his address at the summit, the Iranian president underscored the importance of establishing a fairer world order in which the U.S. dollar is no longer the only dominant currency. “The Western hegemonic powers, by resorting to economic coercion and sanctions, have jeopardized the security and economic prosperity and the principles of fair trade in the world,” Raisi was quoted by the Tehran Times as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Relying on the experience of the past decades, it is now quite evident that, along with militarism, what forms the basis of the Western domination system has been the dominance of the dollar,” he continued, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>Therefore any attempt to shape a fair international system requires the removal of this instrument of dominance in intra-regional relations.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Expanding the use of national currencies in international trade and financial exchanges between the members of this organization and their business partners requires more serious attention,&#8221; the Iranian leader further stressed. &#8220;The Islamic Republic of Iran welcomes any move to introduce financial payment instruments based on modern technologies to facilitate financial exchanges between members and business partners, especially in multilateral frameworks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iran’s president additionally noted that the SCO member countries can build unity and peace by promoting civilization based on ethics, spirituality, justice, rationality, and respect for human dignity. He opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, which is a symbol of this ‘great family of civilizations,’ is now standing in a position that can establish new horizons of regional convergence and security-building cooperation.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Regarding respect for the sovereignty of nations: multilateralism in the contemporary world means joint efforts and synergy of independent countries to achieve common good. Such a perception of multilateralism is in conflict with security alliances to promote violence and hostility with other countries. Real multilateralism is for the benefit of the nations and not for the powers. In the light of respecting the sovereignty of countries and relying on mutually beneficial cooperation, the lofty goals of security and sustainable development can be realized,” Raisi further said.</p>
<p>At the summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin also pushed for the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/xi-jinping-vladimir-putin-push-for-increased-settlements-in-national-currencies/">use of national currencies</a> in trade settlements. According to Putin, more than 80 percent of commercial transactions between Russia and China are carried out in Russian rubles and Chinese yuan.</p>

<h2>Bolivia Calls for De-Dollarization at Mercosur Summit</h2>
<p>Bolivia’s President Luis Alberto Arce Catacora (Lucho Arce) called for de-dollarization and increased strategic alliances with international organizations, including the BRICS economic bloc at the 62nd Summit of Heads of State of Mercosur and Associated States in Puerto Iguazú, Argentina.</p>
<p>The Southern Common Market, also known as Mercosur, is a South American trade bloc whose full members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Venezuela joined as a full member in 2012 but was suspended indefinitely in late 2016. Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname are associate members of Mercosur, with Bolivia currently in the process of becoming a full member.</p>
<p>The summit was attended by Argentina&#8217;s President Alberto Fernández, Brazil&#8217;s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Uruguay&#8217;s President Luis Lacalle Pou, and Paraguay&#8217;s President Mario Abdo Benítez. Bolivia’s president and the president-elect of Paraguay, Santiago Peña, also attended.</p>
<p>The Bolivian president tweeted Tuesday at the conclusion of the meeting (translated by Google):</p>
<blockquote><p>Our region is seriously affected by the restrictions imposed by the northern financial system, which limits financing options, making it necessary to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar and diversify our economic relations.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We must seek strategic alliances with other international actors, such as China, in a Eurasian and Asian bloc that, organized within the BRICS and other integration mechanisms, are projected as spaces for the construction of a new world economic order,” he added. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Regarding Bolivia becoming a full member of Mercosur, President Arce stated: “We believe that Bolivia&#8217;s accession to Mercosur represents a unique opportunity to strengthen integration, expand trade and regional cooperation.” He emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are experiencing a crucial moment of transition towards a multipolar world that guarantees a balance of powers and respects the principle of non-interference.</p></blockquote>
<p>Commenting on Brazil taking over the rotational presidency of Mercosur on Tuesday, the Bolivian leader said: “We also convey our best wishes to the incoming Brazilian presidency. We are sure that under the leadership of President Lula, guided by his integrating vision, Mercosur will continue to advance to respond to the enormous challenges that our times present.”</p>
<p>Lula has expressed strong support for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-urges-developing-countries-to-abandon-dollar-as-global-reserve-currency/">abandoning the U.S. dollar</a> and adopting national currencies in trade settlements. He also supports the creation of a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazils-president-lula-voices-support-for-brics-currency/">common BRICS currency</a>. Last month, he announced his intention to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazil-to-push-de-dollarization-agenda-at-brics-meeting/">discuss</a> de-dollarization at the upcoming BRICS meeting.</p>

The financial regulator maintains that Saxo Bank&#x2019;s portfolio of crypto assets falls &#x201C;outside the legal business area of &#x200B;&#x200B;financial institutions&#x201D; and is in violation of the country&#x2019;s Financial Business Act.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Danish Financial Regulator Insists &#x2018;Unregulated Trading in Crypto-Assets Can Create Distrust in the Financial System&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Danish financial regulatory authority, tasked with overseeing financial markets in Denmark, has <a href="https://www.finanstilsynet.dk/Tilsyn/Tilsynsreaktioner/Paabud/2023/Saxo_bank_050723">directed</a> Saxo Bank to liquidate its crypto asset portfolio. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saxo-bank-founder-lars-christensen-is-waiting-for-a-cryptocurrency-panic-sell-off/">Saxo Bank</a>, an investment bank established in 1992, specializes in online trading and investment. In 2017, Saxo Bank incorporated crypto assets into its services, enabling trading of digital currencies like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" target="_blank">LTC</a>, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The bank also offers customers access to crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs), allowing investors to gain exposure to prominent cryptocurrencies. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) asserts that Saxo Bank, in addition to offering crypto services, maintains &#x201C;a portfolio of crypto assets, which are held as a hedge to offset the market risk associated with the bank&#x2019;s crypto asset products.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The DFSA maintains that trading in crypto assets is not listed in Annex 1 of the Financial Business Act. Moreover, the activity is deemed unacceptable as an ancillary bank business due to concerns regarding financial stability. The regulator believes that &#x201C;unregulated trading in crypto-assets can create distrust in the financial system.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Hence, the DFSA has now directed Saxo to &#x201C;dispose of its own holdings of crypto assets,&#x201D; citing that holding cryptocurrencies for the bank&#x2019;s own account exceeds the legal boundaries established for Danish financial institutions. Nevertheless, the DFSA does not specify a deadline or indicate in the press release the timeframe for Saxo&#x2019;s compliance with the recent ruling.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/05/denmarks-financial-watchdog-orders-saxo-bank-to-shed-its-crypto-holdings/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines">statement</a> provided to Coindesk, a Saxo spokesperson expressed that the financial institution will &#x201C;naturally take the decision of the Financial Supervisory Authority into account and will read it thoroughly to consider how we otherwise respond to it.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
