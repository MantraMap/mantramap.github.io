<p>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chairman Gary Gensler could be facing unemployment after Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) and Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) introduced a bill to remove the SEC boss from power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tyrannical-chairman"><strong>“Tyrannical Chairman”</strong></h2>



<p>In a June 12 <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1668305460368121857">tweet</a>, crypto-friendly congressman Warren Davidson announced that he had filed the “SEC Stabilization Act” in the House of Representatives.</p>



<p>“U.S. capital markets must be protected from a tyrannical Chairman, including the current one. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m introducing legislation to fix the ongoing abuse of power and ensure protection that is in the best interest of the market for years to come,” Davidson said in the Twitter statement. “It&#8217;s time for real reform and to fire Gary Gensler as Chair of the SEC,” he concluded.</p>



<p>Rep. Davidson, the vice chairman of the Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-congressman-mulls-pushing-legislation-to-remove-secs-gary-gensler/">initially announced</a> his intention to have Gensler fired from his role in April. At the time, he said he would be introducing legislation to “correct a long series of abuses” by firing the Chairman of the SEC and replacing the role with “an Executive Director that reports to the Board (where authority resides)”.</p>



<p>House Majority Whip and Minnesota Republican Tom Emmer, who co-authored the bill, <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/press-releases?id=F9BD4F5B-0C81-4DE5-8F65-E78B064CB060">posited </a>that “the SEC Stabilization Act will make common-sense changes to ensure that the SEC’s priorities are with the investors they are charged to protect and not the whims of its reckless Chair.&#8221;</p>



<p>While they will need bi-partisan support to pass the Senate, if the bill were to succeed, Gensler would no longer be able to serve in a leadership capacity at the top American financial watchdog. It would also overhaul the agency to redeploy power from the chairman to other commissioners and a single political party would not be able to hold more than three commissioner seats at a given time. According to Fox News, the bill would also add a sixth commissioner to the agency and create an executive director position. The SEC’s board of commissioners currently has five members.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC, Gensler Under Fire</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC and its chair Gary Gensler have drawn criticism from the cryptosphere — recently and in years prior — for not having clear-cut nor innovative regulations and for insinuating in different interviews that they truly want to destroy the crypto industry. Gensler has made it clear that he <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-indirectly-declares-ether-is-a-security/">believes </a>all crypto assets — apart from bitcoin — should be classified as securities, and therefore, most cryptocurrency-focused companies and trading should fall under the SEC’s purview and comply with regulatory frameworks that are already being used for other securities.</p>



<p>Back in February, Rep.Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1625215670731390976">slammed </a>the SEC’s regulation-by-enforcement technique when it fined Kraken $30 million and forced the exchange to close its staking program in the U.S permanently.</p>



<p>The SEC said last week it was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">suing </a>Binance, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company for Binance.US on allegations of breaking federal securities laws. A day later, it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">levied similar charges</a> against rival exchange Coinbase (COIN).</p>



<p>While the SEC hits the crypto industry with a wave of enforcement actions, the European Union has been working hard to usher in a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-holds-steady-as-eus-mica-regulation-gets-another-green-light/">new set of rules for the nascent sector</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset lawyers say the judgment in the SEC and Ripple case could have substantial implications for the sector going forward.</li>



<li>Despite initial anger following the lawsuit against Binance and Coinbase, crypto executives now see it as a platform to get clear regulations.</li>



<li>The digital asset community follows the cases keenly, backing both exchanges and criticising Gensler and the SEC.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The case between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v Ripple (XRP), filed in Dec 2020, is now more thrilling in its late stages as a potentially favourable ruling could spark off countless wins for the industry.</p>



<p>Web3 lawyers have expressed a close relationship between the Ripple case and the recent Binance-Coinbase lawsuit by the SEC. A ruling by the trial judge on whether XRP constitutes securities in the secondary market could set the tone for further decisions.</p>



<p>James Murphy, a crypto lawyer in a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/metalawman/status/1666864200147251201?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">tweets</a>, noted that a win for Ripple could “<em>undermine the entire basis for the SEC’s case” </em>against both exchanges it sued for allegedly offering trading services on unregistered securities. However, he stated that while it is only a convincing and persuasive precedent, it is not legally binding.</p>



<p>This means that the courts in Coinbase and Binance cases “<em>not be bound to rule the same way” </em>because only the Supreme Court of Appeal can determine binding precedents. Murphy, however, believes that the court will follow the Ripple matter closely as they serve in the same court in lower Manhattan.</p>



<p>Similarly, Bill Morgan, a partner at Morgan Mac Lawyers, explained that the judgment would be a game changer for the industry and the SEC, depending on where the pendulum swings.</p>



<p>“<em>If they lose badly in the Ripple case, they go forwards with Coinbase and Binance with a substantial judgment against them. Obviously, Coinbase and Binance will use that to their advantage that the sales of XRP are not an investment contract,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-others-allege-a-political-undertone"><strong>Others allege a political undertone</strong></h2>



<p>Since Gary Gensler and the SEC launched its renewed offensive on the digital asset market, crypto users and industry players have accused the Commission of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripples-lawyer-on-why-secs-gensler-must-recuse-himself-from-voting-on-enforcement-cases/">bias</a> toward certain assets and markets. Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton feels the case between XRP and both exchanges are related, leading to the Commission’s decision to file the cases at this time.</p>



<p>“<em>I believe the SEC wanted to get those cases filed before that decision just in case it is a bad result for the SEC, possibly causing it to lose some political and legal momentum,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deaton further asserted that the Commission would tone down its aggression on cryptocurrency firms when big financial institutions acquire more shares in digital assets.</p>



<p>“<em>Once JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, or other traditional players get a bigger slice of the crypto market, then the SEC will become more reasonable,” </em>he added.</p>

<ul>
<li>Nigeria has passed a new 10% tax code on digital assets amid mixed signals from its regulatory agencies.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Over the weekend, the nation issued a directive declaring the operation of Binance in the country as “illegal” for its failure to register with local regulators.</li>



<li>Finance experts feel the ban on Binance Nigeria is in line with its tax policy which places a huge focus on registration and compliance.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The country’s 2023 budget is riddled with an 11 trillion naira budget deficit and 6 trillion naira debt service cost, so it is looking for new avenues to fund its budget, observers say.</p>



<p>Nigeria has placed a 10% tax on digital asset profits in the latest Nations Finance Act 2022 amendment. The tax will include profits earned on trade, staking, or other cryptocurrency investments. According to the Capital Gains Tax Act, the word digital assets were infused into asset classes for purposes of taxation. </p>



<p>“<em>Subject to any exceptions provided by this Act, all forms of property shall be assets for the purposes of this Act, whether situated in Nigeria or not, including options, debts, digital assets, and incorporeal property generally,” </em>the Act reads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The announcement of the new policy came with lots of backlash from the Finance markets, with many wondering how the government intends to tax a sector that it has described as “<em>illegal.” </em>Over the weekend, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that the operations of Binance Nigeria Limited, the local branch of Binance in the country, are illegal and not in line with the laws. </p>



<p>The Commission also urged investors to be wary of the company and warned the exchange to desist from soliciting investment from the country.</p>



<p>“<em>Binance Nigeria Limited is hereby directed to immediately stop soliciting Nigerian investors in any form whatsoever,&#8221; the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said in a statement dated June 9. It said the company was not registered or regulated, making it illegal.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-silver-lining-amid-chaos"><strong>A silver lining amid chaos</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the looks of things, observers have tipped a turnaround in the country’s dealings with digital assets. The Central Bank of Nigeria <a href="https://zycrypto.com/china-2-0-nigeria-intensifies-major-cryptocurrency-crackdown-after-cbdc-launch/">banned</a> cryptocurrency trading in 2021 with harsh words against the sector while floating its “<em>failing” e-naira, </em>creating panic for users. </p>



<p>That period looks over as the new President, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in his manifesto, recognized digital assets and created a path for them in the nation’s economy. Experts suggest that digital assets have received legitimacy with this new tax code because the government cannot tax what is illegal while infusing it as an asset class. </p>



<p>According to many, the ban on Binance, though harsh, is in line with the 10% tax policy forcing all exchanges to register with authorities for a regulated market. Nigeria has a pro-crypto population, and with plunging revenues, the government is looking for other revenue streams. </p>



<p>In 2022, Nigeria ranked 11th according to the Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index amid tough regulatory policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a June 11, 2023 post, the private American venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (also known as a16z) announced that it is expanding to the UK and would open a crypto office in London later this year. The office will oversee the growth of the crypto ecosystem in the UK and Europe.</p>



<p>“That’s why I am thrilled world-leading investor Andreessen Horowitz has decided to open their first international office in the UK – which is a testament to our world-class universities and talent and our strong competitive business environment”, said UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak.</p>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz said the UK has highly sophisticated, world-class regulators, making it well-positioned to lead in web3. Andreessen Horowitz said it had also invested in several UK-based crypto companies like Arweave, Aztec, and Improbable.</p>



<p>According to Andreessen Horowitz, UK policymakers and regulators are taking an inclusive approach to blockchain and digital asset regulation that includes working constructively with the industry to identify the unique attributes of blockchain technology.</p>



<p>The UK policymakers and regulators&#8217; approach also includes laying the foundation for future applications of blockchain technology and ensuring adequate consumer protection in any crypto regulation.</p>



<p>Andreessen Horowitz said that the UK is on the right path to becoming a leader in crypto regulation due to its deep pools of talent, world-leading academic institutions, and strong entrepreneurial culture.</p>



<p>Some U.S.-based companies are expanding overseas amidst requests from crypto companies for more regulatory clarity. There is also concern amongst crypto enthusiasts that the U.S. could lose the crypto leadership role to Europe, where parliament has already passed the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation.</p>



<p>In May 2023, Coinbase opened the Coinbase International Exchange in Bermuda. The expansion will enable institutional users based in eligible jurisdictions outside the U.S. to trade perpetual futures.</p>



<p>In a May 2023 blog, Team Gemini announced that it had set up its European Headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. Gemini also announced that it would begin applying for a crypto license to serve customers based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to make Gemini a global company.</p>



<p>Again in May 2023, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-acquires-crypto-custody-provider-metaco-for-250m-as-xrp-lawsuit-nears-end-game/">Ripple announced a $250 million acquisition of Metaco</a>, a Swiss-based provider of digital asset custody and tokenization technology, increasing its presence overseas.</p>



<p>There is also concern amongst crypto enthusiasts that the U.S. could lose the crypto leadership role to Europe, where parliament has already passed the Market in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. Andreessen Horowitz emphasized that it remains committed to working with U.S. policymakers and regulators for more crypto regulatory clarity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img width="1200" height="700" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Coinbase-Lays-Off-1100-People-In-Preparation-For-Prolonged-Bear-Market.jpg" class="attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Coinbase Lays Off 1,100 People In Preparation For Prolonged Bear Market" decoding="async" loading="lazy" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Coinbase-Lays-Off-1100-People-In-Preparation-For-Prolonged-Bear-Market.jpg 1200w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Coinbase-Lays-Off-1100-People-In-Preparation-For-Prolonged-Bear-Market-300x175.jpg 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Coinbase-Lays-Off-1100-People-In-Preparation-For-Prolonged-Bear-Market-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Coinbase-Lays-Off-1100-People-In-Preparation-For-Prolonged-Bear-Market-768x448.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;" class="sharethis-inline-share-buttons" ></div>
<p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has unveiled a &#8220;Stand with Crypto&#8221; commemorative non-fungible token (NFT) in a show of solidarity with the crypto community following the latest onslaught by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on crypto.</p>



<p>Described as a unifying emblem for those who believe in the future of crypto on its official website, this symbolic artwork aims to rally support and advocate for sensible policies surrounding cryptocurrency. The NFT features a striking blue shield, representing the collective determination to protect and promote the potential of digital currencies.</p>



<p>In addition to displaying support for the cause, the NFT will allow holders to actively engage with the community&#8217;s efforts and take various actions to advance the advocacy for crypto further. Over 135,531 NFTs were already minted at press time on the Zora NFT marketplace.</p>



<p>This unveiling follows closely on the heels of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing a lawsuit against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase</a> on Tuesday, just a day after a similar suit was filed against Binance.</p>



<p>In particular, the SEC argued that Coinbase&#8217;s platform operated three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets-those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies, yet<em> “Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.”</em></p>



<p>Armstrong responded to the lawsuit by expressing his pride in representing the industry in court and seeking clarity on crypto rules. In a tweet, Armstrong criticized the SEC&#8217;s enforcement-based approach, stating that it was harming America and the industry, highlighting that the SEC had previously reviewed Coinbase&#8217;s business and allowed it to become a public company in 2021. </p>



<p>Armstrong further noted that introducing new legislation by the US Congress and the global move towards establishing clear rules demonstrated the need for regulatory clarity. He affirmed Coinbase&#8217;s confidence in their adherence to the facts and the law expressing his belief that America would ultimately find the right path forward.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Coinbase is publicly pushing back against the SEC. Earlier this year, the exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1630592674020335617">launched</a> a grassroots campaign dubbed “Crypto 435” aimed at advocating for pro-crypto-policy in all 435 Congressional Districts across the U.S. Through the initiative, the exchange noted that it <em>“will empower the Crypto435 community with information about how to contact specific politicians in their local districts, what those politician&#8217;s records on crypto are, tips for making your voices heard in D.C., and more.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, as the legal battle between the SEC and Coinbase takes a new twist, it remains to be seen whether the crypto community can stay resilient and determined to safeguard the future of cryptocurrencies in this challenging time.</p>

<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">Ripple</a> has entered a partnership with Canada&#8217;s largest university by enrollment, the University of Toronto. The partnership is a part of Ripple’s University Blockchain Research Initiative (UBRI), a program that supports a diverse portfolio of blockchain research, technical development, and innovation at universities around the world.</p>



<p>The university plans to start work on an independent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/colombian-government-launches-national-land-registry-on-xrp-ledger-for-over-50-million-people/">XRP Ledger</a> Validator. UBRI has been driving significant blockchain and crypto technology research in Canada, which is an addition to the number of benefiting tertiary institutions in the country.</p>



<p>The program will allow university students to acquire and improve skills that will make them relevant in the fast-growing crypto industry.</p>



<p>In the last five years, Ripple has invested over $2 million in UBRI for top universities and colleges in Canada to foster knowledge acquisition in crypto and blockchain technology in the country. This is just a part of a total of $47 million the company has disbursed to universities worldwide, and the budget is increasing to $80 million for 2023.</p>



<p>Despite the ongoing case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Ripple is working towards developing the crypto industry. This is a giant stride towards ensuring its impact is felt.</p>



<p>It is hardly surprising that the partnership is with Canada’s top university since the US has been hard on crypto and has intensified efforts this year by cracking down on crypto companies. UBRI has been chiefly active outside of the U.S. because of this, as other countries remain more crypto-friendly.</p>



<p><em>“As more crypto projects and companies look to build outside of the U.S., creating evergreen educational opportunities and growing a pipeline of talent is critical to our industry’s long-term success.” </em>Ripple’s Senior Vice President  of Strategic Initiatives Eric van Miltenburg, stated.</p>



<p>Blockchain technology has many applications beyond crypto. With this program, Ripple is helping to raise the next generation of crypto and blockchain leaders who will help drive the industry’s growth in the future.</p>

<p>Holders of Cardano’s ADA, Polygon’s MATIC, and Solana’s SOL had a reason to smile on Monday as prices made a partial comeback— parring some losses incurred last week after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged they were crypto securities in high-profile lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sol-ada-matic-stage-partial-comeback"><strong>SOL, ADA, MATIC Stage Partial Comeback</strong></h2>



<p>Although the SEC went after the world’s two biggest exchanges earlier last week, it also chose to namecheck a couple of cryptocurrencies that it describes as unregistered securities, triggering a fall across most altcoins.</p>



<p>Three of them — Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC) toppled by around 29% each during the past seven-day span following the regulatory bombshells, according to CoinGecko data.</p>



<p>Yet, at press time, ADA rose 6.73%, SOL surged 1.1%, and MATIC was up 5.55% on the day as the wider crypto market remained mostly unchanged. The jury is still out on whether bulls will sustain the recovery in these tokens or whether higher prices will bring out the bears in big numbers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Securities Characterization Rebuffed</strong></h2>



<p>ADA was the first to have its regulatory status defended by its development company. ZyCrypto <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-devs-vigorously-dispute-secs-classification-of-ada-as-a-security-as-robinhood-mulls-delisting-coin/">reported</a> on June 8 that Input-Output Global disputed the SEC’s classification of its ADA token as an unregistered security, adding that the regulator’s allegations will not affect the firm’s operations “in any way”.</p>



<p>&#8220;The facts might be inconvenient to the SEC but are facts,&#8221; Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson further <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1668003846273085441">posited </a>today, pointing out that the initial financing and marketing for ADA was done in Japan and that no ADA tokens were sold in the U.S. Additionally, he said ADA debuted in 2017 as an airdrop two years after the vouchers sale, which was priced in Japanese Yen and Bitcoin.</p>



<p>On Saturday, the Switzerland-based Solana Foundation <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1667578529612017666">tweeted </a>its disagreement with the SEC’s framing of SOL as a security. Similar to IOG, the Solana Foundation emphasized its commitment to collaborating with regulators in the statement, noting “regulatory clarity” is an issue that affects everyone in the crypto sector that’s “building” in the United States.</p>



<p>Hours after the non-profit dedicated to stewarding SOL rebuffed the SEC’s securities claim, Polygon Labs <a href="https://twitter.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1667643925232852996">took to Twitter</a> to address for the first time the SEC’s classification of its native token MATIC as a security without directly addressing the regulator. The company attempted to distance MATIC from U.S. markets by saying the token was developed and deployed outside the US. Polygon Labs then said MATIC was &#8220;available to a wide group of persons” while drawing attention to the “global community that supports the network” to this day. Commenting on MATIC’s utility, Polygon Labs said the coin was helpful in securing the Polygon network from Day 1.</p>



<p>Since the SEC’s enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase, some major retail trading avenues, such as Robinhood, have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/robinhood-ceases-support-for-cardano-solana-and-polygon-after-sec-calls-them-securities/">cut support for ADA, SOL, and MATIC </a>in response to the regulatory filings.</p>



<p>Other companies could soon follow suit, but in the meantime, each respective development foundation tied to the trio of coins is pushing to clear its token’s name.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the cryptocurrency initiatives that has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/3-catalysts-renewing-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-price-as-meme-coins-see-sudden-resurgence/">captivated investors&#8217; interest</a> and enthusiasm the most. The introduction of Rocket Pond, the creation of the SHIB Metaverse, and the impending mainnet release of Shibarium are just a few of the significant changes that the Shiba Inu community is anxiously anticipating as the project gathers pace and speed.</p>



<p>The launch of Rocket Pond, one of the 11 SHIB Metaverse hubs, was one of the most eagerly awaited updates. According to Marcie Jastrow, a Shiba Metaverse advisor, the Rocket Pond will be presented very soon. SHIB owners and fans are extremely excited about this news and can&#8217;t wait for the launch of this new metaverse hub.</p>



<p>The Shiba Inu project has focused on the SHIB Metaverse, and the team has been working hard to assemble it. Jastrow recently alluded to the upcoming release of a video presentation of one of the metaverse centers. With this release, the community can anticipate seeing a glimpse of the immersive universe that Shiba Inu is creating.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shiba-inu-price-outlook-hangs-on-as-shib-network-activity-surges-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shibarium</a>, another ground-breaking invention, is also seeing rapid development. Puppynet, the Shibarium beta version recently released, shows continual upgrades and advancements. The developer team is working behind the scenes and improving the platform to offer the Shiba Inu community autonomous services and infrastructure.</p>



<p>These improvements mark significant turning points for the Shiba Inu project as it continues to gain popularity and draw an expanding user base. SHIB has lost two zeros since April, highlighting its remarkable price performance and market interest. This has sparked investor rumours and conversations about the likelihood that SHIB would soon achieve the coveted price of $0.001.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu lovers have expressed their enthusiasm and eagerness on various social media sites as they eagerly await these developments. There is palpable excitement for the next updates since SHIB holders think these achievements could significantly increase the value of their treasured coin.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the Shiba Inu initiative has strongly emphasised accessibility and inclusivity. According to reports, Rocket Pond and other metaverse hubs won&#8217;t be bought out by private investors. Once the metaverse is operational, it will instead be accessible to the general public and offer options for participation and community interaction.</p>



<p>The Shiba Inu community is on the verge of anticipation as the launch dates for Rocket Pond, the SHIB Metaverse, and the Shibarium mainnet approach. The planned updates are significant advancements for the project and can influence how the SHIB ecosystem develops in the future. Shiba Inu is already firmly entrenched as one of the most compelling projects in the cryptocurrency market, thanks to the enthusiasm and confidence that each milestone brings.</p>

<p>Through a June 9, 2023 press release, the Director of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Division of Enforcement, Ian McGinley, advised that on June 8, 2023, a U.S. District judge had entered a default judgement order in favour of the CFTC, for a civil monetary penalty of US$ 643,542 against the Ooki decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for operating an illegal trading platform.</p>



<p>CFTC charged the Ooki DAO for unlawfully acting as a futures commission merchant (FCM), offering leveraged and margin retail commodity transactions outside of a registered exchange, and for failure to comply with obligations applicable to FCMs. This federal civil enforcement action was filed in 2022.</p>



<p><em>“This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure, intending to insulate themselves from law enforcement and ultimately putting the public at risk”, said McGinley.</em></p>



<p>Generally, a DAO is a blockchain-governed organization with a common goal and heavily relies on transparent and verifiable rules or smart contracts that define how the organization works. The DAO has no central governing body, and management and decision-making are through member proposals which are automatically executed once a quorum of majority votes is attained.</p>



<p>The benefits of DAOs include decentralised decision-making, encouraging global participation, and offering public accountability. However, DAOs could result in slower decision-making from a lengthy voting process, less cohesion due to the wide diversity of members, and concerns such as security exploits.</p>



<p>The DAO was a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) launched on the Ethereum blockchain in 2016 after raising US$150 million worth of Ether through a token sale. However, a hacker spotted a vulnerability in the DAO’s code and Ether worth US$ 60 million was stolen. The stolen funds were eventually restored to the DAO investors.</p>



<p>In July 2017, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a report that cautioned market participants that offers and sales of digital assets by &#8220;virtual&#8221; organizations were subject to the requirements of federal securities laws.</p>



<p>The SEC report concluded that tokens offered and sold by the DAO were securities and therefore subject to the federal securities laws and also said that those participating in unregistered offerings may be liable for violations of the securities laws.</p>



<p>According to the June 8, 2023 default judgement, the court held that the Ooki DAO is a “person” under the Commodity Exchange Act and violated the law as charged by the CFTC.</p>



<p>The federal civil enforcement action was filed concurrently with the issuance of an administrative order against Ooki DAO’s predecessor LLC and its founders. The administrative order found that Ooki DAO’s predecessor founders were liable for any debts arising from Ooki DAO’s violations of the law.</p>

<ul>
<li>Coinbase CEO has responded to the SEC’s lawsuit against the company with great optimism, saying it is an opportunity to achieve clear-cut regulations finally.</li>



<li>He also criticized the regulatory conflicts between the SEC and the CFTC as both agencies struggle to categorize cryptocurrencies between commodities and securities.</li>



<li>Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer, called the SEC&#8217;s action disappointing ahead of his hearing at the US Congress. </li>
</ul>



<p>Adverse reactions have trailed the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) regulatory approach toward Coinbase as the commission and 11 states filed a complaint against the company.</p>



<p>In response to the SEC’s lawsuit against the company, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong took to Twitter to <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1666129111025324035?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">express</a> optimism about the development of the crypto industry so far. According to him, “<em>the team is very confident in our facts and law..” “This is a chance to finally get the needed clarity.”</em></p>



<p>He went further to explain to his followers that the company reviewed the business and allowed them to register as a public company and that was not done automatically but through a careful adherence to rules. Armstrong took the opportunity to swipe at the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s (CFTC) stance on digital assets.</p>



<p>“<em>The SEC and CFTC have made conflicting statements and don&#8217;t even agree on what is a security and what is a commodity.”</em></p>



<p>Brian Armstrong has been a strong critic of the inconsistent approach of regulators in the United States, calling for a new holistic approach to regulating the industry. He also warned that the current “<em>regulation by enforcement” </em>approach is detrimental to the growth of crypto firms in the country.</p>



<p>Coinbase&#8217;s legal team has previously filed a suit against the SEC for failing to provide rules regulating digital assets and mandating the Commission to offer clarity.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paul-grewal-mounts-pressure-on-sec"><strong>Paul Grewal mounts pressure on SEC</strong></h2>



<p>Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, has called on Congress to adopt the Digital Asset Market Structure Draft while his company faces a lawsuit by the SEC. Speaking on the lawsuit, he <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1665859409623359495?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">stated</a> that the SEC is “<em>disappointing, but not surprising,”</em> stressing the need to regulate effectively to catch up with other jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Grewal also noted that recent developments do not perturb Coinbase and will carry on business as usual despite 11 states slamming the company with a “<em>cease and desist” </em>order regarding its staking products.</p>



<p><em>“The solution is legislation that allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally, not litigation. Despite today&#8217;s complaint, we will continue to operate our business as usual,” </em>Grewal added.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-attorney-is-ready-to-go-to-bat-for-binance-coinbase-users-in-fight-against-sec/">lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance</a> sent the market tumbling this past week though slight positive signals have trickled in. </p>

<ul>
<li>Transaction fees on Ethereum dropped 69% from April as the meme coin frenzy slowed down.</li>



<li>Experts say the reduced gas fees could be a positive boost for the overall network strength, increasing actual network utility. </li>



<li>A cross-section of users bemoans the use of meme coins to clog networks which results in high gas fees to the detriment of the community. </li>
</ul>



<p>The Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) networks suffered several congestion levels in May occasioned by meme coins and BTC Ordinals, respectively.</p>



<p>Gas fees on Ethereum have plummeted sharply by 69% over the last 30 days as a result of declining meme coin trading volumes. Transaction fees reached a 12-month high, hitting 140 gwei per activity. One gwei is equal to one billionth of one ETH. </p>



<p>PEPE was central to the surge as gas fees spiked by 50% since the launch of the token. Other meme coins like Aped (APED) and Bobo Coin (BOBO) also added to the surge and became more significant when they dominated the top 10 gas-burning altcoins. According to Santiment, PEPE, APED, etc. joined the usual dominant altcoins ETH, Wrapped Ethereum (WETH), and USDT. </p>



<p>Presently, the median gas fees cost about $7, which is approximately 24 gwei according to Dune analytics. The sharp decline in gas fees follows the fall of PEPE, which is down 70% from its all-time high within 30 days. PEPE has also fallen 14% in the past 24 hours since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Binance for listing unregistered securities.</p>



<p>Experts have expressed optimism following the in transaction fees, adding that affordable fees lead to a stronger utility around a network. A cross-section of users is opposed to meme coins on their preferred network calling it “<em>anti utility” </em>and an easy way to lose one’s value. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-ordinals-put-bitcoin-down-the-same-path"><strong>BTC Ordinals put Bitcoin down the same path</strong></h2>



<p>With Bitcoin also receiving its fair share, May was the month of increased gas fees across networks. Last month, BTC Ordinals hit 10 million inscriptions, spiking transaction volumes on the network to new highs.</p>



<p>As a result, network fees surged up to $20 per transaction leading to mass complaints and a temporary <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoins-surging-transaction-fees-viewed-as-direct-attack-by-a-cross-section-of-the-community/">halt</a> of withdrawals by leading crypto exchange, Binance. At the time of Binance’s announcement, there were more than 420,000 transactions in the mempool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ordinals recorded about 2.5 million inscriptions across the week, during which the network suffered congestion, with some users calling it an “<em>attack” </em>on the network.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Metropolitan Museum of Arts is set to return all the funds it received from FTX after an agreement with debtors.</li>



<li>Over 180 United States politicians received funding from FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried, with only 19 fully returning the funds or showing keen interest in doing so.</li>



<li>In a related development, digital asset firms and influencers exercise “<em>double caution” </em>as their sieve through endorsement deals. </li>
</ul>



<p>According to court documents, a total of $93 million was handed out by FTX in donations between March 2020 and November 2022, creating a dilemma for recipients.</p>



<p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art has confirmed its intention to return donations received from FTX to its debtors. The New York-based museum stated in a filing to the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware that after discussions the agreement to return came in “good faith, arm’s length negotiations” with debtors.</p>



<p>“<em>The Met wishes to return the Donations to the FTX Debtors, and the FTX Debtors and the Met have engaged in good faith, arm’s length negotiations concerning the return of the Donations,” </em>the filing states.</p>



<p>The Met has received a total of $550,000 across two installments from FTX facilitated by West Realm Shires Services, the firm behind the daily operations of FTX. The first payment ($300,000) was received in March 2022 while the second ($250,000) came two months later in May.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its collapse in November, the management of FTX has been tasked with getting back funds that were donated by Sam Bankman-Fried while it was a going concern. In the United States alone, about 180 politicians have been linked to receiving funds from FTX while only 19 have either returned or shown keen interest to do so as debtors remain stranded.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-returns-keep-flowing-in">Returns keep flowing in</h2>



<p>Court documents show that FTX handed out $93 million in <a href="https://zycrypto.com/give-it-back-ftx-debtors-demand-return-of-93-million-donations-from-us-politicians/">donations</a> to several agencies and individuals. The biggest beneficiary remains the “Protect our Future PAC”, which received $27 million, according to reports from Market Watch. </p>



<p>Since the fall of the exchange, politicians and organizations have continued returning funds to debtors. The Alignment Research Center has said that it will return the $1.25 million received from the company stating that the funds “<em>money morally belongs to FTX customers or creditors” and was a “particularly straightforward decision.”</em></p>



<p>The University of Toronto has set plans in motion to return $500,000 it received from FTX. Similarly, ProPublica would also return the $1.6 million it received. So far, new CEO John Ray has recovered about $6.2 billion in assets.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>As the SEC continues its onslaught on the sector, Proof-of-Work assets appear to be exempted, leaving Proof-of-Stake counterparts at the mercy of regulators.</li>



<li>Experts cite the centralization of assets and staking as factors in determining which assets get the stick from regulators.</li>



<li>Proof-of-Work may be safe from the financial market regulators, but climate concerns remain a hurdle.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has intensified its efforts in regulating digital assets in what many have described as a “<em>lopsided process</em>” against several assets.</p>



<p>On June 5, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">filed</a> charges against Binance and Coinbase for allegedly offering trading services to unregistered securities, improper registration on the part of Binance US and Coinbase staking services. The big question on the minds of observers has been, “<em>How did the SEC determine which assets are securities?”</em></p>



<p>The SEC and other United States regulators have failed to conclusively answer that question leading to a lack of clarity and uncertainty in regulatory policies. Following the lawsuits, some analysts have shared their views on what they believe to be the Commission’s logic.</p>



<p>Steven Lubka, the Managing Director of Swan Bitcoin, opines that Proof-of-Work (PoW) assets are not flagged by regulators because a central body does not issue them.</p>



<p>“<em>I think PoW coins are largely avoided because there is no central issuer. Generally speaking, PoW is an open mechanism and lacks a central issuer, unlike PoS coins,” </em>he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To others, staking is integral to the decision as users lock up assets in anticipation of a reward given by a “<em>central body.” </em>Vineeth Bhuvanagiri, the Chief Executive of Emurgu, taking a swipe at Gary Gensler feels that the decision is based on the popularity of a coin. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-proof-of-work-dodges-bullet-but-is-still-within-range"><strong>Proof-of-Work dodges bullet but is still within range</strong></h2>



<p>From legal filings against Coinbase, the Commission focused on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets like Filecoin (FIL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), etc, excluding PoW networks. Gary Gensler has also stated in the past that Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency he can refer to as a commodity because of its structure.</p>



<p>Despite these, the PoW community should not feel too comfortable because the energy consumption of their favourite assets has been a concern for many governments. In 2021, China <a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-banning-cryptocurrencies-china-set-to-release-a-blockchain-national-standard-in-2022/">clamped</a> down on miners citing environmental concerns as cities fell below their climate quota.</p>



<p>According to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, electricity spent on mining Bitcoin globally is at similar levels to Argentina’s electricity usage. This has led to activists clamouring for policy changes that could affect these assets even more than financial regulators. Last month, the White House proposed a 30% tax on crypto mining, stressing their negative community impact.</p>

<p>A final judgement on the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-lawsuit-sec-has-a-3-chance-of-winning-says-lawyer-predicts-xrp-victory-surge-to-10-price/">SEC vs Ripple lawsuit</a> is unlikely to impact the industry due to SEC’s reliance on enforcement as the regulatory tool, legal experts have argued.</p>



<p>In a recent piece titled &#8220;Regulation by Enforcement in the Digital Asset Industry: A Lagging Response to Stale Facts”, Karen Ubell, Mitzi Chang, and Adam Bruce of the Goodwin law firm shed light on the ineffectiveness of regulation by enforcement in the digital asset industry. The experts particularly argued that the focus on enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had done little to clarify regulatory expectations concerning current facts and market practices.</p>



<p><em>“SEC’s enforcement approach with respect to the digital asset industry now resembles carpet-bombing efforts rather than strategic or targeted actions intended to signal principled policy positions, as was more typical of the SEC under its prior leadership,”</em> they said.</p>



<p>According to the experts, while enforcement actions are essential in sanctioning fraudulent actors and protecting investors, their utility as a means of conveying prospective regulatory expectations is limited.&nbsp;Moreover, they argued that enforcement actions and litigation are inherently backwards-looking, often addressing factual scenarios and market trends that are no longer prevalent in the industry.</p>



<p>They highlighted the ongoing SEC vs Ripple case as an example of the limited utility of enforcement in conveying regulatory expectations. In their view, the facts alleged by the SEC in the case align with early ICO boom characteristics. At the same time, the current market practices around protocol and digital asset launches have evolved significantly. The legal experts thus argued that the outcome of the Ripple litigation would likely have limited implications for the blockchain and digital asset industry.</p>



<p><em>“The application of the laws implicated by protocol and digital asset launches-including the Securities Act of 1933 and its interpretation in&nbsp;Howey&nbsp;and its progeny-is always highly dependent on the facts and circumstances surrounding the offer and sale of the alleged security. Thus, while the outcome of the XRP litigation will undoubtedly be of significance for Ripple and XRP holders, the implications for modern launch plans and digital asset distribution models with materially different facts are likely to be limited,” </em>they added.</p>



<p>However, advising the SEC, the lawyers emphasized two primary tools for implementing mandates and regulating markets. The first is making rules and guidelines that look ahead and provide expectations for the future while the second tool is enforcement actions that apply existing rules and regulations through taking action against those who break the rules that already exist.</p>



<p>That said, with many viewing <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-attorney-is-ready-to-go-to-bat-for-binance-coinbase-users-in-fight-against-sec/">SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions</a> as disorderly and unclear in terms of policy signals, a court decision in the Ripple case could offer precise guidance regarding regulatory expectations for the digital asset industry.</p>
