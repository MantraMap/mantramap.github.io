										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/polygonhederatron-see-large-scale-adoption-from-countries-heres-how-they-are-being-utilized/">Polygon,</a> an Ethereum scaling solution, will hard fork its proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain to handle gas spikes and chain reorganization. The proposed hard fork is scheduled for January 17. It said in a <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/hardfork-incoming-upgrading-polygon-pos-chain-to-boost-performance">blog post</a> that it will modify its software to solve gas spikes and chain reorganizations (reorgs).<br /><br />The first phase of the hard fork will involve a change in how the blockchain calculates gas fees. Gas fees are a type of tax paid to a blockchain to transact on it. Polygon&#8217;s goal with the fork is to decrease gas price spikes that might occur when there is a lot of activity on the chain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although gas will still increase during peak demand, it will be more in line with the way Ethereum gas dynamics work now. The goal is to smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Polygon said that a reduction in gas fee spikes will be achieved by doubling the value of the “BaseFeeChangeDenominator,” which the company says will “help smooth out the increase or decrease rate of the baseFee for when the gas exceeds or falls below the target gas limits in a block.” The project believes the modification will be successful as it backtested such changes “against historical Polygon PoS mainnet data.”<br /><br />The second suggested portion of the hard fork will deal with reorgs, which can happen when a validator node—a computer that runs the blockchain—receives information that can temporarily generate a new version of the blockchain. Reorganizations might occur as a result of network faults or malicious activities. A reorg can result in lost or duplicate transactions for as long as it lasts.<br /><br />To address this issue, Polygon aims to minimize the time it takes to finish a block to validate a successful transaction, and the hard fork will cut Polygon&#8217;s &#8220;sprint length&#8221; from 64 to 16 blocks, implying that a block producer can create blocks for a considerably shorter period.<br /><br />Hard forks differ from soft forks in that they are not backward-compatible and will require all network node operators to update to the most recent software at a predetermined period. To prepare for the hard fork, all Polygon node operators will need to upgrade their nodes before the scheduled date. Holders of Polygon&#8217;s native token, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-matic-moves-near-1-bitpay-announces-support-for-polygon-making-it-available-for-merchants/">MATIC</a>, will not be affected and will not need to take any action. Decentralized apps, such as Web3 games, will be unaffected and will not need to take any action.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-miners-secure-1-09-billion-mining-revenue-in-january/">Bitcoin miners</a> were impacted in 2022. Several mining giants were knocked off by what appeared to be a year of adequate capital for expansion, high energy prices, increasing competition, and a bear market.<br /><br />After a slumber, Bitcoin miners have returned, with mining difficulty increased by more than 10%, from 34.09 trillion to 37.59 trillion, according to data provided by <a href="https://btc.com/stats/diff">BTC.com</a>.<br /><br />Following the news, f2pool, a major participant in the industry, <a href="https://twitter.com/f2pool_official/status/1614832488370798592">tweeted</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Bitcoin mining difficulty increased by 10.26%, to an ATH! In this 2-week cycle, If BTC can go up above $23,000, machines that are more efficient than 40W/T can be running with profits at the electricity of $0.08/kWh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The statistic that defines how difficult it is to mine a Bitcoin block comes during a bullish reversal in the market behavior of the digital asset.<br /><br />Bitcoin, which is currently trading at $21,175, has managed to recoup losses from the two-month-old collapse of Sam Bankman&#8217;s crypto Fried&#8217;s empire. The next difficulty modification is expected in two weeks, which could result in a tiny decrease of 0.02%, at least for the time being.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s mining hash rate achieved two new highs in only two weeks, although bankrupt miner Core Scientific turned off 9,000 ASICs in December.</p>
<p>This trend could indicate that hash is shifting from weak to powerful hands. Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate is now sitting around 271.86 EH/s.</p>
<p>In terms of mining pool distribution, Foundry USA has the largest share with 35.5%, followed by AntPool (20.9%), Binance Pool (12.3%), and f2pool (10.4%), among others.</p>

<li>The price of Ethereum (ETH) has increased by up to 22% weekly</li>
<li>The Total Value of the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract has just reached an ATH of 16,042,407 ETH</li>
<li>Ethereum on-chain data shows a significant increase in the number of Ether shark addresses</li>
</ul>
<p>In the past seven days, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has increased by up to 22%, propelled by an improving macroeconomic outlook and growing interest in Ethereum&#8217;s planned <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-devs-move-ahead-with-shanghai-upgrade-to-enable-withdrawals-bitcoin-still-weak-analyst-plan-b-says/">Shanghai upgrade.</a> ETH was marginally up in the last 24 hours at $1,545. The Total Value of the ETH 2.0 Deposit Contract has just reached an ATH of 16,042,407 ETH, according to Glassnode data. Now, all eyes are on Ethereum&#8217;s upcoming significant upgrade, known as the<em> &#8220;Shanghai hard fork,&#8221;</em> which is anticipated to occur in March and will enable users of the network to access ether (ETH) they had staked on the blockchain but have been unable to access for months. In December, it was decided to move forward with Shanghai. According to a statement by Messari research analyst Kunal Goel, the total quantity of ethereum staked might probably rise after Shanghai. Crypto trader Thomas Kralow claims that if the Shanghai upgrade is successful, it will pave the groundwork for proto-danksharding, also known as EIP-4844, which would make Ethereum more scalable through sharding, later this year. In the weeks leading up to its March hard fork, Ethereum on-chain data shows a significant increase in the number of Ether shark addresses.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels:$2,300 $2,000, $1,700<br />Support Levels: $1,500, $1,300, $1,000</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ethereum-eth-sees-another-bull-favoring-element-as-on-chain-analytics-indicate-increased-blockchain-activity/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> traded in an upside range throughout the week as both volatility and volume increased significantly. To sustain a string of higher lows and higher highs, ETH/USD must keep today&#8217;s daily candle above the $1,500 level of support while the recovery from $1,200 continues to move higher. If this is not done, downside price goals of $1,300 and $1,200 might be attempted.<br /><br />The bull market started when a daily close occurred above $1,300, while the $1,200 low was more of a bear trap than a negative reversal. If bears return to the market, the decline should be contained to the first downward support level at $1,300. Investors&#8217; attention will be on closing much above the $1,500 level today.</p>

<p>ETH/USD has broken above the $1,500 resistance line, which has since turned into short-term support, far above the 4-hour moving average (MA 50 &amp; MA 200). Given that the pair&#8217;s relative strength index indicator remains above its 80 overbought regions. Despite signs of an overbought market in the near term, most investors prefer to maintain a positive outlook for ETH.<br /><br />If selling pressure picks up again, the pair may try to reach, if not break, the $1,300 support level, while a higher break may see Ether smash the $2,000 psychological barrier and open the door for the $2,500 barrier. Overall, only a successful break of the target at $2,000 might sustain the present bullish sentiment among traders.</p>

</ul>
<p>In a weekend move,<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-blasts-past-mastercard-as-value-soars-to-20000/"> Bitcoin</a> increased over $21,000 on January 14, following hopes that inflation has peaked and the market has bottomed. The largest cryptocurrency rose by up to 7.5% to $21,299 before easing slightly. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $21,002. Since November 8, it hadn&#8217;t risen beyond $20,000, and Saturday marked the 11th day in a row of gains. Data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">CoinGecko</a> shows that the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency industry surpassed $1 trillion for the first time since early November. Using onchain data, Ki Young Ju, CEO of Cryptoquant, noted that someone purchased BTC futures worth almost $4 billion in market orders in the lead-up to the Bitcoin rally, and millions worth of short positions have been liquidated on all exchanges. Ki Young Ju also highlighted one important indicator: premium has returned, favoring Bitcoin bulls, indicating a positive shift in sentiment for Bitcoin in the US. <em>&#8220;Bitcoin market sentiment turned positive in the US.

<p>On the daily chart, the price rebound past the moving average (MA 200) denotes bullish pressure. As the No. 1 cryptocurrency fought to maintain its position above the support level of $20,000, which served as a barrier between the high of last November and mid-October, near-term selling activity also eased, thanks to an increase in positive actions and a decrease in negative momentum.<br /><br />Overall, after falling to $15,460, Bitcoin has recovered some of its losses. Buyers&#8217; emergence around the $17,500 handle may try to sustain the positive rebound because the loss produced a yearly low. The bullish Relative Strength Index, which indicates a continuation in the rising momentum, might hasten the rebound toward the $25,000 zone</p>

<p>The short-term oscillators currently indicate bulls are encouraging further increases in the pair over the $20,000 level. Bears may sell, though, if the price rises over the next horizontal resistance, which is $22,000. Initial upside friction may start near $25,000 if buyers are successful in extending the rebound toward this area.<br /><br />Otherwise, first support could come from the $20,000 level, with lower support at $18,500 if positive factors begin to fade. And should the downward trend continue, the price may aim for the $17,500 short-term moving average (MA 50 &amp; MA 200) zone. For bulls to outnumber bears on the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-bitcoin-tackles-barrier-at-17000-current-bear-market-ranks-second-largest-in-history-per-this-metric/">BTC/USD</a> pair, buyers must push the price over the $25,000 level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Shaktikanta Das, governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), advocated for a ban on cryptocurrencies at a recent conference, according to a Jan. 13 story from<a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/rbi-governor-shaktikanta-das-cryptocurrency-should-be-banned-similar-to-gambling-2321280-2023-01-13"> India Today.</a><br /><br />The central bank&#8217;s position on cryptocurrencies, according to Das, <em>&#8220;is very clear—it should be banned.&#8221;</em> He continued by claiming that cryptocurrencies  <em>&#8220;does not have any underlying value&#8221;</em> and that their value is based on<em> &#8220;make-believe&#8221;</em><br /><br /><em>&#8220;To put it bluntly, it is gambling,&#8221;</em> said Das, noting that gambling is prohibited in India. His remarks reaffirm a comparable analogy made by politician Sushil Kumar Modi of Bihar in April. Even though some Indian states permit betting and lotteries, the activity is mostly outlawed and there is a large-scale problem with illegal gambling there.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/indian-supreme-court-rules-rbi-crypto-ban-unconstitutional/">RBI</a>, which serves as India&#8217;s central bank and monetary authority, was also concerned that allowing bitcoin may weaken its position. He cautioned that cryptocurrency could result in India losing control over the money supply.<br /><br />He stated that the introduction of cryptocurrencies could result in dollarization, wherein foreign U.S. currency will replace the Indian rupee more and more.<br /><br />Indirectly referring to the recent collapse of FTX and the ensuing slump in the cryptocurrency market, he said that the RBI has previously warned of a crypto collapse. He said, <em>&#8220;If you see the developments, I think I don’t need to add anything more,&#8221;</em><br /><br />Since at least late 2021, Das and the RBI have indeed issued comparable cautions. In December of last year, Das made a personal appeal for a crypto prohibition.<br /><br />India has not yet expressly outlawed the usage of cryptocurrencies, despite numerous allegations to the contrary. Additionally, Das appears to be in favor of some blockchain applications, and India is working to regulate CBDCs.<br /><br />However, the nation will begin taxing capital gains from cryptocurrency trading at a relatively high rate of 30% in 2022 (along with a 1% transaction tax).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a recent announcement, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/hbar-price-analysis-will-hbar-make-a-comeback-in-2023-popular-avalanche-based-dex-launches-on-hedera/">Hedera</a> will start quarterly resets of the testnet on January 26, 2023, from 17:00 to 19:00 UTC, during which the testnet will be unavailable. Resetting the Hedera testnet regularly guarantees that old data is cleared out, spam is eliminated, and the system is kept up to date.</p>
<p>Attempts will be made by Hedera Core Engineering to make testnet resets as developer-friendly as feasible. Dates for testnet resets will be announced at least two weeks in advance through email to testnet users, the Hedera Network Status website, and the official Hedera developer Discord.</p>
<p>Owners of testnet mirror nodes will be given advance notice of the availability of their mirror nodes and instructions to configure them before the planned reset. This scheduled maintenance affects Hedera Testnet (v0.33.3), Individual Nodes, Hedera-Managed Mirror Node Testnet APIs (v0.71.0), and Hedera Testnet (v0.33.3).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash and Polygon To Undergo Hard Forks in 2023</h2>
<p>A hard fork upgrade of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/matic-price-analysis-polygon-shares-upcoming-expectations-for-2023-how-will-matic-price-react-going-forward/">Polygon</a>, Ethereum&#8217;s layer 2 scaling solution, is planned for 2023. A proposed hard fork to Polygon&#8217;s proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain has been made public.</p>
<p>The software change is scheduled to take place on January 17 if approved, and it will address gas price increases and chain rearrangements (reorgs). The Polygon community was initially made aware of the hard fork debate in December 2022.</p>
<p>The first modification in Polygon&#8217;s new split relates to how gas fees, a form of tax one must pay to a blockchain to conduct transactions, are set. Polygon hopes that the fork will reduce gas price increases that occur when there is a lot going on in the chain.</p>
<p>The second suggested improvement deals with reorgs, which can happen when one of the machines running the Polygon blockchain, a validator node, receives data that momentarily produces a new version of the blockchain.</p>
<p>Due to the necessity for nodes to reconcile which chain is the right one (also known as the &#8220;canonical&#8221; one), such an event makes it challenging to accurately verify whether a transaction has been accomplished.</p>
<p>Polygon seeks to shorten the time it takes to finalize a block and verify successful transactions to solve its issue of relatively frequent reorgs. The goal is to decrease Polygon&#8217;s &#8220;sprint length&#8221; from 64 to 16 blocks, allowing block producers to manufacture blocks in considerably less time (from 128 to 32 seconds).</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin Cash Hard fork</strong><br />The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bch-price-analysis-explosive-move-towards-1200-unique-eth-web3-compatible-sidechain-launches-on-bitcoin-cash/"> Bitcoin Cash</a> fork is anticipated to take place in May 2023. With plans for &#8220;CashTokens,&#8221; which, according to developers, would enable decentralized applications directly on Bitcoin Cash, the hard split is expected to increase the network&#8217;s security and anonymity.</p>
<p>Smaller transaction sizes, which speed up transaction times, and smart contracts functionality, which could enable the development of Bitcoin Cash-based applications that provide users with opportunities for crowdfunding, recurring payments, and derivatives trading, among other uses, are other proposed improvements that have already been locked in.</p>

<p>After U.S. markets closed, Bitcoin was up 6% in 24 hours, trading at about $19,982, as traditional markets recovered earlier losses to close higher. Per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>, the largest cryptocurrency has increased by over 18% during the last seven days.<br /><br />According to data from <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/">companiesmarketcap.com</a>, Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency, has eclipsed banking behemoth Mastercard in terms of market value.<br /><br />The flagship cryptocurrency is now worth $372 billion after reaching an intraday high of $20,000 on the Bitstamp platform. Before that, Bitcoin outperformed significant companies like Meta Platforms, Eli Lilly, and Chevron, with bulls finally on a winning streak after months of disappointing market action.<br /><br />The largest cryptocurrency is now closing in on Tesla, the leading e-car manufacturer. Tesla&#8217;s stock took a beating last year, with the firm losing the majority of its market capitalization and CEO Elon Musk became the first person in history to lose $200 billion.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/why-mana-exploded-by-70-bitcoin-reaches-20k-as-metaverse-tokens-sand-axs-magic-rally/">Bitcoin</a> has fallen more than 72% from its all-time high. In November 2021, the company&#8217;s market valuation topped $3 trillion. The market cap of a corporation is derived by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the stock price per share. In other words, it shows the overall value assigned to a company by investors depending on current market conditions. Bitcoin&#8217;s market capitalization is derived by multiplying the total number of coins (or tokens) by the current market price per unit.<br /><br />This statistic can change daily, as any shift in investor sentiment or changes in the stock price will have an immediate impact on the company&#8217;s overall market capitalization. Apple is currently the most valuable firm in the world, with a market worth of more than $2.1 trillion.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have recently underperformed <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/whats-in-store-for-cryptocurrencies-in-2023-here-are-five-market-predictions/">cryptocurrencies</a> with smaller market caps as sentiment has improved in the broader crypto markets due to encouraging macroeconomic data.</p>
<p>Decentraland&#8217;s (MANA) native token saw a rise on Friday as metaverse tokens saw their best performance since the year&#8217;s beginning.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, MANA was trading at $0.545, up 33% over the previous day. According to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinMarketcap, the token has increased by almost 70% in the past week as it started a winning streak in 2023.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Decentraland unveiled brand-new user features, which coincided with the price increase. According to a tweet from Decentraland, the upgrade adds new avatar and profile options.</p>
<p>The update does not alter the value proposition of the MANA token or directly boost the number of Decentraland users. Other significant metaverse tokens have experienced strong growth over the past week and 24 hours.</p>
<p>The Sandbox’s native SAND has increased by 18% over the past day and by 49% over the past week. The AXS token of play-to-earn juggernaut Axie Infinity has increased 38% over the previous week and 17% over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>MyNeighborAlice unexpectedly increased by 16% in just one hour. ALICE has increased by 19% during the previous day, while the token has increased by 37% over the past week. Magic (MAGIC) has increased by 26% over the previous day and by 45.03% over the past week.</p>
<p>Leading the surge among gaming tokens is <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/gala-aptos-immutable-x-flow-bitcoin-cash-ldo-aave-frax-share-are-top-gainers-as-bitcoin-reaches-19k/">GALA</a>, which has gained 26% over the past 24 hours and is still up more than 130% for the month. The performance of GALA is notable given its triple-digit gains.</p>
<p>The price increase of gaming and metaverse tokens, a high-risk sector that gained prominence during the final stages of the 2021 bull market, may portend a resurgence of risk in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2>BTC Reaches $20K</h2>
<p>Leaders in the market, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have only seen small advances of 6% and 2% over the past day.</p>
<p>BTC records the largest short liquidations since July 2021, according to on-chain data. The bitcoin price rose above the $19,000 level to reach $20,000 today and hit a two-month peak in the process. The latest surge came as traders continued to react to Wednesday’s U.S. inflation report.</p>
<p>At the time of publication, BTC was changing hands at $19,962, up 6% in the last 24 hours after reaching highs of $20,000. According to Coinglass data, Bitcoin liquidations in the previous 24 hours stand at $35.37 million.</p>

<ul>
<li>Tezos (XTZ) is up 3% in the last 24 hours at $0.90 and 19% since the past week</li>
<li>The subsidiary of the crypto exchange Binance says it&#8217;s giving away $750 worth of XTZ</li>
<li>Tezos is the blockchain network that hosts the digital token XTZ</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-will-tezos-make-a-comeback-in-2023-binance-us-announces-support-for-xtz-staking/">Tezos (XTZ)</a> is up 3% in the last 24 hours at $0.90 and 19% since the past week as the crypto market recovers. To celebrate the launch of Tezos staking on Binance US, the subsidiary of the crypto exchange Binance says it&#8217;s giving away $750 worth of XTZ. In late December, BinanceUS, a subsidiary of the Binance crypto exchange, announced that its customers will be able to stake Tezos (XTZ) and earn up to 7% APY at inception. Customers would be able to buy, sell, convert, or stake XTZ in minutes on Binance US, a major staking provider. Also, advanced trading is available on the XTZ/USD, XTZ/BUSD, and XTZ/BTC pairs. Tezos is the blockchain network that hosts the digital token XTZ. A blockchain-based governance mechanism used by Tezos prevents hard forks, or blockchain splits, by adopting and implementing protocol upgrades selected by voting proportional to users’ economic stake in Tezos. XTZ uses a proof-of-stake system rather than Bitcoin mining to validate blockchain transactions, which uses less energy.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $2.00, $1.50, $1.00<br />Support Levels: $0.70, $0.50, $0.30</p>
<h4>XTZ/USD Daily Chart: Ranging</h4>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xtz-price-analysis-trades-higher-amid-increasing-adoption-mayor-of-reno-proposes-nft-offering-on-tezos/">XTZ prices</a> are flirting towards $1.0 in the short term, following a ten-day upward trend. The relative strength index (RSI) has advanced north into the positive zone, while the price is attempting to flip the moving average (MA 50) to hold into the bullish zone. While flattening out, the moving average (MA 200) is preparing to function as resistance.<br /><br />If the price structure persists, the next critical milestone might be the moving average (MA 200), which is immediately beneath the $1.50 horizontal resistance. The $1.50 barrier, slightly higher, may prevent the bullish movements after reaching the moving average (MA 200). On the other hand, a drop below the horizontal support at $0.70, on the other hand, might send the bears lower than their recent low.</p>

<p>In the 4-hour time frame, the price has regained ground and is currently trading above the moving averages (MA 200 and MA 50). Depending on today&#8217;s close, we could see a continuation up or a move down. The price is at a crossroads between $0.90 and $1.00. A bounce off the zone should strive past $1.00, while a drop should aim for $0.80.<br /><br />Currently, the short-term oscillators do not indicate a bearish direction for the pair. The price is now oscillating ahead of the two moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200), flirting near the $1.00 round mark. The positively charged 4-hour relative strength indicator reflects the most recent increase in purchasing activity, but further price gains remain somewhat constrained.</p>

<p>According to a Jan. 12<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7"> release</a>, the Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Genesis and Gemini over their now-defunct Gemini Earn program.</p>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We allege that Genesis and Gemini offered unregistered securities to the public, bypassing disclosure requirements designed to protect investors. Today’s charges build on previous actions to make clear&#8230; that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, in November 2022, Genesis compelled a halt to Earn withdrawals, citing a lack of liquidity brought on by market circumstances at the time of FTX&#8217;s demise. According to the SEC, 340,000 Gemini Earn members&#8217; crypto assets, valued at $900 million, were held by Genesis Earn at the time withdrawals were halted. This topic has generated a lot of debate in recent months, and it was included in the SEC&#8217;s complaint today.<br /><br />However, the SEC also called attention to dubious actions taken by Gemini while the service was in use. Gemini reportedly received an agency fee as high as 4.29%, according to the regulator.<br /><br />Additionally, it claimed that because the Earn agreement did not specify how investor assets may be utilized, Gemini combined investor Earn monies with other funds and invested those funds at its discretion.<br /><br />Per federal securities regulations, it seems from the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit that the Gemini Earn agreements were not registered with the SEC. Additionally, it claims that Gemini and Genesis provided <em>&#8220;selective and inadequate disclosures&#8221;</em> and that the two businesses marketed Gemini Earn as an investment to the general public.<br /><br />The SEC wants to stop the two firms from breaking certain securities laws in the future. It also seeks the disgorgement or surrender of the two corporations&#8217; ill-gotten gains as well as the payment of interest and penalties on those gains. The amount that Genesis and Gemini may owe the SEC is not specified in today&#8217;s filing. Additionally, it doesn&#8217;t specify precisely which services, if any, the two businesses may be prohibited from providing.<br /><br />Users of Earn had been unable to withdraw their money for the past two months, and on Tuesday, the service was formally and permanently terminated. It&#8217;s uncertain whether the SEC&#8217;s measures will enable people to get their money back.</p>
