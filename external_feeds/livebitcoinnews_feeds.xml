										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has soared following the bank crisis that occurred earlier in the year, but many analysts – despite clear evidence that the world’s number one digital currency has risen exponentially – don’t think the asset is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/bitcoin-banks-crisis.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">moving in the right direction</a> or think it’s doing as well as so many of their peers believe.</p>
<h2>Some Don&#8217;t Think Bitcoin Is Doing That Well</h2>
<p>At the time of this article’s writing, the price of bitcoin is at about $28,000 per unit. This occurred after the world’s number one cryptocurrency lost more than 70 percent of its value. It was trading at a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit in November of 2021, though 12 short months later, it dropped into the mid-$16K range. 2022 was, arguably, the worst year on record for crypto.</p>
<p>However, now the currency is rising back up again, and this appears to be due, in part, to the banking <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">problems occurring in regions</a> like the U.S. and Europe. Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank have all crashed and burned over the past two months, and things are still very much up in the air regarding the world of centralized finance.</p>
<p>Thus, many have turned to bitcoin and similar assets to keep their portfolios “intact.” Who would have thought that such speculative and once volatile assets would now be the answers so many individuals are turning to?</p>
<p>Still, things allegedly aren’t happening as fast as some analysts think they should be. Ed Moya, a crypto analyst at the trading firm OANDA, said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there widespread interest in and growth coming into the space? Is it a lot of new money? It doesn’t really seem like that’s happening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conor Ryder – research analyst for Kaiko – also threw his two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It doesn’t mean that because there’s a big price move one way that this is a whole new wave of institutional money or anything like that. It’s more so a liquidity issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, bitcoin was introduced in whitepaper form in 2008 on Halloween. The asset was designed to be an answer, of sorts, to the financial crisis and Great Recession that were occurring that year, but things haven’t really taken off the way they were supposed to. Moya continued his statement with:</p>
<blockquote><p>You’re seeing some flows just go out of stablecoins into bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Molly White – a known crypto critic – was also quick to suggest that the banking issues haven’t led to as many people as originally anticipated jumping into the BTC space. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the spike was fear-driven, I would have expected it to have started during the SVB bank run.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Others Feel the Asset Is in a Great Spot</h2>
<p>Cory Klippsten – chief executive at Swan Bitcoin – disagrees, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>They’re believers that this will be the global reserve currency. This is the best moment for bitcoin marketing and bitcoin adoption in its history.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For bitcoin, 2023 has been a year of vast turnaround. A <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-heads-for-its-third-positive-month-in-a-row-after-fighting-off-us-banking-crisis-and-regulatory-crackdown/ar-AA19keX0" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report was issued</a> in late March showing that the world’s number one digital currency enjoyed three straight months of solid gains, and the asset doesn’t appear to be showing serious signs of slowing down.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Had a Great Year Thus Far</h2>
<p>This is a huge reversal of what was witnessed in 2022, obviously the worst year on record for crypto. The space wound up losing more than $2 trillion in valuation after assets like bitcoin lost 70 percent or more from their previous November 2021 all-time highs. During that period, bitcoin was trading at a whopping $68,000 per unit, though just 12 short months later, the currency dropped into the mid-$16K range. It was a sad sight to see.</p>
<p>But not long ago, the digital asset <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">enjoyed a nine-month high</a>, and March saw bitcoin extend its rally and price by more than 20 percent. This brings its overall jump since the beginning of the year to over 70 percent. This also marks the best quarter on record for bitcoin since early 2021, the beginning of a major bull run. Jeff Cantwell – an equity analyst at Wells Fargo – explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rally has continued in March even after recent bank closures. While the rebound has more than one underlying reason, our conversations with investors have centered on three: crypto as a &#8216;flight to safety&#8217; given banking turbulence; positioning (short covering); and a shift &#8216;at the margin&#8217; by investors to &#8216;risk on&#8217; as prospects of a Fed pivot have increased.</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears the banking crisis Cantwell is speaking of has done wonders for bitcoin. There’s so much distrust, suddenly, surrounding the world of standard finance that many have turned to more speculative (and riskier) assets like BTC as a means of keeping their financials safe. There’s no guarantee that the bank they work with is going to remain afloat, and thus bitcoin and various digital currencies suddenly seem like safer bets.</p>
<p>Callie Cox, an analyst at investment firm e-Toro, commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin still seems to be in a favorable light, but only if growth stays healthy as well. A recession could still pressure crypto prices considering it&#8217;s still such a retail-dominated asset, and high rates are still an obstacle… The banking news narrows the gap for a soft landing and increases the chance of seeing an extreme scenario in either direction.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Just Jump Back in Yet&#8230;</h2>
<p>She added:</p>
<blockquote><p>For now, it&#8217;s anybody&#8217;s guess how crypto weathers either extreme scenario – a recession or persistently high inflation. We&#8217;re seeing signs of some buying exhaustion, too – flows out of crypto exchange-traded products, bad reactions to good news. Crypto investors should still tread carefully. Bitcoin&#8217;s strong streak this year isn&#8217;t necessarily a green light to pile back in.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index claimed in a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/03/n31570327/2023-independent-reserve-cryptocurrency-index-shows-singaporeans-are-still-actively-investing-in-c" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">recent report that</a> the digital currency world, despite taking several hits in the trust department, is still enjoying active trading among people in Singapore, who appear to be as steady in their investing as ever.</p>
<h2>Singapore Still Loves Crypto</h2>
<p>Crypto interest in <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/singapore/" data-wpel-link="internal">Singapore</a> once stood beyond the 60 point mark, thus meaning digital currency was very popular within the nation and there were several individuals that trusted it and loved it as though it were on the same level as standard, fiat currency. Now, it appears that the mark has fallen to the 55 level. Thus, trust has dropped a little, but not enough to end the trading hype that’s clearly still occurring in the nation.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that about 44 percent of residents in Singapore – just shy of half the population – hold digital currency as part of their investment portfolios, while as many as 46 percent invest in crypto monthly. Lasanka Perera – chief executive officer of Independent Reserve Singapore – explained in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>2022 was a challenging time for the cryptocurrency industry due to several macroeconomic factors. The collapse of Terra-Luna and the FTX fallout has understandably led to a loss of confidence and trust in the industry. As recent global financial events continue to unfold, many may also re-evaluate their dependence on traditional financial institutions to safeguard their money and turn to alternative assets such as bitcoin to hedge against bank defaults and currency debasement. It is encouraging to see that optimism towards the long-term benefits of cryptocurrency remains strong in Singapore, and that investors who adopt a long-term view are reaping rewards… Singapore has one of the clearest and robust regulations for cryptocurrencies, which gives investors an added assurance of dealing with trusted players. As Singapore continues to remain open to innovation in digital assets, education remains crucial as awareness and adoption of cryptocurrencies among residents grow.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Awareness Is Going Up, Up, Up</h2>
<p>This year alone, the level of awareness surrounding crypto grew by more than one percent, suggesting that while most residents were previously obsessed with bitcoin, many have turned their attention to neighboring altcoins as a means of diversifying a bit more. Right now, people between the ages of 26 and 35 are the most aware of digital currency. Perera said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rising popularity of altcoins shows that more Singaporeans are beginning to gain more awareness about other cryptocurrencies apart from bitcoin. This is a promising sign for the industry as more investors gain exposure to various types of blockchains and projects that have innovative utility and potential to be adopted more widely for real-world applications and use cases.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite being a very bearish year, crypto adoption in Singapore rose three percent in 2022 from 40 to 43 percent.</p>

<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0895 level. The main support is near the $0.088 zone. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.0850 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.0820.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent poll, Colorado ranks <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/colorado-ranks-highly-for-interest-in-cryptocurrency-trading/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">amongst the highest states when</a> it comes to crypto activity.</p>
<h2>Colorado Ranks High When It Comes to Crypto Activity</h2>
<p>The study was conducted by Cryptobetting.org. The platform looked at all the crypto activity occurring within the 50 states of the American union, and as it turns out, Colorado placed eighth. The state is amongst the youngest regions of the country, and it’s also one <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/data/study-colorado-one-of-the-top-states-for-tech-workers/?ipid=promo-link-block1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">of the most tech-friendly</a> according to a separate poll.</p>
<p>All this makes sense in many ways given how the region has fallen victim to a wide array of digital currency scams in recent months. According to a statement by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), several residents have fallen victim to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fbi-report-shows-colorado-residents-getting-duped-by-crypto-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto scams in Colorado</a> centering around USDC, a prominent stable currency. The statement also provided advice for how to avoid falling victim to a scam. It read:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a common scenario, the victim is approached on a social media platform, dating app, or discussion forum with a cryptocurrency investment opportunity. The victim is directed to a link or phone number to set up the investment account. This is a scam. The link or phone number is controlled by the fraudster, who has set up a fictitious support site. Once the victim transfers the funds, the fraudster disappears with the money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, a lot of crypto activity is going to give rise to a few bad actors here and there, so it seems accurate that the digital currency trading occurring within Colorado has grown in recent weeks to earn it a place on this poll’s list. The study also suggests that for every 100,000 people in the state, approximately 1,710 crypto-related searches occurred online. The state presently ties in this department with regions like Virginia and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Despite Colorado’s high rank, it does not beat Nevada, which currently (as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/study-nevada-is-the-most-crypto-friendly-state/" data-wpel-link="internal">it did last year</a>) lists as the top state for digital currency friendliness. That state saw close to 2,000 crypto-related searches online for every 100K people, thus beating out the Centennial State by a hefty margin. Among the lowest activity states was Mississippi, which only saw about 686 searches for every 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>The top five top crypto states were Nevada as number one, followed by California, New York, New Jersey, and Washington in that order.</p>
<h2>New York Is Crypto Friendly?!</h2>
<p>The inclusion of New York in the top five is a surprise given just how non-friendly the region’s regulators have been over the past several years. Things got off to a negative start in 2015 when the state introduced the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitlicense/" data-wpel-link="internal">BitLicense</a>, a document that proved so rigid and expensive it caused many digital currency companies to exit the Empire State for good.</p>
<p>NY attorney general Leticia James has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/leticia-james-sues-coin-ex-alleging-crypto-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">also developed a habit</a> of going after several crypto firms in court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Gensler – the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/gensler-urges-congress-to-increase-funding-for-sec-to-investigate-cryptocurrency-issues/ar-AA19ferY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">asking Congress to grant</a> the agency even more funding so he and his fellow agents can continue their investigations into the crypto arena.</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler and the SEC Want More Money</h2>
<p>In a recent conference, Gensler described the crypto scene as the “Wild West” (how original – nobody’s <em>ever</em> used that term before) and asked that he be given the funds to hire more employees so that they can examine more digital currency firms, which he described as “rife” with non-compliance.</p>
<p>The conference occurred before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Gensler discussed the ongoing changes and rapid growth of certain markets, a big one being digital currency. He said there are more people participating in the space than ever before. This puts them all at risk given how many of the enterprises allegedly don’t follow present financial rules and securities laws.</p>
<p>Right now, according to the SEC head, the Division of Enforcement and Examinations makes up roughly half of the agency’s staff. As it stands, the Division garnered more than 35,000 separate tips, referrals, and complaints from whistleblowers in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>Gensler has no doubt this will get worse over time if the SEC is not permitted to do all it can in the coming months and weeks to prevent further bad actors from having a hand in the growing digital currency industry. He said the Division brought more than 750 unique actions against crypto companies last year, but that this was not enough to get everyone that needed to be investigated. Overall, these actions led to nearly $6.5 million in penalty fees.</p>
<p>When asked by Wisconsin Democrat Rep. Mark Pocan if the SEC has adequate research to investigate the present crypto issues making their way to the top of the SEC’s priorities list, Gensler answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re stretched thin, sir. This is a field that has [a] significant amount of non-compliance in it. We’ve increased our resources there, but we could always use more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The funding that Gensler is now suggesting would arrive as early as 2024 and permit the agency to fill another 170 separate positions. It would also grant full-year funding to all the people hired by the agency in 2023.</p>
<h2>Going After Every Company</h2>
<p>The SEC has developed a big goal to go after and persecute practically every single digital currency company in the last few weeks. For example, leading US digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">received a Wells notice</a> from the SEC, suggesting the company could face legal action relatively soon.</p>
<p>The agency has also gone after Kraken, another Northern California-based digital trading platform. The enterprise was forced to part <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">with a $30 million penalty</a> fee and end all its staking services and activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin bull and hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/mike-novogratz-challenges-steve-hanke-after-the-top-economist-bashes-bitcoin-as-a-fool-s-game/ar-AA19dE50" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gotten into a bit of a battle</a> with top economist Steve Hanke over bitcoin. The latter is against it, while the former is practically willing to bet everything he has on the asset.</p>
<h2>Mike Novogratz Comes to Bitcoin&#8217;s Aid</h2>
<p>In a recent tweet, Hanke took aim at bitcoin, calling it a “fool’s game.” He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset, not a currency. Unreliability, lack of stability, and susceptibility to fraud will continue to plague this cryptocurrency. Don&#8217;t be tricked; buying bitcoin is a fool&#8217;s game.</p></blockquote>
<p>In retaliation, Novogratz commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve, it has outperformed all assets [year to date] over two years and three years on a risk adjusted weighting (sharpe ratio). It&#8217;s been safer than JPM and Google. Run the numbers yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Novogratz has always been there to support bitcoin, even when nobody else is. He’s commented in the past that he thinks the price of BTC could potentially rise to $500,000 as we get closer to 2030, though frankly, if the asset simply <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/mike-novogratz-will-be-happy-if-btc-reaches-30k-at-the-end-of-the-year/" data-wpel-link="internal">reaches a price of about</a> $30,000 by the end of the year, he’ll be happy with that considering the terrible bear run it had during 2022 and how hard it’s been for the asset to pull itself out of the doldrums.</p>
<p>2022 was arguably the worst year on record for bitcoin. The token lost more than 70 percent of its value over the course of 12 short months. Initially, the asset was trading at a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit. This was in November of 2021. From there, it incurred a series of losses that ultimately brought it down into the mid-$16K range by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Now, however, the asset appears to be picking itself back up as at the time of writing, the currency is trading at $28,000. This is nowhere near where it was just a year and a half ago, but we’re certainly getting there.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of room for healing, but the fact that BTC has the initiative to be pushing itself the way it is seems to be giving a lot of fans and investors hope that perhaps the negativity of the previous year can finally be put behind them. That $28,000 price shows that the currency has managed to add roughly $12,000 to its value in just a few months.</p>
<h2>Some, Like the SEC, Don&#8217;t Think Assets Like BTC Are Reliable</h2>
<p>Sadly, while there are certainly people out there who would agree with Novogratz that bitcoin is something unique, there are other parties that will probably side with Hanke like the SEC. In a recent statement, the agency said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only money you should put at risk with any speculative investment is money you can afford to lose entirely.</p></blockquote>
