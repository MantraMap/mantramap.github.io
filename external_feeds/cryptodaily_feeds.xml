			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Certain projects stand out for their innovation, potential, and impact! As we embrace 2023, three projects have caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors: Tron (TRX), Polkadot (DOT), and Big Eyes Coin (BIG).</p>
<p>These projects represent the best of the best in terms of technology, community, and vision. Let's explore the nitty-gritty of each project and discover why they are among the top contenders in the crypto landscape.</p>
<p>Tron: A Decentralised Digital Economy</p>
<p>Tron has emerged as a trailblazer in the crypto industry, aiming to revolutionise the digital entertainment sector. By leveraging blockchain technology, Tron seeks to create a decentralised ecosystem where content creators can directly connect with consumers, eliminating the need for intermediaries and empowering users with greater control over their data and digital assets.</p>
<p>One of Tron's key strengths lies in its scalability. With high throughput and low fees, the Tron network can handle a vast number of transactions, making it suitable for applications ranging from gaming to decentralised finance. The project's commitment to interoperability further enhances its appeal, allowing seamless integration with other blockchain networks and expanding its reach.</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin: Pioneering In Memes And Eco-Friendliness</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin, the cat-themed meme coin, has drawn a lot of interest as a cryptocurrency in presale that tackles significant environmental problems. By using the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which is recognised for its energy efficiency and ecologically favourable features, the project adopts a novel approach to mining. This demonstrates Big Eyes Coin's dedication to sustainability and establishes it as a trailblazing force in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The effects of Big Eyes Coin, however, reach beyond mining. The initiative is committed to making a beneficial impact on the globe and has put aside a percentage of its assets to help organisations that promote ocean protection. Big Eyes Coin just debuted its own casino, providing players with an interesting selection of play-to-earn (P2E) games, to further strengthen its presence in the cryptocurrency industry. This move adds a layer of entertainment and engagement while providing an additional revenue stream for participants. That&rsquo;s set to launch with 4,000 P2E games, users can expect a myriad and exciting gaming experience within the world of Big Eyes.</p>
<p>Polkadot: Unlocking The Power Of Interoperability</p>
<p>Polkadot has made waves with its ambitious mission to enable a multi-chain ecosystem that connects different blockchains and allows them to interoperate seamlessly. Designed to solve the scalability and interoperability challenges faced by blockchain networks, Polkadot's innovative technology aims to foster collaboration and resource sharing among diverse projects.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the core of Polkadot's architecture is its unique relay chain, which serves as a secure foundation for interoperability. Parachains, specialised chains that connect to the relay chain, enable independent governance and customisation while benefiting from the security and scalability of the overall network. This modular approach empowers developers to create and deploy their own blockchain applications while enjoying the benefits of interoperability.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Tron, Polkadot, and Big Eyes Coin have emerged as leading crypto projects in 2023, each offering unique innovations and contributions to the industry. Tron's focus on decentralised digital entertainment and scalability positions it as a promising contender. Big Eyes Coin's commitment to environmental consciousness and charitable initiatives sets it apart as a pioneering force. Polkadot's vision of a multi-chain ecosystem and interoperability showcases its potential to solve key challenges in blockchain technology. These projects exemplify the ongoing evolution and impact of cryptocurrencies in the current landscape.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is a realm of constant evolution, where opportunities and trends can surge and die down with remarkable speed. In this constantly evolving landscape, users need early access to information to stay ahead of the curve. The later you are to trend or play, the less likely you are to make a profit, and here's an opportunity to stay early and position yourself for the massive inflow of value coming to the crypto market. </p>
<p>Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA) are undervalued, and you can expect some price pumps in the coming weeks leading to the bull market. However, the ultimate play for the next bull season is the newly launched presale project, Uwerx.</p>
<p class="s8">Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA)</p>
<p>Aptos(APT) and Cardano(ADA) are two cryptocurrencies with some of the most underrated growth metrics when assessing the next pumps of the bull market. Aptos(APT) recently launched, and it hasn't had time to grow for a project that emerged right before the FTX market chaos. The network has had an impressive price trend this year, and it's planning an upgrade to improve staking and participation on the network. This upgrade will allow delegated staking, where users can earn staking rewards without running a node themselves. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Cardano(ADA) has had the most upgrades of any blockchain network in the past two years. The Cardano community is dedicated to constantly improving the chain, and the network saw its most tremendous price jump after its smart contract upgrade in 2021. Since last year, the network has launched updates to make it a better alternative to Ethereum and provide support for cutting-edge crypto solutions like DeFi. With its latest upgrade, Cardano adds a scaling tool, Hydra Head, to make transactions on the chain even faster.</p>
<p>Both projects have been building in silence, and nothing speaks value louder than when the bull market begins to build momentum. However, we firmly believe the Uwerx token is a less risky bet as it's on presale and offers a unique solution to a derived market.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx Presale Guarantees Massive Profit For Early Adopters</p>
<p>Uwerx is the most exciting blockchain solution we have seen in recent years. The platform easily edges out existing platforms in the freelance industry. The gig economy is dominated by firms more particular about the company's profit than creating value for users. For example, Upwork and Fiverr charge 10% and 20% for transactions initiated on their platform.</p>
<p>Uwerx easily becomes a better competition with its 1% flat fee across all contracts. Most of this fee would eventually go back to serve users via the liquidity pool and other means of creating value. Uwerx uses its native WERX token as the primary utility token allowing users to begin trading it once the platform launches.</p>
<p>However, smart investors have started entering the presale event to get in on the project early and make some profit by launch. You can join them, too, as the token goes for $0.0225 after a recent increase from $0.012. Price prediction analysis suggests that the token could go as high as $1.5 in Q3 of 2023; this is an opportunity you shouldn't miss for anything.</p>
<p>In addition, liquidity will be locked for about 25 years as a safety measure to keep funds available to users willing to trade tokens. Enter the presale now and earn up to 20% bonus tokens.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>For years, trading success and profitability remain a big deal for traders. However, Tradecurve (TCRV) has emerged to change the story by providing traders with a first-of-its-kind hybrid and decentralised trading platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still in presale, Tradecurve (TCRV) is poised to make eye-popping gains and potentially surpass even established players like Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in ROI. With a unique approach to blockchain technology and a growing community of enthusiastic investors, Tradecurve (TCRV) is quickly making a name for itself as the cryptocurrency to watch. This article unravels the unique potentials of Tradecurve (TCRV) and why it is quickly taking out Monero (XMR) and Dogecoin (DOGE) in ROI.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Monero (XMR) Lead Bear Market Despite Regulatory Pressure</p>
<p>Despite the overall bearish condition of the crypto market, Monero (XMR) is leading its peers with upward momentum as regulatory pressure tightens around its privacy-focused peer-to-peer solution. As of May 17, the Monero (XMR) token is trading around $151 after surging to $164 from a key support level of $131.</p>
<p>The recent surge in Monero (XMR)'s price is due to the growing demand for Monero (XMR)'s unparalleled privacy-focused and anonymity feature. These include ring signatures and stealth addresses that obfuscate transactions while protecting user identity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Monero (XMR) remains an unsuitable investment for many investors. Its privacy-enhancing feature has given rise to new regulations while countries and crypto exchanges enforce stricter rules and bans for using and transacting with Monero (XMR) and other privacy-conscious cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) Hype Fizzle Out as High-Value Projects Dominates</p>
<p>The hype around Dogecoin (DOGE) has fizzled out recently as investors have turned their attention to more high-value projects. The meme coin, created as a joke in 2013, saw its price soar to an all-time high of $0.73 in May 2021, but it has since fallen back to around $0.073, about a 90% loss.</p>
<p>One reason for this significant decline in Dogecoin (DOGE)'s value is its lack of underlying value. Unlike innovative projects like the Tradecurve (TCRV) protocol, Dogecoin (DOGE) is not backed by any real-world use case, application or asset. High supply and volatility also subject Dogecoin (DOGE) to wide price fluctuation, making it a risky investment for many people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) Protocol Surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR) as Hybrid Decentralised Platform Pique Mainstream Attention</p>
<p>Innovation is key to success - a reason why Tradecurve (TCRV) continues to lead its peers while providing a seamless and better way to trade. Gone are the days of juggling multiple accounts for different assets. With Tradecurve (TCRV), users can effortlessly trade crypto, stocks, forex, indices, and commodities, all from one convenient platform.</p>
<p>With its cutting-edge tools and capabilities, Tradecurve (TCRV) offers a decentralised, multipurpose and scalable platform accessible to everyone. Benefit from low latency execution, transparency, competitive trading fee, AI-integrated algorithmic trading systems, and social trading, all designed to optimise every trader's portfolio and experience.</p>
<p>At the core of Tradecurve (TCRV)'s thriving ecosystem is the TCRV token that grants users unlimited access to the platform's staking opportunity, reward and discount. Thus, it is easy to see why Tradecurve (TCRV) will potentially topple Dogecoin (DOGE) and Monero (XMR)'s ROI in its ongoing presale.</p>
<p>Interest in Tradecurve (TCRV)'s capabilities has zoomed its demand to the second phase. Its token is trading at $0.012. Experts are optimistic about its long-term success and ability to change decentralised trading forever. Sign up for the presale and stand a chance to be a part of next-gen trading technology.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Decentralized crypto mixing platform Tornado Cash recently suffered a significant attack on its governance. A malicious proposal recently subverted its governance system, providing the threat actor with complete control over the protocol.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The threat actor successfully shifted 1.2 million votes to a proposal with deceptive intent on May 20th. This initiative received more than 700,000 legitimate votes, enabling the attacker to fully command Tornado Cash governance. This incident was highlighted by @samczsun, a researcher at Paradigm, a research-driven technology investment firm.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">On 2023/05/20 at 07:25:11 UTC, Tornado Cash governance effectively ceased to exist. Through a malicious proposal, an attacker granted themselves 1,200,000 votes. As this is more than the ~700,000 legitimate votes, they now have full control.https://t.co/nY87XmrYgT pic.twitter.com/h9qjc3xRqz</p>
&mdash; @samczsun.com (@samczsun) May 20, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The attacker claimed their proposal employed logic akin to a previously approved community proposal. However, it concealed an insidious function. Once approved, the attacker utilized the emergencyStop function on the governance contract to modify the proposal logic, granting themselves falsified votes.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">With total control, the attacker can now withdraw all locked votes, drain the tokens from the governance contract, and effectively "brick" the on-chain router. @samczsun's latest tweets on the matter suggest that the attacker has already withdrawn 10,000 votes as TORN tokens and liquidated them.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This diligently underscores the need for the diligent scrutiny and appropriate review of proposal descriptions and logic. A Tornado Cash community member known pseudonymously as Tornadosaurus-Hex confirmed the possible compromise of all governance funds and urged members to withdraw any locked funds.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Tornado Cash's team is now actively seeking Solidity developers who could help protect the protocol from further damage. They have also indicated the necessity for dialogue with Binance, as the exchange possesses more tokens held than the threat actor and may be able to help reverse the functions implemented through the exploit.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Tornado Cash case recently received support from major crypto policy and advocacy groups. The Blockchain Association and DeFi Education Fund jointly filed an amicus curiae brief in support of a partial summary judgment motion for the plaintiff against the U.S. Treasury Department.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Tornado Cash, asserting that it assisted the North Korean hacking group, Lazarus Group, in funneling roughly $7 billion worth of funds obtained from various exploits. The infamous Lazarus Group is notorious in the crypto sphere for stealing from prominent DeFi protocols. This accusation led to the arrest of Tornado Cash's creator, Alexy Pertsev, on money laundering charges in August, inciting public outcry.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In retaliation to these widespread exploits, the sanction was imposed by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on Tornado Cash, placing addresses purportedly connected with the mixer on its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List. Consequently, it is illegal for U.S. persons to interact with those addresses under threat of substantial fines and imprisonment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Data from CoinMarketCap reveals a significant decrease in Tornado Cash's activity following these developments, with transaction volumes declining by an average of 40% on an hour-to-hour within the last 24 hours. The reported loss of roughly 10,000 TORN tokens have been traced back to the threat actor's activities. The aftermath of this episode underlines the importance of rigorous code inspection and robust community governance in decentralized protocols.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">Staking your cryptocurrency is an ideal way of earning a passive income while also supporting the network&rsquo;s operation. Though the idea is sound, it comes with certain disadvantages for the user who is staking - meaning, his share of cryptocurrencies would remain locked in a wallet for a period of time and would remain inaccessible, thus limiting the ability to use or trade them.</p>
<p class="s4">But innovation never sleeps and thus sprung the idea of liquid staking.</p>
<p class="s4">With it, two key players emerged, captivating the attention of investors and enthusiasts like LIDO and Cosmos. These innovative platforms offer a revolutionary concept known as liquid staking, which combines the benefits of staking with the flexibility of decentralized finance (DeFi). We will also discuss an upcoming player who&rsquo;s big into DeFi, a meme token called Big Eyes Coin.</p>
<p class="s8">What Is Liquid Staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking provides a solution to this liquidity problem. With liquid staking, you can stake your cryptocurrency and still maintain its flexibility. Instead of locking up your funds, they are tokenized into "staking derivatives" that represent your staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Thus, liquid staking offers the best of both worlds: the ability to earn staking rewards and maintain liquidity, allowing you to use your assets in various ways within the crypto ecosystem. It provides more flexibility and accessibility compared to traditional staking, where your funds are locked up for a specific duration.</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking holds huge future potential, and investing in tokens that are at the forefront of this unique mechanism will reap huge rewards.</p>
<p class="s10">LIDO - Unleashing The Power Of Liquid Staking</p>
<p class="s4">Imagine you have some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Solana, Polkadot, or Kusama, and you want to earn rewards by staking them.</p>
<p class="s4">Here's where LIDO comes in. LIDO is one of the best platforms that help you stake your cryptocurrencies through liquid staking. With LIDO, you can stake your assets and receive something called st-tokens. These st-tokens represent your staked assets and are linked to them in a one-to-one ratio. So, if you stake 1 Ethereum, you'll receive 1 st-token.</p>
<p class="s4">The cool thing about LIDO's liquid staking is that it allows you to enjoy the benefits of staking, like earning rewards, while still having the flexibility to trade or use your st-tokens in the DeFi world. So, win-win for both the network and staker.</p>
<p class="s4"></p>
<p class="s10">What Is Liquid Staking On The Cosmos Hub Through Stride?</p>
<p class="s4">Stride, the leading liquid staking protocol within the Cosmos ecosystem, offers liquid staking for several Cosmos chains, including the Cosmos Hub. Stride allows users to stake their tokens and receive staking derivatives that can be freely traded or redeemed with Stride for the original tokens.</p>
<p class="s4">By adopting Stride's non-custodial liquid staking protocol, users maintain full control over their assets, providing greater flexibility compared to traditional staking methods. With over 80% market share in the Cosmos ecosystem, Stride contributes to the decentralization and security of the network while enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of staked assets.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Big Eyes Coin - A Promising Investment Opportunity</p>
<p class="s4">Big Eyes Coin has emerged as an exciting crypto project, capturing the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts. With its upcoming launch on Uniswap, Big Eyes Coin aims to establish itself as a unique player in the market. The project boasts a range of top features, including a casino platform where users can trade their crypto for BIG tokens and participate in play-to-earn (P2E) games. With over $37 million raised during its presale and a projected increase in value, Big Eyes Coin presents an enticing investment opportunity.</p>
<p class="s4">For a limited period, you have the exclusive chance to acquire $BIG tokens at their remarkable stage 3 price. Buy BIG tokens now for $0.00017 per token.</p>
<p class="s4">We hope now you can answer like a pro when someone asks - What is liquid staking?</p>
<p class="s4">Liquid staking has emerged as a game-changing concept, offering users the benefits of staking combined with the flexibility of the DeFi ecosystem. LIDO and Stride within the Cosmos ecosystem are two of the best liquid staking platforms that exemplify the power and potential of this new technology, providing users with enhanced liquidity, accessibility, and control over their staked assets.</p>
<p class="s4">Furthermore, Big Eyes Coin presents an exciting investment opportunity, with its unique features and promising future. By investing in these coins, individuals can diversify their portfolios and potentially reap substantial returns.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) gained marginal ground early in the Asian session as the pair remained in a relatively tight range with selling pressure around the 26955.26 level, right around the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 25810 to 27678.73.&nbsp; Upside progress recently weakened around the 27516.58 level, representing a test of another downside retracement level linked to recent selling pressure around the 29850 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technical trading activity remains strong with recent buying activity around the 26361.52 area, a test of a previous downside price objective linked to selling pressure around the 28334.75 area. &nbsp;Following recent selling pressure, related downside price objectives include the 26308, 26093, 25885, and 25604 levels.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 27145, 27108, 26765, 26729, 26380, 26309, and 26203 levels during the recent depreciation, downside price objectives related to recent selling pressure around the 30500, 30050, 29850, 28334, and 27647 levels.&nbsp; Related downside price objectives include the 25474, 25442, 25124, 24705, 24440, 23208, and 22769 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One key thing to understand about crypto is that it is a highly dynamic industry that is constantly evolving in both its operational and user experience capabilities. The current crypto market is rife with excellent newcomers bringing new and improved ideas to the table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of these have improved old concepts or systems and others are bringing completely new, revolutionary ideas that challenge all the previous norms of what cryptocurrency is about. One key thing to understand about crypto is that it is a highly dynamic industry that is constantly evolving in both its operational and user experience capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of these, in particular, is Big Eyes Coin, which launched its presale in August 2022 and has since seen an incredible environment of growth. It has surprised investors and users with its stunning selection of rewards and profitable opportunities. Within the first 2 months, the platform made its first $8 million, this was the first display of strength by Big Eyes Coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Sets Big Eyes Coin Apart?</p>
<p>Right from the start, Big Eyes Coin was seen as one of the most successful coins in presale history due to it being audited and approved by Solidity Finance, making $2 million, and being listed as number 1 on CoinSniper all within the first month. No other meme coin was able to gain this amount of success in such a short period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exponential growth can be attributed to the coin's incredible bonus scheme. Starting at only 20% within a month of the presale launch, it successfully attracted all kinds of hungry investors. As it stands, Big Eyes Coin is offering one of the largest rewards in the presale market - a 300% bonus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coins has a lucrative structure that is different from other meme coins. Their loot boxes have the most to offer without the need for a large investment. Users can simply invest a minimum of $10 to win up to a million dollars in prizes. This communicates the incredible risk and reward ratio of the site and explains why it has grown so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is it a force to be reckoned with in the bonus arena, but it also gives its users a great selection of NFTs that they can use to maximize their profits when the platform launches. Hosted on the Opensea marketplace, they can collect, mint, and then trade these on or after the launch on June 3rd, when the demand for it is at an all-time high.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Does Big Eyes Coin Hold In The Future?</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin&rsquo;s release into the larger market will make history. Not only is it one of the best-performing presales in recent history, but its value and community are unmatched by that of both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within the next 6 months, Big Eyes Coin is expected to face incredible growth. Based on its performance during the presale and its community of investors, the coin is highly likely to perform significantly better than both its meme coin rivals, with many speculating that it may even take the top spots in the meme coin category, being part of the top 10. This can be seen in the speed at which it has already built up its presale pool to over $35 million, which would not have been possible without the support of strong investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin will launch at $0.0006 and steadily grow from here. The ultimate goal is to reach a value of $1, and based on its performance and investment potential so far, this can easily be achieved within the first year of its launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the presale for Big Eyes Draws to a close in the following weeks, investors can make use of this limited time by purchasing their share of $BIG to make the most out of their investment when it does hit its $1 mark. Big Eyes Coin is expected to lead a new era in the meme coin arena, don&rsquo;t miss this opportunity to be part of a revolution.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>NFTs belonging to the bankrupt crypto firm Three Arrow Capital sold for close to $2.5 million at a Sotheby&rsquo;s auction. </p>
<p>According to auction house Sotheby&rsquo;s, seven non-fungible tokens (NFTs) belonging to bankrupt cryptocurrency firm Three Arrows Capital (3AC) fetched nearly $2.5 million at auction. The auction was part of 3AC&rsquo;s liquidation, Teneo, one of the court-appointed liquidators, said in February.</p>
<p>The liquidator said it would sell the firm&rsquo;s prized NFTs to help recoup the over $3.6 billion owed to 3AC&rsquo;s creditors.</p>
<p>The NFT, which fetched the highest price at over $1 million, was &ldquo;Fidenza #725,&rdquo; an image with graphic curves and dashed in a muted palette of yellow, cream, black, and pink, news outlet Reuters reported. The firm purchased the NFT for 135 ether (ETH) in 2021, worth around $341,786 at the time.</p>
<p>3AC is said to have had an extensive collection of sought-after NFTs, including items from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Ape Yacht Club, and Cryptopunks.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency news site The Block reported 3AC&rsquo;s assets worth an estimated $1 billion, and its NFT collection valued at about $22 million.</p>
3AC Founders Embark on a New Venture
<p>Amid the company&rsquo;s liquidation, Three Arrows Capital co-founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies announced the launch of a new cryptocurrency exchange &ndash; OPNX.</p>
<p>Zhu and Davies pitched the idea in January, with CoinFlex co-founder Mark Lamb joining the duo.</p>
<p>Three Arrows Capital is widely regarded as one of the crypto firms most severely affected by the 2022 crypto winter. Davies and Zhu admitted that the crisis and collapse of the Terra ecosystem, along with Bitcoin&rsquo;s price drop below $20,000, eventually led to the firm's demise.</p>
<p>The co-founders have both been blamed for massive investor losses.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>AI cryptocurrency tokens took off to the upside on Friday. Will they spark the next phase of the bull rally?</p>
An AI led bull rally
<p>The crypto bull rally that started at the beginning of this year was very much led by a strong artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. ChatGPT was out in the public arena and much polemic debate raged over its use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the interest in AI continued to gather momentum, the focus turned to the cryptocurrency sector and its obvious capability to integrate AI and use its own particular technology innovations to find novel use cases.</p>
<p>According to Coingecko, the AI crypto category currently has a market cap of around $2.6 billion. Back in early January this would have been a lot less and value investors saw the potential in buying up several of the crypto AI tokens.</p>
Massive AI token surge
<p>One of the biggest recipients of this buying spree was SingularityNET ($AGIX). $AGIX went from a value of $0.0450 on January 1, to $0.622 on February 8, a whopping gain of 1400%.</p>
<p>Fetch.AI ($FET) was another AI token that rose in tandem with $AGIX. $FET put on 586% for the same time period, but if it was taken into account that its bottom was in late November 2022, its actual gain could be measured at 1068%.</p>
<p>However, both of these tokens, plus most of the other AI tokens descended from their dizzy heights in early February, first descending precipitously, and then grinding down over the last 3 months to arrive at what could now be an AI token bottom.</p>
Technical indicator bottoms

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AI cryptocurrency tokens took off to the upside on Friday. Will they spark the next phase of the bull rally?</p>
An AI led bull rally
<p>The crypto bull rally that started at the beginning of this year was very much led by a strong artificial intelligence (AI) narrative. ChatGPT was out in the public arena and much polemic debate raged over its use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the interest in AI continued to gather momentum, the focus turned to the cryptocurrency sector and its obvious capability to integrate AI and use its own particular technology innovations to find novel use cases.</p>
<p>According to Coingecko, the AI crypto category currently has a market cap of around $2.6 billion. Back in early January this would have been a lot less and value investors saw the potential in buying up several of the crypto AI tokens.</p>
Massive AI token surge
<p>One of the biggest recipients of this buying spree was SingularityNET ($AGIX). $AGIX went from a value of $0.0450 on January 1, to $0.622 on February 8, a whopping gain of 1400%.</p>
<p>Fetch.AI ($FET) was another AI token that rose in tandem with $AGIX. $FET put on 586% for the same time period, but if it was taken into account that its bottom was in late November 2022, its actual gain could be measured at 1068%.</p>
<p>However, both of these tokens, plus most of the other AI tokens descended from their dizzy heights in early February, first descending precipitously, and then grinding down over the last 3 months to arrive at what could now be an AI token bottom.</p>
Technical indicator bottoms
<p>When looking at technical analysis, the higher time frames give the much truer picture of price action. In this respect, the weekly Stochastic RSIs (a momentum indicator) have bottomed for some of the AI tokens, implying that they are now extremely oversold, and with some of these a crossover has now taken place.</p>
<p>$AGIX was the first AI token to lift off, and started its rapid breakout on late Thursday afternoon. It surged 30% in a period of only 24 hours, hitting $0.32. Since then $AGIX has come back to touch the trendline it broke out of - a trendline that has been steadily following downwards since March 18.</p>
<p>A cross up has taken place on the weekly RSI and it now remains for the oscillator to cross the 20 line to really signal the start of the strongest momentum that can send AGIX back to its double top at $0.66.</p>
<p>Many of the other crypto/AI-related tokens are likely to follow suit and it will be very interesting to note which of them might take the lead from SingularityNET.</p>

<p>The head of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has urged G7 nations to set an example in implementing global anti-money laundering standards. Kumar added it is prudent to put an &ldquo;end to the lawless crypto space&rdquo; as little progress has been made in introducing the organization&rsquo;s new crypto rules.</p>
<p>The FAFT head urged the Group of 7 to implement recommendations on fighting against money laundering and terrorism ahead of the annual G7 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, this weekend.</p>

CBDCs and &ldquo;Travel Rule&rdquo; Up for Discussion at Hiroshima
<p>The summit is slated to discuss policy for crypto and digital assets and standards for the global implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The summit will also address accelerating the implementation of the FAFT&rsquo;s controversial &ldquo;Travel Rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Travel Rule&rdquo; requires financial institutions which process crypto transfers greater than $3,000 to disclose the sender&rsquo;s details, including their name, address, and account information.</p>
<p>Kumar said most countries have advanced in introducing regulation, with most introducing FATF standards, but &ldquo;relatively poor&rdquo; progress had been made in implementing the updated requirements relating to crypto assets. The President noted his concerns in an article entitled &ldquo;An End to the Lawless Crypto Space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said:</p>

<p>G7 countries should lead by example and regulate the crypto sector so that no virtual safe havens exist for illicit financial transactions.</p>

<p>The FATF applied its AML and counter-terrorist financial rules to the crypto space in 2019, but most nations remain non or only partially compliant with them.</p>
<p>Kumar further emphasized the increased risk of crypto assets as they grow. He specifically referenced the use of cryptocurrencies to pay for ransomware attacks and evade sanctions and its use in raising funds for terrorist groups.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While the risks have increased, crypto assets continue to operate in a virtually lawless global environment,&rdquo; the FAFT President said.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Developers of a decentralized exchange based on Arbitrum called Swaprum have drained $3 million worth of ETH from the protocol in what looks to be an apparent rug pull or exit scam.&nbsp;</p>
Swaprum Team Pulls Off $3M Heist&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrencies are built on the principles of trust and transparency. However, the specter of hacks and rug pulls has often cast a long and dark shadow on the industry. Recent events have provided a grim reminder of the constant threat from hacks and scams, as users of Swaprum have unfortunately discovered. Swaprum is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Arbitrum Network. It has now emerged that the developers at Swaprum have pulled off a rug pull on its users, draining $3 million worth of ETH from the protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decentralized exchange offered users low swapping fees, exceptionally high farming rewards, and the potential to earn up to 100% annual percentage yield (APY).&nbsp;</p>
Details Of The Rug Pull&nbsp;
<p>The rug pull was discovered by blockchain security firm PeckShield, which flagged it on Friday. PeckShield revealed that approximately 1628 ETH, worth around $3 million, was drained from Swaprum&rsquo;s liquidity pools. According to on-chain data, the exit was orchestrated late on Thursday. First, the Swaprum team removed liquidity for the SAPR token on the decentralized exchange, selling the assets in exchange for more ETH. The SAPR token is the native token of the Swaprum decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subsequently, the team moved the funds from Arbitrum to Ethereum before moving them to the cryptocurrency mixer Tornado Cash. A more detailed analysis carried out by Beosin revealed that the developer of Swaprum&rsquo;s smart contract had added a backdoor functionality to the contract. This is what enabled the theft of the liquidity pool tokens that users had staked. It was revealed that the developer had used the add() function and drained the protocol. Beosin explained that the team at Swaprum had upgraded the normal liquidity collateral reward contract to another, which contained backdoor functions. It stated,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The backdoor function add() will transfer LP tokens from the contract to the _devadd address. By querying the _devadd address, it will return the &lsquo;Swaprum: Deployer&rsquo; address. The Swaprum: Deployer uses the stolen LP tokens in the previous step to remove liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Swaprum team also completely wiped out their online footprint, deleting all their social media profiles across platforms such as Twitter, GitHub, and Telegram. However, the project&rsquo;s official website is still operational. The now-defunct decentralized exchange also highlighted a positive security check from CertiK. However, it remains to be seen whether the certification is genuine.&nbsp;</p>
SAPR Token Essentially Worthless&nbsp;
<p>As expected, the decentralized exchange&rsquo;s native SAPR token lost all its value following the rug pull. Currently, the token is trading at $0.000022, with a trading volume of only $83. This represents a 99% decline from its price of $0.147 before the rug pull. The Swaprum rug pull is easily one of the biggest rug pulls on the Arbitrum Network. It eclipsed the loss suffered during the hack of DeFi protocol Hope Finance, which was the victim of a $2 million exploit that took place in February.</p>
Rug Pulls On The Rise
<p>The crypto space has seen an unmistakable rise in rug pulls or exit scams. Just the month of May itself has seen two other rug pulls apart from Swaprum. On the 5th of May, CertiK froze $160,000 that was stolen during the Merlin DEX rug pull. Merlin fell victim to an insider rug pull which resulted in a loss of $1.8 million. XIRTAM, an educational project backed by CultDAO, also pulled off a rug pull, with the team behind the project stealing 2000 ETH out of the funds raised for the platform.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent Messari report reveals Ripple&rsquo;s XRP surged by over 55% in Q1 2023, outperforming the overall cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p>According to a report by Messari, Ripple&rsquo;s XRP outpaced the overall crypto market in Q1 2023, having grown by over 55% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ). Messari revealed XRP&rsquo;s market capitalization increased from $17.4 billion on January 1 to an impressive $27.4 billion on March 31, representing a Q1 surge of 59.9%. While XRP&rsquo;s market cap grew by 59.9%, its price surged by 55% during the first quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall cryptocurrency market only observed an increase of 46% during the same period.</p>
<p>XRP started the year at $0.35 but gained immensely during a market-wide rally to reach a high of $0.43 on January 23. The asset&rsquo;s price, however, faced resistance at this price and ended January with an increase of 19.71%.</p>
<p>Ripple&rsquo;s native token, however, declined in February to a price of $0.36 but closed the month off at $0.37. XRP witnessed a decline of 7.27% during February.</p>
XRP Moved in March
<p>XRP moved with strong bullish momentum during March, registering an overnight growth of 20% on March 22. Ripple&rsquo;s XRP was on its way to hitting its very bullish target of $0.50 but ultimately fell short, reaching a high of $0.49.</p>
<p>The asset gained on the back of the US banking crisis and anticipation of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. The price further grew as speculation circulated that Ripple&rsquo;s case with the SEC would soon come to an end.</p>
<p>XRP was on track to end March with a bang when it soared to a 10-month high of $0.58 on March 29, having witnessed a solo run of 56% in just two weeks. The asset fought off a few bearish attacks to close March at $0.54. March&rsquo;s rally saw XRP gain 43%, ending the first quarter with a price increase of 55%. Against the backdrop of its stunning Q1 growth, Ripple reported that it sold over $361 million worth of XRP tokens during the first three months of 2023.</p>
<p>Q2 has not proved too profitable for XRP yet, which, at the time of writing, exchanged hands at $0.46.</p>
Things Are Looking Up for Ripple
<p>Ripple had a victory this week in its ongoing legal battle against the SEC. A court denied the SEC&rsquo;s request to seal documents related to former SEC official William Hinman&rsquo;s statements about Ether. Hinman, the former director of the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Corporate Finance, delivered a prudent speech in 2018, suggesting that Ether was not a security.</p>
<p>Hinman&rsquo;s statements are significant to the case as they provide a precedent for a digital asset like XRP.</p>
<p>Ripple further announced it made a $250 million acquisition of Metaco &ndash; a well-known crypto custodian. Seen as a positive sign for the future of both Ripple and Metaco, the move sees Ripple take on sole responsibility at Metaco while still allowing current CEO Adrien Traccani to manage operations independently. Traccani has been instrumental in getting Metaco where it is now.</p>
<p>Customers would benefit significantly from this deal, says Monica Long, the President of Ripple:</p>

<p>Adding these capabilities to Ripple&rsquo;s already growing product solutions means we can continue to support customers as they look to embrace the true potential of crypto and blockchain in real-world applications.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins burst onto the scene in 2013, tickling the funny bone of the cryptocurrency world. Over the past decade, these seemingly light-hearted tokens have evolved into lucrative investment opportunities, spawning numerous millionaires and capturing global attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, despite their popularity, most meme coins have been criticized for their lack of utility and dependence on fleeting trends. This narrative took a different direction when DigiToads (TOADS) a meme coin yet utility-rich play-to-earn and stake-to-earn token, appeared on the scene. This new ICO, boasting a 25x growth potential, has caught the attention of analysts who believe it could surpass well-known tokens like ApeCoin and Shiba Inu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what is the secret behind the success of this promising ERC20 token?</p>
<p>DigiToads Leading Among The Top Crypto Coins</p>
<p>DigiToads is an innovative cryptocurrency project that has successfully merged the world of meme coins with real-world utility. Designed to disrupt the crypto landscape, DigiToads offers a unique play-to-earn and stake-to-earn model, attracting investors and engaging users in a thriving gaming ecosystem.</p>
<p>At the heart of DigiToads lies the Toad-Cade, an engaging game where users can battle and breed their Toads, represented by non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This gaming platform allows players to earn rewards, creating an exciting environment where users can participate and profit from their in-game activities.</p>
<p>This hyper-deflationary token has implemented a comprehensive staking system, allowing investors to earn passive income by staking their cool NFTs. This feature appeals to many investors, from crypto enthusiasts to those seeking steady investment returns.</p>
<p>The DigiToads project has experienced remarkable success during its presale, having already raised over $2.45 million. This intense buying pressure indicates the project's future potential and investors' confidence in its growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presale is currently in progress, with the price of TOADS sitting at $0.024 and expected to reach $0.055 upon launch, presenting a significant opportunity for early investors.</p>
<p>To further solidify its position in the market and enhance its accessibility, DigiToads is set to launch on both decentralized and centralized exchanges. With listings on Uniswap, a popular decentralized exchange, and BitMart, a well-known centralized platform, the project is poised to reach a broader audience and gain further credibility within the crypto community.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>ApeCoin and Shiba Inu Analysis</p>
<p>ApeCoin and Shiba Inu are popular meme coins that have been at the center of attention for some time. ApeCoin, backed by the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, was initially designed to be a governance token and medium of exchange within the ApeCoin ecosystem. However, despite its association with a popular NFT project and has had a little stunt growth.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Shiba Inu started as a Dogecoin-inspired meme coin and has since evolved into a more expansive ecosystem. With its decentralized exchange, ShibaSwap, and the development of its own blockchain, Shibarium, Shiba Inu has created a utility level many other meme coins lack. However, Shiba Inu's inflationary tokenomics has had some investors looking out for a newer project that could possibly have better returns.</p>
<p>Bottom Line</p>
<p>Overall, DigiToads stands out among many top altcoins and meme coins like ApeCoin and Shiba Inu by offering a unique ecosystem with passive income opportunities, deflationary tokenomics, and a transparent team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DigiToads combines the playful nature of meme coins with utility and credibility, positioning itself as a compelling alternative for investors seeking long-term value appreciation in the DeFi market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Amid whispers and speculation, the cryptocurrency world is abuzz with rumours of an impending revolution as Tradecurve's (TCRV) presale quietly emerges as a potential game-changer, silently toppling the giants of the industry such as XRP (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With its innovative approach, Tradecurve (TCRV) is positioning itself as a force to be reckoned with, stirring excitement among investors and enthusiasts alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This article will uncover the newest developments in XRP (XRP) and Polkadot (DOT) and analyse why Tradecurve (TCRV) is the ultimate pick for crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>XRP (XRP) Shows Strong Performance with 1.48% Rise: Revisits $0.46 Threshold</p>
<p>In the realm of digital assets, XRP (XRP) displayed an upward trajectory on Wednesday, registering a noteworthy ascent of 1.48%. Building upon a previous gain of 3.37% the day before, XRP (XRP) concluded the trading session at $0.44825. A remarkable event unfolded as XRP (XRP) revisited the $0.46 mark, marking its return after a hiatus of ten sessions.</p>
<p>The day commenced on an optimistic note as XRP surged to an early morning peak of $0.46138. Demonstrating resilience, XRP (XRP) successfully breached both the First Major Resistance Level (R1) at $0.4500 and the Second Major Resistance Level (R2) at $0.4583. However, a subsequent reversal compelled XRP (XRP) to dip to an early afternoon nadir of $0.43765. Skillfully evading the potential downturn indicated by the First Major Support Level (S1) at $0.4261, XRP (XRP) swiftly rebounded, concluding the day at $0.44825.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) Faces Steep Decline, Approaches Critical Support Level of $5.30</p>
<p>Since its peak at around $7.8 per coin earlier this year, Polkadot (DOT) has experienced a rapid decline, finding itself in a downward spiral. Currently, the native DOT token teeters perilously close to a crucial support level, around $5.30, as renewed selling pressure continues to mount. The predictable nature of this sell-off can be attributed to Polkadot's (DOT) operation within an intensely competitive domain of the blockchain industry.</p>
<p>A standout characteristic of Polkadot (DOT) lies in its unique ability to foster interoperability among diverse blockchains. This revolutionary feature facilitates seamless communication, data sharing, and the execution of smart contracts.</p>
<p>A remarkable bridge is created by employing a relay chain, which bridges the gap between disparate blockchains, enabling them to collaborate and coexist harmoniously. By transcending the boundaries of individual blockchains, Polkadot (DOT) paves the way for a new era of interconnected decentralised systems.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Presale Alert: Tradecurve (TCRV) Introduces Game-Changing Trading Platform at $0.01</p>
<p>Tradecurve is set to revolutionise the trading landscape by offering a cutting-edge platform that provides users complete anonymity while trading. With the launch on the horizon, Tradecurve (TCRV) is currently in stage 2 of the presale, generating excitement among potential investors. The initial token price is set at $0.01, presenting a promising opportunity for early participants.</p>
<p>Tradecurve will introduce automated trading and leverage the power of artificial intelligence, granting users access to a diverse array of algorithmic and AI-based trading systems. By incorporating these advanced technologies, Tradecurve (TCRV) aims to extend financial inclusion to millions of individuals, making trading applications accessible to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) also addresses security concerns by implementing enhanced security measures, ensuring the protection of user assets, and significantly reducing trading costs. Moreover, Tradecurve (TCRV) offers a comprehensive range of trading tools and educational resources to empower users with knowledge and insights for successful trading strategies.</p>
<p>With a unique blend of centralised and decentralised exchange features, Tradecurve (TCRV) aims to create a seamless trading experience that combines the best elements of both approaches, fostering a dynamic and efficient trading environment for all users.</p>
