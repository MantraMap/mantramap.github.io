<p class="s3">It's not uncommon for a cryptocurrency to face bearish trends for lengthy periods with little hope for recovery, thereby causing substantial losses to investors. Unfortunately, this is the current situation for the Axie Infinity (AXS) community. The disheartening trend is pushing investors to more stable crypto projects like the crypto newcomer, Yachtify.</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify (YCHT) Takes the Lead in the Crypto Scene</p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify, a crypto new player, is projected to lead the crypto space in the coming seasons. Market trends are endorsing projections even before the currency's launch, and investors are swarming into the community, making solid investments with the potential to start earning a stable income. </p>
<p class="s3">Yachtify, a new coin with the potential to become a blue chip cryptocurrency, is designed to enable individuals worldwide to profit off the economy-proof maritime industry. </p>
<p class="s3">It is the first cryptocurrency investment project to allow investors to buy, sell and rent luxury boats so that investors can own shares in anything from a jet ski to a sunseeker. This model will enable the everyday crypto user to own, sell, and trade yacht shares, discarding the stereotype that delegates the market to extremely wealthy individuals.</p>
<p class="s3">Furthermore, Yachtify would allow investors to purchase fractional NFTs that represent real-life yachts with the Yachtify token ($YCHT). These yachts are strictly insured and secured in maximum-security seaports worldwide. </p>
<p class="s3">That's not all, though; current yacht owners can join the Yachtify community and raise funds by selling a minimum of 25% of their private yachts. All yachts will be sold or leased to high-net-worth persons, and the revenue will be disbursed to community members proportionally to their investments.</p>
<p class="s3">The Yachtify network and founder have been audited and verified by the SolidProof network. Yachtify will lock liquidity for life and freeze community tokens for three years, so it is completely for investors. </p>
<p class="s3">When dealing with a high-potential coin, it is always best to get invested early, and with a presale value of just $0.10, Yachtify is a no-brainer.</p>
<p class="s3">This is an incredible opportunity to get into an unbelievably stable cryptocurrency investment at an excellent price. Follow this link before the price becomes untouchable!</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY YACHTIFY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Axie Infinity (AXS): Future Wavers as Axie Infinity (AXS) Goes to Zero</p>
<p class="s3">Axie Infinity (AXS) is a blockchain cryptocurrency that is based on an online game. </p>
<p class="s3">It was developed by a Vietnamese gaming studio, Sky Mavis, and is run on the Ethereum network. It utilizes a play-to-earn feature that allows players to purchase, breed, and compete with creatures known as Axies in exchange for crypto tokens. </p>
<p class="s3">Cryptocurrency investors were still nursing losses as of April 23rd's unlocking of its Blockchain-based play-to-earn project's tokens worth millions of dollars. At the time, AXS's price was about $7.44, down about 12% that week alone. Market trends predict that Axie Infinity (AXS) will still drop. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Token unlocks are generally considered a bearish catalyst, mainly because holders benefiting from the unlock can sell their coins, thereby adding to the supply in the market. This may trigger more holders to sell their coins and cause a dip, which would be even more drastic for the Axie Infinity (AXS). </p>
<p class="s3">While there may be hopes that Axie Infinity (AXS) may rise again and find stability, investing in coins with stable prospects is best. Yachtify presents an attractive opportunity for investors to get in early on a solid project and earn massive revenue. </p>
