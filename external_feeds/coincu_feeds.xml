<p>Hash rate refers to the amount of computational power that is being used to mine new Bitcoin blocks. It is a measure of how much work is being done to secure the Bitcoin network. The higher the hash rate, the more secure the network is considered to be.</p>

<p>The impact of hash rate on Bitcoin&#8217;s future is significant. A higher hash rate means that it is more difficult for an attacker to successfully launch a 51% attack on the network. This is because a 51% attack requires the attacker to control more than half of the total hash rate of the network.</p>



<p>Additionally, a higher hash rate means that there is more competition among miners to mine new Bitcoin blocks. This competition helps to ensure that new blocks are added to the blockchain at a consistent rate, which helps to maintain the stability of the network.</p>



<p>However, a higher hash rate also means that it is more difficult for individual miners to mine new Bitcoin blocks. This is because the difficulty of mining Bitcoin is adjusted automatically based on the hash rate of the network. As more miners join the network and the hash rate increases, the difficulty of mining Bitcoin also increases.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate is a measure of the computational power being used to mine new Bitcoin blocks. It represents the number of hash calculations that can be performed by the Bitcoin network in one second.</p>



<p>As of April 27, 2023, the Bitcoin hash rate is approximately 160 exahashes per second (EH/s). This means that the Bitcoin network is capable of performing 160 quintillion hash calculations per second. The hash rate has grown significantly over the years as more miners have joined the network and as mining technology has improved.</p>



<p>The high hash rate of Bitcoin is one of the factors that make the network so secure. It would require an enormous amount of computational power to launch a successful 51% attack on the network, making it extremely difficult and expensive for any individual or group to do so. The high hash rate also ensures that new Bitcoin blocks are added to the blockchain at a consistent rate, helping to maintain the stability of the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Why is hash rate important?</h2>



<p>Hash rate is an important metric in the world of cryptocurrency, particularly for blockchain networks that use proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithms, such as Bitcoin. Here are some reasons why hash rate is important:</p>



<ol>
<li>Security: A high hash rate makes the network more secure by making it more difficult for attackers to launch a 51% attack, which would require them to control the majority of the network&#8217;s hash rate.</li>



<li>Network stability: The hash rate plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of the network. It determines how quickly new blocks are mined, and a consistent block time helps to ensure that the network remains reliable and predictable.</li>



<li>Mining difficulty: The mining difficulty adjusts automatically based on the network&#8217;s hash rate. As the hash rate increases, so does the difficulty, making it more challenging for individual miners to mine new blocks. This helps to prevent the network from becoming centralized and encourages more miners to join the network.</li>



<li>Market sentiment: The hash rate can be seen as a measure of the health of a blockchain network. A high hash rate indicates that miners are investing significant resources into securing the network, which can be seen as a positive indicator of market sentiment.</li>
</ol>



<p>The hash rate is an important metric in the world of cryptocurrency because it provides insight into the security, stability, and health of a blockchain network.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s hash rate is a measure of the computational power being used to mine new  BTC blocks. When a miner attempts to add a new block to the Bitcoin blockchain, they are essentially trying to solve a complex mathematical puzzle. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees.</p>



<p>The hash rate represents the number of hash calculations that can be performed by the  BTC network in one second. Each hash calculation is a mathematical algorithm that takes the data from the previous block, along with a random number called a &#8220;nonce,&#8221; and produces a hash output. The goal is to produce a hash output that meets a specific target value that is set by the Bitcoin protocol.</p>



<p>The difficulty of the mining puzzle is adjusted automatically every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, based on the total hash rate of the network. If the hash rate increases, the difficulty of the mining puzzle also increases, making it more difficult for miners to solve the puzzle and earn the Bitcoin reward.</p>



<p>The hash rate is important because it determines the security and stability of the  BTC network. A high hash rate makes the network more secure by making it more difficult for attackers to launch a 51% attack, which would require them to control the majority of the network&#8217;s hash rate. It also ensures that new  BTC blocks are added to the blockchain at a consistent rate, helping to maintain the stability of the network.</p>



<p>The hash rate is a measure of the computational power being used to mine new  BTC blocks. It plays a critical role in the security and stability of the Bitcoin network and is adjusted automatically based on the total hash rate of the network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does the hash rate affect Bitcoin price?</h2>



<p>The hash rate of the Bitcoin network is one of many factors that can potentially influence the price of  BTC, but it is not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Here are a few ways in which the hash rate can indirectly impact the price of  BTC:</p>



<ol>
<li>Network security: A high hash rate generally makes the BTC network more secure, which can increase investor confidence and lead to higher demand for Bitcoin, potentially driving up the price.</li>



<li>Mining profitability: The mining profitability of Bitcoin depends on the hash rate and the difficulty of the mining puzzle. As the hash rate increases, the difficulty also increases, making it more challenging for miners to mine new  BTC blocks. This can reduce mining profitability, which could potentially reduce the supply of new Bitcoin being introduced into the market and drive up the price.</li>



<li>Market sentiment: A high hash rate can be seen as a positive indicator of market sentiment, as it indicates that miners are investing significant resources into securing the network. This could lead to increased investor confidence and higher demand for Bitcoin, potentially driving up the price.</li>
</ol>



<p>However, it is important to note that the price of  BTC is influenced by a wide range of factors, including market sentiment, adoption rates, regulatory developments, and macroeconomic factors. While the hash rate can indirectly impact the price of  BTC, it is just one of many factors that can influence the market.</p>

</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">MATH token</h2>



<p>The MATH token is a central coin in their entire ecosystem, and the token not only holds the same name as the wallet but is the primary token for many of the other products they build. Products include DEX marketplace, NFT, and their layer two solutions built on Substrate.</p>



<p>The MATH coin is the central token in the entire ecosystem. Thus, get a wide variety of use cases from various protocols and systems.</p>



<p>Of course, the token was partially sold to raise funds. But you can still earn it as well. Just put the token in the Math Vault Dapp. Here, tokens are released slowly to staking in the Dapp. And there is a halving period every two years, and doing so will take at least 2040 before the Vault is empty.</p>



<ul>
<li>Token name: MATH token</li>



<li>Symbol: MATH</li>



<li>Blockchain: Ethereum.</li>



<li>Standard: ERC-20.</li>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Math Wallet Hardware Wallet Compatibility</h2>



<p>Math Wallet is compatible with two hardware wallets, including&nbsp;Ledger and WOOKONG Bio.</p>



<p>The Ledger hardware wallet is a popular choice for users looking for a secure way to store their cryptocurrencies offline. Math Wallet supports the Ledger hardware wallet through its Google Chrome extension, allowing users to easily manage their Ledger accounts and transactions directly from the Math Wallet interface.</p>



<p>Similarly, the WOOKONG Bio hardware wallet is also supported by Math Wallet through its mobile app. WOOKONG Bio is a biometric hardware wallet that uses fingerprint recognition to authenticate transactions, providing an extra layer of security for users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Fee</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s free. You only pay blockchain fees when you use Dapps or send transactions. Besides, Math does not charge any fees. On the Dapp browser page, Math advertises some of its apps, like Math Vault and Math Gas. That&#8217;s fair in their ecosystem.</p>



<p>The fact that they offer free wallets is fantastic. But when it comes to fees, you must always beware of the high blockchain fees currently on Ethereum. Luckily, Math has many other EVM blockchains that can help you if Ethereum is too expensive.</p>

<p>Thus, the article introduced the entire Math Wallet, from features, and products to basic instructions for use. This seems like a perfect wallet to use for web3 users. They have an entire ecosystem built around their Math token, with the wallet being part of that ecosystem. To make this all work well together, newbie content is a bit easier to digest, and better community support can greatly help with this. Users can earn passive income by staking their digital assets and contributing to the security and governance of their respective blockchain networks.</p>



<p>However, if you are familiar with the crypto space and know from the start how to do anything web3, Math could be the one for you. As they don&#8217;t cause you any trouble to set up, and it gives you the ability to access all your favorite Dapps in seconds.</p>



<p>Math Wallet is a highly secure crypto wallet for managing digital assets. The wallet employs various security measures to protect user funds and data, such as multi-factor authentication, biometric verification, and hardware wallet integration.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chronos was created to become the top liquidity layer for the Arbitrum network. By providing an easy and economical way for projects of all sizes to incentivize token liquidity, Chronos hopes to form a true &#8220;public good&#8221; within the Arbitrum ecosystem. Let&#8217;s learn more about the project through the article below.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">About Chronos</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="549" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836-1024x549.png" alt="Chronos Review: Arbitrum-Based DEX What&#039;s Special" class="wp-image-184029" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836-1024x549.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836-300x161.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836-768x412.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836-750x402.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1836.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chronos Review: Arbitrum-Based DEX What&#039;s Special 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Chronos is a community-owned decentralized exchange (DEX) and liquidity provider<a href="https://news.coincu.com/181836-nftperp-first-perpetual-futures-dex-nft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> built on</a> the Arbitrum Layer 2 (L2) network, which aims to drive DeFi growth through liquidity incentives lasting. Chronos&#8217; exchange dApp will be revealed, complete with UI for airdrop request, swap, liquidity, lock, vote, chrNFT, referral, and more. on April 27, 15:00 UTC.</p>



<p>The platform is designed to be a key component of Arbitrum&#8217;s DeFi infrastructure, similar to Thena on Binance Smart Chain, Equalizer on Fantom, and Velodrome on Optimism.</p>



<p>To do this, Chronos optimizes and innovates the ve(3,3) model to facilitate reliable liquidity delivery for new and established protocols, creating value for users and the ecosystem.</p>



<p>Arbitrum was chosen as Chronos&#8217; foundational network due to its alignment with its core values. Arbitrum&#8217;s L2 architecture offers scalability, high transaction speeds, low costs, and robust security. Furthermore, Arbitrum hosts a multitude of DeFi pioneers and high-quality projects, which Chronos aspires to join and support in the global on-chain adoption endeavors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Chronos Operation Model</h2>



<p>Chronos&#8217; ve(3,3) model aligns incentives in a way that benefits all participants in this ecosystem.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1827.png"><img decoding="async" width="1080" height="1080" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1827.png" alt="Chronos Review: Arbitrum-Based DEX What&#039;s Special" class="wp-image-184020" title="Chronos Review: Arbitrum-Based DEX What&#039;s Special 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<ul>
<li>Liquidity Providers: incentivized to add liquidity to pools with the highest $CHR emissions.</li>



<li>veCHR Voters: incentivized to vote incentivize directly to high-volume groups, because these groups generate the most fees.</li>



<li>Traders: benefit from low slippage and better rates thanks to the liquidity provided.</li>



<li>Protocols: benefit from a public liquidity layer and can easily bribe voters to attract more incentives &#8211; and thus more liquidity for their pool.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chronos uses a non-rebase model. Unlike other ve(3,3) DEXs, voters must continue to add to their locked positions over time to maintain their voting rights.</p>



<p>By modeling different rebase mechanisms and conducting in-depth research on the pros and cons of each, we have concluded that the no-rebase model is the most effective for long-term health and longevity project sustainability. It offers the best economic incentives for all participants, making it more attractive for new protocols looking to join the Chronos ecosystem after launch. It also reduces the advantage for those early users so that the system remains balanced over time.</p>



<p>The no-rebase model is the fairest way to implement the ve(3,3) mechanism and helps reinforce our commitment to making Chronos an actual &#8220;public good&#8221; for all participants Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Objectives of the project</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="549" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829-1024x549.png" alt="Chronos Review: Arbitrum-Based DEX What&#039;s Special" class="wp-image-184022" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829-1024x549.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829-300x161.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829-768x412.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829-750x402.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-1829.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Chronos Review: Arbitrum-Based DEX What&#039;s Special 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The project wants to help DeFi grow. It&#8217;s time for blockchain technology to replace the entrenched system, but before that can happen on a large scale, a number of challenges still need to be overcome.</p>



<p>Chronos and the whole ve(3,3) model is a step in that direction. Our goal is to be a trusted entry point for both new and established protocols in search of sustainable liquidity incentives on Arbitrum and, in doing so, help create substantial value not only for our users but also for the entire ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Function</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gauge Voting / Bribing</strong></h3>



<p>By locking $CHR for $veCHR, users earn the right to vote on the platform&#8217;s gauges. Gauges control the rate of emissions to different liquidity pools on the DEX. Pools that receive more votes earn a more significant proportion of $CHR incentives for that epoch.</p>



<p>Each epoch lasts 7 days, after which all bribes and trading fees are distributed as a lump sum to voters. You earn only from the gauges (pools) you have voted for.</p>



<p>On Chronos, outside parties provide economic incentives (called bribes) to help convince $veCHR voters to vote for specific gauges each epoch. The bribe marketplace is permissionless and open to the public, and anyone can add a bribe for any pair on the platform with just a few clicks. Only whitelisted tokens can be offered as bribes.</p>



<p>After the next epoch has ended, trading fees and bribes are claimable as a lump sum.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Swaps</strong></h3>



<p>Chronos uses the same hybrid swap engine seen in other modern DEXs. We use a different swap algorithm depending on how closely correlated assets are to one another.</p>



<ul>
<li>vAMM &#8211; for assets with low price correlation, Chronos uses the Uniswap V2 swap algorithm.</li>



<li>sAMM &#8211; for closely correlated assets, Chronos uses the Solidly stable-swap algorithm.</li>
</ul>



<p>Chronos&#8217;s adjusted prices fee structure enables competitive swap and strong revenue generation for veCHR voters, leading to an increase in both locking rates and incentives for liquidity provisions.</p>



<ul>
<li>vAMM : 0.20%.</li>



<li>sAMM : 0.01%.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Liquidity Pools</strong></h3>



<p>Chronos enables secure trading of digital assets with minimal fees and low slippage.</p>



<p>This difference could result in a smaller amount (higher price paid) or a higher amount (smaller price paid) of desired tokens returned from a trade. Chronos offers two different types of liquidity pools types based on the tokens being provided:</p>



<ul>
<li>sAMM &#8211; for strongly correlated pairs, such as stablecoins.</li>



<li>vAMM &#8211; for uncorrelated pairs, such as $CHR and $ETH.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Chronos Ecosystem Token</h2>



<p>Chronos uses a dual token model to incentivize participants to perform different functions in the ecosystem.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CHR token</strong></h3>



<p>CHR is Chronos&#8217; primary utility token and incentivizes users to add liquidity and stake their LP tokens on the platform.<br>There will be 50 million CHR tokens available at launch and more will be put into circulation over time. For full details on the CHR initial emission and distribution schedules, please see the relevant sections contained in these documents.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>veCHR token</strong></h3>



<p>Any CHR holder can vote to deposit their tokens and exchange them for veCHR grants holders the right to vote on the platform&#8217;s metrics, which control how CHR incentives are distributed to Chronos&#8217; liquidity pool.</p>



<p>The lock period (also known as the election escrow period (hence the prefix) can be up to 2 years, subject to the linear relationship shown below.</p>



<ul>
<li>100 CHR locked for 2 years will become 100 veCHR.</li>



<li>100 CHR locked for 6 months becomes 25 veCHR.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>veCHR token utility</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Gauge voting: owners can vote for gauges weekly. These determine which group will receive CHR emissions for the next epoch.</li>



<li>Admin rights: owners can participate in governance and vote on proposals for protocol improvements. (Governance implementation will take place in the future).</li>



<li>Fee Revenue: Voters earn up to 90% of swap fees generated by pools that voted for each epoch (10% to 20% for chrNFT stakingers).</li>



<li>Bribery revenue: voters earn 100% of bribes to groups that voted for each epoch.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the project, 54% of the initial supply will be made available via the airdrop, making Chronos one of the largest airdrops in Arbitrum history. A future article will provide a detailed breakdown of the total token supply distribution.</p>



<p>Each minted chrNFT will receive a mixture of locked veCHR and unlocked CHR tokens through an airdrop. The more NFTs you mint, the more tokens you get.</p>



<p>The project allocated 9% of the initial supply of CHR (4.5 million tokens) to airdrops to chrNFT miners. If all 5,555 NFTs are minted, each will get just over 800 tokens, split between CHR (allocated linearly for 8 weeks) and veCHR (locked for 2 years). If not all NFTs are fully minted, the CHR airdrop for each NFT will increase.</p>

<p>On April 14, Chronos &#8211; AMM DEX platform built on Arbitrum announced an airdrop for the community. Of which, about 53% of the initial supply of CHR tokens will be distributed to more than 16,000 people.<br>According to information from the project, the airdrop took place to celebrate the launch of Chronos Exchange. The platform&#8217;s gitbook documentation states that the initial supply of CHR is 50 million tokens, and when released, the circulating supply will be 2.45 million tokens.</p>



<p>Token airdrop will be distributed to many different users. The project says 9% of the initial supply, or about 4.5 million CHR, will be given to those who minted chrNFT on March 29. With a total of 5,555 chrNFT minted, each NFT issued will receive an airdrop of 405 CHR and 405 veCHR (locked for 2 years).</p>



<p>In addition, chrNFT holders will also have the option to receive all 810 tokens in the airdrop as veCHR without authorization.</p>

<p>In addition, 25% of the initial supply, or 12.5 million veCHR, will also be allocated to the protocol&#8217;s coffers to incentivize liquidity. These tokens will be locked for 2 years and used only for project funds.</p>



<p>Approximately 21% of the supply (10.5 million veCHR) will be distributed to users of Arbitrum, several other DeFi ecosystems, and Chronos partner platforms. Notably, 6% of the total token airdrop will be for future rewards programs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Chronos Finance is an AMM DEX built on Arbitrum. The goal of the protocol is to become the main liquidity hub on Arbitrum, using the ve(3,3) model to attract liquidity and users in the ecosystem.</p>



<p>In general, Chronos offers many popular products, but with models that have little innovation and many projects in the same field in development, the level of competition is very high. Therefore, a newly launched project may take a long time to compete and prove its potential.</p>



<p>Chronos is currently looking for partners to select the wallet addresses of users to receive the airdrop. The announcement from the platform also states that the event is intended to attract more crypto users to join the project&#8217;s ecosystem.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the .BinanceUS domain name will be made available exclusively through the exchange&#8217;s app in the coming weeks and is currently priced at $10. Unstoppable will also support two-digit domains for the first time, such as 14.BinanceUS or 23.BinanceUS.</p>

<p>With the .BinanceUS domain, customers can buy, sell and send cryptocurrencies quickly within the exchange&#8217;s app. Conversely, Unstoppable Domains customers can also use Binance US to withdraw funds to any Unstoppable domain, including .crypto and .nft.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We’re thrilled at @unstoppableweb&#8217;s continued growth and that they now are offering BinanceUS customers domains with utility.&#8221;</p>
<cite>Sandeep Nailwal, Co-founder Polygon said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Launched in 2018, Unstoppable Domains is a next-generation domain provider and digital identity platform that enables anyone to access Web3 by having full ownership and control of an online identity for the first time.</p>



<p>Over 3.4 million Web3 domains are minted on Unstoppable, and any of them are available on Binance US. Unlike traditional domain name registrars that require owners to pay a fee to renew their domains, blockchain domains like Unstoppable do not require users to pay renewal fees or gas fees, other than being outside the scope and control of ICANN.</p>



<p>Increasing accessibility to Web3 while maintaining a safe and secure customer ecosystem is at the core of Binance.US&#8217;s mission.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to partner with Unstoppable and Polygon to simplify the crypto experience for our community and enable users to take ownership of their digital identities.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tensor is an NFT marketplace built on the Solana blockchain (just like Blur on Ethereum), and Tensor&#8217;s first season, which kicked off September 22, 2022, ended a month and a half ago. The second season has begun as of March 6, 2023.</p>



<p>Tensor organizes airdrops that will reward you when you meet certain conditions to incentivize users. This season, they will reward users with new rewards, which will increase activity. Less than two weeks since Season 2 started, and Tensor is already Solana&#8217;s 2nd largest NFT marketplace (after Magic Eden). In this analysis, you will be able to observe the evolution of Tensor from all angles.</p>



<p>Tensor noted that there is still no tool to calculate the display of airdrop points, but users can start hunting immediately. Based on the number of points, the user will receive &#8220;secret boxes&#8221;. The reward will also be equivalent to the &#8220;rarity&#8221; of the box.</p>



<p>Season 2 aired in less than two months, and NFT sales on Tensor have increased tremendously. The total number of sales since Season 2 aired is more than 300% of the total sales made in Season 1.</p>



<p>Looking at NFT sales, Season 2&#8217;s one-week period sales also seem to be doing well. The total sales of Season 1 is equal to 41% of the total sales of Season 2. That is enough to say that Tensor will be a very thriving ecosystem in this Season 2. The number of NFT buyers in the new season has reached 268% of the total in Season 1.</p>

<p>At the time of massive attention, Solana&#8217;s NFT marketplace announced it had raised $3 million in a seed round led by the Placeholder investment fund, with participation from Solana Ventures, Big Brain Holdings, and MonkeVentures.</p>

<p>The liquidations were mostly from traders who held short positions against BTC and other cryptocurrencies, with 37,332 traders being liquidated. The most significant liquidation was a $2.2 million BTC-USD short position on ByBit, but other liquidated assets include Ethereum and Arbitrum, with $29.71 million and $4.11 million, respectively. Polygon and Litecoin also recorded liquidations, with $2.31 million and $2.27 million, respectively.</p>

<p>Notably, most of the liquidations occurred on Huobi, Binance, and ByBit, which accounted for 73% of the overall liquidations. Of these, 83% were short positions. This indicates that many traders were betting against Bitcoin&#8217;s rally and losing out.</p>



<p>Interestingly, fears of another U.S. banking crisis fuel the new Bitcoin rally. First Republic Bank shares plunged by more than 29% after news emerged that its deposits fell 40% in 22 days. Meanwhile, the U.S. government appears unwilling to intervene in the First Republic rescue process as it did with Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March. The government took over those banks to prevent further contagion to the broader economy. This has led to speculation that the government may not intervene this time, causing some investors to turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against potential economic turmoil.</p>



<p>Sentiments in the market have been mainly positive, with some experts predicting that Bitcoin&#8217;s price might reach around $45,000 by the end of this year. Matrixport chief researcher Markus Thielen said, &#8220;As the US 10 year bond yield has started to trade below 3.5%, we can assume that inflation will be a big tailwind for risk assets – notably Bitcoin.&#8221; This suggests that Bitcoin may continue to be a popular investment option for those seeking to protect their assets against inflation.</p>

<p>To continue using Bitget, Hong Kong users must agree to the Terms of Use of BitgetX Hong Kong and transfer their assets to www.BitgetX.HK. Starting April 24, 2023, Hong Kong users of Bitget.com will be required to transition to www.BitgetX.hk and can no longer access Bitget.com. They must also close any open perpetual contract or margin trading positions and withdraw their virtual assets from Savings products at Bitget.com.</p>



<p>BitgetX Hong Kong intends to apply for a license under the Hong Kong Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) regime. It will operate under the transitional arrangement created under the Hong Kong VASP regime until its license application is approved.</p>



<p>The Hong Kong VASP regime will become effective on June 1, 2023. Due to new regulatory reasons, Bitget.com will not be able to serve Hong Kong users from that date.

<p>South Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, Upbit, announced the addition of EGLD to its KRW and BTC markets on April 27, 2023. As a result, EGLD&#8217;s Korean won, and BTC transactions will be available, and deposits will open within 3 hours of the announcement. However, the announcement of adding a new digital asset to Upbit often leads to a sharp increase in altcoins, so users should be aware of the risks.</p>



<p>EGLD deposit support will only be available from the mainnet network and not through other networks like BSC.</p>



<p>Orders under certain conditions will be restricted after adding new digital assets to the KRW and BTC markets to provide a safe trading environment and accurate market information to members. When adding a new digital asset, the initial purchase order is limited for about 5 minutes, and sell orders are limited to -10% or less of the previous day&#8217;s closing price of CoinMarketCap. The market price and pre-order are determined to be about an hour.</p>



<p>The price of the new digital asset confirmed on CoinMarketCap is 57,710.38 KRW / 0.001468 BTC as of April 27, 09:30 (KST). Users should refer to this point and be mindful of losses due to rapid market price fluctuations in the initial stage of transaction support.</p>



<p>Investors and traders must be careful as the announcement of EGLD&#8217;s addition to Upbit&#8217;s KRW and BTC markets may lead to high volatility in the market. While EGLD&#8217;s addition to Upbit is a positive development, it is essential to consider the risks involved and make informed decisions.</p>

<li><em>MeWe social network with 20M users to integrate with Polkadot parachain.</em></li>



<li><em>MeWe, a social network with reportedly better privacy protections than Facebook, will integrate with the Frequency blockchain network, a parachain of Polkadot. The move will allow MeWe to make a permanent commitment to data ownership for users.</em></li>

<p>The integration will be based on the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP), which was developed by Frank McCourt’s Project Liberty. MeWe&#8217;s CEO, Jeffrey Edell, stated that the move will allow MeWe to make a permanent commitment to data ownership for users, which aligns with its mission of providing better privacy protections to its users. MeWe plans to begin moving its users’ accounts to the network this quarter.</p>

<p>MeWe was launched in 2012 and has been praised as a “Facebook alternative” with allegedly better privacy protections. An Axios report in September stated that the network had over 20 million users. On the other hand, frequency launched as a Polkadot parachain in November and was initially developed by Amplica Labs. During the panel, Braxton Woodham, the president of Amplica Labs, emphasized that the partnership between Frequency and MeWe will not immediately solve all social media problems. However, he claimed that it would provide a basic framework that app developers can build upon to fix a variety of problems in the future.</p>



<p>While MeWe&#8217;s integration with Frequency is a significant move towards better privacy protections, there is still much work to be done in the world of social media. Social networks involve a lot of different problems, ranging from the user experience to moderation to AI algorithms for curation. It&#8217;s virtually impossible to solve all these problems at once, so MeWe and Frequency are taking an approach to link their digital presence together on the web to create the social web. This sets up the ability to attack the data layer and approach those difficult problems. Overall, the integration between MeWe and Frequency is an exciting development highlighting the growing importance of blockchain technology in social media.</p>

<p>Blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence denied involvement in the flash crash that caused Bitcoin to fall by 7% in less than an hour. DB had reported that the crash was caused by the firm sending out an alert that wallets linked to Mt. Gox and the US government had started shifting large sums of Bitcoin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">[DB] Mt Gox and US Govt Wallets Making Transactions: Arkham Alert</p>&mdash; db (@tier10k) <a href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1651317391626846214?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">April 26, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>However, Arkham Intelligence claimed that it had conducted an investigation of the situation and found that its alerts were sent accurately, and neither the alert nor the tweet could have caused the sharp BTC price drop. They also pointed out that the drop occurred before the alert and subsequent tweet were sent.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Data published by a Twitter user showed that there had been no transfers from wallets associated with Mt. Gox. While a Bitcoin address believed to be the US government&#8217;s wallet for Silk Road hack funds witnessed a transaction worth only $0.19, which was still processing at the time of writing.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The sudden and steep decline in prices wreaked havoc on the derivatives market, with the total sum of liquidations for crypto market participants topping $211 million at present, with Bitcoin traders accounting for nearly $97 million worth of these liquidations.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $28,796, up 1.6% in the last 24 hours, according to data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinmarketcap</a>. Despite the flash crash and ensuing chaos, the cryptocurrency market remains highly volatile, with sudden drops or surges not uncommon.</p>
