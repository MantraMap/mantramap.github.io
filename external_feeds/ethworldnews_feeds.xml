<ul><li>FTX debtors have reached an agreement with an affiliate of Miami International Holdings to sell LedgerX.&nbsp;</li><li>LedgerX will be sold to M7 Holdings for $50 million after it emerged as the top bidder in the exchange’s bankruptcy auction.&nbsp;</li><li>FTX US acquired LedgerX’s parent firm for $298 million back in 2021.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>FTX is set to sell its futures and options exchange and clearinghouse unit LedgerX to an affiliate of Miami International Holdings. The bankrupt crypto firm and its associated debtors reached an agreement with M7 Holdings LLC to sell the crypto derivatives exchange after M7 Holdings emerged as the top bidder during the exchange’s bankruptcy auction. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX&#8217;s Deal Is Subject To Approval From The Bankruptcy Court</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-announce-agreement-with-an-affiliate-of-miami-international-holdings-for-the-sale-of-ledgerx-301807349.html" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from FTX earlier today, the LedgerX deal was agreed upon after a comprehensive sales process as part of the Bahamas-based exchange’s Chapter 11 proceedings that included multiple bidders. The total proceeds from this transaction is expected to be approximately $50 million. Court filings show that a sale hearing was initially scheduled for April 12, but was postponed two days ahead of the hearing. The deal is subject to approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and the U.S. Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are pleased to reach this agreement with MIH, which is an example of our continuing efforts to monetize assets to deliver recoveries to stakeholders.&#8221; </p><cite>John Ray III, CEO and Chief Restructuring Officer of FTX. </cite></blockquote>



<p>Ledger Holdings, the parent company of LedgerX, was acquired by <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-brett-harrison-trading-hub-crypto/">FTX US</a> in 2021 for a whopping $298 million. Crypto hedge fund LedgerPrime, a part of the parent firm, announced in September last year that it would return external capital to investors and continue managing the $400 million in assets under management (AUM) it had at the time. LedgerX reportedly had a trading and clearing revenue of $1.2 million and a negative EBITDA of $17 million in 2022. </p>

<ul><li>Binance US has sent a letter to Voyager informing it of the termination of the purchase deal.&nbsp;</li><li>The $1 billion deal to acquire Voyager Digital has faced multiple hurdles including objections from federal regulators.&nbsp;</li><li>Voyager has stated that it will directly distribute its remaining assets to customers via its platform.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The termination of Binance US’ $1 billion deal to acquire the assets of Voyager Digital has become the latest development for the crypto lender, which is currently undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. Binance’s American arm drove the final nail into the billion-dollar asset purchase deal earlier today by sending a letter to Voyager, revealing that the deal had been called off.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Voyager Will Directly Distribute Remaining Assets To Customers</strong></h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/investvoyager/status/1650921887512272917" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> thread earlier today, Voyager stated that it was disappointed by Binance US’ decision to terminate the asset purchase agreement. The bankrupt crypto lender now plans to initiate self-liquidation, in line with its Chapter 11 plan. The firm will directly distribute its remaining cash and crypto assets to customers using the Voyager platform. In the meantime, the Voyager Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors stated that it will explore potential claims against Binance US. </p>



<p>Voyager Digital acknowledged the termination of the deal in a <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175304252380000000171.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made earlier today in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Binance US’ letter to the bankrupt crypto lender didn’t mention the reason for the termination of the deal. The legal notice did highlight the fact that since the purchase agreement hadn’t been executed till April 18, 2023, the exchange was no longer bound to go through with it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a statement posted on Twitter, Binance US revealed that it made the “difficult decision to exercise its right to terminate the asset purchase deal due to the current regulatory landscape for the crypto industry in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>While our hope throughout this process was to help Voyager&#8217;s customers access their crypto in kind, the hostile and uncertain regulatory climate in the United States has introduced an unpredictable operating environment impacting the entire American business community.”</p><cite>Binance US</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr">🤷‍♂️</p>&mdash; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1650941963955236887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 25, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Binance US’ decision to call off the deal comes less than a week after federal regulators in the United States stopped their efforts to get the deal suspended through a court order. Interestingly, when a crypto influencer suggested that the exchange’s decision to pull out of the acquisition deal was part of the conditions for an imminent settlement in the case filed against Binance by the CFTC, CEO Changpeng Zhao neither confirmed nor denied the influencer’s hunch. CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-official-settlement-binance-lawsuit/">indicated</a> in an interview earlier today that she hadn’t ruled out the possibility of a settlement in the lawsuit and was hoping to find a “path forward” with the exchange. </p>

<ul><li>The CFTC is reportedly in communication with Binance over the ongoing lawsuit regarding the exchange’s conduct.</li><li>Commissioner Kristin Johnson revealed that the regulator hopes to find a path forward with the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The commissioner didn’t rule out the possibility of a settlement with the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) may choose to settle its lawsuit against the world’s largest crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/jane-street-binance-vip-in-cftc-lawsuit/">Binance </a>and its Chief Executive Changpeng Zhao. In an interview with CNBC, CFTC Commission Kristin Johnson revealed some positive developments in the case that may lead to a solution out of court in the future. </p>



<h2><strong>CFTC Is Talking To Binance About The Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/cftc-commissioner-hopes-to-find-path-forward-in-binance-lawsuit.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, CFTC Commissioner Kristin Johnson revealed that the commodities regulator has been in “continuing conversations” with Binance. The content of these conversations reportedly includes the regulator’s take on the potentially problematic business conduct of Zhao’s crypto exchange. The exchange has also been in talks with the CFTC to explain their side of the case in an effort to find a path forward. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I want to be really careful not to prejudge what will actually happen in the litigation. And I want to say that typically, in the context of any litigation, we are always ready to have conversations and typically even ahead of the litigation.”</p><cite>Kristin N. Johnson, CFTC Commissioner </cite></blockquote>



<p>While no decision has been taken yet on whether to settle the lawsuit against Binance or not, Commissioner Johnson stated that she hopes to find a “path forward” in this matter. Her statement marked the first time that a CFTC official commented on the Binance lawsuit since it was filed on March 27, 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When asked about the regulatory landscape for crypto in the United States, the CFTC official stated that she was counting on Congress to come up with crypto-specific regulations soon. “Under immediately existing laws, there is provision to understand how securities laws would apply to any digital assets that qualify as securities. And those (are) the same in the context of commodities&#8221; she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A Gibraltar court ruled for crypto exchanges to work with liquidators from beleaguered crypto trader Globix as the platform hopes to recover $43 million in digital assets. </li><li>The court asked Binance to freeze suspected transfers linked to funds that liquidators say went missing last year. </li><li>Crypto exchanges Bitstamp, <a href="http://crypto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crypto.com</a>, and Kraken were ordered to identify certain account holders, per an April 13 court ruling cited by the Financial Times. </li></ul>



<p>Globix, a cryptocurrency trading venue that filed for liquidation on the 10th of March 2023 has secured a court order that freezes digital assets and incentivizes crypto exchanges to hand over customer information as they search for $43 million of missing funds. </p>



<p>Following an extensive investigation into the alleged theft, a Gibraltar court ordered Binance, to halt attempts to move assets from several Globix-linked crypto wallets. The court has also ordered Bitstamp, crypto.com, and Kraken to identify account owners linked to the collapsed crypto trader and hand over customer information.</p>



<h2>Globix in Gibraltar</h2>



<p>Miracle World was a crypto exchange operating as “Globix” or “Globix Cash”, with investors in Gibraltar and the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>The crypto trader was trying to carve a niche in crypto investing by letting customers choose automated trading strategies and pick attractively valued tokens. This plan was interrupted as a crisis of confidence gripped the crypto market, causing several major crypto tokens including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) to lose a chunk of their value. </p>



<p>Several once-prominent firms in the crypto landscape also filed for bankruptcy due to the ripple effects of this market shakedown. </p>



<p>After the crypto market crisis in 2022, Globix closed its doors to investors in June last year. Daniel Carreras, the sole shareholder, and director, also a Gilbraltarian citizen, voluntarily put Globix into liquidation last month after a prolonged period of struggling to pay investors. He said the company suffered digital theft and plans to recover the funds by working with the necessary authorities. </p>



<p>It is believed that this is the first time an injunction in relation to crypto assets has been made in Gibraltar. While the country has previously developed plans of becoming a global crypto hub, the failure of several major crypto firms in Singapore and FTX in the Bahamas has pushed financial centers to reassess regulatory policies. </p>



<p>Globix was not licensed by the local regulators but its current situation has seemingly called into question whether the architects of Gibraltar’s crypto ambitions can adequately identify risks to consumers. The government of Gibraltar said the case demonstrates the need for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gibraltar-authorities-release-10th-regulatory-principle-to-tackle-market-manipulation/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gibraltar-authorities-release-10th-regulatory-principle-to-tackle-market-manipulation/" rel="noreferrer noopener">firms to be licensed and supervised.</a>  </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>10 persons involved with crashed crypto company Terraform Labs were indicted on multiple charges on Tuesday.</li><li>Daniel Shin who co-founded Terra alongside Do Kwon was also formally charged, though his lawyers claim Shin left the company in 2020.</li><li>Prosecutors froze 246.8 billion won or $184.7 million from the suspects, per Bloomberg.</li><li>The charges were announced shortly after a Seoul District Court ruled disputed claims that LUNC qualifies as a security</li></ul>



<p>Terra co-founder Daniel Shin and nine others linked to the collapsed crypto company were indicted by South Korean prosecutors on multiple criminal charges, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-25/terra-co-founder-daniel-shin-9-others-indicted-by-south-korea" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-25/terra-co-founder-daniel-shin-9-others-indicted-by-south-korea" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> on Tuesday. One of the charges slammed on Shin and the others include violations of the country&#8217;s Capital Markets Acts, a major policy that governs financial operations in South Korea.</p>



<p>Prosecutors seized $185 million (247 billion won) in assets from the suspects months after Kwon&#8217;s company imploded, wiping out at least $40 billion in investments. Investigators started probing the matter shortly after and have made numerous efforts to uncover the truth. Prosecutors previously requested Shin&#8217;s arrest but the court ruled against such a move. </p>



<p>Shin&#8217;s lawyers argued that he left Terra in 2020 after co-founding the project with Do Kwon. His lawyers also maintained that Shin was not involved in the company&#8217;s operations after 2020, stressing that he returned to South Korea after the collapse to cooperate with law enforcement and the investigation. </p>



<h2>Terra Classic (LUNC) Not  A Security Says District Court</h2>



<p>In the battle to classify the status of Terra Classic or LUNA Classic (LUNC) as it was renamed, a District Court in Seoul <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwons-terra-classic-not-security/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwons-terra-classic-not-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ruled</a> that the token is not a security. Prosecutors are seeking a ruling from the country&#8217;s Supreme Court over the matter. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under Gary Gensler also said <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-sues-do-kwon-terraform-labs-fraud/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-sues-do-kwon-terraform-labs-fraud/" rel="noreferrer noopener">LUNC was a security in a lawsuit against Do Kwon</a>.</p>



<p>Authorities are unable to seize roughly $100 million in assets supposedly held by co-founder Shin thanks to Monday&#8217;s ruling over Terra&#8217;s security status. Also, investigators were not able to find any significant property <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-fortune-not-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-fortune-not-in-south-korea/" rel="noreferrer noopener">owned by Kwon in South Korea</a>. </p>

<p>Ethereum’s leading Layer 2 scaling network Arbitrum started <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1650541491012370435?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1650541491012370435?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">distributing</a> its ARB governance token to DAOs in its ecosystem weeks after it airdropped free coins to eligible users as a reward for supporting the chain. </p>



<p>DeFi projects like Aave, Uniswap, GMX, SushiSwap, TreasureDAO, Balancer, Layer Zero, 1inch, MakerDAO, Curve, and Gains Network to name a few all feature among eligible decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs set to receive ARB tokens from the scaling solution. </p>



<p>Arbitrum previously allocated 1.13% of its 10 billion supply towards these DAOs after announcing its governance airdrop to network users and participants in March. This distribution is not to be mistaken with the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arbitrum-airdrop-live-arb-below-2/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/arbitrum-airdrop-live-arb-below-2/" rel="noreferrer noopener">airdrop</a> sent to users or grants that the protocol&#8217;s own DAO would issue to other DAOs as part of the roadmap. </p>



<p>Last week, the protocol sent out test transactions to eligible DAOs. Those that confirmed receiving the mock transactions will receive full distribution, the L2 network noted in a tweet. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The full distribution of the DAO airdrop will take place today with those that have confirmed receiving the test transaction that was sent earlier last week.<br><br>For more details on the DAO distribution, please read the thread below. 🧵👇 <a href="https://t.co/naApiR7uT2" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/naApiR7uT2</a></p>&mdash; Arbitrum (💙,🧡) (@arbitrum) <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1650541491012370435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Arbitrum&#8217;s on-chain data also showed massive ARB token outflows from the Foundation&#8217;s address to over 125 DAO wallets. Per previous details from the airdrop, the DAO distribution boasts 113 million ARB tokens worth around $145 million at current prices. ARB traded above $1.32 on Tuesday, as seen on TradingView charts. </p>

<h2>Arbitrum Moves Past AIP-1 Debacle </h2>



<p>The Ethereum-based scaling solution was the subject of intense community backlash after a governance proposal that sought to allocate 750 million ARB to the Arbitrum Foundation was implemented before voting ended. </p>

<ul><li>Bybit is set to impose mandatory KYC rules on its customers starting May 8, 2023. </li><li>The crypto exchange will restrict certain trading activities for users to refuse to comply with the new rules. </li><li>KYC checks were introduced by the exchange in December last year for select services including P2P trading. </li></ul>



<p>Crypto exchange Bybit has announced that it will enforce mandatory Know Your Customer (KYC) rules on its platform starting May 8. 2023. The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/fast-crypto-registration-french-amf-mica/">crypto</a> exchange&#8217;s new KYC norms are set to come into effect just days after it opened its new global headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. </p>



<h2><strong>Bybit Will Limit Access For Non Compliant Users</strong></h2>



<p>According to an update on Bybit’s <a href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/help-center/s/article/Individual-KYC-FAQ" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a>, the new KYC rules will be applicable in two levels. Individual KYC of at least level 1 will be mandatory for users to access all products and services on the platform from May 8 onwards. Users who opt out of the KYC verification post the deadline will only be allowed to close existing open positions or orders, return loans, or withdraw. Any new trading activities for these users will be restricted. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Bybit ensures that your personal information will be encrypted and protected for privacy and security, and will be used for the sole purpose of verifying your identity to better serve you. It is neither shared nor repurposed for any marketing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p>The verification process will take between 15 minutes to 48 hours. Non-VIP users who complete the level 1 KYC requirements will see their daily withdrawal limit from 20,000 USDT to 1 million USDT. Completing the level 2 KYC requirements will increase it to 2 million USDT. The withdrawal limit for the “Supreme VIP” clients will increase to a whopping 12 million USDT.</p>



<p> According to Bybit, the new rules are necessary to maintain the exchange’s security and to prevent illegal activities. The latest norms are set to kick in more than four months after the platform last updated its KYC requirements. In December 2022, the exchange rolled out verification checks for several products, including peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, NFT trading, and fiat deposits on the platform. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Terra Classic cryptocurrency created by Do Kwon does not classify as a security, a South Korean District Court ruled in February after a similar ruling back in November last year.</li><li>South Korean prosecutors requested a judgment from the country&#8217;s supreme court after the latest ruling.</li><li>Both Kwon&#8217;s attorneys and a South Korean court have not contested whether LUNA Classic counts as a security, per reports.</li><li>The U.S. SEC said LUNC was a security in a fraud lawsuit against Do Kwon in February week before his arrest by Montenegrin police.</li></ul>



<p>The Terra Classic cryptocurrency created by Do Kwon does not classify as a security, a South Korean District Court ruled in February after a similar ruling back in November last year.</p>



<p>According to South Korean news house <a href="https://m.ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=450928" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://m.ilyo.co.kr/?ac=article_view&amp;entry_id=450928" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ilyo Shinmun</a>, the Seoul Southern District Court ruled twice on the matter. Once on November 15, and again on February 16. Both instances were reported for the first time today, the reason being unclear. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Based on the data submitted by the prosecution, it is difficult to say that Luna falls under the financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.</p><cite>&#8211; Seoul Southern District Court.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Prosecutors in South Korea are now seeking a judgment from the country&#8217;s Supreme Court on whether the renamed LUNA CLASSIC or LUNC is a security under the Capital Markets Act.</p>



<p>Authorities are unable to seize assets controlled by Daniel Shin following the ruling. Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, was the focus of an asset manhunt where prosecutors hoped to seize <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-co-founder-home-raided/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terra-co-founder-home-raided/" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100 million for Shin&#8217;s alleged part in Terra&#8217;s $40 billion crash</a>. </p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s LUNC A Security Or Not, Authorities Debate</h2>



<p>South Korean authorities seemingly consider establishing Terra Classic&#8217;s security status as a front boiler topic in the case against <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-fortune-not-in-south-korea/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-fortune-not-in-south-korea/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do Kwon</a>. Kwon&#8217;s lawyers have also contested claims that LUNC is a security, albeit arguing that they are not to disarm authorities intending to sue Kwon for securities fraud. </p>



<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also called Do Kwon&#8217;s Terra Classic a security in a fraud lawsuit <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-sues-do-kwon-terraform-labs-fraud/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-sec-sues-do-kwon-terraform-labs-fraud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> against Kwon in February. According to the SEC, LUNC and its sister token TerraUSD (UST), Kwon&#8217;s algorithmic stablecoin, qualify as securities as investors held expectations of profit from secondary-party efforts. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The French Financial Markets Authority could fast-track crypto registration for companies like Binance that already run regulated digital asset businesses in France.</li><li>Regulators in France are considering the sped-up regime as the EU&#8217;s landmark MiCA bill was overwhelmingly backed by legislators, beckoning a new crypto regulatory era across European states.</li><li>The French AMF also noted that lawmakers would continue to assess rules for DeFi and NFTs as these two ecosystems do not fall under MiCA&#8217;s purview.</li></ul>



<p>Regulators from the French Financial Markets Authority (AMF) are moving to <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/fr/actualites-publications/actualites/marches-de-crypto-actifs-le-reglement-mica-adopte-par-le-parlement-europeen" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amf-france.org/fr/actualites-publications/actualites/marches-de-crypto-actifs-le-reglement-mica-adopte-par-le-parlement-europeen" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fast-track</a> crypto registration for approved digital asset businesses in the country. The AMF&#8217;s decision comes after lawmakers from the European Union voted in favor of the Markets in Crypto Assets Bill or MiCA which will dwarf existing crypto regulations across EU states like France. </p>



<p>MiCA&#8217;s bloc-wide rules require crypto businesses and wallet providers to register for a license under strict regulations. Stablecoin operators must also hold sufficient reserves for the coins they issue. The bill <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-wins-vote-crypto-licensing-europe/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mica-wins-vote-crypto-licensing-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garnered</a> massive support from lawmakers, winning votes 13-1 during a parliamentary session on Thursday. MiCA takes effect from 2023, 12-18 months after the bill is passed and Published in the bloc&#8217;s Official journal. </p>



<p>The AMF said there&#8217;s “consideration of a possible fast-track modular licensing&#8221; for crypto businesses like Binance that already received approval from France&#8217;s financial watchdog. For companies like this, MiCA allows an extra registration period of 18 months for businesses to align their operations with stricter customers and financial protection policies. </p>



<p>&#8220;These players can, during this period, continue to offer their services solely to the French public&#8221;, said the AMF. </p>



<h2>French Regulator Hints DeFi Rules After FTX Crash And MiCA Vote</h2>



<p>The French AMF suggested that rules for decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens as MiCA purview does not cover these two crypto vertices. France already tightened local crypto regulations after FTX, the crypto exchange founded by the disgraced Sam Bankman-Fried, left millions of users in limbo after crashing last year. </p>



<p>During its latest announcement, the AMF said EU lawmakers would continue to <a href="https://t.co/ZEoAosRGRk" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://t.co/ZEoAosRGRk" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">assess</a> rules for DeFi and NFTs if necessary. </p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/ The <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@kucoincom</a> handle was compromised for about 45 mins from 00:00 Apr 24 (UTC+2). A fake activity was posted and unfortunately led to asset losses for several users. KuCoin will fully reimburse all verified asset losses caused by the social media breach and the fake activity.</p>&mdash; KUCOIN (@kucoincom) <a href="https://twitter.com/kucoincom/status/1650336619730436099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">April 24, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>The exchange identified 22 transactions from users who interacted with fraudulent tweets. &#8220;we are currently examining and blocking suspicious addresses&#8221; Kucoin said, promising to prevent any further damage and protect customer assets. The platform also promised full reimbursement to affected users.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>3/ Until 02:00 Apr 24 (UTC+2), we have identified 22 transactions including ETH/BTC associated with the fake activity, with a total value of 22,628 USDT.

<p>Kucoin claims it is conducting an in-depth investigation of the incident with Twitter to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Assets on the exchange remain secure and SAFU despite the exploit via Twitter, the crypto exchange stressed in today&#8217;s thread. </p>



<h2>Cyber Criminal Target Crypto Exchanges</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s attack is the latest exploit on crypto exchanges so far in 2023. A hacker <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitrue-hackers-steal-23-million-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drained</a> $23 million in ETH, SHIB, MATIC, and other cryptos from crypto exchange Bitrue, forcing the platform to suspend withdrawals until April 18 to restore full security. </p>



<p>Before that, South Korean digital asset trading venue Gdac suffered an attack on its hot wallet. The attackers <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hackers-13-million-crypto-exchange-gdac/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/hackers-13-million-crypto-exchange-gdac/" rel="noreferrer noopener">looted $13 million in crypto assets</a>. </p>



<h2>Crypto Crackdown On Kucoin</h2>



<p>Kucoin, like other crypto businesses in the U.S., is no stranger to the regulatory spotlight. Just last month, the exchange was sued by New York State Attorney General Letitia James. AG James claims the exchange is an unregistered commodities and securities dealer. </p>



<p>In the suit brought against the Seychelles-based firm on Thursday, AG James alleged that the exchange facilitated crypto transactions that violated commodities and securities laws within New York. The regulator also accused Kucoin of operating without a commodity and securities license. </p>
