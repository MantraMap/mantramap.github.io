										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/indonesia-national-crypto-exchange/">Indonesia Unveils National Crypto Exchange and Clearing House</a></p>
<p>Indonesia, one of the world&#8217;s most populous countries, has officially joined the ranks of nations with a national crypto exchange and clearing house. After overcoming challenges and delays, the Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti) <a href="https://bappebti.go.id/siaran_pers/detail/12795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on July 20 the successful launch of the long-awaited exchange, marking a significant milestone in the country&#8217;s crypto journey.</p>
<p>With this exchange, the Southeast Asian country aims to provide a regulated and legitimate platform for digital asset trading within its borders to boost investor confidence, promote financial inclusion, and enhance crypto transactions&#8217; overall transparency and security. The newly introduced digital asset trading platform will be an exclusive venue for legally conducting crypto trades within the country.</p>
<p>Accompanying the platform, Bappebti has also introduced a state-of-the-art futures clearing house, an essential component that facilitates smooth and secure transactions between buyers and sellers. This addition is expected to bolster the country&#8217;s overall crypto ecosystem, offering a higher level of protection and reliability for market participants.</p>
<h2>Interest in Cryptocurrencies Continues to Surge in Indonesia Despite Ban on Crypto Payments</h2>
<p>Indonesia began its journey to establish a national crypto exchange in 2021. However, due to the meticulous review process of potential participants, the launch, initially <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/indonesia-crypto-stock-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planned</a> for the end of 2022, was delayed until July 2023. The Trade Minister of Indonesia, Zulkifli Hasan, revealed that licensed traders in Indonesia can now join the national exchange within a specified window, enabling them to participate actively in the country&#8217;s growing crypto market.</p>
<p>Last year, Indonesia&#8217;s deputy minister of trade, Jerry Sambuaga, proposed policy changes in response to the growing interest in digital assets. One of the proposals required two-thirds of the directors and commissioners of crypto firms to be Indonesian citizens.</p>
<p>Despite the ban on using cryptocurrencies for payment, Indonesia&#8217;s interest in digital assets has surged, especially during the pandemic. Bappebti&#8217;s data revealed that nearly 11 million people, approximately 4% of the country&#8217;s population, have invested in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The newly launched exchange and clearing house will provide vital transaction records and enhanced protection for crypto investors in Indonesia. It also marks a significant step in monitoring the rapidly growing sector amid the ongoing transition in regulatory oversight. While the country prohibits using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment, it permits investments in these assets, leading to a surge in investments during the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Binance Indonesia Arm Tokocrypto Registered with the National Exchange</h2>
<p>According to the Bappebti announcement, renowned licensed crypto companies, including Tokocrypto, an Indonesian digital asset trading platform acquired by <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> in December 2022, and Indodax, are among the prominent traders on the exchange. Day-to-day operations of the national crypto platform will be managed by PT Bursa Komoditi Nusantara, ensuring adherence to regulatory standards and efficient functioning. PT Kliring Berjangka Indonesia will oversee clearing transactions, providing a seamless and reliable trading process.</p>
<p>With the passing of a new law earlier this year, the Financial Services Authority will gradually take over the regulation, supervision, and oversight of cryptocurrencies from Bappebti over a two-year transition period. The move reflects Indonesia&#8217;s commitment to fostering a robust and secure crypto market for its investors.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/canadian-crypto-investor-home-robberies/">Canadian Police Warns Public on Crypto Investors&#8217; Home Robberies</a></p>
<p>In recent times, high-value crypto investors in Canada have become victims of home robberies, prompting the local police to issue a public warning.</p>
<p>Both the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Richmond and Delta Police have <a href="https://bc-cb.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/ViewPage.action?languageId=1&amp;siteNodeId=2122&amp;contentId=80507" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> their concern over the emerging pattern of these attacks and are urging potential victims to come forward and report any incidents to aid in their ongoing investigations.</p>
<p>The Canadian Police noted that several incidents have been reported within the past year, where armed assailants have targeted investors’ homes, seeking to steal their digital fortunes. The sheer audacity and sophistication of these crimes have raised serious concerns within the law enforcement community.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Richmond and Delta police have been alarmed by a series of robberies targeting individuals known to be high-value crypto investors. The attackers seem to have detailed knowledge about the victims’ crypto investments, their residential addresses, and the best time to strike.</p>
<p>With this information at hand, the criminals employ tactics to gain access to their victims&#8217; homes, posing as delivery personnel or authoritative figures. Once inside, the suspects proceeded to rob the victims of information that provides access to their cryptocurrency accounts.</p>
<p>The investigations reveal that these robberies have netted significant amounts of digital currency gains, but the specific figures have not been disclosed by the authorities.</p>
<p>One encouraging development is that an arrest has already been made in connection with one of the reported incidents, and charges are being recommended. While the authorities have not confirmed a direct link between all the cases, they have identified a discernable pattern that the criminals seem to follow in executing these home robberies.</p>
<h2>A Call to Action</h2>
<p>The recent wave of home invasion-style robberies targeting high-value cryptocurrency investors in Richmond and Delta has raised major worries about the crypto community&#8217;s safety and security. With ongoing investigations and collaboration between the Richmond RCMP and Delta Police, there is hope that the perpetrators of these crimes will be brought to justice.</p>
<p>In the meantime, crypto investors are urged to take precautions to protect themselves and their assets. The police department has advised residents to refrain from letting strangers or delivery personnel into their homes, regardless of how legitimate they may appear. Instead, residents are encouraged to request deliveries be left outside and to be cautious when dealing with unknown individuals at their doorstep.</p>
<p>Additionally, the department recommended that investors should discuss financial matters only with individuals they trust and avoid sharing sensitive financial information in public places, where eavesdropping is possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the crypto regulatory landscape in Canada appears to have become stringent as a host of crypto exchanges are exiting the territory. Dubai-based crypto exchange Bybit recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bybit-exit-canada-regulatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> its exit from Canada due to recent regulatory developments in the North American nation. Bybit’s departure from Canada follows shortly after leading crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> made a similar announcement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/aviation-digital-yuan-ticket/">China’s Aviation Authority Approves Digital Yuan for Ticket Purchases</a></p>

<p>China&#8217;s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) has officially <a href="http://www.caacnews.com.cn/2/2/202307/t20230718_1368969.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">approved</a> the digital yuan for purchasing air tickets. The company issued a notice on July 18, 2023, via a blog post.</p>
<p>Spring Airlines was the first aviation company to <a href="https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202104/16/WS60794328a31024ad0bab6188.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">allow payments</a> for its ticket with the digital yuan in 2021. The carrier received 560 yuan for a flight ticket from Shanghai to Shenzhen. Xiamen Airlines soon followed suit in November of the same year. Afterward, Beijing Daxing International Airport and Beijing Capital International Airport also unveiled a digital yuan initiative in 2022. However, widespread use of the asset in the aviation sector did not follow.</p>
<h2>Partnership for Air Tickets</h2>
<p>With the new development, the CAAC is partnering with the China Merchants Bank (CMB) to launch a digital yuan payment platform. The platform is known as the Civil Aviation Ticket Government Procurement Management Platform Application Digital RMB Settlement Mode. While both parties have partnered on multiple projects in the past, this new project will allow digital currency to be used to settle business air tickets. Likewise, passengers can also use the CBDC to access novel services via the platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform brings a new service experience to business passengers and is expected to boost the digital economy. Before the launch, the company noted that it completed the functional testing of the air ticket procurement service system. It also tested the China Merchants Bank’s clearing system. </p>
<h2>Digital Yuan Tests Continue Across Sectors</h2>
<p>China has made significant progress in the development of a CBDC. The PBOC has been testing the digital renminbi across the nation since 2020. Its first major <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/315000-worth-digital-yuan-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deployment</a> of the asset was for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Since then, the bank has been conducting pilot tests across different cities.</p>
<p>The bank has also encouraged the use of digital yuan in the transportation sector. Railway stations, light rail connections, and metro systems have been upgraded around the nation to facilitate smooth transactions with the digital yuan. Elsewhere, the bank partnered with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-offline-payment-digital-yuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">China Telecom and China Unicom</a> to allow offline transactions for the digital yuan via SIM cards. The plan would also allow users to pay for goods and services using the digital yuan, even without a bank account or an Internet connection.</p>
<p>The adoption of the digital yuan by the CAAC is expected to boost the development and innovation of the digital economy in the nation. It should also augment the competitiveness and influence of China&#8217;s aviation sector in the global market.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/trump-man-on-the-moon-nft-nasa/">Melania Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Man on the Moon&#8217; NFT Drop at Odds with NASA Regulations</a></p>
<p>Former United States First Lady Melania Trump’s latest <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> drop “Man on the Moon” has been met with pushback as it appears to be in violation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) merchandising regulations. The limited edition collectible was released on Wednesday, one day before the 54th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission, and features a July 21, 1969 image of astronaut Buzz Aldrin on the moon. The image was captured by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong who is seen as a reflection in Aldrin’s visor.</p>
<p>The $75 collectible places the iconic image in a silver frame with a textured surface that appears to be inspired by the moon’s surface. The bottom of the frame sports a three-dimensional model of the moon while the back features the disembodied text “One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind”. It also includes an embedded audio file that will be &#8220;unlocked&#8221; upon purchase.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

I salute America’s ingenuity and ongoing commitment towards excellence. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USAmemorabilia?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#USAmemorabilia</a> <a href="https://t.co/Kr7hJUC63w">pic.twitter.com/Kr7hJUC63w</a></p>
<p>— MELANIA TRUMP (@MELANIATRUMP) <a href="https://twitter.com/MELANIATRUMP/status/1682148679686168576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></blockquote>
<p>NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/features/Merchandising_Guidelines.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Regulations on Merchandising Requests and Media Usage Guidelines</a> strictly prohibit the use of its intellectual property in NFT. While images that are produced by the agency and in the public domain – like the Buzz Aldrin image – can be used freely, NASA reserves the right to approve or deny requests for their use on merchandise. The regulations state that the agency “does not wish for its images to be used in connection with NFTs” and is &#8220;not approving any merchandising applications&#8221; related to NFTs.</p>
<p>The drop was done in partnership with USA Memorabilia, the “premiere NFT platform featuring United States memorabilia”. It appears that the former first lady and the NFT platform did not consult with the federal agency, hence the conflict.</p>
<p>The drop has sparked conversation online as members of the NFT and crypto community wait to see how the agency will respond. It is unclear if NASA will take legal action against Trump. A NASA attorney is reported to have previously told <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-07-19/nasa-logo-shirts-swimsuits-everything" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The Los Angeles Times</a> that while the agency can send cease-and-desist letters to merchants who overstep its guidelines, it prefers less confrontational means including informal conversations.</p>
<p>Melania Trump, like her husband former US President <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donald Trump</a>, has been an active participant in the NFT space in recent weeks. Last month the former first lady debuted a line of collectibles commemorating pivotal moments in American history with a collection titled the “1776 Collection”.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/opensea-trading-feature-deals/">OpenSea Announces New Trading Feature Dubbed Deals</a></p>
<p>The NFT trading community on OpenSea now will have a new feature to enable P2P trading dubbed Deals. With the new trading feature, the OpenSea NFT trading community can offer a combo of digital artworks and sweeten the deal with Wrapped Ethers (WETH). The NFT marketplace announced that users no longer need to use sketchy DMs and websites to trade their digital artworks since OpenSea Deals provides a seamless platform.</p>
<p>Notably, the OpenSea Deals feature is powered by the Seaport protocol, which was introduced earlier last year. The Seaport protocol is a web3 marketplace project backed by OpenSea that is used for safely and efficiently buying and selling <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a>. Moreover, the Seaport protocol uses open-source core smart contracts, which entail different items including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>, ERC20, ERC721,  and ERC1155.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="474" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Deals: offer your NFTs for theirs, securely on OpenSea.</p>
<p>👉 <a href="https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK">https://t.co/bTciJLUWDK</a> <a href="https://t.co/KR2MLbi7jh">pic.twitter.com/KR2MLbi7jh</a></p>
<p>&mdash; OpenSea (@opensea) <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1682077991029932032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>With the Make a Deal OpenSea feature, users can offer one or more of their NFTs in return for another user’s NFTs. However, the user must first have a wallet address, and an ENS name or basically an OpenSea username for the person intended to make a deal with.</p>
<p>“Similar to Offers, the user accepting the Deal will pay gas. At this time, Deals transactions won’t include the OpenSea fee or any creator earnings. ERC-721 NFTs from badged collections that are visible in a user’s profile (not hidden) are eligible for Deals,” OpenSea <a href="https://support.opensea.io/hc/en-us/articles/18477733878803?_gl=1%2Aotc1ih%2A_ga%2AMzUyMzMwNDc1LjE2ODk5MTg4Mzk.%2A_ga_9VSBF2K4BX%2AMTY4OTkxODgzOS4xLjEuMTY4OTkyMDUxOC4wLjAuMA.." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, OpenSea has been criticized for not being friendly to the community during the crypto bear market. According to Twitter user Aaron (@Aaronsage), the crypto industry currently needs value and not innovation. The Twitter user suggested that OpenSea could have easily launched a crypto token to give back to the community instead of announcing a trading platform since most people are holding their bags in anticipation of future bull rallies.</p>

<h2>OpenSea and Its Market Position</h2>
<p>The OpnSea NFT marketplace has enjoyed significant dominance in the digital artwork industry since its official Launch a few years ago. For instance, OpenSea collected revenue of about $600 million in 2022 despite the cryptocurrency industry battling the bear market effects. Nonetheless, the NFT trading volume has significantly declined as more traders recently moved to more promising digital assets like meme coins.</p>
<p>Consequently, OpenSea has been forced to continue innovating in a bid to remain on top of the NFT marketplace competition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rising use of NFTs in different industries including the luxury sector to eliminate counterfeit products has given OpenSea huge growth prospects. Furthermore, the use of phygital by different blockchains including Shiba Inu, and VeChain has increased the overall NFT traded volume. Additionally, the exponential growth of the metaverse and GameFi industry has given the NFT market more utility away from mere speculation.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-attorneys/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-attorneys/">Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Legal Action from FTX Attorneys</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the former CEO of the now-defunct <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/">FTX</a> crypto exchange is embroiled in a legal battle with his former company’s lawyers.</p>
<p>The attorneys have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/sam-bankman-fried-is-paying-defense-lawyers-with-ftx-funds-lawsuit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> filed a lawsuit in Delaware bankruptcy court, accusing Bankman-Fried and members of his leadership team of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars from FTX and its sister hedge fund, Alameda Research.</p>
<h2>The $10 Million Gift Scandal</h2>
<p>The focal point of the legal battle lies in a transaction involving a substantial $10 million gift to Sam Bankman-Fried’s father, Joe Bankman. While gifting money to family members is not unlawful, this significant transaction, which allegedly occurred around January 2022 has sparked concerns.</p>
<p>FTX attorneys contend that the $10 million gift was essentially a ruse to divert company funds into the personal coffers of the former CEO’s family. The complaint contends that these funds are now being used to pay for Bankman-Fried’s criminal defense expenses, suggesting potential links to criminal activities related to the alleged misappropriation of funds.</p>
<p>In light of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ftx-exchange-files-for-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy</a>, the lawyers for the exchange are determined to recover as much money as possible for the company&#8217;s creditors and investors. The allegations of embezzlement against Bankman-Fried and his leadership team are central to this mission.</p>
<p>Despite mounting questions, a representative for Bankman-Fried has opted not to comment on the matter, leaving stakeholders and the crypto community searching for answers. Should the court find them guilty of these financial misdeeds, they may be ordered to repay the misappropriated funds, along with facing potential fines and penalties.</p>
<h2>The Rise and Fall of FTX</h2>
<p>FTX, founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang, quickly gained recognition as a pioneering crypto exchange. Bankman-Fried’s background in quantitative trading and his reputation as a savvy crypto investor played a significant role in propelling FTX to prominence.</p>
<p>The exchange stood out for its diverse offerings, including perpetual futures contracts, options trading, and other innovative financial products. FTX&#8217;s successful partnerships with renowned sports teams, celebrities, and institutions further solidified its position in the competitive crypto market.</p>
<p>However, the exchange’s success was short-lived, as liquidity dried up and customer withdrawal demands exceeded the company’s capacity. These financial difficulties became insurmountable, prompting FTX to declare bankruptcy late last year.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried faces a slew of criminal allegations, including fraud, bribery, and campaign finance offenses. The allegations point to possible corporate wrongdoing, with Bankman-Fried reportedly engaging in acts that contributed to FTX’s financial instability.</p>
<p>Alongside Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda executives Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Nishad Singh are also named as co-defendants in the case. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried has maintained his innocence throughout the legal proceedings and pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
<p>As the trial is expected to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-criminal-charges-ftx-sbf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commence later this year</a>, the industry will closely monitor the evidence presented and the arguments put forth by both the prosecution and the defense.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-shut-down-crypto-lending/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-shut-down-crypto-lending/">Coinbase Moves to Shut Down Crypto Lending Program</a></p>

<p>An unnamed source has announced that <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> will end its lending program, Coinbase Borrow, over the next few months.</p>
<p>Coinbase Borrow, a program that allowed customers to receive fiat loans of up to $1 million, began in November 2021. According to its website, users could borrow as much as 40% of their Bitcoin holdings at an 8.7% annual interest rate.</p>
<p>However, in May, Coinbase <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-stop-bitcoin-borrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it would no longer allow new loans to be taken. It noted that it took the decision after re-evaluating the product’s prospects. At the same time, it promised that existing loan customers would not be affected. </p>
<h2>Coinbase to Wind Down Its Lending Service in November</h2>
<p>With the current development, loan holders will have until November 20, 2023, to clear their outstanding loan balances. It is unclear how many users this will affect</p>
<p>According to the source,  they “have notified impacted loan holders and are taking extra measures to ensure a smooth transition for them”. This measure includes priority access to customer support through Coinbase One and a four-month loan repayment period.</p>
<p>While Coinbase remains unclear as to its reason, there are indications the shutdown of the product may have been due to low demand. Others suggest that the exchange is simply doubling down on its essentials after attracting scrutiny from the SEC. Recall that the regulator <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-coinbase-unregistered-exchange/">warned</a> Coinbase it could face enforcement action for supposedly offering unregistered securities. Possible targets of the enforcement action are the exchange’s spot wallet service, Coinbase Prime, and its Coinbase wallet.</p>
<h2>Exchange Advocates Update of Financial System</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the crypto exchange has <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/how-embracing-regulation-and-compliance-protects-our-customers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">issued</a> a call for a clearer regulatory framework for crypto in the United States. The company noted that 1 in 5 Americans held crypto while the industry was attracting more interest from institutional investors. A lack of regulation, it said, was pushing Americans towards “unregulated” foreign exchanges.</p>
<p>Coinbase noted that blockchain and crypto had the potential to revolutionize the financial system but the US must stop its regulation-by-enforcement approach. “It’s time to allow for a faster, more affordable, and more transparent system to exist &#8211; that’s the promise of crypto,” it said.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-governance-ventures/">Elon Musk Expanding His Ventures, Facing Scrutiny Over Governance Issues</a></p>
<p>Investors are raising concerns over the multiplying ventures of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a>. Recently, the billionaire <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/elon-musk-ai-company-xai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/xai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xAI</a> – a new company that focuses on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) research and development. As a result, there is a risk of competition between <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tesla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesla Inc</a> (NASDAQ: TSLA) and the new enterprise. Investors are wondering if there will be a devaluation of the EV giant. However, Elon Musk believes that xAI and its focus on AI would bring some value to Tesla.</p>
<p>Elon Musk <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/why-tesla-investors-should-care-about-elon-musks-multiplying-ventures.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There were just some of the world’s best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup but they were not willing to join a large, sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So I was like, OK well, better it’s a startup that I run than they go work somewhere else. That’s kind of the genesis of xAI.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Musk&#8217;s new xAI company aims to &#8220;understand reality&#8221; without any other details or explanation. It is also looking for ways to build an AI that is &#8220;truth-seeking&#8221; and that can &#8220;understand the nature of the universe&#8221;. The company is still in the early stages of bringing its plans to life, but is has already had an impact on competition and innovation in the field. It will definitely lead to advancements in AI technologies and applications, benefiting various industries. Besides, the launch of xAI will result in exploring alternative research directions and approaches.</p>
<p>As Musk has stated, xAI will compete with Google Bard and OpenAI’s ChatGPT in the future. Besides, xAI is planning to collaborate with Tesla on software and silicon alike.</p>
<h2>Governance Issues</h2>
<p>Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren called the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) for investigating Tesla and its board of directors to determine if they violated securities laws after Elon Musk took over Twitter. As Elizabeth Warren stated in a letter to SEC, Musk&#8217;s responsibilities &#8220;have raised concerns about conflicts of interest, misappropriation of corporate assets, and other negative impacts to Tesla shareholders&#8221;. In particular, Warren found funneling Tesla resources into Musk’s Twitter takeover, conflicts of interest regarding advertising from other car companies, and possible labor law violations when conducting transfers of some Tesla employees to Twitter. Besides, Tesla’s board had not informed shareholders properly about the ways that the two companies have worked together, or might work together.</p>
<p>Back in May, Tesla face a similar issue, when a group of 17 investors who hold a total of $1.5 billion of Tesla stock raised concern that Tesla&#8217;s board of directors was &#8220;failing to adequately represent the interests of Tesla&#8217;s shareholders&#8221;. At that time, pension funds and other institutional investors urged Tesla&#8217;s board to improve corporate governance and oversee Elon Musk&#8217;s actions. Seems that things have not really improved since then, therefore, SEC Chair Gary Gensler got a letter from Elizabeth Warren.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ceo-caroline-ellison-alameda-research/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ceo-caroline-ellison-alameda-research/">Former CEO Caroline Ellison Reportedly Felt Ill-Suited to Run Alameda Research</a></p>
<p>Former Alameda  Research CEO Caroline Ellison has revealed that she did not feel well suited to leading the hedge fund. This is according to a Thursday <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">New York Post article</a> citing the former exec’s diary. Ellison was in December charged with fraud in relation to the November collapse of Alameda’s sister company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ftx-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Ellison, who was romantically linked to then FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, has been named a key witness in the former’s October trial. She was hand-picked by Bankman-Fried, known in crypto circles as SBF, to run the hedge fund. According to the report, the day that the leading crypto exchange collapsed, Ellison made a diary entry that said it “feels great”. Ellison wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Running Alameda doesn’t feel like something I’m that comparatively advantaged at or well suited to do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ellison’s Alameda Research was implicated in the FTX collapse because of the intermingling of funds between the companies. New FTX CEO John J Ray has stated that Alameda had access to FTX customer assets and could use them for its own purposes without proper oversight. According to Ray, whose previous experience includes helping manage Enron after the energy trader&#8217;s 2001 bankruptcy –  FTX’s failure was caused by “a very small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals”.</p>
<h2>FTX Sues Former  Executives in Bid to Recoup $1 Billion</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the bankrupt crypto exchange is suing former executives in a bid to recover $1 billion that they allegedly misappropriated. The complaint, filed in Delaware bankruptcy court names <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/sam-bankman-fried/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, Caroline Ellison, former FTX technology chief Zixiao &#8220;Gary&#8221; Wang, and former FTX engineering director Nishad Singh. The suit alleges that the group used company funds to bankroll luxury accommodations, political donations, speculative investments, and other &#8220;pet projects&#8221;, all the while committing &#8220;one of the largest financial frauds in history&#8221;.</p>
<p>SBF is facing several criminal charges and has pleaded not guilty while Ellison, Wang, and Singh have pleaded guilty and agreed to assist prosecutors. According to the complaint by FTX, the illicit transfers include over $750 million of equity that FTX and SBF-controlled West Realm Shires awarded &#8220;without receiving any value in exchange&#8221;. A further $546 million was used by SBF and Wang to buy Robinhood Markets share while Ellison paid herself bonuses amounting to $28.8 million. The funds were allegedly misappropriated between February 2020 and November 2022. The complaint states that according to the US bankruptcy code, the transfers can be undone.<a class="infinscroll_next_page_link" style="display:none" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/united-kingdom-crypto-firms-fca/" rel="prev">next</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/united-kingdom-crypto-firms-fca/">United Kingdom Wants Crypto Firms to Be More Responsible as FCA Seeks More Regulatory Powers</a></p>
<p>The United Kingdom&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is currently formulating a new set of requirements for crypto-based firms in the region. According to the regulator, it might no longer suffice that a firm has cleared anti-money laundering requirements and obtained an operational license.</p>
<p>So, to this end, the FCA is seeking to create new rules that will foster prudence among crypto firms. The FCA revealed the plans in its annual <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/financial-watchdog-cracks-down-problem-firms-and-supports-struggling-borrowers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> which was published Thursday.</p>
<p>However, the FCA also noted that the new prudential rules it intends to float will only come to light when the Treasury and Parliament eventually bring those activities under its regulatory authority.</p>
<p>As of publication, what timeline the FCA will receive this regulatory power remains unclear.</p>
<h2>United Kingdom Eyes Becoming a Global Crypto Hub</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the FCA has already put a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/multi-firm-reviews/ifpr-implementation-observations#:~:text=The%20Investment%20Firms%20Prudential%20Regime%20(IFPR)%20is%20the%20new%20prudential,began%20on%201%20January%202022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prudential regime</a> in place for investment firms. That includes asset managers, trading firms, and even fund managers spread across the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The regime requires first that firms make certain that they have enough capital. Then, they identify risks to their business and show proof of adequate reserves to mitigate harm.</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the FCA has been warning firms that are linked with crypto to be cautious in their business dealings. That includes those with direct or indirect exposure to crypto. And as a fact, the regulator <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/fca-crypto-financial-scam-uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">issued</a> a warning statement to such firms last year, asking them to &#8220;have appropriate systems and controls to counter the risk of being misused for financial crime&#8221;.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the FCA has just been saddled with some new regulatory powers under a recently passed financial markets bill. And as it stands, the regulator might well be on the way to becoming the country&#8217;s key watchdog. That is as far as crypto is concerned.</p>
