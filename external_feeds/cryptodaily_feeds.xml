			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto data firm Arkham Intelligence is under fire after privacy-conscious users discovered that the firm has been irresponsible about user data.&nbsp;</p>
Arkham&rsquo;s Privacy Problem
<p>It is never a good idea to be negligent with customer data, especially in the crypto and blockchain space, where users value their security and privacy above everything else. Looks like crypto data firm Arkham Intelligence has learned this the hard way. The company committed multiple gaffes when it revealed its latest service that would uncover the identities of digital wallet owners. Privacy-conscious crypto advocates rose up in arms about this new service when they realized the firm had already been inadvertently leaking private customer information through its referral program.&nbsp;</p>
Faulty Referral Program Doxxed User Emails
<p>Under this program, users could invite others to the Arkham platform by sharing a unique referral URL. At quick glance, these URLs appeared to be a random string of characters. But under deeper inspection, it was uncovered that they could be easily deciphered to reveal the user&rsquo;s email address, encrypted with Base64.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company&rsquo;s biggest product allows tracking crypto transactions and identification of wallet owners. Its latest product, &ldquo;Intel Exchange,&rdquo; has raised even more eyebrows in the privacy-focused corners of the cryptoverse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The uncovering of the weblink slip-up has already added to the company&rsquo;s reputation of not following a more privacy-focused approach in its services and operations.&nbsp;</p>
M4gicpotato Comments On Privacy Breach
<p>A privacy advocate known as m4gicpotato, who has been involved in crypto under various aliases since 2017 and is a contributor to the privacy blockchain Beam, shed light on the matter via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All Arkham referral links shared on Twitter is doxxing everyone because the email is in the referral URL.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The post quickly gained viral attention, with m4gicpotato expressing concerns about the infringement on user privacy. They have also criticized Arkham's decision to encode user emails using Base64, emphasizing that this additional layer of obfuscation compounded the privacy concerns surrounding the company.</p>
<p>The full extent of the number of affected users remains unclear. In theory, anyone who generated and shared a referral link may have inadvertently disclosed their email address. Some users even posted their links on Twitter, further exacerbating the potential privacy risks.</p>
CEO Responds
<p>The company&rsquo;s CEO, Miguel Morel, responded to the controversy, claiming that the coding of the referral program was done in this manner in the beta stage to allow Arkham to identify and reward users who were referring others. He claimed that the change has already been made to the code to encrypt user email properly to prevent reverse engineering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our industry has been plagued with bad actors who survive by hiding in the shadows. Crypto intelligence brings them into the light, and that&rsquo;s what our platform and our research have always done.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">In this article, we&rsquo;ll be highlighting three remarkable crypto projects that are expected to make waves in the upcoming bull run - according to crypto analysts. Delve into the world of futuristic investments with InQubeta, the crypto crowdfunding platform transforming AI startup investments. </p>
<p class="s3">Additionally, explore the dynamic potential of Ethereum, the pioneering smart contract platform, and Polkadot, the creative multi-chain ecosystem, as they emerge as the top contenders in the competitive realm of blockchain technology. </p>
InQubeta: Taking AI Startup Investment To The Next Level
<p class="s3">A lot of investors are tired of the same opportunities and want to add some excitement to their portfolio, now, they need to look no further than InQubeta. InQubeta is not an average crypto crowdfunding platform - it&rsquo;s here to shake the space up. This project proves that traditional investment methods can be a thing of the past, as the world's first crypto crowdfunding platform that enables fractional investment in AI startups using $QUBE tokens is introduced.</p>
<p class="s3">With InQubeta, individuals can dive into the world of AI startups and invest in a manner that suits their budget. The NFT marketplace of InQubeta is buzzing with opportunities where AI startups raise funds and offer reward and equity-based NFTs. The intriguing aspect is that each investment opportunity is minted into an NFT and fractionalized, allowing individuals to participate without incurring significant costs.</p>
<p class="s3">InQubeta has even taken things a step further with their deflationary ERC20 token, $QUBE. This is not just an ordinary token; it is a deflationary currency that becomes even more valuable over time. A 2% tax on all buy and sell transactions is directed to a burn wallet, resulting in the token becoming scarcer. Additionally, a 5% sell tax is allocated to a dedicated reward pool, providing an opportunity for individuals to earn rewards by staking their tokens. InQubeta offers a project that holds great potential, and AI fans should definitely take note.</p>
<p></p>
Ethereum: Unleashing the Power of Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications
<p class="s3">When it comes to blockchain platforms, Ethereum stands tall as the original pioneer and a force to be reckoned with. Born in 2015, Ethereum introduced the concept of smart contracts, which transformed the way transactions are executed on the blockchain. This decentralized platform allows developers to build and deploy their own applications without relying on intermediaries, offering a level of transparency and security that traditional systems can only dream of.</p>
<p class="s3">One of Ethereum's major strengths lies in its vast network and active community. Developers from all corners of the world have flocked to Ethereum, creating a vibrant ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and inventive dApps that cover a wide range of industries. This rich ecosystem has solidified Ethereum's position as the go-to platform for creating and launching new tokens, conducting initial coin offerings (ICOs), and experimenting with novel financial instruments.</p>
<p class="s3">Scalability has been a challenge for Ethereum, as increased usage has resulted in network congestion and high fees. However, Ethereum is addressing these issues through the implementation of Ethereum 2.0, a major upgrade that introduces a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Stake (PoS) and shard chains. This upgrade aims to significantly enhance scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making Ethereum even more robust and attractive to developers and users alike.</p>
Polkadot: Unlocking a New Era of Blockchain Interoperability and Scalability
<p class="s3">Polkadot emerges as a remarkable project that seeks to bridge the gap between different blockchains. Founded by one of Ethereum's co-founders, Polkadot introduces a multi-chain framework that enables interoperability, allowing various blockchains to perfectly communicate and share information with each other.</p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot's architecture revolves around a relay chain that serves as the heart of the network, coordinating communication and consensus between connected blockchains, known as parachains. These parachains operate independently, each with its own unique features, governance models, and specialized functionalities. This modular approach provides flexibility and scalability, as new parachains can be added without disrupting the entire network.</p>
<p class="s3">By facilitating interoperability, Polkadot opens up a world of possibilities for cross-chain applications and collaborations. Developers can create decentralized applications that can interact with multiple blockchains, harnessing the strengths and features of each chain to enhance functionality and efficiency. This interoperability also paves the way for secure asset transfer between different chains, enabling new use cases and driving invention in areas such as decentralized finance, supply chain management, and gaming.</p>
<p class="s3">Polkadot's governance model, based on on-chain voting and a nominated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, ensures that decisions regarding network upgrades and the addition of new parachains are made in a transparent and decentralized manner. This community-driven approach fosters inclusivity and empowers stakeholders to actively participate in shaping the future of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p>
Conclusion
<p class="s3">Respected crypto analysts recognize the immense potential of these projects and believe they are well-positioned to thrive in the evolving crypto landscape. As the market gears up for the next bull run, investors should pay close attention to InQubeta, Ethereum, and Polkadot, as they represent exciting opportunities for growth and creativity in the crypto space.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A newly released survey and report from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) claims if widely used, cryptoassets and stablecoins may threaten financial stability. </p>
<p>The BIS published a new survey and report detailing the state of global CBDC (central bank digital currency) adoption and central banks&rsquo; view and plans regarding CBDCs.</p>
Almost 25% of Central Banks are Piloting Retail CBDCs
<p>The report, entitled &ldquo;Making Headway &ndash; Results of the 2022 BIS Survey on central bank digital currencies and Crypto,&rdquo; finds the number of central banks planning on launching CBDC in the near future has doubled since the previous year, despite the chaos in the market.</p>
<p>In its report, the BIS, however, warned of the risks of using cryptoassets for payments. It said:</p>

<p>If widely used for payments, cryptoassets, including stablecoins, may constitute a threat to financial stability.</p>

<p>While accepting the reality of widespread CBDC introduction, the BIS and other global regulators will issue guidelines to mitigate the danger it associates with the industry. The BIS explained:</p>

<p>To strengthen and coordinate regulatory approaches to contain their risks to the financial system, the CPMI, IOSCO, FSB and BCBS published updated or new guidance and standards for stablecoins or crypto activities and markets more broadly.</p>

<p>Through its research, the BIS found that almost a quarter of all central banks are currently piloting retail CBDCs. The BIS expects over two dozen such state-backed digital currencies to roll out by the decade&rsquo;s end. &nbsp;</p>
BIS Expects 15 Retail, Nine Wholesale CBDCs To Launch
<p>CBDCs have already been issued by Nigeria, the Bahamas, Jamaica, and parts of the Caribbean, and according to the survey, those regions will soon be joined by several other territories.</p>
<p>The report explains that work on retail CBDCs is more advanced than wholesale CBDCs.</p>
<p>The BIS report reads:</p>

<p>Work on retail CBDC is more advanced than on wholesale CBDC: almost a quarter of central banks are piloting a retail CBDC. More than 80% of central banks see potential value in having both a retail CBDC and a fast payment system, mostly because a retail CBDC has specific properties and may offer additional features.</p>

<p>The BIS expects that by the end of 2030, 15 retail CBDCs, and nine wholesale CBDCs will be circulated in established and emerging economies.</p>
<p>According to the report, 60% of surveyed central banks explained the arrival and rise of stablecoins had accelerated their development of CBDCs.</p>
2022 Crypto-Chaos Leaves Central Banks Divided
<p>2022&rsquo;s market spiral, however, did not convince all central banks of the necessity of CBDCs.</p>
<p>The report find that while 93% of all central banks are exploring CBDCs in some way, an increasing number of those banks expressed with greater conviction that they would not issue a state-backed digital currency soon.</p>
<p>The report states:</p>

<p>A clear divergence has emerged: compared to last year, some central banks have become more likely to issue a CBDC within the next three years, while others indicated to be less likely to do so.</p>

BIS Backs Tokenisation, But Says Crypto is a &ldquo;Flawed System&rdquo;
<p>The BIS, considered by many as the central bank of central banks, recently released its plan for a global &ldquo;unified ledger&rdquo; that would support CBDCs and tokenized assets.</p>
<p>According to the organization, tokenization offers a &ldquo;major leap&rdquo; in the financial system, calling it &ldquo;the next logical step.&rdquo; While it advocated for a centralized approach to the future of the monetary system, it dismissed decentralized cryptocurrencies as a &ldquo;flawed system.&rdquo; It said:</p>

<p>Crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) have offered a glimpse of tokenization&rsquo;s promise, but crypto is a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money.</p>

<p>Moreover, the BIS argued that &ldquo;crypto has collapsed&rdquo;, and the successful use of tokenization relies on the trust provided by central banks.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security and analytics firm Chainalysis has suggested that the multimillion-dollar exploit of the Multichain Protocol could be indicative of a rug pull.&nbsp;</p>
Multimillion Dollar Exploit Was Inside Job?&nbsp;
<p>The cross-chain bridge protocol Multichain has fallen victim to a multimillion-dollar exploit that Chainalysis believes is an inside job. The incident, which took place on July 6, 2023, involved unauthorized withdrawals of an unusually large scale and resulted in a staggering loss of around $130 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The aftermath of this exploit has left the blockchain community stunned, as Multichain was once regarded as a promising cross-chain bridge protocol. However, with the suspicion of an inside job, questions arise regarding the integrity and security practices within the organization.</p>
Hacker Seized MPC Keys&nbsp;
<p>Chainalysis expressed its suspicions in its July 10th blog post calling the situation &ldquo;a hack or rug pull by insiders.&rdquo; This aligns with the prior claims made by blockchain security firm SlowMist, which also raised the possibility of internal involvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latter tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears that activity has stopped. However, with multiple bridges all being drained, this looks more like a hack or rug pull and less like a migration. Please do not use and revoke all permission related to Multichain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Explaining the technical aspects of Multichain's smart contracts, Chainalysis highlighted their use of a multiparty computation (MPC) system, much like a multisignature wallet. The firm suggested that the attacker might have gained control of Multichain's MPC keys to orchestrate this exploit. While acknowledging the chance of external hackers obtaining the keys, experts and analysts are leaning toward an inside job or rug pull due to recent questionable incidents surrounding the protocol.</p>
Shady Incidents At Multichain
<p>One prominent example of these incidents happened toward the end of May, when the protocol&rsquo;s CEO, &ldquo;Zhaojun&rdquo; went missing. There was immediate speculation that Chinese authorities had arrested him.</p>
<p>Additionally, the platform suffered from delayed transactions and various technical problems, leading Binance to withdraw its support for several bridged tokens on July 7.</p>
<p>As the investigation unfolds, blockchain analysts have uncovered further dubious token movements associated with Multichain. These abnormal outflows included draining token addresses across multiple chains through the Multichain executor address.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on July 8, stablecoin issuers Circle and Tether took swift action by freezing over $65 million in assets linked to the Multichain exploit. Also, the fact that the exploiter did not bother swapping out the centrally controlled assets like USDC, which can be easily frozen by the issuing company, just adds to the dubious nature of the entire situation.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Jay Clayton, former Head of the SEC, says that there are now no reasons why a Spot Bitcoin ETF should not be approved.</p>
<p>The ex-chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission was interviewed on CNBC Squawk Box on Monday and gave his views on the long-running saga of the SEC and Spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>In order to give the whole picture of ETFs for Bitcoin, Clayton started by giving his thoughts on the first Bitcoin ETF filings back in 2015/16, when he believed that things were very different to what they are today. He mused on his thoughts at that time:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is an offshore, retail, nothing close to what I would say the core of our financial markets. At that time, if you look at trading of bitcoin, the emergence of bitcoin, it looked like stocks, but it was not anything like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, since that time, he admitted that things had changed drastically to the point that blue chip companies such as Blackrock were willing to back it. He commented:</p>

<p>&ldquo;companies whose reputation in the market matters are saying &lsquo;you know what, we think that trading, we think that the custody, we think that those protections around this market are sufficient, that we are willing to put our name on it&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In Clayton&rsquo;s view this was an &ldquo;incredible development&rdquo; and not one that he had expected. He had always been &ldquo;sceptical&rdquo; of bitcoin and said that studies had showed &ldquo;90% wash trading, manipulation&rdquo; and people &ldquo;dumping&rdquo;.</p>
<p>However, for him, what had really changed was when companies that &ldquo;know the markets better than anybody&rdquo; had moved into the space and had said that they are &ldquo;willing to put their reputation behind it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On being asked if he thought that a Spot ETF should now be approved, Clayton said that when a Futures ETF had been approved, the protections for the investor had been in place, but this hadn&rsquo;t been the case for a Spot ETF. Now though, he says that institutions have been arguing that the protections for a Spot ETF are there, and that it is actually &ldquo;more efficient and less drag&rdquo; for the investor than the Futures ETF.</p>
<p>When pressed on when he thought a Spot ETF might be approved, Clayton said that it would need to go through the regulatory process but if it was proved to have &ldquo;similar efficacy&rdquo; to a Futures ETF then it would be &ldquo;hard to resist approval&rdquo;.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks&rsquo; Web3 loyalty program Odyssey has announced a collaboration with the Aku non-fungible token (NFT) collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration will see the next Starbucks Odyssey Journey feature a stamp &ldquo;designed by Aku&rdquo; and a donation to a non-profit.&nbsp;</p>
The Starbucks-Aku Collaboration&nbsp;
<p>Starbucks has collaborated with the Aku NFT collection for its next digital collectible Stamp, available on its dedicated Discord channel. The Aku NFT collection was created by former Major League Baseball player Micah Johnson and focuses on empowering young kids to dream big and pursue their dreams. The collection has attracted interest from several high-profile celebrities, with NFTs from the collection having been purchased by Pusha T, Trevor Noah, and Tyra Banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Micah Johnson thanked Starbucks for their support, tweeting on his official Twitter handle,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely grateful to @Starbucks for supporting our mission to not just be a character that represents good but a character that actually does good.&rdquo;</p>

The New Journey&nbsp;
<p>Starbucks plans to launch the new Journey on the 17th of July. The new Journey, called &ldquo;Aku Adventure,&rdquo; will allow Odyssey members to &ldquo;embark on a new mission with Aku.&rdquo; A post on the Discord channel states that the new Stamp has been &ldquo;designed by Aku,&rdquo; and the Journey will be available exclusively to Odyssey members until the 13th of August, 2023. Additionally, as part of the launch, Starbucks has also announced that it would be donating $100,000 to Blessings in a Backpack, a non-profit dedicated to addressing food insecurity among children.&nbsp;</p>
The Odyssey Program&nbsp;
<p>Starbucks had launched its highly anticipated Odyssey program in December 2022, combining customer loyalty rewards with NFTs and other gamified elements. The Web3 extension of the hugely popular Starbucks Rewards Program was opened to a select group of waitlist members which included customers and existing employees. Those joining the program could engage in interactive &ldquo;Journeys&rdquo; and earn &ldquo;Journey Stamps,&rdquo; which came in the form of Polygon-based NFTs. Users could also collect Odyssey Points and gain access to new benefits and experiences in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of launch, the company had released a statement which said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Starbucks Odyssey is an experience surrounded by a digital community where members can come together, interact, and share their love of coffee. Starbucks is using meaningful elements of Web3 technology to reward members in innovative ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company has been rolling out limited-edition NFTs to the members of the invitation-only Odyssey loyalty program for a considerable amount of time. Back in March, the company announced the release of &ldquo;The Siren Collection,&rdquo; which offered 2000 Stamps, each priced at $100. The Siren Collection saw staggering demand, with collectors complaining of a wave of technical glitches and long wait times. More recently, Starbucks launched the &ldquo;Starbucks First Store Collection.&rdquo; The collection consisted of 5000 stamps, each priced at $99. This launch had a far smoother launch than the Siren Collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CMO Bradley Brewer stated that Starbucks wanted to invest in blockchain for a considerable amount of time but was waiting for a concrete way of using the technology to help expand its business and loyalty program. According to Brewer, the company wanted to make NFTs the gateway to the digital community but obscured the exact nature of the technology to bring more users to the Web3 platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It happens to be built on blockchain and web3 technologies, but the customer &mdash; to be honest &mdash; may very well not even know that what they&rsquo;re doing is interacting with blockchain technology. It&rsquo;s just the enabler.&rdquo;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Starbucks&rsquo; Web3 loyalty program Odyssey has announced a collaboration with the Aku non-fungible token (NFT) collection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration will see the next Starbucks Odyssey Journey feature a stamp &ldquo;designed by Aku&rdquo; and a donation to a non-profit.&nbsp;</p>
The Starbucks-Aku Collaboration&nbsp;
<p>Starbucks has collaborated with the Aku NFT collection for its next digital collectible Stamp, available on its dedicated Discord channel. The Aku NFT collection was created by former Major League Baseball player Micah Johnson and focuses on empowering young kids to dream big and pursue their dreams. The collection has attracted interest from several high-profile celebrities, with NFTs from the collection having been purchased by Pusha T, Trevor Noah, and Tyra Banks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Micah Johnson thanked Starbucks for their support, tweeting on his official Twitter handle,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m extremely grateful to @Starbucks for supporting our mission to not just be a character that represents good but a character that actually does good.&rdquo;</p>

The New Journey&nbsp;
<p>Starbucks plans to launch the new Journey on the 17th of July. The new Journey, called &ldquo;Aku Adventure,&rdquo; will allow Odyssey members to &ldquo;embark on a new mission with Aku.&rdquo; A post on the Discord channel states that the new Stamp has been &ldquo;designed by Aku,&rdquo; and the Journey will be available exclusively to Odyssey members until the 13th of August, 2023. Additionally, as part of the launch, Starbucks has also announced that it would be donating $100,000 to Blessings in a Backpack, a non-profit dedicated to addressing food insecurity among children.&nbsp;</p>
The Odyssey Program&nbsp;
<p>Starbucks had launched its highly anticipated Odyssey program in December 2022, combining customer loyalty rewards with NFTs and other gamified elements. The Web3 extension of the hugely popular Starbucks Rewards Program was opened to a select group of waitlist members which included customers and existing employees. Those joining the program could engage in interactive &ldquo;Journeys&rdquo; and earn &ldquo;Journey Stamps,&rdquo; which came in the form of Polygon-based NFTs.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Grayscale Investments has sent a letter to the US Court of Appeal, demanding to know how the SEC can allow a leveraged 2x Bitcoin ETF to be approved but not a spot Bitcoin ETF. </p>
<p>A lawyer for Grayscale Investments sent a letter to a US Circuit Court, questioning the SEC&rsquo;s refusal to allow Grayscale&rsquo;s Bitcoin ETF (exchange-traded fund) to trade.</p>
<p>On Monday, Donald B Verilli, Jnr. sent a letter to Judge Mark Langer of the US Court of Appeals, pointing out that the US SEC has allowed Volatility Shares&rsquo; 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) to trade.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today, our attorneys filed a letter with the DC Circuit highlighting the disparity between the SEC&rsquo;s approval of a leveraged #bitcoin futures ETF while continuing to deny approval of spot bitcoin ETFs like $GBTC. Let&rsquo;s dive deeper. 🧵/6 pic.twitter.com/z7WyGBthhT</p>

<p>

</p>
Grayscale Applies for Spot Bitcoin ETF
<p>Verilli&rsquo;s questions come after Grayscale applied to convert its spot Bitcoin Trust into a spot Bitcoin ETF, to which the SEC answered no.</p>
<p>Grayscale believes that BITX is a riskier product than the one regulators refuse to approve and poses the question about the rationality behind allowing the trade of a riskier product but refusing the trade of a safer one.</p>
Grayscale Questions Why Riskier Products Receive Regulatory Approval
<p>In the letter, Verilli argued:</p>

<p>It exposes investors to an even riskier investment product than the traditional bitcoin futures exchange-traded products . . . which encompass risks related to both the futures and spot bitcoin markets.</p>

<p>He noted that the 2X Bitcoin Strategy ETF seeks to double the performance of the S&amp;P CME Bitcoin Futures Daily Roll Index every day and highlighted that it is leveraged.</p>
<p>Verilli further quoted BITX&rsquo;s registration statement, which clarifies that the product may lead to massive losses if left in the hands of those who do not have enough knowledge about it. In its stamen, BITX&rsquo;s conceded its product is suitable for &ldquo;knowledgeable investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verilli also argued that approving the Volatility Shares ETF contradicts the SEC&rsquo;s view against any fund dealing with the spot market.</p>
<p>He wrote:</p>

<p>The fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot Bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs.</p>

SEC&rsquo;s Arguments Lack Consistency
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s refusal of Grayscale&rsquo;s application rested on the argument it lacked an appropriate plan to monitor the impact on spot prices stemming from fraud and market manipulation. Grayscale rejected the SEC&rsquo;s statement by saying futures prices themselves are drawn from spot markets.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s rejection of the Volatility Shares ETF shows the agency&rsquo;s inconsistency. Verilli argued in his letter that by dealing with futures markets using leverage to achieve larger returns, the fund exposes investors to higher risk than a spot or traditional ETF would. Mr Verilli claims his argument should invalidate the SEC&rsquo;s reason for rejecting Grayscale&rsquo;s filing.</p>
<p>Verilli stated:</p>

<p>While the commission could theoretically correct its discriminatory treatment of spot bitcoin ETPs by rescinding its approval of all Bitcoin-based ETPs, the Commission&rsquo;s apparent willingness to permit even a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP&mdash;a particularly high-risk version of a Bitcoin futures product&mdash;makes clear [it] has no intention of doing so.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Six members of the United States Congress have called on the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate crypto firm Prometheum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The members have alleged that the firm has close ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).&nbsp;</p>
Republicans Step Up Attack On Prometheum&nbsp;
<p>The Republican members of Congress stated that the firm&rsquo;s co-CEO, Aaron Kaplan, may have potentially given false testimony during a Jun. 13 hearing on regulatory clarity in the crypto space. They also alleged that the company may have violated securities laws. The lawmakers stated in a letter written on Jul. 10, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We write to express great concern that Prometheum Inc. (Prometheum) may have provided false testimony to Congress or violated United States securities laws.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawmakers further claimed that Prometheum was connected with investors that had close ties with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain and HashKey Digital Asset Group. The group of lawmakers, led by Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville, called on Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and Attorney General Merrick Garland to look into the matter. Apart from Tuberville, the letter was signed by Laine Luetkemeyer, R-Miss., Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., Ralph Norman, R-S.C., Byron Donalds, R-Flor., and Mark Alford, R-Missouri.</p>
What Did Kaplan Say?&nbsp;
<p>On Jun. 13, Kaplan, the co-founder, and co-CEO of Prometheum, appeared before the US House to discuss regulatory clarity in the crypto space. During the hearing, Kaplan had argued that multiple frameworks put out by the Securities and Exchange Commission had laid out a clear path for crypto firms operating in the United States. Kaplan went so far as to call the Securities and Exchange Commission &ldquo;the most capable financial markets regulatory agency in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, what caught the attention of Republican lawmakers were allegations that the company had links with the Chinese Communist Party. Tuberville alleged that Kaplan, during his testimony, had said that Prometheum was developed independently of Wanxiang and HashKey. Kaplan stated in his testimony,&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In December 2018, as part of the investment from Hashkey into Prometheum, Prometheum, and Wanxiang agreed to jointly develop a blockchain trading system. Thereafter, in approximately one (1) year, it became clear to Prometheum that joint development was not viable. Upon such realization, Prometheum started to independently develop its own platform. All servers, code, data, and proprietary technology were created independently of Wanxiang and its affiliates. Prometheum does not use any resource, code, or other assets from Wanxiang or its affiliates in any of its systems."</p>

<p>According to Kaplan, Prometheum terminated all strategic relationships with Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain in October 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prometheum formally terminated all co-development work and strategic relationships with Shanghai Wanxiang Blockchain and its affiliates in October 2021 in an Omnibus Agreement, which was filed with the SEC in November 2021.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, lawmakers alleged that this contradicted the information that the firm had provided in filings with the SEC, stating that Prometheum still relied on the HashKey partnership, as shown by the SEC filings from 2020-2021. Furthermore, they questioned why Prometheum did not make clear in the filings that the company was developing its own technology platform, entirely independent of its Chinese partners.</p>
<p>The senators have yet to give the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice a deadline to respond but have said they hope to hear from them soon.&nbsp;</p>
Prometheum Responds&nbsp;
<p>While Kaplan has not commented on the developments so far, a Jun. 23 op-ed by Kaplan and co-CEO Benjamin Kaplan has claimed that Tuberville&rsquo;s concerns regarding Prometheum and its alleged ties to China were without merit and relied on old information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We formally terminated all co-development work and strategic relationships with Wanxiang and its affiliates on Oct. 21, 2021. Prometheum has severed all intellectual property and technology ties to Wanxiang, giving it and its affiliates no access to any information that could expose the U.S. or its citizens to risk.&rdquo;</p>

Concerns About China
<p>Republican lawyers have consistently raised concerns about companies having ties with China-based entities or its government when it came to laws and regulations regarding digital assets. Minnesota Rep Tom Emmer and Former Senator Pat Toomey had issued warnings about the use of China&rsquo;s Digital Yuan during the Beijing Winter Olympics. The current letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice comes a month after Tuberville brought forward a bill to ban companies from China from acquiring a stake in American digital asset companies. The bill was co-sponsored by Sen. Kristen Gillibrand, D-N.Y.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Despite the promise of a bullish season, the crypto market has persisted with a bearish trend, causing many tokens to experience huge reductions in their total market capitalizations. Hence, tokens like Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) struggle to stay in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx has breezed through many successful presale stages, rapidly selling out and reaching new heights daily.</p>
Stacks (STX) Launches Stacks 2.1
<p class="s5">Stacks (STX) aims to create a more secure, decentralized internet owned by users. The Layer-2 blockchain provides a scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications (dApps) and performing decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Stacks (STX) platform improves the base protocol by introducing smart contract functionality for Bitcoin (BTC) users. Furthermore, it enables users to create and trade valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on popular digital marketplaces.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, Stacks (STX) also provides the underbanked access to vital financial services, like micropayments and loans, without interference from governments or other intermediaries.</p>
<p class="s5">The blockchain recently released a significant upgrade in March 2023. Stacks (STX) launched the Stacks 2.1 upgrade to improve the speed and volume of DeFi transactions. The launch caused the STX token's price to surge 14% in less than 24hrs, reaching $1.27.</p>
<p class="s5">However, the token has steadily declined since March after reaching more than $1.5. STX stayed at $0.9 since April but has now fallen even more, trading at $0.6 currently.</p>
Stellar (XLM) Partners With Anchain.ai
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payment system based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The blockchain enables the exchange of traditional crypto coins and fiat money across international borders.</p>
<p class="s5">Furthermore, Stellar (XLM) recently partnered with an AI-powered security company, Anchain.ai. This integration is aimed at enhancing cross-border payment security. Stellar (XLM) seeks to provide more accessible security tools to create a secure developer ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s5">The XLM token has been on a constant decline since March after it reached $0.13. The coin took a significant fall to settle at $0.7 in April.</p>
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) is experiencing a decline in Q2 2023, making only very minuscule backward and forward leaps. The XLM token has been stuck in the $0.8 range since last week. Holders are looking wide-eyed for appreciation, while investors are watching and wondering if now would be an excellent time to get in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">However, experts are predicting an exaggerated dip, even with the steadiness of the token.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale Is Breaking New Heights
<p class="s5">This new crypto project focuses on the freelancer economy. With freelancing becoming widely adopted, even by big companies like Google, the project is on the right track. The project has undergone vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network to ensure transparency.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to provide a secure, fast, and accessible platform for freelancers and their clients. Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other freelancing platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, charge 10%-20%.</p>
<p class="s5">The project is in its fifth funding stage and has a 72.5 million token allocation, with WERX priced at $0.0315 per token. The total presale token allocation increased to 57% from 45%, creating more opportunities for early supporters. The hard cap presale will occur on 31st July 2023.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx recently announced preparations to transition to the Beta version to enable users to start testing. The Alpha version of the platform was launched last week. The launch came with Landing Page and Sign-Up Page. However, the platform has been recently updated with more pages, including the Login, Forgot Password, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process, My Activity, and Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step Of Finding Talent pages. Users can also send helpful feedback to Uwerx through an email, feedback@uwerx.network.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Despite the promise of a bullish season, the crypto market has persisted with a bearish trend, causing many tokens to experience huge reductions in their total market capitalizations. Hence, tokens like Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) struggle to stay in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx has breezed through many successful presale stages, rapidly selling out and reaching new heights daily.</p>
Stacks (STX) Launches Stacks 2.1
<p class="s5">Stacks (STX) aims to create a more secure, decentralized internet owned by users. The Layer-2 blockchain provides a scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications (dApps) and performing decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions on the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Stacks (STX) platform improves the base protocol by introducing smart contract functionality for Bitcoin (BTC) users. Furthermore, it enables users to create and trade valuable non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on popular digital marketplaces.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, Stacks (STX) also provides the underbanked access to vital financial services, like micropayments and loans, without interference from governments or other intermediaries.</p>
<p class="s5">The blockchain recently released a significant upgrade in March 2023. Stacks (STX) launched the Stacks 2.1 upgrade to improve the speed and volume of DeFi transactions. The launch caused the STX token's price to surge 14% in less than 24hrs, reaching $1.27.</p>
<p class="s5">However, the token has steadily declined since March after reaching more than $1.5. STX stayed at $0.9 since April but has now fallen even more, trading at $0.6 currently.</p>
Stellar (XLM) Partners With Anchain.ai
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) is a decentralized payment system based on the Stellar Consensus Protocol. The blockchain enables the exchange of traditional crypto coins and fiat money across international borders.</p>
<p class="s5">Furthermore, Stellar (XLM) recently partnered with an AI-powered security company, Anchain.ai. This integration is aimed at enhancing cross-border payment security. Stellar (XLM) seeks to provide more accessible security tools to create a secure developer ecosystem.</p>
<p class="s5">The XLM token has been on a constant decline since March after it reached $0.13. The coin took a significant fall to settle at $0.7 in April.</p>
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) is experiencing a decline in Q2 2023, making only very minuscule backward and forward leaps. The XLM token has been stuck in the $0.8 range since last week. Holders are looking wide-eyed for appreciation, while investors are watching and wondering if now would be an excellent time to get in the game.</p>
<p class="s5">However, experts are predicting an exaggerated dip, even with the steadiness of the token.</p>
Uwerx (WERX) Presale Is Breaking New Heights
<p class="s5">This new crypto project focuses on the freelancer economy. With freelancing becoming widely adopted, even by big companies like Google, the project is on the right track. The project has undergone vetting and auditing by SolidProof and InterFi Network to ensure transparency.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx aims to provide a secure, fast, and accessible platform for freelancers and their clients. Uwerx charges a low transaction fee of 1%, while other freelancing platforms, such as Upwork and Fiverr, charge 10%-20%.</p>
<p class="s5">The project is in its fifth funding stage and has a 72.5 million token allocation, with WERX priced at $0.0315 per token. The total presale token allocation increased to 57% from 45%, creating more opportunities for early supporters. The hard cap presale will occur on 31st July 2023.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx recently announced preparations to transition to the Beta version to enable users to start testing. The Alpha version of the platform was launched last week. The launch came with Landing Page and Sign-Up Page. However, the platform has been recently updated with more pages, including the Login, Forgot Password, Freelancer or Client Initiation, Job Creation Process, My Activity, and Initial Step of Job Creation and Initial Step Of Finding Talent pages. Users can also send helpful feedback to Uwerx through an email, feedback@uwerx.network.</p>
<p class="s5">Uwerx provides a Uwerx Vault to help secure users' tokens. Users can store their tokens for a specified time and earn rewards using the Vault.</p>
<p class="s5">Moreover, the team has locked the developer's liquidity, which was set for 25 years after the presale. The lock happened after 82.8% of the community voted on an instant lock. Also, 92.8% of the community voted for a test airdrop to enable users to validate their wallet addresses.</p>
<p class="s5">The project has an excellent presale run, and with that, the developers have reduced the token allocation from 8% to 7%, increasing investor confidence in the project.</p>
<p class="s5">The Uwerx developers utilized an agile methodology approach to achieve presale success. The approach uses rapid development and accelerated deployment through feedback.</p>
<p class="s5">Stellar (XLM) and Stacks (STX) give holders much anxiety with their current standings as the tokens seem to be rolling downhill.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As retail investors leave crypto in droves, is institutional money coming in to quietly buy the cream of the cryptocurrencies?</p>
Sell and perhaps get in lower?
<p>Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. A narrative going around social media platforms such as Twitter suggests that with the backdrop of the SEC enforcement actions against Coinbase and Binance, the liquidity and investor interest that would normally propel the next bitcoin bull market just isn&rsquo;t there.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is going sideways and downwards, and certain influencers and analysts believe that the latest rejection from the $31,000 price level is the start of a fairly large pullback that could be in the range of 30% for bitcoin and up to 50% for the altcoins.</p>
<p>In this sort of very uncertain environment weak hands are going to sell and even stronger hands might be thinking to do the same thing with a view to improving their position a lot lower down.</p>
Fickle retail money vs institutional know-how
<p>So we perhaps have the perfect scenario for an institutional take over of cryptocurrencies that have been in the hands of retail investors ever since they came onto the scene.</p>
<p>It must be wondered though just how fickle retail is. It is hardly any time at all since Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the largest asset management firm in the world, said on national TV in the US that bitcoin was an &ldquo;international asset&rdquo; and &ldquo;digitised gold&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Obviously, it&rsquo;s not at all sure that the Blackrock filing for a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved, especially given Gensler and the SEC&rsquo;s extremely negative stance on crypto. Be that as it may, Blackrock isn&rsquo;t just any company. It is a behemoth, and has untold influence in Washington and across the world. It will surely get the business done at some point.</p>
<p>A Washington Post article published on Saturday posits that the &ldquo;tech-focused investors&rdquo; have moved on from crypto and are now much more interested in artificial intelligence, and that the once crazy amounts of venture capital that used to be thrown at crypto has &ldquo;slowed to a trickle&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When this kind of narrative becomes this strong, and the bitcoin halving only 280 days away, it&rsquo;s a perfect time for big money to slowly start coming into the crypto space. It cannot be argued that crypto will provide the solutions for many issues, especially in finance, and therefore now could be a good time for entry.</p>
The narrative is established
<p>When Satoshi Nakamoto launched bitcoin in the time of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, he meant for bitcoin to be bought by the people in order to save them from the next, probably even worse crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average retail investor is scared though. Mainstream media has done its work, and so has the Biden administration, central banks across the world, and regulatory agencies such as the SEC. As this next financial crisis looms larger, retail needs to be brave and hang on in there. The alternative can be so much worse.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In its latest research report, Standard Chartered Bank has presented an optimistic forecast for Bitcoin, suggesting that the leading cryptocurrency could touch the $50,000 milestone by the end of 2021, and climb to an impressive $120,000 by 2024's close.</p>
Mining Economics Fueling Bitcoin's Potential Ascend
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Driving this prediction is a key factor: the growing profitability of Bitcoin miners. As Geoff Kendrick, the head of FX and digital assets research at Standard Chartered, explained in the report, miners play a vital role in determining the net supply of the newly minted cryptocurrency, on top of their responsibility of maintaining the Bitcoin ledger.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Increased miner profitability per BTC (bitcoin) mined means they can sell less while maintaining cash inflows, reducing net BTC supply and pushing BTC prices higher," Kendrick stated.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to Standard Chartered's report, the primary driving force behind its predicted Bitcoin price surge involves Bitcoin miners. These miners create approximately 900 new Bitcoins globally every day. The costs they incur, predominantly power expenses for high-performance computers, are currently being offset by selling 100% of these freshly minted coins, as per the bank's estimation.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, should Bitcoin's value climb to $50,000, Standard Chartered believes miners would only need to sell between 20% and 30% of their new coins to cover their costs. This reduction in the number of new coins entering the market could potentially limit the available supply, thereby driving prices up.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A surge in miner profitability per Bitcoin mined means miners are under less pressure to sell their output. This shift allows miners to retain their earnings while simultaneously decreasing the net Bitcoin supply, creating a favorable environment for Bitcoin prices to rise.</p>
Forecast Revision, Shifting Market Conditions
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This recent revision is a significant upgrade from the bank's previous forecast in April, which projected Bitcoin hitting $100,000. According to Standard Chartered, this initial prediction, influenced by several factors including a banking-sector crisis, now appears "too conservative."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Since then, the market conditions have shifted notably. Bitcoin has experienced an 80% increase from the start of 2021 and is currently trading around $30,100, triggering the bank's reconsideration of its initial forecast.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In light of the revised projection, it's clear that financial institutions are adapting their strategies and outlooks in response to the highly dynamic cryptocurrency market, underscored by the recent flurry of institutional interest and significant price movements.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As the sector continues to transform, these expert forecasts offer valuable insights into potential trends and fluctuations. However, investors and market observers should approach these predictions with a keen awareness of the broader context &mdash; the cryptocurrency market's intrinsic volatility and unpredictability.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">At the time of writing, the current trading price of Bitcoin, at around $30,200, represents an 80% increase since the start of 2021, which is an important consideration when gauging the potential future trajectory of this premier cryptocurrency.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD 29998 Support Tested:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 11 July 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained dominated by short-term technical levels early in the Asian session as the pair encountered buying pressure around the 29996.74 level, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 29715.87 to 30456.&nbsp; Traders pushed BTC/USD higher to the 30282.09 area, representing a test of the 23.6% retracement of the same appreciating range.&nbsp; Recent selling pressure expanded around the 31142.38 area and this increases the risk of another test of the 29427 area, representing the 38.2% retracement of the broader appreciating range from 26165.98 to 31443.67.&nbsp; &nbsp;Below that area, the 28604.83 level represents the 50% retracement of that appreciating range.&nbsp; Additional upside price objectives include the 31737, 32125, and 33569 areas.&nbsp; Stops are cited above additional upside price objectives around the 31674, 32043, 34531, and 34658 areas.</p>

<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30475.07 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30227.33.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>

<p>Following recent selling pressure, areas of potential technical support and buying pressure include the 29427, 28886, 28804, 28182, 28096, and 27306 areas.&nbsp; &nbsp;Technicians will closely monitor trading activity around the 28095.44 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the historical depreciating range from 69000 to 15460.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 30475.07 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 30227.33.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;24440.41/ 23270.10/ 22769.39 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>LFi One is a revolutionary smartphone that not only boasts cutting-edge features comparable to leading smartphones in the market but also serves as a unique minting hardware. Unlike other mobile devices, LFi One has embedded powerful software that enables it to mint tokens and generate rewards for its users.</p>
<p>All you need to do is make sure that your LFi One is connected to the internet. Once it is online, the phone will start minting LFi tokens and you will receive crypto rewards in return. The price of an LFi token is currently $1. And, as the LFi ecosystem continues to develop, the price of LFi tokens has the potential to go up in the coming years.</p>
Here are some of the benefits of using LFi One:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Mint tokens: LFi One is built to support token minting. This gives users the opportunity to earn crypto rewards by simply using their phone.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Top-of-the-line features: LFi One has features that can compete with the leading smartphones in the market. This makes it a great choice for users who want a powerful and versatile device.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Potential for price appreciation: The price of LFi tokens has the potential to go up in the coming years. This means that users who mint LFi tokens now could potentially see their portfolio grow in value.</li>
</ul>
Understanding Minting&nbsp;
<p>Crypto minting is the process of creating new units of a cryptocurrency without the need for computational work. It is an important part of the process by which new cryptocurrency units are created and added to the market.</p>
<p>There are a variety of different mechanisms through which crypto minting can occur, depending on the specific cryptocurrency being minted. In some cases, crypto minting can occur through a process called staking. Staking involves holding a certain amount of a cryptocurrency in a wallet or on a particular blockchain network. Stakers are then rewarded with newly minted units of the cryptocurrency, based on the amount they hold and the length of time they have held it.</p>
Here are some of the most common mechanisms to generate crypto units:
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Proof-of-work (PoW): PoW is the most common mechanism for crypto mining. It involves using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems in order to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. The first miner to solve a problem is rewarded with newly minted units of the cryptocurrency.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Proof-of-stake (PoS): PoS is a more energy-efficient alternative to PoW. It involves locking up a certain amount of cryptocurrency in a wallet in order to become a validator. Validators are then randomly selected to verify transactions and add them to the blockchain. They are rewarded with newly minted units of the cryptocurrency for their services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crypto minting is an important part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It allows for the creation of new units of cryptocurrency, which helps to keep the market liquid and growing. The different mechanisms for crypto minting offer a variety of options for users, depending on their preferences and resources.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another DeFi hack. Arcadia Finance has reportedly been the victim of an exploit which allowed hackers to drain roughly $455,000. </p>
<p>Decentralised finance (DeFi) platform Arcadia Finance has reportedly become the latest victim of a hack. Blockchain investigating firm PeckShields reported the exploit and said it was due to &ldquo;the lack of untrusted input validation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">#PeckShieldAlert Our community contributor has detected that @ArcadiaFi has been exploited on both #Ethereum and #Optimism for ~$455KThe exploiter on #Ethereum was frontrun by 0x5C75e94dD0Ab9c10BFd1B8073DafEF031D3c050dhttps://t.co/blGx5IEAkkThe exploiter on #optimism&hellip; pic.twitter.com/WDzF0XVcmL</p>
&mdash; PeckShieldAlert (@PeckShieldAlert) July 10, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p>PeckShields alerted about a code vulnerability that allowed a hacker to drain funds worth about $455,000 from Ethereum (darcWETH) and Optimism (darcUSDC) vaults. According to the firm, the code vulnerability lacked a validation mechanism to cross-check unverified inputs. It added, &ldquo;There is a lack of reentrancy protection, which allows for the instant liquidation to bypass the internal vault health check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PeckShields also reported the exploiter transferred roughly 179 ETH by bridging 148 ETH and swapping 59,000 USDC to crypto mixer Tornado Cash.</p>
Arcadia TVL Drops 76%
<p>Following the hack, DeFiLlama reported that Arcadia&rsquo;s Total Value Locked (TVL) dropped by a staggering 76%, from $605,000 to $145,000.</p>
<p>The exploit on Arcadia Finance comes only days after a $130 million hack on Multichain&rsquo;s MPC bridge platform.</p>
<p>Observers noted $102 million worth of crypto was withdrawn from the Multichain Fantom bridge on the Ethereum side. $666,000 worth of Dogecoin (DOGE) and $5 million from Moonriver were also removed. An additional 7214 Wrapped Ether tokens, 1024 Wrapped Bitcoin, and $58 million worth of USDC tokens were drained from the Fantom bridge&rsquo;s Ethereum smart contract.</p>
Arcadia Acknowledges Exploit
<p>Arcadia Finance acknowledged the exploit on their protocol but has yet to provide further information.</p>
<p>The platform informed its users this morning that it had contacted the hacker.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We have initiated contact with the attacker. https://t.co/dh74gG90n6 https://t.co/O39Slsc1z5We will continue to work with our security partners, law enforcement, and the broader community to resolve this as best we can. Our number one priority is recovering funds for Arcadia&hellip;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>According to the SEC, Coinbase was aware of securities law violations and even warned some of its shareholders about the risk.&nbsp;</p>
SEC Claps Back At Coinbase
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally responded to Coinbase&rsquo;s claims that the former lacks the jurisdiction to regulate the crypto exchange&rsquo;s activities.</p>
<p>It all started on June 6, 2023, when the US regulatory body filed charges against Coinbase, claiming that the crypto exchange had offered investors unregistered securities since 2019. The &ldquo;unregistered securities,&rdquo; in this case, were several cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In the SEC&rsquo;s recent letter, the organization addressed a district judge and argued that Coinbase, as a "multi-billion-dollar entity advised by sophisticated legal counsel," intentionally disregarded decades of established legal precedent, specifically the landmark Howey test, in an attempt to create its own criteria for determining what constitutes an investment contract.</p>
Coinbase Acknowledged Securities Law?&nbsp;
<p>The response from the SEC highlighted Coinbase's own acknowledgment of the risk that assets traded on its platform could be classified as securities. The regulator quoted from Coinbase's public statements since becoming a publicly traded company, emphasizing that the company had consistently informed shareholders about the potential violation of federal securities laws resulting from its conduct.</p>
<p>The SEC also presented evidence that the crypto firm was well aware of the federal securities laws and how they could be applied to the exchange&rsquo;s activities. The letter also claimed that the Coinbase team had even gone as far as communicating the potential securities laws violations and the associated risks to its shareholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An excerpt from the letter reads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since becoming a public company, Coinbase has repeatedly informed its shareholders of the risk that the crypto assets traded on its platform could be deemed securities and therefore that its conduct could violate the federal securities laws.&rdquo;</p>

Coinbase Claims Lack Of Jurisdiction
<p>This letter from the SEC is in direct response to a previous filing made by Coinbase on June 28, where the latter appealed to the court to dismiss the case on grounds of lack of jurisdiction and its claims that the SEC did not follow due process.</p>
<p>Coinbase had referenced a statement allegedly made by SEC Chair Gary Gensler during his appearance before Congress, where he reportedly claimed that market regulation of crypto exchanges was outside the scope of the SEC's authority and that only Congress could confer such regulatory power.</p>
<p>Coinbase also pointed out that despite being a public company for two years, it was only recently that the SEC brought charges against the exchange for activities that had been thoroughly described to the regulator and the public.</p>
<p>The outcome of this case will have significant implications for the regulation of cryptocurrencies and how they are traded within the United States. As the legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC continues, market participants eagerly await a resolution that could shape the future of the crypto industry.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As bitcoin continues to trade sideways in a range, the next sharp move is not far from happening.</p>
Becalmed, but not for long
<p>Bitcoin looks to be reasonably comfortable as it sits on support at around $30,000. Not the heights of over $31,000 and a chance at breaking resistance, but a respectable sideways price action that could break soon.</p>
<p>In fact, it&rsquo;s only 5 days since bitcoin made a new high for the year, when it rose to $31,500 and looked as though it might break the strongest resistance it&rsquo;s likely to meet in this bull market.</p>
Strong support below
<p>However, gravity took its toll and bitcoin has returned back down to $30,000. Should this break further to the downside, there is very strong support at around $29,300 and then down to $28,800. After that there is massive support at $25,000 which would also be bolstered by the 200 MA, plus the upward trendline that started at the beginning of the year.</p>
Dark economic clouds gather
<p>Things are still incredibly uncertain from an economic perspective. The lower inflation sequence could be about to be broken in the US, while remaining very persistent worldwide, particularly in countries in Europe and especially in the UK.</p>
<p>On the horizon in August there is the BRICS summit, where a new rival reserve currency to the dollar could potentially be announced. The lack of decent Western mainstream coverage of such an earth-shattering economic event does not bode well for proper preparation from the West.</p>
<p>Housing crises are also drawing near in many Western countries. UK mortgage holders are getting to the end of their fixed rate mortgages and will need to renegotiate them, facing a potential rise of at least 300% on their current payments.</p>
<p>In addition, when the Summer comes to an end and Winter begins to demand vastly higher energy bills, an entry into recession will have been all but assured.</p>
Bitcoin about to prove its worth
<p>How bitcoin will perform in such an economic quagmire is really the million dollar question. So far it hasn&rsquo;t become that inflation hedge that all were hoping for, but this could change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Money printing in the West is likely to start getting ramped up again as these economies desperately fight to get themselves through the Winter. Bitcoin, the scarcest asset in the world, and out of the reach of government manipulation, will have the chance to prove that it is a haven of safety. Those able to buy bitcoin, gold, or silver may want to do so before fiat debasement makes it so much more difficult.</p>

<p>Things are still incredibly uncertain from an economic perspective. The lower inflation sequence could be about to be broken in the US, while remaining very persistent worldwide, particularly in countries in Europe and especially in the UK.</p>
<p>On the horizon in August there is the BRICS summit, where a new rival reserve currency to the dollar could potentially be announced. The lack of decent Western mainstream coverage of such an earth-shattering economic event does not bode well for proper preparation from the West.</p>
<p>Housing crises are also drawing near in many Western countries. UK mortgage holders are getting to the end of their fixed rate mortgages and will need to renegotiate them, facing a potential rise of at least 300% on their current payments.</p>
<p>In addition, when the Summer comes to an end and Winter begins to demand vastly higher energy bills, an entry into recession will have been all but assured.</p>
Bitcoin about to prove its worth
<p>How bitcoin will perform in such an economic quagmire is really the million dollar question. So far it hasn&rsquo;t become that inflation hedge that all were hoping for, but this could change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Money printing in the West is likely to start getting ramped up again as these economies desperately fight to get themselves through the Winter. Bitcoin, the scarcest asset in the world, and out of the reach of government manipulation, will have the chance to prove that it is a haven of safety. Those able to buy bitcoin, gold, or silver may want to do so before fiat debasement makes it so much more difficult.</p>

<p>Revoke, an approval management platform that helps users practice safer crypto wallet behaviour was forced to issue a fix after users reported a new crypto scam.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yesterday, we received reports of people seeing unknown approval transactions in their transaction history.It turns out that this is a new scam where scammers use so-called gas tokens to steal money when victims revoke these "fake approvals". pic.twitter.com/vpY2sGIv0T</p>

</p>
<p>Revoke.com received complaints over the weekend of a new crypto scam which baits users into revoking "fake approvals," leaving them with excessively high transaction fees. The platform posted on Twitter that it had received reports of users seeing unknown approvals in the transaction history.</p>
Scammers Are Creating Fake Gas Tokens
<p>Revoke explained the scam involves scammers using so-called "gas tokens" to steal funds when victims revoke so-called "fake approvals." Gas tokens were developed after Ethereum network fees began increasing, allowing users to store "cheap gas" when network demand is low.</p>
<p>Revoke explained this feature allows users "to mint gas tokens when fees were low and burn them when fees were high, effectively "locking in" the lower fee." The platform explained the scam operates by scammers creating fake gas tokens, which they airdrop with fake approvals to users, tricking them into thinking there are requests they need to revoke.</p>
<p>The scammer's fake tokens are programmed to generate a lot of gas during the revoked transactions. The newly minted tokens are sent to scammers, leaving victims with high transaction fees.</p>
<p>Revoke said:</p>

<p>But the scammers programmed these fake tokens so that it mints a lot of gas tokens during a revoke transaction. These gas tokens are then sent to the scammers, who can sell them. This is scary because your wallet popup will not show that you're sending funds, just a high fee.</p>

Revoke Introduces Fix to Mitigate Scam
<p>Revoke acts as a tool to help users practice safer wallet behaviour. The platform manages or revokes active approvals such as those no longer required by decentralised finance protocols.</p>
<p>In an effort to mitigate the fallout from the scam, Revoke added a check that disables revoking approvals if the gas fees are excessive, and urged users to ignore fake approvals. Revoke explained:</p>

<p>Best thing to do with these fake approvals / fake tokens is to ignore them. As long as you don't interact with them, they can't steal your funds.</p>
