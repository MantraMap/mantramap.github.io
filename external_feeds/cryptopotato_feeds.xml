			            <description><![CDATA[Worldcoin has a "high probability of failure," according to Slow Mist's founder. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The recently launched Worldcoin human identity verification system elicited mixed reactions among people. While the project deems itself as a privacy-preserving digital identity, many prominent players in the community view the iris scanning process specialized Orb hardware device to be Orwellian.</p>
<p>The crypto-focused project, co-founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, has witnessed significant security concerns being raised due to the potential for hackers to exploit it.</p>
<h2>Slow Mist Founder&#8217;s Views on Worldcoin</h2>
<p>Worldcoin is drawing a fresh wave of criticism from the founder of Slow Mist, who does not believe the project has much hope. The executive of the blockchain security expert <a href="https://twitter.com/evilcos/status/1683521011235586050" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> that if Worldcoin succeeds, it will be an &#8220;evil&#8221; creation but added that it has a &#8220;high probability of failure.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;What is an iris? It is the most stable and durable unique mark of your person (unless you are blind), which is much more reliable than face and fingerprint verification. I have read the Worldcoin white paper, and the promises in it are really good, but we still need to be vigilant about a new category of things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The founder also asked users to exercise a lot of vigilance while interacting with the project.</p>
<h2>Backlash So Far</h2>
<p>Former American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden drew a striking analogy, comparing the protocol&#8217;s approach to treating the human body as a mere ticket punch. The privacy advocate urged his followers not to &#8220;catalog their balls.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don&#8217;t use biometrics for anti-fraud.</p>
<p>In fact, don&#8217;t use biometrics for anything.</p>
<p>— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1451993036196618251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">October 23, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also published a detailed <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-problems-with-sam-altmans-worldcoin-according-to-vitalik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">blog pos</a><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/4-problems-with-sam-altmans-worldcoin-according-to-vitalik/" data-wpel-link="internal">t</a> on Monday weighing on &#8220;decentralized proof-of-personhood,&#8221; the concept at the center of Worldcoin. He said the privacy issues in the project are relatively mild but pointed out some glaring centralization issues. The exec also indicated risks such as malicious entities linking one person&#8217;s iris with another&#8217;s app and AI-generated 3D irises.</p>
<p>Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus, who is more famously known as &#8216;Shibetoshi Nakamoto,&#8217; <a href="https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1683501141974470656" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">referred</a> to the newly <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openai-ceo-sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-launches-wld-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> cryptocurrency WLD as &#8220;creepy and weird.&#8221; Stephan Livera, a popular Bitcoin podcaster from Australia, <a href="https://twitter.com/stephanlivera/status/1683728294267457536" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">said</a> the project is a &#8220;complete dumpster fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite the uproar, Worldcoin investors reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1683668998410342403" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">boast</a> high-profile names, including a16z, Coinbase Ventures, Digital Currency Group (DCG), as well as some shady ones such as former FTX boss Sam Bankman-Fried and bankrupt hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital (3AC).</p>
<p>Worldcoin, for its part, has been careful not to launch its WLD token in the United States to ensure it won&#8217;t end up running head-first into legal issues, especially at a time when the country watchdogs have amplified their scrutiny.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has once again failed to break above the psychological resistance level of $2,000. While the PA has been bearish over the past few days, there is hope that the market might rebound soon.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been dropping since getting rejected around the key $2,000 level. The 50-day moving average is providing support near $1,850 at the moment.</p>
<p>However, if it breaks down, the 200-day moving average located around the $1,800 level can be counted as the next strong support zone. On the other hand, if the price rebounds from either of these levels, a rally toward $2,300 would be highly probable in the coming weeks.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262480" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-262480 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_2507231" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETHUSDT-Daily-Jul-25-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262480" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price is getting supported at the $1,850 level, following a bearish reversal from the $1,930 resistance zone. While the market is rebounding, there is still a high probability of the breakdown of the $1,850 level in the short term.</p>
<p>In this scenario, a further decline toward $1,750 could be expected. The RSI indicator also demonstrates values below 50%, pointing to the current bearish momentum. Therefore, another bearish move is likely on the horizon before a rally toward the $2,000 mark or higher may be expected.</p>

<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price is currently consolidating around the $2,000 level without showing any intention to rally higher.</p>
<p>One of the most valuable metrics in evaluating the futures market sentiment is the taker buy-sell ratio, which shows whether the buyers or the sellers are executing their trades more aggressively. Values above 1 indicate bullish sentiment, while values below one are associated with a bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>The metric has dropped below 1, indicating that the sellers are selling aggressively. This pressure is one of the prominent reasons for the price&#8217;s failure to climb higher. Moreover, this behavior can also lead to a bearish downturn in price if nothing changes soon.</p>

<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily timeframe, the price has been consolidating above the $30K level before dropping below it. The 50-day moving average, located around the $29K mark, is currently providing support for the price.</p>
<p>If this level holds, the market will be more likely to rally toward the $38K resistance zone in the coming months. However, if the mentioned moving average breaks down, the 200-day MA trending near the $26K area would be the next likely target.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262522" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-262522" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="BTCUSDT 4H - Jul 25 2023" width="2560" height="1464" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-300x172.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-1024x586.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-768x439.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-1536x879.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-2048x1171.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSDT-4H-Jul-25-2023-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262522" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>Looking at the 4-hour chart, the price action becomes clearer. The cryptocurrency is currently breaking below the $30K support area, with the next level located around the $27,500 mark.</p>
<p>However, the RSI indicator is approaching the oversold region, pointing to a potential reversal or pullback in the short term. If the price climbs back above the $30K level, a bullish continuation higher may be expected.</p>

<h2><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Funding Rates</strong></h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has gradually declined over the last few weeks, failing to rise above $30K. The funding rates indicate that this drop might be due to the futures market sentiment.</p>
<p>The funding rates metric determines whether long traders or short sellers are currently dominant. Positive values indicate bullish sentiment, while negative values indicate bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>Considering the recent funding rates values, marketing sentiment is trending relatively bearish after a few months of optimism. Therefore, one of the prominent reasons why the market has failed to keep rallying above $30K is the selling pressure from the futures market.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple faced strong rejection when attempting to breach the significant resistance region at $0.55.</p>
<p>Currently, it&#8217;s challenging to identify Ripple&#8217;s direction due to the choppy price action. The most likely scenario seems to be a consolidation phase for the mid-term.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By <a href="http://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the daily chart reveals that Ripple faced significant rejection upon reaching the crucial resistance zone at $0.85. This indicates robust selling pressure and substantial supply around this price range.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to recognize that a consolidation correction stage is necessary after impulsive price surges to validate the trend&#8217;s strength and allow the market to rest.</p>
<p>As a result, it seems likely that the price has entered a mid-term correction phase leading to higher volatility and pullback periods before the next significant movement occurs.</p>
<figure id="attachment_262486" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-262486" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-262486 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-scaled.jpg" alt="xrp_price_chart_2507231" width="2560" height="1385" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-1024x554.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-1536x831.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-2048x1108.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/XRP-Daily-5-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-262486" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>In the 4-hour chart, it can be seen that the price successfully broke above the upper edge of a channel. However, after reaching the $0.85 region, it experienced a decline with consecutive red candles.</p>
<p>This suggests that a correction period is likely, retracing back to the upper boundary and completing a pullback. If this correction is successful, the market can expect to continue the bullish rally, propelling the price to higher levels.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Market data shows consecutive inflows into crypto-backed investment funds, signaling that traditional investors are experiencing renewed interest in Bitcoin.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest weekly publication of Bitfinex revealed that bitcoin (BTC) balances on centralized exchanges have retraced to levels last seen in January/February 2018.</p>
<p>Bitfinex <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bitfinex-Alpha-64.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">found</a> that the balances have plunged by 32% from the 3.1 million BTC peak in March 2020 to 2.1 million now. At writing time, only 11% of BTC&#8217; circulating supply was found on exchanges, indicating a significant decrease from the 17% recorded in March 2020.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Balances on Exchanges Plummet</h2>
<p>The leading cryptocurrency platform attributed the declining BTC exchange balances to the increasing usage of alternatives like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and funds not covered in the analysis. However, the overarching factor is considered to be the widespread movement of people withdrawing their BTC from exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is also a testament of how longer-term holders are moving coins to cold storage. We see this as a positive for the price as more investors indicate the desire to accumulate rather than trade. Furthermore, we see derivatives market participation continuing to increase, which has historically preceded a break to the upside, as spot prices keep decreasing,” Bitfinex said.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, market data shows consecutive inflows into crypto-backed investment funds, signaling that traditional investors are experiencing a renewed interest in bitcoin and increasing their demand for the asset.</p>
<p>Bitfinex cited the latest analysis by Coinshares, which <a href="https://etp.coinshares.com/knowledge/market-activity/fund-flows-24-07-23?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=Market_FundFlows_240723&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=Minor-outflows-july" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">discovered</a> that crypto-backed investment funds saw a net inflow of $137 million last week, with 99% of the assets directed toward Bitcoin-backed entities. Over four weeks, the gross BTC inflows into crypto funds amassed $742 million, representing the largest since Q4 2021.</p>
<h2>Bulls and Bears Continue to Struggle</h2>
<p>While BTC exchange balances retrace, Bitfinex noticed some unusual whale activity within 72 hours. The exchange’s Whale Ratio metric recorded a significant surge of BTC being sent to exchanges, raising speculation about a potential new selling pressure.</p>
<p>However, upon deeper analysis, it was discovered that the U.S. Department of Justice was moving its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-doj-seized-over-50000-btc-related-to-silk-road/" data-wpel-link="internal">seized</a> BTC stash from the darknet marketplace Silk Road, after which they were re-distributed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, BTC has been in a tight range between $29,500 and $31,500 for over 33 days, indicating that bulls and bears are still struggling. The leading cryptocurrency’s next direction is uncertain, but Bitfinex believes the outflows from short-Bitcoin funds could cause the asset to break out <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/on-chain-metrics-and-investor-behavior-suggest-signs-of-a-bull-run-bitfinex-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">towards</a> the upside.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brand-new staking cryptocurrency BTC20 ($BTC20) has generated significant buzz in the past week, raising over $1.7 million through its presale phase.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=new-stake-to-earn-token-btc20-raises-1-7m-in-a-week-heres-why-traders-are-backing-it" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20 ($BTC20)&#8217;s</a> presale has been an instant hit because it allows investors to buy tokens at the symbolic price of $1 – an homage to the original Bitcoin&#8217;s early days.</p>
<p>With the momentum around the project showing no signs of slowing, many in the crypto community are backing it to pump once it makes its open market debut in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2>$BTC20 Offers Lucrative Staking Rewards with Energy-Efficient Setup</h2>
<p>BTC20’s marquee feature is its staking model, which allows token holders to earn rewards over time through a vesting contract.</p>
<p>Inspired by the original Bitcoin’s block rewards, this contract is designed to distribute $BTC20 tokens to stakers over an estimated 120 years.</p>
<p>Per the BTC20 <a href="https://btc20.com/assets/documents/whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a>, all unsold tokens (minimum of 14.95 million $BTC20) will be locked into the staking contract once the presale ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262500" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="256" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23-300x128.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-23-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Token holders can then stake their $BTC20 to receive recurring rewards – with the more $BTC20 staked, the higher the payout.</p>
<p>Naturally, this staking model provides a way for investors to earn passive income by holding $BTC20 long term.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as this model utilizes a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism instead of Bitcoin&#8217;s Proof-of-Work (PoW), BTC20 aspires to provide a more energy-efficient and sustainable alternative to Bitcoin&#8217;s mining setup.</p>
<p>As noted in an article from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/cryptocurrency-goes-green-proof-stake-offer-solution-energy-concerns-rcna1030" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>, experts believe that PoS protocols can consume up to 99.99% less energy than PoW protocols – essentially making BTC20 a “green crypto” project.</p>
<h2>Homage to the Original Bitcoin Helps Build $BTC20 Presale Hype</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b__34851?referrer=new-stake-to-earn-token-btc20-raises-1-7m-in-a-week-heres-why-traders-are-backing-it" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">BTC20’s</a> stake-to-earn setup has played into its presale hype, which is also bolstered by the project’s strategy of paying homage to Bitcoin’s history.</p>
<p>Just as Bitcoin’s price was $1 in its early days, BTC20 aims to replicate that opportunity by allowing presale investors to acquire tokens at the same price point.</p>
<p>Many in the rapidly-growing BTC20 <a href="https://t.me/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram community</a> believe this could prove fruitful, given the project’s potential for post-listing growth.</p>
<p>Moreover, BTC20 mirrors Bitcoin’s original circulating supply of 21 million tokens.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262499" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="299" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33-300x149.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-33-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Up to 6.05 million of these tokens will be sold in the presale, split into two distinct stages.</p>
<p>This carefully designed tokenomics setup aims to recreate Bitcoin&#8217;s roots while benefiting from the perks associated with being built on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain offers numerous benefits as it creates opportunities for $BTC20 to be integrated with an array of decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>Given that Ethereum is a hub for NFT, DeFi, and metaverse activity, structuring $BTC20 as an ERC-20 token allows for immense interoperability and future utility – a factor that’s contributing to the growing presale hype.</p>
<h2>Crypto Influencers Back BTC20 to Be the Next Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Capitalizing on the momentum from its presale success and unique staking configuration, BTC20 has quickly gained popularity on social media.</p>
<p>The project’s <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC20Token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> page has swelled to over 1,700 followers at the time of writing, with new people flooding in each day.</p>
<p>Several notable crypto influencers have also been discussing BTC20’s potential.</p>
<p>Michael Wrubel, who boasts over 310,000 subscribers on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDz78nbcYzY&amp;pp=ygUMYnRjMjAgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">uploaded</a> a video describing $BTC20 as &#8220;the next Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262498" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="179" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31-300x89.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-31-50x15.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, prominent crypto analyst Jacob Bury also discussed BTC20 in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R47JhiEr3M&amp;pp=ygUMYnRjMjAgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a>, speculating that it&#8217;s a &#8220;new crypto that could explode soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given this influencer backing, many BTC20 community members are already discussing how high $BTC20 may rise once it is listed on the open market after the presale concludes.</p>
<p>While it&#8217;s impossible to predict, if the current hype and momentum persist, $BTC20 could experience considerable appreciation from the $1 presale price, making it a token to keep an eye on in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>According to an update <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1683747073227624448?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">provided</a> by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, an additional $37 million compromised during the hack on Tron and Bitcoin has been located, increasing the initial estimate of $23 million to $60 million.</p>
<h2>Alphapo&#8217;s Hack Estimated to $60M</h2>
<p>Alphapo is a payments processor for crypto-related gambling platforms such as HypeDrop, Bovada, and Ignition. The platform&#8217;s hot wallets were <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1682941291825627137?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">drained</a> on July 23, with the attackers stealing over $23 million. The hackers managed to gain control of users&#8217; crypto assets on several blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tron.</p>
<p>Blockchain security firm PeckShield <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1683034275489382401?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that the assets stolen were approximately 6 million USDT, 108,000 USDC, 2,500 ETH, 1,700 DAI, 100 million FTN, 430,000 TFL, and an undetermined amount of BTC. The hackers swapped the stablecoins and other tokens for over 5,730 ETH before bridging them to Avalanche and Bitcoin.</p>
<p>ZachXBT said the hack appeared to have been perpetrated by the infamous North Korea-linked hacker group Lazarus due to their &#8220;very distinct&#8221; on-chain fingerprint. Lazarus Group is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korea-responsible-for-ronin-network-hack-fbi-confirms/" data-wpel-link="internal">believed</a> to be behind crypto&#8217;s largest hack involving the Ronin Network, with a loss of $620 million. Reports disclosed that the hacker group <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/north-korean-hackers-stole-1-7b-worth-crypto-in-2022-chainalysis/" data-wpel-link="internal">stole</a> roughly $1.7 billion in crypto throughout 2022.</p>
<h2>Alphapo Unsure of Withdrawal Resumption Time</h2>
<p>While Alphapo attempted to contain the incident on Sunday, the HypeDrop team halted the platform&#8217;s withdrawal service and <a href="https://twitter.com/HypeDrop/status/1682832668201721856?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">informed</a> users that their provider was working to resolve some issues on their side.</p>
<p>Alphapo is yet to release an official statement updating users on the matter. However, HypeDrop said it is monitoring the situation and would ensure the funds of users whose payments were affected are safe.</p>
<p>In a recent tweet, the HypeDrop team <a href="https://twitter.com/HypeDrop/status/1683818126608158720?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a> they had disabled crypto deposits for the time being because Alphapo is still manually processing withdrawals slowly. However, they have procured the services of another provider, as Alphapo is not sure when withdrawals will be automated again.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our provider has advised us that withdrawals will be automated again, but unfortunately with no ETA. Therefore, we&#8217;ve implemented another payment service provider today as a backup option. We want to remind you that withdrawals will get paid out, either by our current provider or new provider,&#8221; HypeDrop said.</p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">While the crypto exchange allegedly described the action as a &#8220;normal performance appraisal,&#8221; the layoff is said to be a result of the company&#8217;s new KYC policy.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Las Vegas, Nevada, July 25th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://xandeum.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Xandeum</a>, a trailblazing blockchain startup committed to accelerating humanity&#8217;s transition to decentralized control, announces its highly anticipated launch on July 30, 2023, at 11:00 am PT.</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, Xandeum&#8217;s mission is to empower collective self-determination by creating a scalable, blockchain-based storage layer for smart contracts, which adds a new dimension to the decentralized web. Named External Global Grouped Storage (EGGS), this solution pioneers a new era of storage-enabled Web3 apps (sedApps) on Xandeum.</p>
<p>In a departure from the traditional model of seeking venture capital, Xandeum prioritizes community control by selling node licenses directly to its users. The grand launch will introduce an incentivized purchase model, creating a buzz for this revolutionary blockchain project.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Xandeum is all about transforming the world of blockchain,&#8221; said Bernie Blume, founder of Xandeum. &#8220;We&#8217;re not just creating another blockchain; we&#8217;re creating a holistic platform that integrates advanced blockchain technology with a revolutionary storage solution, paving the way for fully-fledged, storage-enabled Web3 apps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The grand launch introduces an attractive purchase model: the first transaction to purchase a node will receive a generous 50% rebate, the second 49%, the third 48%, and so on until the 50th transaction, which will still secure a 1% rebate.</p>
<p>This follows Xandeum&#8217;s track record of success, already having sold over 2,809 nodes for proceeds surpassing $1.9 million under the prior brand name Bitoku. By opening the market to its community, Xandeum aims to foster further expansion and innovation.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our community just loves to embark on this journey so early, at least 4 to 5 months ahead of the ICO, in order to reap the maximum benefits.” notes Blume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Post-launch, Xandeum will roll out an incentivized Devnet on August 15, followed by a Testnet in the fall, an ICO of the XAND token in November and a beta version of the mainnet scheduled for 2024.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Join us in this exciting journey. Visit our website, explore the lightpaper and the RFC version of our technical whitepaper, check out the roadmap, and prepare to participate in our grand launch,&#8221; urged Blume.</p></blockquote>
