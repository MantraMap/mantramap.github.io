<p>Investing in the crypto industry has made many individuals millionaires, but what knowledge did they possess? They invested during a project's early stages, capitalizing on its growth opportunity and solid fundamentals while maximizing its profits. This strategy has always been very lucrative, and we would like to introduce a perfect chance for you to utilize it - Uwerx! It is a project currently in phase 1 of its presale with an opportunity to surpass both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Gala (GALA) in 2023 as it becomes a top-tier crypto platform with millions of supporters. </p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx (WERX) To Become The Most Profit-Yielding Coin</p>
<p>The freelance industry will soon have a new dominating platform with features that other traditional freelance platforms do not have, joining its ranks. This platform will be Uwerx - the first-ever blockchain-based freelance platform!</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to solve some of the freelance industry's problems- through blockchain technology! Both freelancers and companies will benefit from lower fees (1% vs. 20%) since Uwerx will cut out the intermediary escrow service and much more! Decentralized storage will bring greater trust and security and more significant record-keeping since every piece of information will be kept on the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about security, another area that is very important when making your investment choice. The famous auditing firms InterFi Network and Solidproof have already finished two audits of the project, all while the minds behind Uwerx will place a lock on project liquidity for 25 years after its launch. These safety nets genuinely reflect the team's long-term faith and confidence in the project and are a good sign for any potential buyer. Since the token price is only $0.0065, now is the right time to buy into a possible top 10 coin at a low cost. With many crypto insiders predicting a $2.80 price point by July 2024, we believe that Uwerx may be one of the most profitable investment choices in 2023! </p>
<p class="s7">The Shiba Inu (SHIB) Value Goes Up</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), established in 2020, is a spoof of Dogecoin (DOGE), another joke coin. The currency was developed by the Shiba Inu (SHIB) team as a way of rewarding content providers.</p>
<p>Recently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) developers unveiled "Shibarium" proposals, describing intentions to introduce a layer-2 blockchain. This news helped the Shiba Inu (SHIB) value go up 25% in the past week, which is currently worth $0.00001116. Its trading volume has also shot up 350% in the past 24 hours, but some investors are still skeptical. For it to reach the $1 mark, the developers must make many changes, and even though Shiba Inu (SHIB) may see green charts in the future, those who wish for more significant profit should look for other projects with more utility cases. </p>
<p class="s7">Gala (GALA) Sinks By 11%</p>
<p>Gala (GALA) is a brand-new gaming environment built on Ethereum. The Gala (GALA) coin was launched in 2020 but has already become quite attractive among players to send and receive payments within the environment. </p>
<p>This popularity helped the Gala (GALA) coin reach its all-time high of $0.8367 in 2021. However, the token has been on a downward trend ever since then. Currently, the Gala (GALA) coin is heading down a negative trajectory again, dropping by 11% in a single day as it is currently trading at $0.04622. Another negative indicator is that its market cap has also been losing strength, going down 11.60% in the same period. Experts believe this bearish trend is bound to continue as Gala (GALA) fails to reach the $0.050 support level.</p>
