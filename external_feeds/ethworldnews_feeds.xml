<ul><li>Three Arrows Capital’s (3AC) Grails Collection has been auctioned off by Sotheby’s for almost $2.5 million.&nbsp;</li><li>The NFTs that were sold included Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza #725 CryptoPunk #1326 and Dmitri Cherniak’s Ringers #375.</li><li>Fidenza #725 attracted the highest bid of over $1 million, exceeding the high estimate by nearly five times.&nbsp;</li><li>The NFTs sold in Grails Collection’s auction are separate from the NFT collection put together by 3AC’s Starry Night Capital.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Auction house Sotheby’s has successfully auctioned off a series of rare NFTs associated with Three Arrows Capital (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3acs-su-zhu-arthur-hayes-restraining/">3AC</a>). The popular Grails Collection, which was seized from the defunct crypto hedge fund last year, has been sold for almost $2.5 million. The auction comes three months after Three Arrows Capital’s liquidator announced its intention to sell a part of the firm’s massive digital art collection. </p>



<h2><strong>3AC’s Fidenza #725 Rakes In Over $1 Million In Sotheby&#8217;s Auction</strong></h2>



<p>Sotheby’s Metaverse, the digital art subsidiary of the auction house, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Sothebysverse/status/1659694250215485440" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to announce that it had sold seven NFTs from 3AC’s Grails Collection. The auction was part of a multi-part sale announced by the defunct crypto hedge fund’s liquidator Teneo earlier this year. The most expensive NFT sold was Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza #725 ($1.01 million), which attracted a bid five times its estimated price of $120,000-$180,000. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The second highest bid was for Larva Labs’ Autoglyph #187, which raked in $571,500 despite having an estimated price of $120,000-$180,000. Other NFTs that were auctioned include Larva Labs’ Crypto Punk #1326, which sold for $165,000, Ringers #194 ($152,400), 0xDEAFBEEF’s Series 1: Angular &#8211; Token 134 ($241,300), Ringers #375 ($95,250) and Fidenza #861 ($241,300). Every piece of digital art from 3AC’s Grails Collection sold for considerably higher than the auction house’s estimate. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“The emergence of this collections marks a significant opportunity for collectors to celebrate the pioneering generative artists who helped bring the form to this wider audience, and who continue to push for form forward.” </p><cite>Michael Bouhanna, Sotheby’s Head of Digital Art and NFTs. </cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/series/grails-property-from-an-iconic-digital-art-collection" rel="nofollow noopener">Sotheby’s</a> described the Grails Collection as some of the rarest and most important works from the most sought-after creators in the Digital Art markets. The auctioned NFTs are not part of the highly coveted NFT portfolio of 3AC’s Starry Night Capital. </p>

<ul><li>Miami-based M7 Holdings has successfully acquired FTX’s crypto derivatives exchange LedgerX.</li><li>The acquisition will diversify the portfolio of M7’s parent firm, which operates the Bermuda Stock Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange.</li><li>FTX is set to lose roughly $250 million on LedgerX’s sale to M7. The deal is estimated to be worth $50 million.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Miami-based M7 Holdings LLC has completed the acquisition of LedgerX from FTX. News of the successful sale comes two weeks after the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-court-allow-ledgerx-sale/">approved</a> the deal between FTX’s bankruptcy estate and the Miami International Holdings affiliate. The bankrupt crypto exchange previously estimated the proceeds from the deal to be $50 million. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX Bears $250 Million Loss On LedgerX Deal</strong></h2>



<p>FTX had paid a whopping $298 million for LedgerX in August 2021. The sale to M7 Holdings represents a nearly $250 million loss for the bankrupt crypto exchange. According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miax-completes-acquisition-of-ledgerx-from-ftx-debtors-301829665.html" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) earlier today, the acquisition of LedgerX will help in diversifying the portfolio of its parent firm Miami International Holdings Inc. The firm currently operates Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (MIAX), MIAX PEARL, LLC (MIAX Pearl), MIAX Emerald, LLC (MIAX Emerald), Minneapolis Grain Exchange, LLC (MGEXTM), The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), and Dorman Trading LLC. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are pleased to complete this acquisition and welcome the LedgerX team to the MIH family as we continue to execute on our strategy of operating regulated financial markets both in the U.S. and internationally.&#8221; </p><cite>Thomas P. Gallagher, Chairman and CEO of MIH</cite></blockquote>



<p>LedgerX is a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated exchange and clearinghouse that is registered as a Designated Contract Market (DCM), Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), and Swap Execution Facility (SEF) with the CFTC. The acquisition is in line with Miami International Holding’s growth strategy, which aims to offer new and innovative products to the swaps and futures industry.</p>

<ul><li>Celsius Network’s bankruptcy auction is nearing its end with a possible conclusion within one week.&nbsp;</li><li>A consortium of investors that includes Coinbase has emerged as the top bidder for the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The bids submitted in the auction have exceeded the initial bid from NovaWulf by hundreds of millions of dollars.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Celsius Network is reportedly planning to conclude its ongoing bankruptcy auction within days. The bankruptcy auction, which commenced on April 22, 2023, has seen participation from multiple groups of investors backed by Wall Street Heavyweights. The auction process has reportedly attracted competitive bids from investors that are looking to restart the firm under new management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase’s Consortium Poised To Win The Auction For Celsius’ Assets</strong></h2>



<p>A consortium of investors led by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington’s Arrington Capital is reportedly poised to win the bankruptcy auction for Celsius’ assets. The consortium, Fahrenheit LLC, includes Coinbase, U.S. Data Mining Group Inc, Proof Group Capital Management LLC, Ravi Kaza, and former Algorand CEO Steven Kokinos. Fahrenheit LLC faced competition from the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee, which counts Gemini Trust Company, Global X Digital, and Plutus Lending LLC among its backers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ross Kwasteniet, an attorney representing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-alex-mashinsky-dismisses-lawsuit/">Celsius</a> Network, told bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles that while the auction process has taken longer than expected, it has attracted highly competitive bids from the participating investors. The bids from Fahrenheit and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee have reportedly exceeded the initial bid from NovaWulf LLC by “hundreds of millions of dollars.”. Kwasteniet further revealed that the crypto lender plans to conclude the auction “within a week.”. The competitive bids for Celsius’ assets will ultimately provide more value to its creditors and customers who have been stranded since July last year. </p>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-crypto-company-celsius-could-get-new-life-from-wall-street-3ee6df0f?mod=markets_minor_pos10" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Wall Street giant Apollo Global Management is backing NovaWulf’s bid to acquire Celsius’ assets. This consortium will compete against Arrington’s Fahrenheit, which is backed by senior executives at Fortress Investment Group. People familiar with the matter revealed that each proposal would contribute roughly $50 million to help Celsius resume its operations and guide it out of bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Ethereum stakers have locked up over 2 million tokens so far in May alone, setting a new all-time high.</li><li>Dune analytics data showed that daily ETH withdrawals have also slowed down after Kraken’s massive unlocks.</li><li>Nansen’s Martin Lee noted that staking deposits post-Shanghai indicate strong overall confidence in both the blockchain and ETH as an asset.</li></ul>



<p>Over 2 million Ether (ETH), the native asset on the Ethereum blockchain, has been staked on the network&#8217;s beacon chain so far this May 2023.</p>



<p>This number of tokens locked up this month signals a new all-time high for staked ETH (stETH), per Dune analytics data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The uptick in depositors has continued since the Shapella upgrade enabled withdrawals. Despite fears that over 18 million of unlocked coins would subject ETH to significant selling pressure, deposits have eclipsed withdrawals and rendered falling price concerns a “non-event”.</p>



<p>Nansen data showed that the majority of unstakers or withdrawals have been exchanges like Kraken and not users. Notably, Kraken’s massive unlock was earmarked for internal operations at the crypto exchange as against speculations that the platform planned to dump its staked holdings after the unlock.</p>

<h2>Interest In ETH And LSDs Boomed After Shapella</h2>



<p>Indeed, the inflow of tokens into the beacon chain and liquid staking services like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/lido-finance-activate-ethereum-withdrawal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/lido-finance-activate-ethereum-withdrawal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> signals strong overall confidence” in both ETH and the Ethereum network by users.</p>



<p>Enabling withdrawals has also lowered the risks associated with staking into liquid staking derivatives (LSDs), said Nansen data scientist <a href="https://www.nansen.ai/research/ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-explained-key-metrics-to-track-and-future-predictions" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nansen.ai/research/ethereum-shanghai-upgrade-explained-key-metrics-to-track-and-future-predictions" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Martin Lee</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With withdrawals enabled, there’s lower odds of seeing de-pegs between the liquid staking tokens and ETH itself since withdrawals can be facilitated by official mechanisms instead of the psuedo mechanism introduced by swapping stETH with ETH in Lido’s case.</p></blockquote>



<p>Crypto users are also incentivized to stake their ETH as opposed to holding the asset on exchanges or self-custody devices like hardware wallets since the former could generate yield and returns. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The State Prosecutor’s Office in the capital Podgorica filed an appeal contesting Do Kwon’s bail.</li><li>A Basic Court approved a bail worth £400,000 ($437,000) for the TerraUSD creator Do Kwon and another Terraform executive Han Chang-Joon a day after their lawyers filed the request.</li><li>Authorities from South Korea and the U.S. want to extradite Kwon for trial in Terra’s $40 billion collapse saga.</li></ul>



<p>The bail granted to TerraUSD creator Do Kwon and his fellow Terraform Labs executive Han Chang-Joon by a Basic Court in Montenegro was <a href="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/pDQy" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://sudovi.me/ospg/sadrzaj/pDQy" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">contested</a> by local prosecutors nearly a week later. </p>



<p>On May 12, Kwon and Han&#8217;s lawyers <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/terrausd-do-kwon-granted-bail-montenegro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secured</a> approval from the court to release the defendants a day after the request was filed. A £400,000 ($437,000) bail for each defendant was issued, allowing both suspects to leave detention after making bail and enter home arrest pending further hearings.</p>



<p>Less than a week later on May 17, the State Prosecutor’s Office in Podgorica appealed the court ruling. </p>



<p>Do Kwon and Han were arrested before they boarded a private jet bound for Dubai from Podgorica, Montenegro&#8217;s capital city. Local police said the suspects were detained with forged travel papers, as confirmed by the Interpol office in Brussels. </p>



<p>Montenegrin prosecutors charged Kwon and his travel companion with forgery, an offense that could attract a 5-year prison sentence if found guilty. The suspects are currently under house arrest and awaiting trial for forgery charges that they <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-denies-montenegro-charges/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/do-kwon-denies-montenegro-charges/" rel="noreferrer noopener">pleaded</a> &#8220;not guilty&#8221; to.</p>



<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Multi-Jurisdiction Legal Showdown</h2>



<p>The former Terraform Labs CEO faces charges and prosecution from multiple governments including his home country South Korea and the U.S. where his company onboarded users. </p>



<p>South Korea investigators argue that its better to try Kwon in South Korea and have seized around $176 million in assets from the TerraUSD creator. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/prosecutors-do-kwon-extradition/" rel="noreferrer noopener">If convicted in his home country</a>, Kwon could face at least 40 years behind bars.</p>



<p>Criminal charges have already been <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/judge-sec-dig-do-kwon-terra-and-lfg-files/" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> against Do Kwon in the U.S. with an eight count indictment including fraud charges and securities violations. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Department of Justice Trustee Andrew R. Vara argued that the court must reassess its decision not to appoint an independent examiner in the FTX bankruptcy case.</li><li>Judge John Dorsey ruled against the appointment in February, backing the FTX estate’s claims about the unnecessary costs of an examiner and slowing down proceedings.</li><li>The ruling constituted a “legal error” filed by U.S. Trustee Vara who added costs concerns do not overshadow statutory requirements.</li></ul>



<p>Department of Justice Trustee Andrew R. Vara <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66955907/38/in-re-ftx-trading-ltd/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66955907/38/in-re-ftx-trading-ltd/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed</a> that the court must reassess its decision not to appoint an independent examiner in the FTX bankruptcy case.</p>



<p>Delaware Bankruptcy Court Judge John Dorsey previously ruled against hiring an independent examiner to investigate FTX&#8217;s collapse. The bankrupt estate <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-court-argument-examiner-probe/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-court-argument-examiner-probe/" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> that appointing an examing would slow down the case and the costs might exceed $100 million, an unnecessary expense that could limit the funds available to creditors, the crypto exchange said. </p>



<p>John Dorsey backed the estates&#8217; arguments and ruled against appointing an examiner in a February court hearing. </p>



<h2>Independent Examiner Revisited In FTX Case</h2>



<p>A Wednesday filing from the U.S. DOJ Trustee called Judge Dorsey&#8217;s ruling a &#8220;legal error&#8221;. The filing stressed that FTX met the criteria for an independent examiner. U.S. Trustee Vara&#8217;s filing noted that costs concerns and fast proceedings do not overshadow statutory requirements.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>&#8230;any costs associated with appointing an examiner do not justify departure from the statutory requirement to appoint an examiner where, as here, the statutory criteria are met.</p></blockquote>



<p>During previous arguments regarding the matter, U.S. Trustee Vara emphasized the need to hire an independent examiner to look under FTX&#8217;s hood and demystify the company&#8217;s books after the crypto exchange collapsed due to a lack of corporate controls. </p>



<p>At the time, the DOJ also pointed to existing precedent in the Celsius case where a report from an independent examiner <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/examiners-report-confirms-that-celsius-operated-like-a-ponzi-scheme/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/examiners-report-confirms-that-celsius-operated-like-a-ponzi-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered a Ponzi scheme-like structure</a> and massive malpractice by company executives. </p>



<p>In other FTX news, the bankrupt crypto exchange is suing founder Sam Bankman-Fried and other former executives over lack of due diligence in a $220 million investment that resulted in a 99.5% loss. </p>

<ul><li>Binance Australia has suspended Australian Dollar (AUD) services, including withdrawals.&nbsp;</li><li>The crypto exchange’s Australian arm blamed issues with the local payment service provider for suspending fiat services.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange is currently working to secure an alternative payment service provider to resume AUD services.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Australian arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange has suspended withdrawals and deposits in Australian Dollars (AUD). Binance Australia announced earlier today that it had halted AUD fiat payment services following issues with its local payment service provider. The buying and selling of crypto assets using credit and debit cards is reportedly unaffected.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Binance Is Looking For An Alternative Payment Service Provider</strong></h2>



<p>Binance Australia took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1659018600496373760" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to inform its customers about the latest development. The crypto exchange revealed that a decision made by its third-party payment service provider led to the suspension of PayID AUD deposits for the platform’s users with immediate effect. The exchange’s local payment service provider revealed that AUD bank transfer withdrawals have also been affected by the ongoing issue. </p>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-exit-canadian-market-regulations/">Binance</a> told its Australian users that it was working to find an alternative payment service provider in the country to resume AUD deposits and withdrawals. The platform’s users can still access the Binance P2P marketplace and trade crypto assets using bank cards. The exchange assured users that their funds were safe on the trading platform. The users were also reminded that all funds were insured by the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), which offers protection to the exchange’s users in the event of “extreme situations.”</p>



<p>Binance Australia’s AUD bank transfer suspension comes just a month after the exchange had its local derivatives canceled by the country’s top securities regulator. The crypto community on Twitter expressed concern at exchange’s latest development. One user highlighted that earlier this year, the main international crypto exchange had suspended US Dollar bank transfers without specifying any reason. </p>

<ul><li>Voyager Digital has won the bankruptcy court’s approval to start repaying its creditors and customers.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt crypto lender’s customers will only be able to recover 35% of the amount they’re owed.&nbsp;</li><li>The repayment to customers may go up depending on the outcome of third-party claim disputes.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York has approved Voyager Digital’s Chapter 11 plan to wind down its operations and distribute its remaining assets to customers. The latest development comes as much-needed good news for the crypto lender’s customers who have been stranded since the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July last year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Additional Repayment To Customers Contingent On Voyager’s Outstanding Claim Disputes</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-17/voyager-cleared-to-liquidate-start-repaying-customers-crypto#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Manhattan bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles approved Voyager’s Chapter 11 procedures which laid out its plans to execute liquidation and repayment to creditors. The procedures, which were <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x193/11753/PLEADINGS/1175305052380000000083.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">filed</a> earlier this month, informed the court how the bankrupt crypto lender planned to manage its remaining assets worth over $1.3 billion. The amount represents about 76% of the aggregate value of customer claims against Voyager’s bankruptcy estate. Voyager’s customers are owed over $1.7 billion as per bankruptcy filings. </p>



<p>However, the customers will only receive 35.72% of their claim amount. According to the bankrupt crypto lender, the remaining amount will be held back until all outstanding claims disputes with third parties are settled. As per the initial creditor recovery calculation, $445 million will be held back on account of the preference claims associated with the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX and its sister firm Alameda Research. Voyager plans to retain another $135.6 million for its litigation reserve and to pay for the wind-down costs. An additional $49.9 million will be held back for administrative and priority tax claims. Adding another $74.1 million related to miscellaneous holdbacks, the subtotal of holdbacks comes to $704.6 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Voyager has stated that the customers may receive more than 35% of their claim amount, depending on the outcome of preference claim disputes related to FTX and Alameda Research. The customers may see additional <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-to-repay-creditors-coming-weeks/">repayment</a> given that the Voyager bankruptcy estate is also a creditor in the Three Arrows Capital liquidation. All subsequent recoveries will be made in either cash or crypto at the Plan Administrator’s discretion.</p>

<ul><li>A parliamentary committee in the UK wants unbacked crypto assets to be regulated as gambling rather than financial activity.&nbsp;</li><li>The Treasury Committee’s latest report compelled the government to treat crypto assets like BTC and ETH as gambling instruments.</li><li>The committee highlighted the risk to retail investors from the volatility associated with crypto trading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Lawmakers in the United Kingdom want unbacked crypto assets to be held to the same standards as gambling instruments. The House of Commons Treasury Committee published a report earlier today which compelled the government to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bahamas-stricter-crypto-regulations-ftx/">regulate</a> crypto trading and related investments as gambling. </p>



<h2><strong>Crypto Including BTC &amp; ETH To Be Regulated As Gambling</strong></h2>



<p>According to the 28-page <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm5803/cmselect/cmtreasy/615/report.html" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> that was put together by lawmakers from multiple parties, mainstream crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum should be regulated as gambling. The lawmakers argued that the potential use of such cryptocurrencies by fraudsters and money launderers poses a significant risk to consumers and the economy. The report compelled the UK government to recognize and regulate unbacked cryptocurrencies as gambling instruments. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With no intrinsic value, huge price volatility and no discernible social good, consumer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin more closely resembles gambling than a financial service, and should be regulated as such.” </p><cite>Harriett Baldwin, member of Parliament and Chair of the Treasury Committee </cite></blockquote>



<p>The lawmakers behind the report argued that the volatility associated with the trading of unbacked crypto assets categorized it as sports betting rather than investing. To that end, the government has been recommended to not consider crypto trading a financial activity. The report comes amid the government’s plans to develop comprehensive regulations for the crypto industry. The lawmakers have warned that regulating retail crypto trading will create a “halo effect”, prompting retail investors to perceive crypto trading as safer than it is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Treasury Committee’s report took into account the events that transpired in the crypto industry in 2022. The string of bankruptcies and scandals cost crypto investors billions of pounds and highlighted the risks associated with crypto assets. However, the report acknowledged that crypto’s underlying blockchain technology may be of use to the country’s financial sector.&nbsp;</p>
