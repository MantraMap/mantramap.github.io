<p>Key Points:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Securities Commission of The Bahamas moved $3.5 billion of FTX assets to a wallet controlled by the commission.</em></li>



<li><em>The regulator said the digital assets are being held on a temporary basis.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang no longer have access to the transferred or frozen tokens.</em></li>

<h5><strong>The Securities Commission of The Bahamas (SCB) has directed the transfer of all digital assets in FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas unit of FTX, valued at more than $3.5 billion, to digital wallets controlled by the commission, a <a href="https://www.scb.gov.bs/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SCB-seeks-court-direction-Press-Release-29Dec22-Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">document</a> said by SCB on Dec.</strong></h5>

<p>The Bahamas Securities Commission explained that based on information provided to the Commission by SBF about cyberattacks on the FTX Digital Markets Ltd (FTXDM) system, limited access by FTXDM employees to its AWS system name and other available information, <strong>the Commission has determined that digital assets under the custody or control of FTXDM already exist.</strong></p>



<p>Accordingly, in exercising its supervisory powers, the Commission requested and received a court order to protect digital assets owned by FTXDM or its head or manage them by transferring them to a secure digital wallet under the Commission&#8217;s exclusive control. The regulator said the digital assets are being held on a temporary basis.</p>



<p>The regulator <a href="https://news.coincu.com/151785-bahamas-denies-cooperation-with-sbf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reiterates</a> that it <strong>does not direct, authorize or advise FTXDM to prioritize withdrawals from Bahamian clients in any way</strong>, and further notes that such transactions could be described as priorities. Offer is revocable under insolvency, resulting in the withdrawal of funds from Bahamian clients&#8217; funds.</p>

<p>The commission&#8217;s CEO, Christina Rolle, said that upon completion of the transfer, <strong>FTX founders Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang no longer have access to the transferred or frozen tokens. </strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“All transferred assets were and remain under the sole control of the commission,”</p>
<cite>Rolle said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Earlier, the new chief executive officer of FTX and Lawyers for crypto exchange FTX earlier this month opposed a demand for internal records from its Bahamian business, saying they “do not trust” the Bahamian government with data that could be used to siphon off assets from the collapse company.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The voting distribution for&nbsp;the proposal&nbsp;has already passed the minimum threshold and 148 million users voted for it.</em></li>



<li><em>As the $100 million repurchase request would be approved tomorrow, BITDAO&#8217;s bit token is up 20%.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Forward with the anticipated approval of a $100 million repurchase plan, the price of BitDAO&#8217;s bit token increased more than 20% in less than 24 hours.</strong></h5>

<p>With<strong> 148 million yes votes and no votes against</strong>, the proposal&#8217;s <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0xba5e1b00546f6f373cd86fe69b2d03324fb158243c9d88f347471dcd1fe1746d" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://snapshot.org/#/bitdao.eth/proposal/0xba5e1b00546f6f373cd86fe69b2d03324fb158243c9d88f347471dcd1fe1746d" rel="noreferrer noopener">voting </a>distribution has already surpassed the necessary level. The vote ought to pass unless something unexpected happens before the deadline on December 30 at 11 p.m. EST.</p>



<p>As Coincu reported on December 20, the strategy is&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;in a governance proposal submitted to the DAO.&nbsp;<strong>BitDAO</strong>&nbsp;should set its daily goal to buy amount at&nbsp;<strong>$2 million in USDT for 50 days</strong> starting on January 1 as part of the buybacks. If authorized, at the conclusion of the planned 50 days, the DAO will have spent&nbsp;$100 million in USDT&nbsp;to repurchase it&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>bit token</strong>. The idea also builds on earlier repurchase programs.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2306.png" alt="BitDAO Token Rises 20% As $100 Million Buyback Proposal Expects To Pass  " class="wp-image-156719" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2306.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2306-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2306-768x404.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2306-750x394.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BitDAO Token Rises 20% As $100 Million Buyback Proposal Expects To Pass 7"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The plan listed &#8220;limited deployment opportunities&#8221; as one of the justifications for giving token holders their money back who had too much. <strong>The BitDAO treasury is anticipated to keep $300 million in USDT and USDC</strong>, along with an extra 270,000 ether valued at about $345 million, even after the repurchase campaign.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>$1.7 billion in treasury held by BitDAO</strong>, half of which is in the native&nbsp;<strong>bit</strong>&nbsp;<strong>token</strong>, will be used for the repurchase as Coincu previously <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153857-bitdao-proposes-token-buyback/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/153857-bitdao-proposes-token-buyback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>. As a result, after the conclusion of the repurchase period, the DAO’s share of holdings in its native coin will take another rise.</p>



<p>BitDAO is an investment DAO that has supported different research, development, and grant programs, such as Mantle and zkSync&#8217;s zkDAO, which received $200 million from BitDAO and finances awards for its ecosystem. </p>

<p>In recent years, there has been a noteworthy increase in the significance of payment applications in the financial industry. Users are using these types of applications more than ever before, and their integration into the bitcoin realm has been consistent.</p>



<p>As a result, the largest cryptocurrency trading platform by volume is mass-implementing them. <strong><a href="https://news.coincu.com/156150-changpeng-zhao-binance-wont-go-bankrupt/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/156150-changpeng-zhao-binance-wont-go-bankrupt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance </a>has announced that customers can now purchase cryptocurrency using Apple Pay and Google Pay in their newest Tweet.</strong></p>

<p>The possibility for a sizable market share of people interested in digital assets is undoubtedly enabled by the fact that both mobile wallets are among the most widely used on the market. According to Business.com, <strong>there are 43.9 million users of Apple Pay while Google Pay has 25 million users</strong>, making it the leading and second most popular digital wallet overall.</p>



<p>Additionally, <strong>the arrival of these mobile wallets in the cryptocurrency space represents a development in the accessibility of digital assets</strong>. The simplicity of use that this type of upgrade offers has the ability to bring Binance and the industry as a whole the newest users into the realm of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Despite the usefulness of the payment integrations, <strong>there will be a certain number of users that are not able to utilize the services due to Apple Pay and Google Pay not working in all countries.</strong></p>

<p>According to a tweet Celsius sent on Wednesday, the application to extend the deadline will be heard by the bankruptcy court handling the issue at a hearing on <strong>January 10</strong>. </p>



<p>The deadline for customer claims is, at the very least, postponed until the hearing. The corporation wants to give account holders more time to provide any supporting documentation. Later this week, it will submit a motion asking for a postponement of the bar date.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, <strong>Celsius</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/149531-celsiuss-plan-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gained</a> court authority to extend its exclusivity period until <strong>February 15</strong>, during which time the company did not have to file for bankruptcy.</p>



<p>During a hearing on <strong>December 7</strong>, the US court <a href="https://news.coincu.com/150018-celsius-return-44m-crypto-assets-to-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered</a> Celsius to refund users&#8217; escrow accounts with almost <strong>$44 million in cryptocurrency</strong>. This sum pales in comparison to the money that is still trapped on users&#8217; platforms.</p>



<p>The company then <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153989-celsius-considering-acquisition-offers/">filed</a> with the court that it was receiving multiple offers to acquire its retail platforms and mining business. Celsius advisors are still considering the acquisition. A decision will be made in <strong>mid-January 2023</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the<em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blockfi-pushes-for-robinhood-stake-also-claimed-by-ftx-11672268844" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a></em>, Judge <strong>Michael Kaplan </strong>of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Trenton, N.J., responsible for overseeing the bankruptcy of BlockFi, has agreed to review a request made by the crypto lender, which may transfer the disputed <strong>56 million Robinhood shares </strong>to a neutral account, but the judge has not yet made a decision. BlockFi lawyer <strong>Richard Anigian</strong> said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“These shares should be protected right now.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The final decision, after which a ruling will be made at a court hearing in January 2023. If BlockFi’s request is successful, the shares will be held by a brokerage or escrow account until court proceedings determine who actually owns the disputed shares.</p>



<p>Since early November, when FTX&#8217;s issues first surfaced, <strong>Robinhood&#8217;s stock had fallen by around 40%.</strong></p>



<p>Prior to the demise of FTX, the crypto exchange <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156413-sam-bankman-fried-will-plead-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> created an organization owned by him called <strong>Markets Inc.</strong>, allegedly established as collateral to <a href="https://news.coincu.com/153726-blockfi-trying-to-return-frozen-fund-to-wallet-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlockFi</a>.</p>



<p><strong>FTX</strong> <strong>has asserted its own ownership rights over the Robinhood stock</strong>, which is held by an <strong>Antiguan</strong> <strong>firm</strong> backed by <strong>Bankman-Fried</strong>.</p>

<p>According to recent court papers by BlockFi,<strong> Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd. </strong>provided the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156032-sbf-borrow-546m-alameda-buy-robinhood-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinhood shares</a> to <strong>BlockFi</strong> as collateral for more than <strong>$600 million in loans</strong> <strong>that BlockFi had issued to Alameda Research</strong>, the trading company associated with FTX, days before FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November. FTX&#8217;s U.S. management has disputed BlockFi&#8217;s assertion and asserted that Alameda is the rightful owner of the Robinhood interest.</p>



<p>The legal battle is the latest to crop up after FTX&#8217;s demise, which forced <strong>BlockFi</strong>, a longtime client, into <strong>Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</strong></p>



<p>In his sworn affidavit in Antigua, <strong>Bankman-Fried </strong>claimed that he and FTX co-founder <strong>Gary Wang </strong>had borrowed money from Alameda earlier this year to fund a brand-new Antiguan business he controlled in order to buy a <strong>7.6% interest in Robinhood.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Anigian</strong> claimed that<strong> BlockFi had evidence to back up its argument that it has a direct claim to the shares</strong>, citing a financing arrangement and an agreement from<strong> November 9</strong> in which <strong>Emergent</strong> pledged the shares as collateral for its loan guarantee.</p>



<p>In order to reply to BlockFi&#8217;s lawsuit, liquidators chosen by an <strong>Antiguan</strong> <strong>court</strong> to wind down Emergent requested extra time. According to<strong> Matthew Ziegler</strong>, an attorney for the Antiguan liquidators, their sole objective is to safeguard Emergent&#8217;s assets and determine who ought to receive the Robinhood shares.</p>

<p><strong>Devin Finzer</strong>, CEO of OpenSea, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f3e40b9b-8b29-4483-a3cd-91cef39c4d49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> to the <em>Financial Times</em> that the cryptocurrency sector had recently experienced some setbacks.</p>



<p>As online collectibles and digital artwork known as <strong>NFTs</strong>, which are based on the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, became a hype-fueled market during the previous two years, the value of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154837-nft-marketplace-opensea-blocked-cuban/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a> skyrocketed.</p>



<p>According to the OpenSea chief, there are many reasons why NFTs still have a promising future in the current ecosystem.</p>

<p>Additionally, he held the opinion that <strong>consumers would keep forking over real money to buy digital photos and display them in their homes and online virtual spaces.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“It is not necessarily the case that NFTs will always be bought and sold denominated in cryptocurrency as they are today. There are a variety of reasons why that makes sense in the current ecosystem, but as we get broader and more accessible, there is no reason that NFTs could not at least be denominated in US dollars,” Finzer told to FT.</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="418" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292-1024x418.png" alt="OpenSea Chief Seeks To Defend NFTs Amid Crypto Market Crisis" class="wp-image-156681" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292-1024x418.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292-300x123.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292-768x314.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292-750x306.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292-1140x466.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2292.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="OpenSea Chief Seeks To Defend NFTs Amid Crypto Market Crisis 29"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">   </figcaption></figure></div>


<p><strong>Finzer</strong> also believes that the NFT market is growing and could influence consumer spending in the crypto climate.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“NFTs do not exist in a vacuum, there is the overall macro climate which has changed dramatically, and that affects consumer spending and the broader crypto climate, which is experiencing a winter right now,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After all, <strong>OpenSea</strong> is also struggling with a crypto winter. The leading NFT marketplace has seen monthly trading volumes in <strong>Ethereum</strong> fall <strong>95%</strong> this year.</p>

<p>On July 24, 2022, <strong>Little Shapes NFTs</strong>, a former Twitter user, stopped posting. Today, he tweeted for the first time in 5 months.</p>

<p>According to the story shared by this FTX investor, he was in a car accident 5 months ago, coinciding with his last tweet in <strong>July</strong>. After 5 months in a severe coma, he is back and has a surprise he didn&#8217;t think could happen.</p>



<p>After noticing his brains were still discombobulated, he quickly checked his account and exclaimed:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>His aggressive tweet has garnered more than<strong> 280,000 views</strong> at the moment, as well as comments on suspicion. Some people accused <strong>Little Shapes NFTs</strong> of tweeting this out for interaction in what seems to be a scene from a movie, but he denied it.</p>

<p><strong>Little Shapes NFTs</strong> said that he eventually hoped <strong>he was still unconscious.</strong></p>



<p>The story of <strong>Little Shapes NFTs</strong> is just one of many stories among FTX investors at the moment. Even the most pessimistic person could not have expected the collapse of the <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154568-sam-bankman-fried-was-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> empire so quickly.</p>



<p>As Coincu <a href="https://news.coincu.com/156514-ftx-owned-customers-massively-sell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, at least hundreds of customers who suffered losses due to the collapse of <strong>FTX</strong>, <strong>Celsius Network</strong>, and <strong>Voyager Digital</strong> are seeking to sell their cryptocurrency claims at a deep discount so that they do not have to wait a few days, months or even years.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>NFTs are incorporated into the ecosystems of Banger and PUBG through collaboration. The earliest that the update will go live is in 2023. The blockchain portion of the development will be handled by Banger, a platform that specializes in integrating non-fungible coins into the ecosystem of various games.</em></li>



<li><em>In License to Kill, players are free to execute any number of murders. The more kills someone has, the higher they are ranked in the gaming ecosystem. Kill players as you move around the virtual globe to raise your score.</em></li>



<li><em>In Kill Frenzy, the same principles are in play, but the player is free to run over targets without counting them.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The blockchain portion of the development will be handled by <strong>Banger</strong>, a platform that specializes in integrating NFTs into the ecosystem of various games.</p>



<p>Several of Banger&#8217;s newest features will be tested in anticipation of serving millions of gamers starting with its launch.</p>



<p><strong>License to Kill</strong> is one of the <strong>Banger</strong> <strong>Alpha</strong> challenges where players try to score as many kills as possible. A player will perform better and receive more points for headshots the higher their level. In <strong>Kill Frenzy</strong>, players are tasked with running over as many people as they can. The top 10 results are shown. Players use sniper rifles to get kills as far away as possible to score the maximum points in the game <strong>Ghost Killer</strong>.</p>

<p>The gaming sector is clearly looking to NFTs for integration, even though 2022 might not be their best year. Regarding <strong>PUBG</strong> <strong>NFT</strong> integration, participants who join up for the <strong>Alpha</strong> test are instantly qualified to receive a unique <strong>Banger</strong> digital collectible. Due to innovative features and limited digital treasures that users may own and display to demonstrate their involvement in <strong>Banger</strong> from the start, the platform&#8217;s Alpha test is anticipated to draw a sizable audience.</p>



<p>Banger is a <strong>&#8220;white label&#8221; platform </strong>for integrating NFT in games. This means that <strong>PUBG will rely on Banger to handle the blockchain component rather than developing and implementing its own NFTs.</strong></p>

<p>The platform&#8217;s alpha version will show that users of games like <a href="https://news.coincu.com/75279-krafton-pubg-developer-teams-up-with-solana-labs-to-launch-play-to-earn-crypto-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PUBG</a> can use platforms like <strong>Banger</strong> without having to make an initial investment or have their gaming experience changed, said <strong>Nicolas</strong> <strong>González</strong>, Chief Product Officer at Banger.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This Alpha is going to prove that players of games like PUBG can now benefit from platforms like ours without the need to make an initial investment or see their gaming experience altered. As with previous platform test runs, we expect another full house in this ALPHA thanks to our new extra features, and especially our Limited Digital Collectibles that we want our users to own and wear in recognition for being a part of creating Banger from the very beginning,” said González.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In March of this year, <strong>Krafton</strong>, the PUBG publisher, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/75019-pubg-krafton-partners-with-solana-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a collaboration with blockchain startup <strong>Solana</strong> <strong>Labs</strong> to create and commercialize blockchain- and NFT-powered games that function on the. <strong>Solana network</strong>.</p>
