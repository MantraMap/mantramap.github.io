<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/content/dam/website-assets/collateral/financial-documents/financial-document-archive/form-8-k-12-28-2022.pdf">regulatory filing</a>, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy recently reported that it had acquired roughly 2,395 Bitcoins for a transaction price of approximately $42.8 million between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. This puts their total number of coins held at around 132,500, with a cumulative purchase price of nearly $4 billion and an average cost per coin of around $30,000.<br /><br />Notably, the corporation also sold 704 bitcoins on December 22 at a loss of around $11.8 million to receive a tax benefit. This is the company&#8217;s first Bitcoin transaction and it comes after former CEO Michael Saylor stated earlier this year that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-posts-3-4-billion-losses-on-btc-holdings-here-is-what-to-know-about-the-progress-of-doge-1-to-the-moon/">MicroStrategy</a> would never sell its stock.<br /><br />In August 2020, MicroStrategy began <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/microstrategy-bitcoin-never-sell-5-bln-crypto-stash-michael-saylor-2022-1">investing</a> in Bitcoin for the first time. MicroStrategy indicated at the time that it sees Bitcoin as a reliable store of value that is more suited to conserving wealth over time than cash and other financial alternatives. <br /><br />Furthermore, they believed that the continued development of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-and-altcoins-j-p-morgan-gives-an-indication-of-what-the-second-half-of-2022-might-hold-for-cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a> could generate larger returns than more traditional investments such as government bonds and stocks.<br /><br />Also regarded as a triumph, MicroStrategy suffered a massive failure with its large Bitcoin bet in 2022. The firm is now sitting on $1 billion in Bitcoin-related paper losses. Saylor, as previously reported, stepped down as CEO of the firm in August. Even though his gamble backfired, he remains a staunch supporter of Bitcoin.</p>

<li>Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.252, down 1.61% in the last 24 hours</li>
<li>Messari has issued a study highlighting Cardano&#8217;s accomplishments in 2022</li>
<li>Cardano&#8217;s expanding ecosystem comprises DEXs, lending and borrowing protocols, decentralized stablecoin providers</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-how-high-will-the-new-robinhood-listing-and-upcoming-vasil-fork-take-cardano-ada-price/">Cardano (ADA)</a> trades at $0.252, down 1.61% in the last 24 hours. On-chain analytics firm Messari has issued a study highlighting Cardano&#8217;s accomplishments in 2022. Cardano hosts nearly 8,000 NFT projects and 15 marketplaces, yet its monthly volume is only around $6.8 million. In the third quarter of 2022, JPG.Store attained over 90% of the market share. The top collection in space, SpaceBudz, has done over 40 million ADA in volume. In June 2022, IOG released the Cardano EVM Sidechain in alpha, allowing Solidity developers to quickly transfer apps into the Cardano ecosystem. Despite a late entry into the DeFi space, Cardano&#8217;s TVL is ranked 30th. Cardano&#8217;s expanding ecosystem comprises DEXs, lending and borrowing protocols, decentralized stablecoin providers, and any other necessary DeFi infrastructure. The DeFi ecosystem has Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap with 52%, 20%, and 19% of market share dominance, respectively. According to Santiment data, Cardano ranks as the foremost blockchain in terms of development activity in the last 30 days.</p>
<p><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $0.385, $0.300, $0.275<br />Support Levels: $0.250, $0.200, $0.150</p>
<h4>ADA/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63706 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-Daily-Dec-28-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD Daily Chart </span></em></h6>
<p>Following its continuous consolidation along the low of $0.25, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ada-price-analysis-cardano-touts-massive-on-chain-growth-in-2022-whats-next-for-ada-price/">ADA/USD</a> pair has struggled to raise bids above $0.275. The break below the psychological level of $0.30 led buyers to flee, exacerbating pessimistic sentiment. In the event of a rebound, the $0.275 and $0.30 levels have now been designated as new areas of resistance.<br /><br />On the daily chart, a bearish moving average (MA 50) and moving average (MA 200) are forming, implying that the downward acceleration may not recede at the moment. The pair is headed for lows in the $0.20 support area. A rebound may occur as a result of an oversold relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<h4>ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63707 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ADAUSD-4-Hour-Dec-28-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><em><span style="color: #999999">ADA/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></em></h6>
<p>The relative strength index is almost oversold on the 4-hours chart, which may pique the curiosity of buyers. The projected comeback in ADA/USD, on the other hand, may give trend followers opportunities to sell into strength. ADA/USD remains bearish below $0.30, falling below the 4-hour moving average (MA 50).<br /><br />If the bulls want another shot, they must break through the $0.30 barrier. A drop below $0.25 would trigger a new round of selling below the December support level of $0.247. If the pair breaks down, it might continue to fall toward the $0.20 level.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1/ SDF CEO and Executive Director <a href="https://twitter.com/DenelleDixon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@denelledixon</a> wraps up 2022 by reporting on end-of-year metrics, milestone achievements, and more.</p>
— Stellar (@StellarOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarOrg/status/1607513445607571457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2022</a></blockquote>
<p>Recalling how Stellar arose as a decentralized open-source alternative to Ripple after one of its inventors, Jed McCaleb, became dissatisfied with the development route.<br /><br />The Stellar network is believed to have seen a 176% growth in the number of payments completed, reaching 345.9 million in total. The number of XLM accounts has also increased by 17%, reaching 7.37 million. To date, the Stellar protocol has handled 3.6 billion operations, an increase of 92% year on year.<br /><br />Stellar also introduced Soroban this year, a platform for generating smart contracts that are now live on the Futurenet testnet. The group also formed a $100 million investment fund at the same time as Soroban.<br /><br />The Stellar Development Foundation report also mentions the launch of MoneyGram Access in collaboration with the same-named payment business.<br /><br />Furthermore, the humanitarian service Stellar Aid Assist was developed with this solution, which is a global on/off-ramp, allowing those in need to get USDC swiftly and later cash it out.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-price-analysis-xrp-jumps-13-ripple-sees-backing-from-another-major-player-in-lawsuit/">XRP</a> was a top gainer among the top ten cryptocurrencies on December 26 as its price suddenly jumped 8%. At the time of publication, XRP was up 6.89% in the last 24 hours at $0.368. The cross-border token was likewise up 9% over the last seven days. According to the onchain analytics firm Santiment, millionaire XRP whales are rapidly filling their bags in preparation for the 2022 closure. It observes that XRP’s whale and shark addresses that make up the 1 million to 10 million XRP tier have been rapidly accumulating to end 2022. The onchain analytics firm noted that in December, both the number of these large addresses (1,617) and their percentage of supply held (7.23%) hit an all-time high. In other news, Matt Hamilton, Ex-Ripple developer, announced upcoming developments on XRP Ledger. He revealed that the blockchain will soon introduce smart contracts, which are currently in the &#8220;development process.&#8221; Likewise, SEC General Counsel Dan Berkovitz will depart the agency, effective January 31, 2023, with Megan Barbero, appointed subsequently.</p>

The price of the pair has increased to an intraday high of $0.3698 after falling to a low of $0.3324 on December 19. The rebound is being driven by a desire to hold onto recent gains. After the RSI retreated below its midlines, buyers saw the retracement as a chance to purchase the dip.<br /><br />Even the most positive analyst expectations haven&#8217;t been able to match XRP gains, which started the day around the $0.3457 mark. The daily chart&#8217;s bullish recovery suggests that the surge might be gaining momentum. When momentum returns, the next target would be above $0.3750 and the next high of $0.3923.</p>

<p>XRP price is within the short-term moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200), with a rise on the 4-hour chart becoming well-pronounced. The bears are now on the back foot despite the recent decline to a low of $0.3324. After the relative strength index showed overextension into the overbought zone, intraday traders look to book profit. The recent rebound may present a chance for the bulls to reorganize.<br /><br />A crucial level supporting the upswing is the demand region at $0.3510. The nearest barrier on the upside is found around $0.3750 before the moving average (MA 200). And if it is breached, a larger rally toward the high of $0.4000 may begin. A closure above the immediate resistance level of $0.3750 would indicate that the short-term trend is now ranging.</p>

<p>After a $72 million bailout offer from creditors, fears have been expressed regarding the overall sustainability of the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-more-than-18-million-btc-now-removed-from-exchanges/"> Bitcoin</a> trading community amid a lengthy bear market in light of Basic Scientific&#8217;s recent bankruptcy proceedings. To get out of their unsustainable high debt levels, it turns out that public Bitcoin users have obligations of about $4 billion.<br /><br />During the bull market of 2021, the Bitcoin mining industry racked up a huge debt load, which negatively impacted their financial situation during the ensuing bear market. According to predictive analytics by Hashrate Index, the top 10 crypto mining debtors collectively owe more than $2.6 billion.<br /><br />The largest debtor in the group, Core Scientific, has applied for Chapter 11 insolvency protection in Texas due to dropping sales and <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-is-at-bottom-of-current-cycle-as-large-scale-bitcoin-liquidations-end/">BTC prices</a>. As of September 30th, Core Scientific had $1.3 bn in commitments on its income statement. Marathon, the second-largest debtor, is the primary owner of the $851 million in convertible note liabilities. Marathon avoids bankruptcy by allowing the debtors to convert the convertible notes into equity.<br /><br />The bulk of Bitcoin miners is going through a restructuring process to pay off debt, including Greenidge, the third biggest debtor. Publicly listed bitcoin mining companies have a high debt-to-equity ratio, which points to a significant risk for the industry.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoins-hashrate-now-at-an-all-time-high/">Hashrate</a> Index indicates that most industries consider a debt-to-equity ratio of two or above to be risky. The graph below shows how some of the more well-known Bitcoin miners currently have exceptionally high debt-to-equity ratios. Given that more than 50% of the 25 publicly traded bitcoin miners display extraordinarily high debt-to-equity ratios, the mining industry may suffer possible restructurings as well as bankruptcy procedures unless the bulls mount a comeback.<br /><br />While some companies may stop or reduce operations to save money, this will allow sustainable miners to extend their footprint by acquiring the properties and machinery of competing businesses.<br /><br />The banking institution <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nydig-survey-46-million-americans-hold-bitcoin/">NYDIG</a>, which focuses on Bitcoin, and Greenidge reached an agreement to restructure $74 million in debt on December 20.<br /><br />As per the conditions of the NYDIG deal, a mining capacity of 2.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) or more would be obtained. The mining company would receive a debt reduction worth between $57M and $68M in exchange.</p>

<p>The Japanese government approved a measure in June <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-03/japan-passes-stablecoin-bill-that-enshrines-investor-protection#xj4y7vzkg">recognizing</a> stablecoins as digital currency. As a result, Japan established one of the first significant legal frameworks for stablecoins.<br /><br />However, they had to be backed by the fiat yen of Japan or some other kind of legal money that permitted holders to use them at face value. However, the bill did not mention foreign <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoins-were-knocked-off-their-pegs-due-to-crypto-volatility/">stablecoins</a> backed by assets like Tether.<br /><br />According to a recent development, the Japanese Financial Services Agency [FSA] may decide to lift the restriction on the circulation of stablecoins like Tether and USDC per a recent <a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=419032">CoinsPaid</a> article in English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2023, the Financial Services Agency will lift the ban on domestic distribution of stablecoins issued overseas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remittance cap will be set at 1 million yen ($7500) for each transaction, according to the newspaper.<br /><br />Issuers will need to gather collateral assets for domestically created stablecoins. Banks, trust corporations, and companies offering fund transfers are the only issuers allowed.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/japanese-fsa-cautious-about-crypto-based-etfs-cites-volatility/">FSA</a> will also require stablecoin distributors to record transaction information like user identities as a money laundering prevention tool. According to CoinsPaid, the agency will begin soliciting feedback on the proposed stablecoin criteria from January 26.<br /><br />Japan&#8217;s position on cryptocurrencies has significantly softened over time. The <em>&#8220;New Capitalism&#8221;</em> philosophy of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida aims to strengthen Japan&#8217;s economy. The nation just made public its entry into the NFT, Metaverse space. In parallel, the government is attempting to relax cryptocurrency tax laws.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/december-is-a-historic-month-here-is-what-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-traders-could-expect/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, is down 1.25% in the last 24 hours at $1207. According to Glassnode alerts, Ethereum’s 7-day exchange outflow volume has reached a two-year low of $10,361,174. Likewise, the number of exchange withdrawals in a 7-day timeframe is now at a 21-month low of 2,281. The number of addresses receiving from exchanges is down to a 23-month low of 1,507.

The price trades above the ascending trendline (pattern) at $1,100. For the upside to gain traction, a sustained rise above $1,300 is required.<br /><br />A cluster of important support at $1,200 and $1,000, on the other hand, should buffer the fall. For the pair, the region is a vital confluence zone of support activity. A break below will reveal the next support level at $1,000, which will be tested. The low of $879.80 set in June will be the next target for sellers.</p>

<p>Ethereum short-term support has been set at $1,200. In the 4-hour range, the crypto&#8217;s immediate upside is restrained by the MA 200 at $1,235. The seller congestion at $1,100 is still in place, and the bearish case toward $879 will most likely be delayed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is still at an oversold level. <br /><br />This means that the market has greater room for growth. Overall, the negative price pattern predicts that the ETH/USD pair would decline toward $1,000. The pair is only bullish when trading over $1,300; major resistance levels are identified around $1,500 and $1,700. Sellers may test the $879 low if the pair goes below $1,000.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC continues to struggle amid worries about a global recession</li>
<li>The local top for BTC/USD was set at $17,060 during the week</li>
<li>The period of large-scale liquidations is over</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs are rising that global cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin are set for a dramatic rebound after prices steadied post-panic triggered by<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-token-trading-volume-jumps-1060-as-price-rises-on-ftx-revival-proposal-supported-by-sam-bankman-fried/"> FTX collapse</a> as the FUD begins to wane. Although BTC price remains subdued at the moment, Santa Claus sentiment might begin to brighten investors&#8217; hope for a positive end-of-year rally. BTC continues to struggle amid worries about a global recession. The local top for BTC/USD was set at $17,060 during the week, but might end lower, in the $16,800 range. In the meantime, at the time of writing this analysis, BTC/USD is trading around $16,830. The total capitalization of the crypto market for the week decreased by almost 1.0% and amounted to $0.810 trillion. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, believes that the first cryptocurrency has reached the low of the current cycle, as almost all <em>“irresponsible organizations”</em> have run out of coins to sell. At the same time, the expert believes that the period of large-scale liquidations is over.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $20,000, $18,500, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $15,000, $13,000, $10,000</p>
<h4>BTC/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63672 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">BTC/USD Daily Chart</span></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-price-raises-a-warning-flag-due-to-this-rare-occurrence-details/">Bitcoin price</a> is creating a continuous straight-line formation following its plunge to the $15,460 low on November 21. The BTC/USD pair dropped below $16,000, breaking through the $15,500 support that had kept the bears in check, putting the RSI near the oversold territory. The latter raises the possibility of continued consolidation or correction.<br /><br />In the event of a collapse, the bears will most likely test the $15,000 level before reaching the $13,000 support around $10,000, from which the bulls may attempt another uptrend. On the other hand, the BTC price may seek new lows somewhere between $13,000 and $11,000. The bearish aligned MA 50 and 200 maintain pessimism.</p>
<h4>BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63674 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>Bitcoin has remained trapped within the four-hour moving average (MA 50 and 200) after reactivating an uptrend from the $15,460 bottom. The most recent move is restricted by the moving averages. More advances could push the price to the $18,000 territory, flirting with the $19,000 to $20,000. Otherwise, if the market falls below the $15,000 level, the $10,000 support level may come into play.<br /><br />The MA 50, which is presently at $16,800, may limit the bulls before reaching $18,000. In summary, the BTC price is considered to be in consolidation, albeit a minor rebound or correction may occur to bring the RSI above its midline. Corrective drops, on the other hand, could be viewed as the bulls&#8217; entry point into the market, since BTC may consolidate further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-loses-almost-15b-from-its-market-cap/">SHIB</a> lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama has taken to Twitter to share expectations for the Shibarium layer 2 solutions. According to him, Shibarium is unlikely to be released during the holidays or <em>‘’the resulting New Year&#8217;s party time.’’</em><br /><br />He tweeted <em>&#8220;Happy Holidays&#8221;</em> to more than half the globe. Wen Shibarium? Please know it will come very soon, but not during a crucial time for people to spend with their family (or the resulting New Year&#8217;s party time). Enjoy these next days, next year is an important one for humanity.<br /><br />Earlier, Kusama disclosed in a Telegram update that the much-anticipated Shibarium Beta testing phase will soon launch. According to a screenshot of the Telegram message, Kusama first said, “seriously, it’s coming,” while adding that <em>“Beta is near for Shibarium’’.</em><br /><br />Meanwhile, the team has not chosen an exact date for Shibarium Beta testing. With what the SHIB lead developer stated on Twitter, it might be safe to assume that Shibarium Beta testing may go live by Q1 next year.<br /><br />Shibarium builder, Unification, had disclosed earlier this year that the beta testing for the L2 network would launch by the end of Q3. However, things did not go as planned.<br /><br />In recent weeks, several <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-balance-held-by-top-100-holders-grows-even-bigger-with-fresh-53-billion-token-addition/">SHIB holders</a> believed that Shibarium’s launch was imminent after some team members shared a special countdown. The SHIB lead developer had also sparked expectations when he said his focus was on Shibarium. <br /><br />Unfortunately, many were disappointed to find out that the countdown was for the SHIB website upgrade. SHIB Trophias, a Shiba Inu developer revealed that the website upgrade was necessary for the launch of Shibarium.</p>
<h2>2.4 Trillion SHIB Moved In Between Whales’ Wallet</h2>
<p>According to WhaleAlert, 2,473,966,699,162 SHIB worth $20,533,923 was transferred between unknown wallets. At the time of publication, SHIB was marginally up at $0.0000831.<br /><br />In other news, Hero Wallet, a Web3 decentralized wallet, recently added a Guardarian payment system, allowing its customers to immediately buy and sell Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies using a bank card. <br /><br />Through this collaboration, Guardarian will provide Hero Wallet customers with more than five payment methods for processing crypto payments effortlessly and at no additional cost. Shiba Inu has recently been adopted as a default token on the Hero Wallet platform. Rather than hunting for the contract address, wallet users will now have easy access to SHIB from the add token interface.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s popularity is growing at an alarming rate all over the world. Shiba Inu has become the most popular coin of 2022 on the top Indian exchange, WazirX. Binance also ranked Shiba Inu as the third most-watched crypto asset of 2022, next to Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
