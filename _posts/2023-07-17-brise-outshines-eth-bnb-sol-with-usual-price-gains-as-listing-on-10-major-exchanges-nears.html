<p class="s5">BRISE, the native token of the Bitgert crypto platform, has recently led the crypto market with phenomenal price gains. In a report that captured the eventful week performance of BRISE, it was reported that the coin gained over 30%, pushing its crypto market cap to over $103 million.</p>
<p class="s5">Contrasting the positive growth of BRISE, other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA) experienced losses in the last 24 hours. According to data from CoinMarketCap, while BRISE maintained over 16% upward trajectory over the past seven days, ETH and BNB barely had single-digit gains.</p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, BRISE has climbed three steps up the ranking of the most significant coins within two weeks, gaining more than $3 million in market cap. The interest in the coin can be attributed to exciting development, celebrations, and collaborations around Bitgert.</p>
<p class="s5">In a recent tweet, the project announced the listing of its token, BRISE, on ten major crypto exchanges, inviting the community to join in this significant milestone.</p>
