<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-stock-jumps-revenue/">Baidu Stock Jumps 2% after Better-than-Expected Revenue News</a></p>
<p>Chinese internet giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/baidu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baidu Inc</a> (HKG: 9888) has seen a major uptick in its share price today following the release of better-than-expected revenue. Baidu impressed its investors as one of the top tech giants that saw a major uptick in profitability following the reopening of the Chinese economy after year-long Covid-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>According to the data shared by the company, it said it recorded a 31.1 billion yuan ($4.5 billion) revenue for the three months ended in March. While this revenue is impressive when compared to the projection from analysts which was pegged at 30 billion yuan. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-baidu-beats-quarterly-revenue-estimates-ad-strength-2023-05-16/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">According</a> to the company, the accrued revenue from Baidu Core, its business unit that features search-based ad sales, cloud offerings and its autonomous driving initiatives, grew 8% to 23 billion yuan.</p>
<p>As analysts from Barclays noted before the release of the Baidu results, it was revealed that the company’s “advertising business saw a nice rebound in demand especially post Chinese New Year, and the recovery might have accelerated as we are heading into 2Q”.</p>
<p>The analysts claimed that they “remain optimistic on China’s economic recovery and on the advertising industry outlook for 2023”. The company’s performance metrics are also well pronounced as net income came in at 5.8 billion yuan. This growth was recorded, thanks in part to the gains it printed on its investments.</p>
<p>Baidu is not just a major tech company in the country, it was also one of those that got severely impacted by the broader regulatory crackdown meted out on tech companies by the government. The bet from investors that tech stocks will rebound appears to be paying off with Baidu stocks used as a litmus test.</p>
<p>For its performance, the stock jumped 2.81% in Hong Kong and its price is pegged at 124.30 Hong Kong Dollars.</p>
<h2>Baidu Revenue and the Diversity Push</h2>
<p>Despite the role of Baidu as primarily an internet and marketing company, it is notably not limiting its innovation to this niche. In fact, Baidu saw an uptick in its revenue because of its diversity and the firm comes off as the first major internet giant in China to <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/baidu-chatgpt-ernie-bot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showcase</a> its response to ChatGPT, the chatbot from OpenAI that has gained immense popularity since last year.</p>
<p>Dubbed the Ernie Bot, Baidu’s goal for the new AI tool is that it will be ubiquitous and can be integrated into as many systems as possible. Some of the marked outfits include speakers, self-driving, and smart speakers among others.</p>
<p>“We can buy computing power but not the ability to innovate,” Baidu’s billionaire founder Robin Li said in an <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/baidu-revenue-beats-china-recovery-090713240.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">internal speech</a> recently, adding that “It’s just the beginning of this arena for tech competition.”</p>
<p>With its possibility, Baidu is setting the pace in the AI scene for other tech giants in China to trail.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/zepz-lays-off-restructure-business/">Fintech Group Zepz Lays Off 420 Employees to Restructure Its Business</a></p>
<p>In a bid to streamline its business structure for future growth prospects, Zepz,  a London-headquartered money transfer platform, has announced the reduction of its workforce by about 26 percent. In a report by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/fintech-unicorn-zepz-owner-of-worldremit-lays-off-26percent-of-staff.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CNBC</a>, it is said that Zepz has sent home 420 of its employees but not due to macroeconomic pressure. As a result, Zepz has been left with a total headcount of 1,180.</p>
<p>Available in more than 5,000 global money transfer corridors, Zepz has challenged remittance giants like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/western-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Western Union Co</a> (NYSE: WU). Furthermore, Zepz has over 11 million users across 150 countries and a valuation of about $5 billion following the closure of a Series E funding round with $292 million.  As a result,  Zepz is well-positioned to take over the global remittance market if well-restructured.</p>
<h2>Zepz Business Restructuring Plan</h2>
<p>According to Mark Lenhard, Zepz CEO, the company has been re-evaluating how to optimize its organization for future growth prospects</p>
<p>“The decision marked an important and necessary step in transitioning from two vast, segmented teams to one dynamic organization under Zepz, and laying ambitious foundations towards our long-term strategic direction as a portfolio business,” Lenhard noted.</p>
<p>As a result, the company noted that it is hiring for more than 200 new roles including software developers, managerial positions, and marketing roles, among many others. The company intends to support the employees who have lost their jobs at Zepz. Furthermore, the same employees helped Zepz become profitable last year.</p>
<p>“The remittance industry has maintained robust growth despite global economic conditions, and we’ve seen this audience take great measures to ensure their loved ones are supported as costs rise around the world,” Lenhard added.</p>
<p>Notably, Zepz has significantly reduced its expenses by cutting jobs that had been duplicated through the operations of two market brands Sendwave and WorldRemit. Meanwhile, the company’s CEO noted there are no planned Initial Public Offerings or exit plans in the near future. Moreover, Lenhard noted that the company’s executive leadership is pleased with the fact that the company is profitable since the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook</h2>
<p>Although Zepz has its main offices in the United Kingdom, the company’s presence is also felt in the United States, Canada, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Africa, Somaliland, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Belgium. As of 2020, Zepz had facilitated the transfer of more than $10 billion from 50 million customer transactions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the company’s future growth prospects are under pressure from Web3 tech companies like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and its ecosystem that facilitates cheaper and faster cross-border transactions. Furthermore, there has been a steady increase in the adoption of Bitcoin among other digital assets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-cloud-ai-drug-discovery/">Google Cloud Launches Two New AI Solutions to Speed Up Drug Discovery &#038; Precision Medicine</a></p>
<p>Google Cloud has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/google-cloud-launches-ai-tools-to-accelerate-drug-discovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> two AI-powered solutions to speed up drug discovery and advance precision medicine for relevant companies. On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/google/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tech giant’s</a> cloud computing suite said its newly-launched AI-powered tools would immensely help biotech and pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>One of the tools, the Target and Lead Identification Suite, can assist companies in predicting and understanding protein structure. Meanwhile, the other Google AI solution, the Multiomics Suite, could help researchers collate, analyze, and share large amounts of genomic data.</p>
<p>The recently-launched Google Cloud AI drug-discovery tools mark the company’s latest exertion in the artificial intelligence race. With AI technology still emerging, tech companies have been grappling to gain the upper hand in a market that could be highly lucrative. Google has come under increasing pressure to flex its AI muscle since <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/microsoft-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>-affiliated ChatGPT’s explosion onto the scene late last year.</p>
<h2>New Google Cloud AI-Powered Suites Set to Aid Drug Discovery Processes by Saving Time &amp; Money</h2>
<p>The two new Google Cloud suites tackle a long-standing issue in the biopharma industry. As it stands, bringing a new medicine to the US market can be time-consuming and extremely costly. According to a recent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/deloitte/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deloitte</a> report, drug companies can invest as much as $2 billion to launch a single drug. However, these efforts only sometimes lead to successful outcomes. For instance, another Deloitte report stated that medicines undergoing clinical trials face a 16% approval chance in the US. Furthermore, this bleak success rate usually materializes alongside an extensive and tedious research process that typically exceeds 10 years.</p>
<p>Speaking on the ameliorative tendencies of the two Google suites, Google Cloud’s global director of life sciences strategy and solutions, Shweta Maniar, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’re helping organizations get medicines to the right people faster. I am personally very excited; this is something that myself and the team have been working on for a few years now.”</p></blockquote>
<p>In a media session, Maniar added that the new offerings would save companies time and resources throughout the drug development process. Although both suites are immediately available to customers, Google said associated costs vary depending on the company. Notwithstanding, numerous businesses, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/pfizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pfizer</a> (NYSE: PFE), Cerevel Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CERE), and Colossal Biosciences, have started using the products.</p>
<h2>Google Image Identification Solution</h2>
<p>Google recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/google-identifying-fake-ai-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched new tools</a> for identifying and labeling fake and misleading AI-generated images. The new features are intended to stem the spread of misinformation by differentiating AI images from those captured by traditional means.</p>
<p>In an announcement leading to the image identification feature launch, Google said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We will ensure that every one of our AI-generated images has a markup in the original file to give you context if you come across it outside of our platforms. Creators and publishers can add similar markups, so you can see a label in images in Google Search, marking them as AI-generated.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Pixel Fold</h2>
<p>At its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ai-google-i-o-2023-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual developers’ conference</a> last week, Google unveiled its Pixel Fold smartphone. The tech giant had teased the device for weeks in the buildup and said it could start shipping next month.</p>
<p>The Pixel Fold starts at $1,799 and would likely compete with Samsung’s high-end phones.</p>

<p>Vodafone shares took a beating today amid company plans to layoff thousands of workers, and properly allocate resources. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/vodafone-layoff-11000-shares/">Vodafone CEO Announces Record Layoff of 11,000 Workers, Shares Sink 7%</a></p>
<p>Vodafone (LON: VOD) shares <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/vodafone-shares-drop-4percent-after-cutting-a-record-11000-jobs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell</a> 7% on Tuesday following a mass layoff announcement by the British multinational telecom company. In a statement, chief executive officer Margherita Della Valle said the company&#8217;s plan to ax a record 11,000 jobs is necessary to remain profitable. Vodafone forecasted flat profit growth and explained that the massive downsizing would take place over three years. The cut accounts for a wipeout of just over 10% of the telecom giant&#8217;s 100,000 total headcounts.</p>
<p>Expositing on Vodafone&#8217;s most significant staff reduction in company history, the recently appointed Della Valle said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our performance has not been good enough. To consistently deliver, Vodafone must change.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the chief executive officer also added:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My priorities are customers, simplicity, and growth. We will simplify our organization, cutting out complexity to regain our competitiveness. We will reallocate resources to deliver the quality service our customers expect and drive further growth from the unique position of Vodafone Business.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Vodafone Shares Drop to 84.77 GBX Amid Layoff &amp; Restructuring Plans</h2>
<p>Vodafone shares initially sank 7% following the layoff news but were trading down 5.84% at 84.77 GBX as of press time. The Berkshire-based telecom corporation faces stiff competition in key markets in Germany and Italy. However, it has a German turnaround plan and a strategic review in Spain. Furthermore, Vodafone also plans to tailor its continued pricing action to accommodate growth, with Della Valle saying that they &#8220;will focus our resources on a portfolio of right-sized products and geographies for growth and returns over time&#8221;.</p>
<p>The CEO stressed that Vodafone would rebalance its organizational structure to optimize the potential of Vodafone Business. The reason is that Vodafone Business is a crucial growth driver and has a strong position in an emerging digitized market.</p>
<h2>Vodafone Seeks to Become a &#8216;Leaner and Simpler Organization&#8217; that Focuses on Basics</h2>
<p>Vodafone plans to cover ground amid investor criticism for moving too slowly and not adopting transformative changes quickly. According to Della Valle, the British telco will be a &#8220;leaner and simpler organization&#8221; that increases commercial agility and frees up resources.</p>
<p>Vodafone has reallocated substantial FY24 investments toward customer experience and brand. This development comes in light of the company&#8217;s underwhelming fiscal year 2023 performance.</p>
<p>Vodafone also seeks to refocus on essential customer experience service quality to gain an edge in consumer markets. This also includes delivering the simple and predictably good experiences that customers expect from the brand.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ending March 31st, Vodafone reported a revenue haul of 45.7 billion euros ($49.7 billion). This figure remained unchanged versus the previous year, causing Vodafone to issue underwhelming guidance for FY24. For the fiscal year ending March 2024, the company said free cash flow would drop to 3.3 billion euros. Vodafone&#8217;s free cash flow stood at 4.8 billion euros the year before (FY23).</p>
<p>Vodafone is currently discussing a merger with Three UK owner CK Hutchinson. However, the telecom giant said there is no certainty that both parties would ultimately agree to a merger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/bny-mellon-digital-assets/">Banking Giant BNY Mellon Announces Its Long-Term Committment to Digital Assets</a></p>
<p>Over the last few years, traditional banking players have been showing some affinity towards crypto assets and America&#8217;s oldest bank BNY Mellon is the latest to join the bandwagon. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bny-mellon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BNY Mellon</a> is pushing for digital innovation while focusing on digital assets, not necessarily crypto.</p>
<p>Roman Regelman, CEO of securities services and digital at BNY Mellon, said that the banking is working on initiatives that involve the use of distributed ledger technology, tokenization, and digital cash. The banking giant started prioritizing crypto assets two years ago amid the rising client demand.</p>
<p>BNY Mellon declared its intention to securely manage, transfer, as well as facilitate the issuance of digital assets for their asset-management clientele. The American banker <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/news/bny-mellon-wants-digital-assets-to-be-part-of-every-line-of-business" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> that while the bank works on digital assets, crypto isn&#8217;t its top priority.</p>
<p>During the first-quarter earnings call last month, BNY Mellon CEO Robin Vince emphasized the bank&#8217;s cautious approach in the crypto space while characterizing their progress as &#8220;extremely slow&#8221;.</p>
<h2>BNY Mellon Focusing on Three Key Initiatives</h2>
<p>As said, the American banking giant will be focusing on three key initiatives &#8211; distributed ledger technology, tokenization, and digital cash. The bank&#8217;s digital assets strategy involves crypto at a very partial level. “Crypto is an example of digital assets, but to say that digital assets are a lot more than crypto is an understatement,&#8221; said Regelman.</p>
<p>As part of the first initiative, BNY Mellon is looking to expand its services to include the clearing and custody of digital assets. It also involves widening their offerings to include new asset classes. “Everything that we do, we want to do for digital assets,” he said.</p>
<p>Secondly, BNY Mellon will prioritize the implementation of blockchain and other technology for modernizing their infrastructure, enhancing speed, real-time capabilities, and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>As part of the third initiative, BNY Mellon will explore tokenization as a means to democratize different investment opportunities. During an October 2022 study sponsored by BNY Mellon, the banking giant said that an impressive 91% of institutional investors showed interest in investing in tokenized assets.</p>
<p>Michael Demissie, BNY Mellon&#8217;s managing director said the study reflects “that minds are changing, with traditional investors ready to imagine a world where up to one-third of their portfolios will contain digital assets”.</p>
<p>Roman Regelman said that over the next 1.5 years, the bank plans to undertake several initiatives to expand its existing businesses. “In the next year to year and a half, we’re going to do a number of things to take the businesses that we have and extend them to digital assets,” he said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-secret-service-crypto/">US Secret Service Shares Insight into Its Love for Crypto</a></p>
<p>The US Secret Service revealed that it trades crypto and owns a small collection of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a> in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/13h2mar/ama_on_rcryptocurrency_with_the_us_secret_service/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">session</a> on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>. According to reports, the Secret Service also acknowledged the potential of blockchain to boost the security and effectiveness of innovations beyond cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>On Monday, representatives from the US Secret Service San Francisco Field Office and the Bay Area Regional Enforcement Allied Computer Team (REACT) were questioned by members of the Reddit community r/cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The Secret Service responded in the affirmative when a Redditor asked about the agency’s crypto holdings. The agency responded that it is definitely a holder of crypto and defined itself as crypto &#8220;enthusiasts&#8221; in further comments. According to the agency, owning crypto helps it better comprehend the crypto world&#8217;s underlying mechanics.</p>
<p>In response to a follow-up question on how to best hide nefarious behavior on the blockchain, the Secret Service stated that if people want to do bad things financially, it&#8217;s best to take the money in cash rather than crypto. Furthermore, When a Redditor questioned if the Secret Service was thinking about developing its own “memecoin”, the agency answered that it promoted its own NFT collection on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/opensea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenSea</a>.</p>
<p>The Secret Service is a Federal law enforcement agency within the United States Department of Homeland Security, responsible for protecting the President, Vice President, and other designated individuals, as well as investigating various financial crimes, including counterfeiting and fraud.</p>
<p>To combat illegal crypto transactions, the Secret Service has successfully seized millions of dollars in cryptocurrency from criminals. Remarkably, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-secret-service-confiscates-102m-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compiled data</a> by the US Secret Service reveals the organization has seized more than $102 million in crypto assets since 2015.</p>
<h2>Secret Service and Blockchain Embrace</h2>
<p>The agency also conducts financial and cybercrime investigations. While some regulators still regard crypto as a weapon for fraudsters, the REACT team praised blockchains&#8217; open and transparent nature as an “amazing opportunity” for law enforcement to trace the flow of money.</p>
<p>Notably, Blockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, is based on a decentralized and transparent ledger system. This means that transaction data is recorded on a public blockchain, where anybody can examine and verify transactions.</p>
<p>For law enforcement agencies like the REACT task force, this transparency can provide valuable insights and investigative opportunities. By analyzing blockchain data, authorities can potentially trace the flow of funds, identify patterns, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/covid-relief-fraud-100b-secret-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detect illicit activities</a> such as money laundering, terrorist financing, or other financial crime.</p>
<p>By analyzing blockchain data, investigators can analyze cryptocurrency wallets associated with criminal activities. This analysis may involve identifying wallet addresses, tracking fund movements, and identifying any links between different wallet addresses. The agency&#8217;s role has been instrumental in fighting some high-level crimes in the crypto world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-crypto-regulatory-clarity/">SEC Says Crypto Regulatory Clarity May Take Years and They&#8217;re in No Rush</a></p>
<p>The United States Securities Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) has finally replied to Coinbase&#8217;s demand for regulatory clarity. Recall that the American exchange recently <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-action-sec-regulatory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> a petition asking the regulator to make clear crypto regulations. In a formal response issued to the court, the SEC insists that it will take its time to come up with regulations. But while the rules may take some years to make, the regulator confirms that it will carry on its enforcement actions in the meantime.</p>
<h2>SEC Insists: &#8216;We Are Under No Obligation to Meet Coinbase’s Requirements&#8217;</h2>
<p>It might be worth noting that the regulatory body does not exactly disagree with the fact that there&#8217;s a need to draw up clear policies and reforms. According to court documents <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.119939/gov.uscourts.ca3.119939.26.0_1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed</a> on May 15, SEC says the demands of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> are unrealistic as such complex reforms will take some time. The regulator ultimately argued that it is under no obligation to meet the requirements outlined in Coinbase’s recent petition. The SEC also asked the court to dismiss Coinbase’s petition. In its argument, SEC claims that Coinbase “cannot persuasively claim” that the securities regulator has caused any harm by not acting on the petition since it was initially filed. It also says that Coinbase cannot prove that SEC&#8217;s recent <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/sec-enforcement-action-coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enforcement actions</a> mean that it won&#8217;t “engage in rulemaking”.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the agency assures that it will continue to look at Coinbase’s petition in the ordinary course. That is, it would act accordingly when the time is right.</p>
<p>Coinbase also believes that progress is now being made concerning regulatory clarity. According to the exchange’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal, this may be the first time that the securities regulator is commenting on whether or not the SEC should create rules for the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the filing comes only a few hours after SEC Chair <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/gary-gensler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gary Gensler</a> gave a public speech at the Financial Markets Conference. Gensler’s speech hinted that rules for crypto have already been published and should be enough. However, the regulatory body appears to have now distanced itself from Gensler’s public commentary. Grewal said in a Twitter post:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The SEC also said that the public statements by Chair Gensler are not formal guidance or policy statements from the SEC and the public cannot rely on them as such.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Overall, it will be interesting to know what the SEC may consider to be within or outside its jurisdiction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/otc-markets-finra-digital-assets/">OTC Markets Secures FINRA Approval to Offer Digital Assets as Securities</a></p>
<p>During its earnings call earlier this week, OTC Markets announced that it has secured FINRA approval in order to provide services for digital assets as securities. This is a major development as it provides a regulated market for big investors to trade crypto securities.</p>
<p>In its quarterly report, OTC Markets mentioned that the update to its membership agreement to facilitate transactions in digital securities will allow OTC Link subscribers to quote and trade digital asset securities using the OTC Link ATS. But it&#8217;s too early to gauge whether such activity would have any material impact on OTC Link’s financial results.</p>
<p>Just like an exchange, an ATS works as a regulated trading platform. There are dozens of ATS platforms, however, most operate in the private securities market. OTC Market has a trading platform for many public securities including small banks, and global firms, as well as Grayscale funds that hold assets like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>. Speaking on the development, R. Cromwell Coulson, President and CEO of OTC Markets, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We also recently received FINRA approval to permit digital asset securities to be traded by broker-dealers on OTC Link ATS. This approval furthers our mission of operating regulated markets for broker-dealers and issuers of securities. While it will be some time until the regulatory framework and infrastructure develop, we believe our markets are well-positioned to be part of new trading, data, and disclosure solutions for these securities.”</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="div-gpt-ad-1641667454129-0" data-google-query-id="CPiYjPTI-f4CFYGASwUdDe0Bsw">Crypto and Regulation</h2>
<p>OTC Markets prefer to adopt a regulatory-driven as it plans to offer to trade digital securities to its clients. Cass Sanford, OTC Markets Deputy General Counsel, stated that proper disclosure is essential for investor protection.</p>
<p>For a long, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a> chief Gary Gensler has been insisting that all cryptocurrencies are securities. Thus, if this turns out to be true, OTC Markets will be well-positioned in providing liquidity to these assets in the future. Sanford said that the SEC classifies digital assets as securities, they will function as OTC equity securities. She also added that a lot of instruments currently look like OTC securities. Sanford <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2023/05/207031-otc-markets-approved-by-finra-to-trade-digital-assets-that-are-securities/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The world’s largest digital asset investment vehicles trade on our markets. These securitized products help investors gain exposure to digital assets through broker-dealers and investment advisors operating within a robust framework of state and federal securities laws.  We also recently received FINRA approval to permit digital asset securities to be traded by broker-dealers on our Alternative Trading System (ATS).”</p></blockquote>

<p>Ahead of its rumored June release, the Apple metaverse mixed-reality headset is touted to be an industry leader. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-vr-ar-headset-june-metaverse/">Apple VR/AR Headset Could Likely Launch in Early June &#038; Spur Metaverse </a></p>
<p>Reports suggest that the new <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/apple-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple</a> (NASDAQ: AAPL) <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">virtual and augmented reality headset</a> could <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/apple-headset-could-boost-metaverse-token" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fast-track</a> the emergence of the metaverse. The consumer electronics giant is on course to release its highly-anticipated mixed-reality headset in the weeks ahead. Many believe the upcoming device could spur the metaverse sector as the first genuine metaverse-specific Apple product.</p>
<p>In January, native tokens tied to metaverse projects such as Sandbox (SAND) and Decentraland (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/decentraland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MANA</a>) soared amid rumors of Apple’s VR/AR headset. Now, many analysts, including eToro’s Josh Gilbert, opine that the new headset’s actual launch could be a boon.</p>
<p>Gilbert’s assessment is primarily due to Apple’s proven track record of delivering high-quality, revolutionary products that ‘shift the needle’. According to him, anything Apple does, they “usually do it right”. However, Gilbert added that the launch of Apple’s mixed reality headset might not necessarily drive all metaverse-related tokens through the roof. The eToro market analyst explained that a fully immersive metaverse experience could still be a “long way off”. To underscore his point, Gilbert compared the initial launch of the iPhone with the availability of apps that later realized the phone’s potential.</p>
<p>Gilbert also opined that the performance of metaverse tokens like SAND and MANA would depend more on the industry’s perceived popularity. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The bottom line is that we are still very early in the metaverse world, and their performance will rely heavily on the popularity of the Metaverse in the future.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The metaverse, and associated digital assets, rose in prominence during the 2021 crypto bull run. However, several initiatives instituted by leading players in the industry have yet to enjoy broad-scale adoption among users.</p>
<h2>What We Know About the Upcoming Apple Metaverse Headset</h2>
<p>The new Apple virtual and augmented reality metaverse headset could be called ‘Reality Pro.’ A <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-vr-and-mixed-reality-headset-release-date-price-specs-and-leaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> states that the hardware differs from the rumored Apple Glasses, which purely focuses on augmented reality.</p>
<p>The new Apple VR/AR headset could launch in three weeks (early June) and will likely compete with other premium VR headsets. These include the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/meta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta</a> Quest 2 and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony’s</a> PSVR 2.</p>
<p>Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo previously expected Apple to delay mass production of its Metaverse headset by up to 2 months. Kuo cited factors such as the device’s rumored $3,000 price tag and “compromises on some hardware specifications for mass production”. In addition, the reputable analyst said a lack of “iPhone moment excitement” for the headset could trigger a delayed release. However, Apple could still showcase its metaverse hardware offering at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The tech giant could use the event to preview the device to its prospective end-users ahead of the launch.</p>
<h2>Apple Mainstream Hardware Sales for Fiscal Q2 2023</h2>
<p>Earlier in the month, Apple released its <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/apple-fiscal-q2-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fiscal Q2 2023 results</a>, which revealed better-than-expected iPhone sales. However, the company’s Mac and iPad businesses did not fare as commendably for the same period. Cook ascribed the underwhelming performance to the macro situation and the lofty precedent of last year’s M1 MacBook Pro 14 and 16-inch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-economic-data-expectations-recovery/">China’s Economic Data Missed Broad Expectations amid Wobbled Recovery</a></p>
<p>China’s economic recovery has been faced with a lot of strain in its attempt to return back to winning ways as marked by growth, however, recent data points that the economy has continued to miss broad expectations. As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/chinas-data-industrial-profit.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> by CNBC, economic data from Reuters proved that the COVID-19 restrictions that were in place for the better part of last year had more impact than previously envisaged.</p>
<p>Per the data, the month of April saw the Industrial Production sector grow at a rate of 5.6% year on year, up 3.9% in March. This figure pales when compared to the 10.9% expected according to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idINL1N37D03X" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">estimate</a>. Retail sales in China went up by 18.4% as against the 21% that was projected by analysts.</p>
<p>China’s economic recovery attempt received positive momentum toward the end of the third quarter as the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/jd-tech-ipo-plans-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">government eased the crackdown</a> on high-growth tech companies in the country. While the general inflationary incidence around the world has also impacted the strained business environment for startups and companies in the country.</p>
<p>The economic data also showed that Fixed assets went up by 4.7% even though the general expectation was 5.5%.</p>
<p>“China is in the stage of recovering, compared to last year, the numbers are positive as we just saw, but is the recovery good enough for the market, is the recovery good enough to meet investors’ expectations – that’s the big question here,” BofA Securities China equity strategist Winnie Wu told CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia”.</p>
<p>Wu also added that the data released proved not solid enough to beat investors’ expectations. To him, the demand in the country has slowed and the general recovery of confidence in the economy as well as of jobs will take a while to be achieved.</p>
<h2>China’s Economic Data on Stocks</h2>
<p>China’s economic outlook also affected the stocks of some of the top companies in the country. Notably, these stocks have clawed back most of the gains they have accrued since the start of the year with the Shenzhen Component SZSE Component Index (SHE: 399001) down by 0.71% at the time of writing to 11,099.26.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Composite SSE Composite Index (SHA: 000001) is also down by 0.60% which confirms the encompassing losses that are being experienced in the economy. According to Goldman Sachs economist Hui Shan, the sentiments in the market have remained consistently pale as gleaned from the firm’s client conversation.</p>
<p>In order to reboot the economy, Shan noted that “Symbolic measures that aim at boosting confidence, such as RRR cuts, seem more likely to us, especially around quarter-end when liquidity demand is high”.</p>
<p>The People’s Bank of China (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/peoples-bank-of-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PBoC</a>) has been implementing a series of <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/mainland-china-stock-falls-pboc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monetary policies</a> aimed at getting the economy back on its feet. These actions will be complementary to Shan’s primary trigger in the near to mid-term.</p>
