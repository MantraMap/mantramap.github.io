<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Developers finalized the &#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217; on Thursday.</li><li>The move marks the first major test phase for Ethereum&#8217;s hyped Shanghai updated in March 2023.</li><li>ETH Developer Marius Van Der Wijden noted configuration difficulties on Geth but said progress is underway.</li></ul>



<p>Ethereum developers <a href="https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> a ‚Äòshadow fork‚Äô of the Shanghai update built to test the withdrawal of Staked Ether (ETH) from crypto&#8217;s leading altcoin blockchain. Developers dubbed the test environment &#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217;, suggesting the first of many testnets.¬†</p>



<p>A shadow fork refers to a testing ground or trial network built to simulate the main blockchain, in this case, Ethereum. The shadow fork allows engineers and developers to run code, smooth bugs, and finalize an upgrade before shipping to the mainnet. A similar approach was leveraged when preparing for the massive transition to proof-of-stake in 2022.¬†</p>



<p>&#8216;Withdrawal-Mainnet-Shadow-Fork-1&#8217; was designed to test the withdrawal mechanism for staked ETH that is expected to roll out with the Shanghai update. According to Marius Van Der Wijden, a developer at the ETH Foundation, the shadow fork was successfully finalized on Monday around 5:30 am ET.¬†</p>



<p>Van Der Wijden noted that some bugs emerged when applying the shadow fork configurations on Geth, an execution client of ETH networks that handles key operations like transactions and execution of smart contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ETH coders tackled the issues, however, and ‚Äúall nodes are in agreement‚Äù said Van Der Wijden in a tweet. The next step for developers in Shanghai‚Äôs first shadow fork is to create evil nodes to further test the update. Evil nodes create invalid blocks and try to pull other network nodes away from the main chain.¬†</p>

<h2>Ethereum Developers Move To Unlock 16 Million Staked ETH</h2>



<p>The Shanghai update currently believed to go live in March 2023 will unlock over 16 million ETH currently staked on Ethereum by validators. Indeed, the massive staked Ether makes up over 13% of ETH‚Äôs total supply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers plan to build in a daily withdrawal cap to cushion the potential price impact from mass withdrawals. The cap is set at around 57,600 ETH per day. Liquid staking platform <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> currently tops the staked ETH leaderboard with over 4.6 million Ether <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/">locked</a> through the service.¬†</p>



<p>The number of validators on ETH&#8217;s network also <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed</a> 500,000, a landmark moment as entities prepare for withdrawal functionality with the Shanghai upgrade.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Over 6,000 Uniswap community members voted on the proposal from 0xPlasma Labs.</li><li>Around 80% voted to launch the Ethereum-based decentralized exchange on BNB Chain.</li><li>The 0xPlasma Labs proposal opined that the DEX would enjoy added liquidity and onboard over a million active users by tapping the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem.</li></ul>



<p>The Uniswap community <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://snapshot.org/#/uniswap/proposal/0xa3c7247632d3a08e4e73a63867908d0cd4402f48fa673945f93e3197dee5450a" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">voted</a> in favor of launching Ethereum&#8217;s largest decentralized exchange (DEX) on BNB Chain to tap broader crypto liquidity and expand beyond ETH‚Äôs native blockchain network.¬†</p>



<p>Some 6,495 community members spent a total of 24.9 million UNI voting on the proposal submitted by 0xPlasma Labs, a blockchain company led by Ilia Maskimenka. The results of the vote showed that 80.28% of members voted Yes spending 20 million UNI to back their decision. 19.72% of the votes spent 4.9 million UNI to oppose deploying the DEX on BNB Chain.</p>



<p>Ethereumworldnews previously <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/0xplasma-labs-uniswap-binance-bnb-chain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/0xplasma-labs-uniswap-binance-bnb-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> the proposal‚Äôs first draft which rolled out on December 12, 2022. 0xPlasma Labs, an on-chain infrastructure developer focused on building tools for Uniswap, opined that the proposal would propel broader access to Ethereum‚Äôs largest DEX and tap liquidity from DeFi‚Äôs second-largest ecosystem.¬†</p>



<p>The proposal will now advance to a governance vote. </p>



<h2>Uniswap To Compete With PancakeSwap</h2>



<p>Indeed, launching Uniswap on BNB Chain could throw the trading venue into direct competition with PancakeSwap. Launched in 2020, PancakeSwap was built as a decentralized exchange for the BNB Chain ecosystem, similar to how Uniswap was built for Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DefiLama data showed that PancakeSwap boasted over $2.45 billion in total liquidity locked (TVL) with most of its TVL on Binance Smart Chain. Also, another $1.05 billion was locked up in staking facilities on the exchange at press time. The leading DEX on Binance‚Äôs blockchain also records hundreds of millions in daily trading volume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Uniswap V3 could look to tap more than a million active user addresses on BNB Chain and secure a share of $5 billion in TVL on DeFi‚Äôs second-largest ecosystem. Currently, the Ethereum-based DEX has around $2.68 billion in TVL spread across ETH‚Äôs main chain, and layer 2 side chains like Polygon, Arbitrum, and Optimism.¬†</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Genesis filed for bankruptcy protection late on Thursday revealing $3.6 billion owed to the top 50 creditors.</li><li>Top unsecured claimants included Gemini, Babel Finance, VanEck, and Cumberland among others.</li><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss once again threatened legal against Genesis&#8217;s parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert.¬†</li></ul>



<p>The Winklevii Founded Gemini was <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/genesis/Home-DownloadPDF?id1=MTQzOTA3OQ==&amp;id2=-1" rel="nofollow noopener">named</a> a top creditor in a list of unsecured claims published by bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global. Genesis filed for bankruptcy late on Thursday roughly two months after the imposition of the crypto exchange FTX.¬†</p>



<p>According to the court filing submitted in the Southern District of New York, Genesis owes over $3.6 billion to its top 50 unsecured creditors. The crypto lender also confirmed between $1 billion and $10 billion in assets and liabilities. The filing covers Genesis Global Holdco LLC, Genesis Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd, and Genesis Global Capital LLC which served as the partner firm for Gemini‚Äôs beleaguered Earn product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thursday‚Äôs unsecured claims list noted that Gemini is owed $766 million. Two other creditors are owed a combined $692.2 million but both names were redacted in the court filing. Other members of the top 50 creditors category include Mirana Corp (owed $151 million), Babel Finance (owed $150 million),&nbsp; and VanEck New Finance Income Fund (owed $53 million) to name a few.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DCG subsidiary said the late filing was a ‚Äústrategic action to achieve a global resolution to maximize value for all clients and stakeholders‚Äù. The filing comes a few months after the fall of FTX and uncertainty surrounding the lenders‚Äô parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG)</p>



<h2>Winklevoss Threatens Lawsuit Against Genesis Parent Company DCG</h2>



<p>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss threatened to sue the crypto lenders&#8217; parent company DCG and its CEO Barry Silbert for lying to investors about the company‚Äôs financial health. Cameron tweeted on Friday that the bankruptcy filing ‚Äúdoes not insulate Barry, DCG, and any other wrongdoers from accountability‚Äù.¬†</p>



<p>Both parties engaged <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-barry-silberts-resignation-dcg/">embroiled</a> in a public spat ever since Genesis Global Capital paused withdrawals, essentially cutting off liquidity for Gemini‚Äôs Earn program and its 340,000+ users. The crypto lender supposedly buckled amid back-to-back exposure to crippled entities Three Arrows Capital and Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs FTX exchange.¬†</p>

<p>Furthermore, Thursday‚Äôs filing raises questions regarding <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-confirmed-grayscale-gbtc/">Grayscale‚Äôs</a> Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) product, another entity owned by DCG. Crypto participants have expressed worries that bankruptcy proceedings could have a domino effect on the company‚Äôs massive BTC holdings which exceed 600,000 at press time.¬†</p>

<p>John Ray III, the current CEO of FTX, has hinted at the possibility of restarting FTX.com, the international crypto exchange that lies at the center of Sam Banklam-Fried‚Äôs failed crypto empire. Mr. Ray, who was brought in last November to clean up the mess made by SBF and his team, has spent the past two months salvaging assets from the exchange in a bid to secure some value for the exchange‚Äôs investors and customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>John Ray: Restarting FTX is on the table</strong></h2>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-ftx-chief-says-crypto-exchange-could-restart-11674143168" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, new CEO John Ray III revealed that he has set up a task force to explore the possibility of restarting FTX. The CEO acknowledged that rebooting the exchange may be feasible. Shutting it down and returning available assets to customers would be the other available option. If reviving the exchange leads to more recovery than the liquidation of assets, then the exchange will be restarted.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Everything is on the table‚Ä¶If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we‚Äôll do it.‚Äù</p><cite>CEO John Ray</cite></blockquote>



<p>Mr. Ray told WSJ that recovering assets was particularly difficult in this case because there was no centralized register that listed the company‚Äôs cash and investments. Gary Wang, the exchange‚Äôs co-founder, and Alameda Research‚Äôs <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/alamedas-caroline-ellison-says-sbf-ftx-execs-received-secret-loans-worth-billions/">Caroline Ellison</a> initially helped to locate the exchange‚Äôs funds. Both executives have pleaded guilty and secured deals with prosecutors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankmain-Fried, who has maintained that filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy was a mistake, welcomed the possibility of restarting FTX. John Ray took issue with comments made by SBF since the bankruptcy, calling them ‚Äúunhelpful and self-serving.‚Äù</p>



<p>The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">FTX Token</a> ($FTT) has gone up more than 30% since the news of a possible revival of the exchange came out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A hacker who stole almost $5 million from Solana-native decentralized exchange Raydium moved a part of the funds from an Ethereum wallet to sanction crypto mixing protocol Tornado Cash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The activity was noted on Thursday by the on-chain security firm CertiK. According to the company, the exploiter transferred $2.7 million in stolen Ether (ETH) to the mixer. EtherScan data indicated that the hacker‚Äôs wallet moved a total of 1,774.5 ETH over 42 transactions.¬†</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The initial hack <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/raydium-hacker-bridges-solana-to-ethereum/">occurred</a> in December 2022 as previously reported. An unidentified exploiter obtained keys to the admin account for Raydium‚Äôs smart contract code. The compromised credentials allowed the hacker to drain liquidity pool (LP) tokens from the DEX. After, the individual bridged the digital assets to Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain and converted the funds to ETH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A total of $4.4 million in crypto was stolen off the Solana-based exchange, per reports.¬†</p>



<h2>Tornado Cash Saga</h2>



<p>The attempt to leverage Tornado Cash and other crypto mixers is not uncommon among decentralized finance (DeFi) criminals. Indeed, the U.S Treasury Department sanction the Ethereum-based protocol on suspicions that North Korean cyber-criminal organizations used the service to fund illicit operations.</p>



<p>Although, reports from on-chain observers like Chainalysis disputed claims that the bulk of global money laundering and illicit wealth is funneled through the crypto industry. Per the blockchain company‚Äôs review, crypto makes up for less than 5% of illegal cash flow.</p>



<p>Alexey Pertsev who wrote the code for Tornado Cash was <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-will-reportedly-stay-in-jail-for-two-months-after-his-appeal-gets-dismissed-by-the-court/">arrested</a> by Dutch police back in August 2022. Pertsev remains jailed until February 20 as a Netherlands judge deemed the developer a flight risk.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Raydium Hack Among Over $3 Billion In DeFi Attacks </h2>



<p>Raydium counted among a raft of attacks on DeFi protocols in 2022. Hackers had drained over $1 billion in assets from crypto projects as of September. October was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninabambysheva/2022/12/28/over-3-billion-stolen-in-crypto-heists-here-are-the-eight-biggest/" rel="noopener">tagged</a> the worst month for DeFi hacks.</p>



<p>To date, the 2022 exploit of Ronin‚Äôs bridge remains the largest hack in DeFi history. The exploit which was attributed to the North Korean group Lazarus <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ronin-network-hacked-for-173-6k-ethereum-and-25-5m-usdc/">stole</a> over $600 million in Ethereum and USDC from the cross-chain service.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A VC fund co-founded by Peter Thiel closed almost all of its 8-year-long bet on Bitcoin last year.&nbsp;</li><li>The winding down of the crypto investments came right before 2022‚Äôs crypto crash in May.&nbsp;</li><li>Shortly after selling the crypto holdings, Thiel suggested that Bitcoin‚Äôs price may rise 100-fold.</li><li>The fund currently manages more than $11 billion and has very little exposure to crypto.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Billionaire investor Peter Thiel reportedly cashed out big on crypto last year. The Founders Fund, a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel, made its initial investment in <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-developer-loses-3-6-million-bitcoins-hack/">Bitcoin</a> in early 2014 when the flagship crypto was trading at around $700. This was followed by large investments in crypto, however, the bulk of the crypto exposure was to Bitcoin. Crypto investments became one of the fund‚Äôs core positions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Peter Thiel‚Äôs fund sold crypto investments before the market crashed</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/0a1d5597-7145-4035-987b-ff033bba3d75" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>, the 8-year-long crypto bet made by Thiel‚Äôs Founders Fund was wound down towards the end of March 2022. This included the majority of the fund‚Äôs exposure to the crypto portfolio. This sale came just a month before the crypto contagion of 2022 that started in May. The fund netted a whopping $1.8 billion from this sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interestingly, Peter Thiel said in April 2022 that he was optimistic about the future of Bitcoin. The billionaire investor had suggested that BTC, which was worth around $44,000 at the time, could rise by 100 times. These comments came just days after his fund had sold its Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sale of the Founders Fund‚Äôs crypto portfolio has not previously been reported. People familiar with the matter told FT that as of now, the fund has no significant exposure to crypto assets. The fund currently has more than $11 billion under management and has&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://foundersfund.com/portfolio/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">invested</a>&nbsp;in popular companies like SpaceX and Lyft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Stargate Finance looks to power liquidity transfer across decentralized networks without downgrading security and efficiency, per Stargate&#8217;s official announcement.</li><li>The LayerZero Labs&#8217; protocol will start by enabling support for Tether&#8217;s USDT stablecoin for Metis users on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and Ethereum.</li><li>Metis CEO Elena Sinelnikova noted that the partnership should propel growth for the multi-chain economy, making crypto more accessible to everyday users.</li></ul>



<p>LayerZero Labs‚Äô Stargate Finance will onboard its liquidity transport protocol on layer 2 network Metis as Stargate moves toward bridging crypto assets and digital currency liquidity across multiple blockchains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unveiled by LayerZero Labs in March 2020, Stargate boasts network composability allowing users and decentralized applications (dApps) to move native assets between otherwise isolated blockchains. The solution operates as a cross-chain protocol with its own unified liquidity pools and optimized finality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>LayerZero supposedly built the protocol to further plans of an Omni-chain ecosystem where crypto users can seamlessly interact with web3 solutions like decentralized exchanges and yield aggregators, regardless of the native blockchains those solutions were initially built on.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Pushing Crypto Adoption And Accessibility With Cross-Chain Technology</h2>



<p>Commenting on the news, Metis CEO and Co-Founder Elena Sinelnikova opined that onboarding Stargate Finance will further broader cryptocurrency adoption by improving accessibility to digital assets. Sinelnikova also noted that the partnership signals significant progress toward ‚Äúeliminating the barriers between blockchains, and opening the doors to a more decentralized, multi-chain economy.‚Äù</p>



<p>Metis is a layer 2 protocol based on Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain network. Similar to other layer 2 chains, Metis improves scalability, enabling faster transactions at lower costs without trading the network security that Ethereum is famed for. </p>



<p>The project also moves a step further with an NFT bridge, a web3 storage solution, a framework for decentralized autonomous companies (DACs), and a middleware protocol dubbed Polis.&nbsp; LayerZero Labs Co-Founder and CTO Ryan Zarick added that integrating with Metis paves the way for deeper communications between protocols and solutions on Ethereum‚Äôs layer 2 network.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The integration of Metis is another big step in LayerZero‚Äôs expansion into the Layer 2 ecosystem of Ethereum, allowing for a unified flow of messaging across the entire Ethereum ecosystem. We‚Äôre extremely excited to support the Metis ecosystem and its developers and are looking forward to building amazing things together.</p><cite>&#8211; CTO Ryan Zarick.</cite></blockquote>



<h2>Stargate Finance Brings USDT To Metis Users</h2>



<p>According to the official announcement, Stargate Finance will provide support for Tether‚Äôs USDT stablecoin on Metis. Users leveraging Metis‚Äô layer 2 solutions on Avalanche, BNB Chain, and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereums-shanghai-upgrade-brings-heat-to-liquid-staking-derivatives-lsd-with-ldo-seeing-71-increase-in-value/">Ethereum</a> will be able to tap crypto‚Äôs largest stablecoin by market cap.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the partnership with Metis marks a watershed moment for <a href="https://stargate.finance/" rel="nofollow noopener">Stargate Finance</a> since its launch. This is the first time the project has expanded beyond LayerZero Labs, the Stargate Finance team told EthereumWorldNews.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Ethereum Name Service governance proposal aims to create an extra runway for the project should the crypto market suffer another downturn.</li><li>10,000 ETH would be sold for Circle&#8217;s USDC via a Gnosis auction, Wednesday&#8217;s proposal suggested.</li><li>ENS DAO held around $2.4 million in stablecoin and some 40,000 Ether in its treasury at press time.</li></ul>



<p>A member of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DAO submitted a governance proposal aimed at diversifying the protocol‚Äôs treasury and hedging against further downturns in the crypto market. The details of the draft proposed offloading 10,000 Ether (ETH) worth around $13 million at today‚Äôs prices.¬†</p>



<p>The ENS treasury held over 40,000 ETH and almost $3 million in Circle‚Äôs USD Coin (USDC), crypto‚Äôs second largest stablecoin by market cap. According to the member‚Äôs proposal, swapping 10,000 ETH for 13 million in USDC will allow the project to hold enough liquidity to offset operating costs for the next 24 months, regardless of crypto asset prices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the broader digital asset and financial markets suffered huge downturns in 2022 following harsh macro conditions and a series of industry implosions like Terra. When Ethereum Name Service fully launched its service and token in November 2021, Ether peaked at over $4,000 and set an all-time high.¬†</p>



<p>ETH‚Äôs price has since dipped over 60% in over a year and currently trades around $1,500. The ENS community member <a href="https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://discuss.ens.domains/t/draft-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">argued</a> that securing liquidity is essential since the project‚Äôs primary revenue is in Ether.¬†</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The DAO currently keeps almost 100% of its spendable treasury in ETH. While ENS generates protocol revenue in ETH, having so much exposure to a single volatile asset places the DAO in a vulnerable position.</p></blockquote>



<h2>2.8 Million Ethereum Name Service Domains Registered in 2022</h2>



<p>Ethereum Name Service enjoyed massive user activity in 2022 despite crypto prices taking a beating. Dune Analytics data showed over 2.8 million domains registered and over 600,000 unique wallets created.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ENS runs atop the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ethereum-validators-500000-post-merge/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain and was initially a part of the Ethereum Foundation in 2017. However, the service broke off as a standalone entity a year later in 2018, and is managed by True Names Limited.¬†</p>



<p>The Ethereum Name Service protocol allows users to attach a simple name like ‚Äúxyz.eth‚Äù to their ETH wallets. ENS was built as a solution to make crypto wallets more accessible, meaning that users do not have to memorize complicated long-form addresses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the service is similar to web2 domain registrations where users link a dot-com name to their numeric internet protocol addresses.¬†</p>

<ul><li>Genesis Global Capital is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy.</li><li>The DCG subsidiary has been in negotiations with several creditor groups.&nbsp;</li><li>Genesis has been struggling to raise funds for its lending unit following a liquidity crunch.&nbsp;</li><li>Parent firm Digital Currency Group suspended dividends today due to liquidity issues with subsidiaries.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Genesis Global Capital, one of the most popular subsidiaries of the Digital Currency Group (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dcg-asset-sales-genesis-owes-3-billion/">DCG</a>), is reportedly preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as this week. This crypto lending subsidiary of the Digital Currency Group has been attempting to raise funds to maintain liquidity ever since FTX‚Äôs collapse caused it to halt withdrawals in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Genesis in confidential negotiations with creditors</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/crypto-firm-genesis-said-to-prepare-bankruptcy-filing-as-soon-as-this-week" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Genesis Global Capital has engaged multiple creditor groups in negotiations amid liquidity issues that have spilled over to parent firm Digital Currency Group. The crypto broker had indicated in November 2022 that a bankruptcy filing may be imminent unless fresh capital was raised to sustain operations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People close to the matter have stated that a bankruptcy filing may not be necessary and that plans could change. As per a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theblock.co/post/203310/genesis-creditors-negotiating-prepackaged-bankruptcy-sources" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>&nbsp;by The Block, creditors of Genesis are actively involved in negotiating the terms of a possible chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Sources revealed that creditors may agree to a forbearance period between 1-2 years under a prepackaged bankruptcy plan in exchange for cash payments and equity in the Digital Currency Group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG&#8217;s founder and CEO Barry Silbert has been involved in a public feud with Gemini‚Äôs co-founder and President Cameron Winklevoss. The latter‚Äôs customers are allegedly owed more than $900 million as part of Gemini&#8217;s Earn Program. The non-payment has dragged Silbert into the limelight following a series of open letters published by Cameron Winklevoss.</p>



<p>People familiar with the matter have stated that the communication regarding the bankruptcy filing is ongoing and may change. Genesis‚Äô parent firm Digital Currency Group revealed earlier today that it would be suspending its quarterly&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-18/digital-currency-group-halts-dividend-payment-to-conserve-cash" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dividends</a>&nbsp;to preserve cash following liquidity issues with its subsidiaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A second Substack post from the FTX Founder contested data and financial records filed by legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.</li><li>Bankman-Fried argued against the notion that FTX US has a shortfall and is unable to pay back customers.</li><li>The platform has over $350 million in excess cash, said SBF once again. ¬†</li></ul>



<p>Disgraced crypto tycoon Sam Bankman-Fried reiterated that FTX US, the American division of his bankrupt international crypto exchange, remains solvent with enough cash and assets to make customers whole.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried argued against court records filed by legal firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell which claimed that the U.S. exchange had a shortfall and was insolvent. The documents filed by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell directly contrast SBF‚Äôs rhetoric of healthy financial holdings at FTX US.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>S&amp;C claims that FTX US has a shortfall. That claim is false. Based on S&amp;C‚Äôs own data provided in the same court presentation, FTX US had roughly $609m of assets ($428m USD in bank accounts, plus $181m of tokens) backing roughly $199m of customer balances. FTX US was solvent when it was turned over to S&amp;C, and almost certainly remains solvent today.</p></blockquote>



<p>In his second Substack post after a ‚Äú<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-premortem/">pre-mortem</a>‚Äù analysis on January 12, Sam Bankman-Fried once again opined that FTX US was solvent when he handed over to the bankruptcy team on November 12. SBF also noted that the U.S. platform holds at least $111 million of excess cash and over $350 million to cover customer deposits.¬†</p>



<p>‚ÄúCustomers should be given access to their funds,‚Äù said Sam Bankman-Fried in his latest Substack post, expressing annoyance that users have not received their crypto and assets. Notably, Bankman-Fried also <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1615555252962627584?s=20&amp;t=uBmpEg5coaQJ7oy6rPIZRg" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> there isn‚Äôt enough information to actually prove that.¬†</p>



<h2>FTX Discovers Another $90 Millon Missing</h2>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange reported that about $181 million in liquid assets from the American exchange have been identified so far. Of the total sum, $88 million was moved to cold storage wallet controlled by debtors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around $3 million was also earmarked for cold storage, said the bankruptcy team. About $90 million remains unaccounted for at press time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previous reports <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-5-billion-recovered-in-crypto-assets/">stated</a> that around $5 billion in cash, crypto, and securities were recovered. However, it remains unclear if this figure includes nearly $400 million <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/u-s-doj-launches-probe-into-372-million-ftx-hack-following-bankruptcy-filing/">stolen</a> from the exchange, $3.5 billion in the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">hands</a> of Bahamian authorities, and roughly $450 million worth of Robinhood shares <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2023/01/04/feds-move-to-seize-ftxs-robinhood-shares-as-sam-bankman-fried-faces-fraud-charges/" rel="noopener">seized</a> by the U.S. Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>
