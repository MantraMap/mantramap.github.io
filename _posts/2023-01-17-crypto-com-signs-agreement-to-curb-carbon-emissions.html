<p>There is no denying that the digital asset industry is not as environmentally friendly as we would like it to be. For this reason, many projects have taken steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Prominent crypto exchange, Crypto.com, has signed an eight-year carbon renewal agreement with Climeworks in which it intends to neutralize its direct carbon emissions. </p>
Environmental Sustainability Has Become an Industry Priority
<p>The digital asset industry has for a long time been criticized for its environmental impact have been forced to address these issues. Sustainability has become the goal of many projects and as such many have taken action to reduce their energy consumption. Ethereum, the world&rsquo;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, last year transitioned from an energy-intensive Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a much more eco-conscious Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model.</p>
<p>Crypto.com has for a long time been conscious of its environmental impact and is committed to becoming more sustainable. In its efforts to become more sustainable, the company has signed an eight-year carbon renewal agreement with Climeworks. By signing this agreement, Crypto.com intends to neutralize its direct carbon emissions. Climeworks is a Swiss company and leader in the field of carbon dioxide removal using direct air capture technology. Many other major companies such as Shopify, Microsoft, and Stripe have partnered with Climeworks and purchased future carbon removal services from it.</p>
