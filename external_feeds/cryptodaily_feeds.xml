			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Toncoin (TON) is currently troubled by a continuous downtrend movement, and an impending price swing is about to shift to the bears in Uniswap (UNI). With hopes of little return on the aforementioned tokens, investment in the Sparklo presale couldn&rsquo;t have come at a better time.</p>
<p class="s8">Uniswap's (UNI) Price Movement is Predicted to Shift to the Bears</p>
<p class="s6">Uniswap's (UNI) recent price movement is showing a bearish trend, with sellers populating the market more than buyers. Uniswap (UNI) has been trading on support, currently at $5.3 in the wake of a 1.77% decline in the past 24 hours at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="s6">The price swing, which is characterized by an increase in selling pressure, is set to shift once more to the bears, with support tested repeatedly. With Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) failure to break the $5.6 resistance earlier, it is currently trading at $5.2.</p>
<p class="s6">Considering the technical analysis of Uniswap (UNI), the bearish trend might endure for a while. Investors are bracing for Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) downtrend by putting their investment somewhere else, especially in the Sparklo presale.</p>
<p class="s8">Toncoin (TON): Persisting Bearish Movement Frustrates Investors</p>
<p class="s6">Toncoin (TON) is a decentralized Layer-1 blockchain experiencing a continuous downtrend on the 24-hour to 90 days price chart. The hopes of a price swing in Toncoin (TON) were dashed in the past 24 hours after it recorded a 1.9% decline in price.</p>
<p class="s6">With the hope of an upward price movement dampened and no scheduled events to impact the price of Toncoin (TON), investors are frustrated. Consequently, investments in other projects, which promise high profits, are on their cards, over Toncoin (TON). Moreover, the opportunity to invest in the Sparklo presale is too good to be passed up by them, thereby resulting in increased purchases at the expense of Toncoin (TON).</p>
<p class="s11">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;BUY SPARKLO TOKENS&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s12">Sparklo (SPRK): Creating the Possibility to Invest in Bits of Precious Metals</p>
<p class="s6">Before the launch of Sparklo, it was difficult and almost impossible to invest in bits of precious metals such as platinum, gold, and silver. However, with its creation, investors can now invest in any amount of desired rare metals through fractionalized NFTs. Furthermore, investors who purchase the complete NFT will receive real-world assets in their chosen locations.</p>
<p class="s6">The token&rsquo;s presale is worth a competitive price of just $0.017. In addition, a further 30% bonus until May 5th makes the presale even cheaper and has mouth-watering growth potential. According to experts, the price of Sparklo can increase by over 3,000% in the following year.</p>
<p class="s6">With the importance given to transparency, the KYC audit is ongoing and in its final stage, and the smart contract has been successfully audited by InterFi Network, which it passed with no mishaps. Lastly, to promote investment security, the liquidity has been locked for 100 years, thereby dispelling fears of a rug pull.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">While many cryptocurrencies are currently dwindling, Collateral Network (COLT) has emerged as the most profitable project on the market. </p>
<p class="s6">Bulls have pounced upon the presale of Collateral Network (COLT), and it is predicted to make its investors 35x richer in the next two quarters due to its unparalleled use cases. In this article, we will understand why Collateral Network (COLT) has the potential to surpass Fantom (FTM) and Enjin Coin (ENJ). </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Fantom (FTM) Eyes Domination On Twitter</p>
<p class="s6">The market conditions seem to be favoring Fantom (FTM), as the platform has been rising steadily on the price chart. The market value of Fantom (FTM) has seen an uptick of 18% in the past week. As a result, Fantom (FTM), at the time of writing, is trading at $0.53. </p>
<p class="s6">Fantom received a major push recently when iME, a messaging platform-come-crypto wallet, released a new feature allowing FTM to be traded via Twitter. As Twitter recently signed a deal with eToro to enable the trading of cryptocurrencies, it is expected that iME&rsquo;s recent feature can make Fantom (FTM) the most traded token. The total value locked (TVL) of Fantom (FTM) has surged by 14% over the previous month. However, Fantom&rsquo;s (FTM) network growth has been under pressure, and dipped over 70% in the past month.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Enjin Coin (ENJ) Teases New Platform</p>
<p class="s6">Enjin Coin (ENJ) recently shared its development update, and made its community active on the charts. In its April update, Enjin Coin (ENJ) informed that a new platform UI is set to undergo the testing phase. The new Enjin Coin (ENJ) platform will empower developers to customize their collections and decide how they want to receive their creator fees. </p>
<p class="s6">The updates are expected to help Enjin Coin (ENJ) return to the growth path. Notably, EnjinCoin (ENJ) surged at the beginning of 2023, but has declined by 22% since February last week. Besides, the bearish sentiments around Enjin Coin (ENJ) have increased by 18% in the past week. At the time of writing, Enjin Coin (ENJ) is available to trade at $0.44.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s10">Collateral Network (COLT) Shows Skyrocketing Potential</p>
<p class="s6">With the advent of Collateral Network (COLT), gone are the days when lending was an extremely draining and complex task.</p>
<p class="s6">Collateral Network (COLT) is the first decentralized cross-chain network that allows crowdlending against non-traditional assets like luxury watches, fine art, wine, and more. The platform assesses and evaluates physical assets, and mints an NFT against them. These NFTs are broken up into multiple pieces, letting the community fund loans backed by them on a fixed amount of interest rate.</p>
<p class="s6">This revolutionary ecosystem is beneficial to both borrowers and lenders. Borrowers can get a fast and low-cost loan that is secured on the blockchain, and private in terms of footprint on credit history. On the other hand, lenders enjoy the security of their investments, and earn a fixed passive income. </p>
<p class="s6">Powered by the project&rsquo;s utility token, COLT, holders will get special discounts on borrowing and trading fees along with voting rights on key matters.</p>
<p class="s6">The liquidity pool is locked for 33 years, and merely 38% of the total supply of 1.4 billion COLT tokens is available for presale. Collateral Network is currently selling at a price of $0.014. Therefore, investors and whales across the globe are seizing this great opportunity to invest in Collateral Network (COLT) as it is set to increase 35x in the next few months.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">In the cryptocurrency sector, there is always a new coin or token on the rise, with traders and investors keeping a watchful eye on the latest predictions and trends. One such token that has been making waves lately is Yachtify's (YCHT) token. </p>
<p class="s7">According to industry analysts, YCHT's token is poised to skyrocket 4,000x over Binance Coin (BNB) and Litecoin (LTC) shortly. Interestingly, the token is currently in the presale stage offering an opportunity for investors to get in for only $0.01 per token. </p>
<p class="s9">Binance Coin (BNB): Bearish Momentum Coming?</p>
<p class="s7">Last week, Binance Coin (BNB) tried to break above $340 resistance but failed as bears took over, leading to a correction similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Binance Coin's (BNB) price then dropped below $330 support and hit a low of around $320.8. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently, Binance Coin (BNB) is consolidating and trading below $330 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the 4-hour chart of BNB/USD, a bearish trend line with resistance near $333 is also forming.</p>
<p class="s7">If Binance Coin (BNB) fails to surpass the $335 resistance, it may continue to decline. The first level of support is around $320, followed by a major support level near $315. </p>
<p class="s7">If the token's price plunges below $315, it could extend the decline toward the $300 support level. By press time, Binance Coin's (BNB) price is $325.90, In the last 24 hours, the token's price has increased by 0.83%, but it has declined by 1.37% in the past week.</p>
<p class="s9">Litecoin (LTC) Meets Rejection At $90</p>
<p class="s7">According to Litecoin's (LTC) price analysis, the token found support at $86.00 and has since bounced back to $88.00 with bullish momentum. However, there is still strong bearish pressure, as Litecoin (LTC) bulls were rejected at $90.00. </p>
<p class="s7">Litecoin (LTC) is currently in a bearish rally, as the price broke down from $104.00 to $86.00. Nevertheless, the bulls made a partial recovery, and the price rebounded to $88.00.</p>
<p class="s7">According to data from CoinMarketCap, Litecoin (LTC) currently trades at $88.10, with a 24-hour trading volume of $475,893,346. The price has declined by 0.02% in the last 24 hours but has increased by 0.02% in the past seven days.</p>
<p class="s7">Traders should anticipate that Litecoin (LTC) will move sideways at its current price level before continuing its downward trend.</p>
<p class="s9">Yachtify (YCHT): Invest in Boats for Passive Income</p>
<p class="s7">Yachtify will be a new marketplace where users can rent, buy, sell, or own fractional timeshares in various watercraft, including Sunseeker Yachts and Jetskis. The platform will allow investors to create NFTs corresponding to each investment, which can be purchased to claim real-world asset ownership. </p>
<p class="s7">The Yachtify ecosystem encompasses a lending protocol, NFT marketplace, and rewards club, presenting a promising investment opportunity. Additionally, the team has passed KYC and audits by SolidProof, ensuring investor security. </p>
<p class="s7">With Yachtify, you can buy and sell all types of boats on the blockchain, and receive part of the platform fee shares depending on your investment. </p>
<p class="s7">Currently in its first presale stage, Yachtify tokens are priced at only $0.1 per token. Smart and early investors can benefit from a 30% bonus before the price increases at the end of the month. Furthermore, those who purchase an entire NFT can have the corresponding real-world asset (gold, silver, or platinum) delivered to their chosen location.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has seen its fair share of meteoric rises. A recent example is Cannation (CNNC), a weed-related meme coin that can be mined, which has experienced an astounding increase of over 1,250,000% in just 30 days. With such explosive growth, investors are now turning their attention to other potential high-growth opportunities, such as DigiToads(TOADS). In this article, we explore the reasons behind Cannation's surge and whether DigiToads could be the next big thing in the crypto market.DigiToads (TOADS)</p>
<p>DigiToads, an ERC-20 token stands out from other altcoins due to its emphasis on utility and community involvement. The project incorporates a play-to-earn gaming platform, allowing users to collect, nurture, and battle digital toads, while earning TOADS tokens as rewards. Integrating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) into the ecosystem further enhances the project's appeal, with a collection of 3,500 unique NFTs launching during the presale. These stakeable NFTs provide additional opportunities for users to earn rewards, attracting investors who appreciate projects with real utility.</p>
<p>The question now is whether DigiToads can emulate the massive growth experienced by Cannation. While predicting the future performance of any cryptocurrency is always uncertain, DigiToads has several factors working in its favor. The project's successful presale, which has raised over $2.45 million so far, indicating strong investor interest and confidence in the project's potential. Moreover, the innovative combination of meme coin features, play-to-earn gaming, and stakeable NFTs sets DigiToads apart from other altcoins, increasing the likelihood of it capturing investor attention.Given the runaway success of its presale, investors and analysts lean towards a resounding yes. Many analysts pointed to the protocol&rsquo;s provision of passive income through NFT staking and TOADS airdrops which the market has not yet factored into its valuation.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Buy DigiToads Now &lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Cannation (CNNC)</p>
<p>Cannation, an altcoin that centers around the cannabis industry, recently captured headlines due to its exponential growth. This weed-related meme coin, which can be mined, has seen its value increase by more than 1,250,000% within a month. The staggering rise in Cannation's value can be attributed to the growing interest in meme coins and its focus on the cannabis sector, which has gained momentum in recent years. Moreover, the ability to mine CNNC attracts investors looking for ways to generate income. </p>
<p>Cannation Now Massively Overbought</p>
<p>While Cannation has seen a phenomenal increase in value the crypto is now horrifically overbought and investors entering now will most likely get burnt. Hence why attention is now shifting toward other potential high-growth altcoins like DigiToads. With its successful presale, unique combination of features, and strong focus on utility and community involvement, DigiToads stands out as a promising contender in the world of meme coins and ERC-20 tokens. Although predicting the future performance of any cryptocurrency is always a challenge, the factors working in DigiToads' favor suggest it could be well-positioned to follow in Cannation'sfootsteps. Crypto investors work on a probabilistic framework, and probability dictates Cannation retraces after such a violent move, whereas DigiToads has yet to explode upwards making it far more attractive. Become Part of the TOADS Journey TodayWhile nothing is guaranteed in crypto, projects like DigiToads represent an exciting and unique prospect for investors willing to explore the ever-changing landscape of digital assets. Given its innovative approach, strong presale performance, focus on utility, and above all provision of passive income through multiple angles, DigiToads certainly has the potential to become a significant player in the meme coin and altcoin sectors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Justice Department is investigating cryptocurrency exchange Binance in connection with possible Russian sanction violations.</p>
<p>So far, neither Binance nor the United States Justice Department have commented on the matter.</p>
Binance Under Scrutiny Once Again
<p>According to a report on Friday, the United States is investigating whether Binance Holdings allowed customers based in Russia to access the exchange. This would be in violation of the sanctions imposed on Russia by the United States following the former&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine. The inquiry is being led by the Justice Department&rsquo;s national security division. Global regulators have consistently advocated stricter controls and regulations on crypto exchanges such as Binance. According to regulators, more stringent regulations could help curb activities such as money laundering and terror financing.</p>
Previous Action Against Binance
<p>The action by the justice department is the latest high-profile action against Binance and follows a 2021 joint investigation with the Internal Revenue Services against the exchange. Binance is also under investigation by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which is investigating the company&rsquo;s relationship with two entities founded by Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. A Binance spokesperson speaking on the matter stated that the company complies with all US and international financial sanctions.</p>
<p>Binance was also sued by the Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) in March 2023. The CFTC alleged that Binance knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the United States, against federal law. In May 2023, Israel revealed it had seized around 190 Binance accounts with ties to known terrorist groups. However, it still needs to be made clear how Israel managed to seize the accounts since neither Israel nor Binance revealed details about any cooperation. It remains to be seen how Israel seized the accounts since Binance is not obliged to adhere to local laws in Israel.</p>
<p>However, Binance has pushed back against allegations against it, stating that it ensures complete compliance, having assembled the largest compliance team in the crypto space. According to Binance&rsquo;s head of compliance, Tigran Gambaryan, the exchange&rsquo;s compliance team addresses over 1300 law enforcement queries every week. The exchange has also claimed that it has figured out how to keep North Koreans off the exchange.</p>
Binance&rsquo;s Regulatory Woes
<p>Binance has run into trouble with regulators around the world, apart from the seizure of Binance accounts by Israeli authorities. In April, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) canceled Binance&rsquo;s derivatives license, which allowed it to operate in Australia since 2022. The cancellation was in response to a request submitted by Binance. Dubai&rsquo;s Virtual Regulatory Authority (VARA) also asked Binance to submit additional information related to the exchange&rsquo;s auditing procedures, governance, and ownership structure. Binance is also subject to a probe by authorities in Brazil, with the authorities confirming the launch of an official investigation into the exchange. Brazilian authorities allege that Binance did not respond to a stop order that directed the exchange to stop selling crypto derivatives.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, the cryptocurrency market has seen a surge in AI-related tokens, and STN is among the projects utilizing AI technology. This fusion of AI and cryptocurrency not only presents attractive investment opportunities but also contributes to the advancement of various industries. Let's delve into the details of STN below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James proposed legislation to grant her office greater authority to regulate the cryptocurrency industry. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reports (WSJ) that New York Attorney General Letitia James proposed a new state law to tighten the rules governing crypto firms. James claims additional measures must be taken as the industry suffers from &ldquo;rampant fraud and dysfunction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, dubbed Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency, and Oversight (CRPTO), introduces a rule in which New York requires independent audits of cryptocurrency exchanges and prohibits people from owning both brokerages and tokens in an effort to prevent conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>James explains that her proposal would be &ldquo;the strongest and most comprehensive set of regulations on cryptocurrency in the nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposal further requires crypto platforms to reimburse customers who have fallen victim to fraud and would strengthen the New York State Department of Financial Services&rsquo; authority to regulate digital assets. To this end, Attorney General James said:</p>

<p>Millions of investors have lost hundreds of billions in the value of their cryptocurrency investments because of rampant fraud, including market manipulation, hacking, and opaque business practices.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports, CRPTO, if adopted by state legislators, would also prevent crypto brokers and marketplaces from trading in their accounts and would ban brokers from borrowing and lending customer assets.</p>
<p>James said in a statement:</p>

<p>Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency, and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry. New York investors should have the peace of mind that there are safeguards in place to protect them and their money.</p>

<p>As an elected official, James seeks jurisdiction to enforce crypto firms&rsquo; violations of the law, issue subpoenas, and impose civil penalties of $10,000 per violation for every individual or $100,000 per violation for each crypto firm, according to the WSJ.</p>
<p>The AG also seeks authority to shutter businesses that engage in alleged fraud and illegality.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve in 2023, various platforms have continued to compete and evolve to meet users&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p>While Polygon and Polkadot are popular cryptocurrencies, they are facing increasing competition from other coins. One of these coins is Tradecurve&rsquo;s TCRV token. Tradecurve.io is a new DEX project that has been gaining popularity among investors due to its plan for low fees, fast transaction times, and intuitive user interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve.io Token Set To Surge&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tradecurve, is an innovative decentralized exchange (DEX) solution that has been the talk of Web3 community for weeks. Tradecurve will offer lower fees, faster transaction times, and a more user-friendly interface than most other crypto trading platforms</p>
<p>At its core, Tradecurve is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that enables users to trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets without the need for a centralized authority. Tradecurve uses an automated market maker (AMM) algorithm to determine prices and liquidity for trading pairs, and supports a wide range of tokens and assets.</p>
<p>In addition to Tradecurve&rsquo;s DEX capabilities, they will also offer yield farming and liquidity mining opportunities, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity to the platform. Tradecurve also features a suite of analytics and trading tools to help traders make more informed decisions and optimize their trading strategies.</p>
<p>Holders of Tradecurve&rsquo;s native token, $TCRV, have access to a number of benefits including trading fee discounts, staking rewards, and best of all, the astounding profit potential of a 500:1 trading leverage.</p>
<p>Tradecurve&rsquo;s token (TCRV) is currently at the first stage of presale, selling at $0.01. Once the tokens at this stage are sold out, the price will pump to $0.088 at launch</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) Price Prediction</p>
<p>The Polygon network was designed as a layer 2 solution based on the Ethereum blockchain. Polygon aims to enable Dapps, smart contracts, and transactions at a quicker and more affordable rate than the Ethereum network. The Polygon network's native token, MATIC, is in charge of the administration, transaction fees, and security of the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Polygon peaked in 2021, Polygon&rsquo;s MATIC has decreased in value by 67% and is now only worth $1.09 per token. As a result, many Polygon investors have started selling their Polygon (MATIC) assets and shifting their attention to better investment alternatives.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) News</p>
<p>Polkadot is a multi-chain platform that aims to provide interoperability between different blockchains. Polkadot (DOT)has gained a lot of attention in the cryptocurrency space. This is mostly due to the Polkadot network&rsquo;s unique architecture and potential to enable cross-chain communication. However, recent price analyses of the Polkadot platform&rsquo;s token DOT have shown a consistent bearish trend.</p>
<p>The price of Polkadot (DOT) has already dropped 15% last month and is on the verge of falling another 15%. The Polkadot drop follows the rise on Wednesday, which was preceded by a technical rejection and many support level breaches. Traders and investors are currently unsure of the feasibility of a Polkadot (DOT) bullish run.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Kenya is considering implementing a 3% tax on cryptocurrency and non-fungible token (NFT) transfers as part of the country's proposed budget.</p>
Latest Budget Proposes Crypto Tax
<p>The latest budget proposal for the country has a contingency for taxing crypto transactions, including NFT transfers. The Finance Bill 2023, presented to the Kenyan parliament on May 4 by the country&rsquo;s finance ministry, the National Treasury, has proposed levying a 3% tax on all &ldquo;income derived from the transfer or exchange of digital assets.&rdquo; The proposal has also included NFTs in its definition of &ldquo;digital assets.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crypto exchanges or those who initiate the transfer of crypto or NFTs would be required to collect the tax, having to deduct 3% of the transfers&rsquo; value to be paid to the government. Exchanges not registered in Kenya would have to register under the tax regime.</p>
<p>As just a proposed bill, the legislature has a long journey ahead before it can become law. It will need to pass through five rounds of readings, committees, and reports by the National Assembly. In the next major step, it will end up at the President's desk, who will take the final call to pass it into law.&nbsp;</p>
Raising Funds Through High Taxes
<p>The proposal intends to raise revenue for the East African country, which has been facing an economic crisis since the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has hit the Kenyan economy hard, with many businesses shutting down and unemployment rates skyrocketing.</p>
<p>The bill is also looking to generate revenue for the government by taxing digital content monetization. This means that online celebrities and influencers could have to give up 15% of their earnings on monetized content on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. The scope of the taxable earnings will extend to brand deals and sponsorships, affiliate marketing, merchandise sales, and paid subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill also proposes to increase taxes on cigarettes and alcoholic drinks, as well as introduce a tax on plastic waste.</p>
Where Does Kenya Stand?&nbsp;
<p>The proposed tax has received mixed reactions from the Kenyan cryptocurrency community. Some believe that the tax will help regulate the industry and generate revenue for the government, while others fear that it may stifle innovation and drive away investment. In addition, the governor of the Central Bank of Kenya has shown an aversion to the trend of converting the country&rsquo;s reserves into Bitcoin, even though the institution has been exploring its CBDC options.</p>

<p>Near Protocol (NEAR): Partnership with Cosmose Likely to Impact Price in the Future</p>
<p>Near Protocol (NEAR) recently announced a partnership with Cosmose AI, an AI-based company primarily focused on retail shopping.

Today, the company is estimated to be valued at about $500 million, thanks in part to Near Protocol&rsquo;s (NEAR) funding.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cosmose is also planning to integrate its customers&rsquo; data into the Near Protocol (NEAR) blockchain to improve efficiency. This is expected to impact its price at some point, which many enthusiasts share.</p>
<p>However, Near Protocol (NEAR) is still trading at $1.8, down by a considerable 4% in the past 24 hours at the time of writing. This bearish descent was followed by a further extension over the past 30 days, down by 8.5%. While a rally in the price of Near Protocol (NEAR) might be imminent, investors are nonetheless opting for the Sparklo presale. They believe its growth will be more significant than that of the Near Protocol (NEAR).</p>

<p>Sparklo (SPRK): An Innovative Project Poised to Disrupt The Investment Industry</p>
<p>In addition, to promote transparency, the KYC audit is almost at its final stage, while the smart contract has been audited by InterFi Network, which it passed with flying colors.

Sparklo is an innovative blockchain-based investment platform aiming to provide more access to investment in gold, silver, and platinum, which is an unprecedented move.</p>
<p>The Sparklo investment platform aims to provide the opportunity to own and invest in bits of precious metals through fractionalized NFTs. By owning bits of NFT, investors are possessing digital assets backed by real-world rare assets. To possess the physical asset directly and not through NFTs, investors can purchase the complete NFT, and it will be delivered directly to them.</p>
<p>Today, Sparklo&rsquo;s presale is worth a cheap price of only $0.017 and an additional 30% bonus until May 5th. It also comes with high growth potential, which analysts have predicted to surpass 3,000% the following year.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the smart contract has been audited by InterFi Network, which it convincingly passed. In addition, there is an ongoing KYC audit and a liquidity lock of 100 years, which improves investors&rsquo; confidence.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Discover four cryptos that could help you build an explosive portfolio. Learn about NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Gala (GALA), Curve DAO (CRV), and Uwerx and why they could benefit your portfolio. Don't miss out on investing in these promising cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Crypto enthusiasts are constantly searching for the next digital asset that could deliver explosive returns on investments (ROI) for their portfolio. The best practice is to seek coins that have performed well in the past, like NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Gala (GALA), and Curve DAO (CRV).</p>
<p>However, new cryptos in their presale stage, like Uwerx, could also deliver explosive returns. Heading into the new week, here&rsquo;s why these four tokens could benefit your portfolio.</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Delivering More Blockchain Scalability Than Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is a smart-contract-enabled Layer-1 blockchain ecosystem that allows developers to develop and deploy dApps. Often listed among the rivals to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) aims to provide a faster and cheaper blockchain solution to Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>However, users, developers, and investors are keener on the network because it promises faster throughput compared to other competitors. NEAR Protocol&rsquo;s (NEAR) throughput can go as high as 100,000 transactions per second (TPS). That is above Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), and Algorand (ALGO), which have 3,000 TPS, 4,500 TPS, and 6,000 TPS, respectively.</p>
<p>As a result of this keen interest, many analysts believe that the value of NEAR, the native utility token of the NEAR Protocol (NEAR), could hit $2.93 within Q4 2023.</p>
<p>GALA (GALA): Improving Gala Games User Experience</p>
<p>GALA (GALA) is the native utility coin for the Gala Games ecosystem. It is the primary token used to purchase NFT items and also the reward received by Founder&rsquo;s Node operators in exchange for running nodes. In addition, it is the gas token used to pay network fees on the Gala (GALA) network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Focusing on GameFi and Web3, the intention of the developers of GALA Games is for GALA (GALA) to offer a viable and secure payment mode and settlement between participants interacting within the Gala Games ecosystem.</p>
<p>As a result, GALA (GALA) has been rising in value amid a wave of optimism thanks to the network's ongoing expansion and development. The ecosystem recently implemented the GALA token burn mechanism used whenever customers make purchases on the GALA (GALA) platform.</p>
<p>As of writing, GALA (GALA) had a daily increase of 3.72%. This data was obtained from CoinMarketCap. Currently trading at $0.035, priceprediction.net predicts the coin to reach $0.065 within Q1 2024.</p>
<p>Curve DAO (CRV): Powering Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</p>
<p>Curve DAO (CRV) is an Ethereum-based crypto that powers Curve Finance, a blockchain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) that leverages an automated market maker (AMM) system. The Curve protocol facilitates the exchange of various ERC-20 tokens while offering swap support for Ethereum-based Bitcoin (BTC) tokens and stablecoins like Dai (DAI). As a decentralized exchange that links users to exchanges with the best pricing, Curve provides low slippage rates and low costs for trading digital coins.</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX): Aiming To Disrupt The Gig Economy</p>
<p>Uwerx will likely be the future of the gig economy and freelancing. By bringing the power of blockchain technology and its unique features to the freelance industry, the InterFi Network and Solidproof audit-approved soon-to-launch project will revolutionize an already innovative industry.</p>
<p>For the presale, the revolutionary crypto project will accept up to 18 different cryptos as payment, improving payment flexibility. At the end of the presale, liquidity tokens of developers will be locked for 25 years to reinforce developers' commitment and investors' funds' security. Plus, the team will forfeit smart contract ownership of the project when taxes hit zero to give investors more assurance about the project and prevent rug pulls.</p>
<p>As a result, we strongly believe that WERX value can reach $1.20 in Q4 2023. So, why sit on the fence? Join the most exciting presale at $0.00995 before the price increase to $0.012 on Satuday and enjoy a 20% purchase bonus whilst your at it! An alpha version of the platform is also due to be unveiled within the current stage.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) and WOO Network (WOO) enthusiasts are shifting their focus to Yachtify (YCHT) &ndash; a project in its first token presale phase with the potential to revolutionize the yacht industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts have predicted that early investors will receive as high as 4,000x their initial investment. This makes it an attractive opportunity for those seeking to diversify their portfolio and invest in real-world assets using cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Shows Bearish Pattern</p>
<p>Since March 17th, Bitcoin's (BTC) price has been exhibiting a head and shoulders pattern, which is often considered a bearish indicator as it usually signals a potential drop in prices. Currently, the neckline of this pattern is situated at $27,500.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Bitcoin's (BTC) value drops below this level, it could experience a further decline to $23,200, which corresponds to the 0.5 Fib retracement support level. However, if Bitcoin (BTC) manages to break above the right shoulder of the pattern, it could defy the bearish trend and potentially climb to $42,000.</p>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $29,083.75, with a 24-hour trading volume of $14,918,910,435. This reflects a 1.42% increase in the last 24 hours and a 2.57% rise over the past week.</p>
<p>WOO Network (WOO) Price Bounces After Recent Fall&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2023, WOO Network (WOO) price has been rising within a long-term ascending parallel channel. On April 15th, the token's price declined after facing rejection at the channel's resistance line.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, WOO Network (WOO) found support at the $0.26 horizontal level and is currently trading in the upper part of the channel. If WOO Network's (WOO) upward trend persists, the next resistance stands at $0.36. Conversely, if the price drops, WOO Network (WOO) may revisit the $0.26 support area.</p>
<p>According to CoinGecko, the WOO Network (WOO) price stands at $0.294097, with a 24-hour trading volume of $47,360,074. This is a 12.38% increase in the last 24 hours and a 9.05% rise over the last week.</p>
<p>Yachtify (YCHT) Offers A Chance For Low-income Earners To Penetrate The $100B+ Yacht Industry&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yachtify is building an ecosystem that will serve the needs of cryptocurrency supporters and yacht lovers alike. The platform will offer a marketplace for users to invest in fractional amounts of NFTs that are backed by physical yachts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also feature a lending protocol that allows users to obtain loans at competitive rates by using their NFT assets and physical yachts as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, Yachtify will establish a rewards club for its members, providing them access to curated networking events, unique NFT releases, and premium benefits. Meanwhile, the platform has taken a step to ensure funds are safe and the token's price does not drop.</p>
<p>To prevent a sudden sell-off at launch, tokens are vested, with investors receiving 20% of their tokens each week for five weeks. Yachtify's initial presale phase offers tokens for only $0.1 each, with a 30% bonus for early investors who purchase before the price hike at the end of this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yachtify has the potential for significant growth and could potentially become a blue-chip cryptocurrency. Smart investors are already bagging Yachtify tokens, you should do the same.</p>

"It offers unprecedented levels of interoperability and scalability for developers and players alike, opening up exciting new possibilities for in-game experiences and interactions."</p>

<p>Multichain tech offers limitless possibilities for new in-game experiences, including cross-chain quests, inter-game tournaments, and franchise crossovers. ReneVerse is leading the way in asset interoperability technology that uses innovative metadata solutions and also benefits from multichain functionality. The developers can use their robust SDK to select their preferred blockchain while still being able to communicate and exchange assets with other blockchain projects.</p>

<p>"ReneVerse's multichain capabilities will enable developers to communicate and collaborate on multiple blockchain networks, enriching both player experiences and developer outcomes," adds Dang.</p>

<p>ReneVerse's commitment to advancing the potential of multichain technology is evident in its ongoing efforts to create a seamless gaming ecosystem that fosters creativity, collaboration, and excitement for both players and developers. As more and more projects embrace the power of multichain, the possibilities for web3 gaming will continue to grow exponentially.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is simmering away, waiting for a sharp breakout that will propel it into a new bull run. AI could lead the charge.</p>
Bitcoin breakout soon?
<p>Those who experienced previous bull markets may say that the crypto space is a trifle boring right now. Yes, bitcoin did rise over 100% since the beginning of the year, but apart from the odd surge up or down, it has generally moved sideways.</p>
<p>A downward trendline has formed for bitcoin since its high for this rally earlier in April. On the weekly time frame there have now been 4 touches of this line so a breakout could be on the cards for next week as long as the price stays around the current level of $29,000.</p>
AI narrative remains strong in crypto
<p>Looking at the altcoins, it can be noted that for several of them the higher, weekly time frame Stochastic RSIs are either at the bottom, or are close to coming down and resetting.</p>
<p>It might be further noted that of these coins, several of them are AI-related. It must be remembered that some of the AI (artificial intelligence) coins were among the best performers over the whole of this latest crypto rally which topped in early February.</p>
<p>$AGIX was the most successful among them. From lift-off on January 2 of this year, $AGIX rose 1,370% in only 6 weeks. Since that time it has drifted sideways and down, coming down to almost touch the 61.8 Fibonacci level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>$AGIX has nearly come back down to this level again, which has good support, formed back in 2021, with the added attraction that the weekly time frame Stochastic RSI is at the bottom and just waiting for a cross up.</p>
<p>Fetch.ai ($FET) was another bright star of the AI altcoins. $FET achieved 520% over the same time period as $AGIX, but if one was to take into account that it started its surge back in November then this would give it a rise of 1,060%.</p>
<p>One further AI-related altcoin that could start another surge soon is Alethea Artificial Liquid Intelligence ($ALI). Since the beginning of the year this coin surged 1,171%, but like $FET, if you take it from the low, it rose over 1,900% since early November.</p>
<p>It must be noted that many factors need to be taken into account before trading any cryptocurrencies. World financial markets and new regulatory impositions are also part of this.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins are back in crypto in earnest. Pepe the frog, based on thin air, is roaring towards a $1 billion market cap.</p>
All aboard the Pepe meme train
<p>Pepe &ndash; the digital token named after one of the most iconic internet memes ever &ndash; has taken the cryptocurrency world by storm. Its market capitalisation is fast approaching 1 billion dollars and its value has skyrocketed recently due to growing support from investors worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret to Pepes success lies in its unique branding and community driven nature. It was launched as a fun project by a group of crypto enthusiasts but has rapidly grown into something much bigger than anyone could have anticipated. The current uptrend for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is also driving interest in Pepe further contributing to its rapid rise in popularity.&nbsp;</p>
A word of caution
<p>However, those wishing to jump onto the Pepe bandwagon and take advantage of the widely expected moon shot need to understand that everything about the Pepe the frog crypto meme coin is pure casino.</p>
<p>Fundamentals do not exist, and the friendly frog is likely to disappear as rapidly as it appeared. Be that as it may, it seems that the kind of retail investor that jumps onto these meme coins just doesn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>The thought of quick money, and for a very few, massive returns, just inspires those retail investors who want to get rich quick. Social media is all part of it, and influencers who hype coins like this and drive buyers into a frenzy all do their bit.</p>
<p>The sad part of it is that the vast majority of retail who jump on this now could likely lose a large chunk of their investment, if not all of it. The cryptocurrency sector is a complex space, and many new investors who are only here for the memes will not understand how to manage their accounts, especially, God forbid, if they are using leverage.</p>
<p>How much longer Pepe continues to rocket skyward is anyone&rsquo;s guess. 1,300% over the last 3 weeks isn&rsquo;t a bad return, and for those who bought very early and held, many thousands of percent would be their prize.</p>
Good for crypto?
<p>The crypto sector has a heritage of openness and is entirely neutral to anyone who wants to launch a token on a blockchain. However, for those who are watching the crypto industry from outside, and who are perhaps involved in, or pro the banking sector shall we say, might see this casino in play and may well use it as an example to confirm their distrust of the sector.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, Pepe fever may continue for the time being. For the investors who lose out, you have been warned &hellip;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Blockchain security firm CertiK has revealed that it has frozen around $160,000, which was stolen during the Merlin DEX rug pull last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merlin, a zkSync-based decentralized exchange, fell victim to an insider rug pull, resulting in a loss of $1.8 million.&nbsp;</p>
Stolen Funds Blocked&nbsp;
<p>The blockchain security firm and smart contract auditor shared the news of the freezing of funds via its official Twitter handle. CertiK tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want to provide the community with an update regarding the Merlin DEX incident that took place on April 25th, when Merlin insiders rugpulled their users for $1.8M. This was an internal rug pull. Merlin insiders abused the owner&rsquo;s wallet privileges. We initially tried to collaborate with the remaining members of the Merlin team, but a number of core members were unwilling to verify their true identities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to CertiK, the firm tried to reach out and collaborate with members of the Merlin team. However, they were unwilling to verify their identities, leading to complications in efforts to aid victims of the rug pull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This lack of cooperation has complicated our efforts to validate and aid victims. We are focusing on working with law enforcement and have submitted information to relevant US &amp; UK agencies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The firm also added that it was monitoring the stolen funds and working with law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom and the United States of America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have successfully frozen $160K of the stolen funds with the help of partners. We will continue to monitor the movement of all stolen funds in an attempt to freeze and recover the remaining amount.&rdquo;</p>

The Merlin Rugpull&nbsp;
<p>Merlin tweeted on its official handle that the rug pull was orchestrated by its back-end team, adding that it had put a high degree of trust in the team. It added that it would continue to support the community and help resolve the issue. CertiK also took on some of the blame, stating that they failed to adequately inform users about the risks that could arise from centralization. The firm added that they would put more emphasis on such issues during future audits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are working to improve the clarity of our audit summaries in our reports &mdash; especially around centralization risks &mdash; and to better communicate with the community about the purpose of an audit. Going forward, CertiK will prioritize centralization risks in audit summaries to ensure users have a complete picture of potential risks. We recognize that audit reports can be highly technical documents, and it&rsquo;s our job to communicate the risks clearly and transparently.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, CertiK also added that smart contract auditors could not be held entirely responsible for failing to identify rug pulls. It stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Code Audits serve the purpose of uncovering vulnerabilities, not to detect a potential rug pull. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that many projects, both large and small have centralization issues flagged, and the vast majority do not result in a rug pull.&rdquo;</p>

<p>CertiK is also working with Merlin and planning to launch a victim aid fund to help those impacted by the Merlin DEX exploit.&nbsp;</p>
