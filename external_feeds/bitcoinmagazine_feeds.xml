The cases could potentially have major impacts on the future of Bitcoin and open-source software development.&nbsp;</p><p>Eleven of the developers being supported by the Fund will file their defense on April 26. <em>Tulip Trading Limited v. Bitcoin Association For BSV &amp; Others</em>, in which the developers are named, stems from an alleged hack in February 2020 that resulted in the loss of 111,000 bitcoin that Wright claims to own. In February 2021, Tulip Trading issued a “Letter Before Action” announcing its intention to take legal action against certain Bitcoin developers to recover the allegedly lost bitcoin.</p><p>Should the UK courts rule in Tulip Trading’s favor, open-source developers could be considered fiduciaries to users of software that they have contributed to, even in projects without any formal assumption of duty or compensation for costs and associated risks. Alex Morcos, the co-founder of Chaincode Labs and the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, said, "the Tulip Trading case threatens not only the MIT License but also the very notion of freedom of speech."</p><p>Craig Wright has also brought a second lawsuit against Bitcoin developers in which he alleges that he is Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, and thus owns the copyright for the Bitcoin Whitepaper and the database rights for the Bitcoin blockchain. <br><br>Should Wright be successful, “it would, in the eyes of the law, allow Craig Wright ultimate control over the Bitcoin network,” a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine says. However, it should be noted that Bitcoin is a protocol and network made up of all its participants worldwide. Bitcoin can not be controlled by any one individual, institution, or government. The law cannot give anyone complete control over the Bitcoin network.</p><p>Jess Jonas, the Chief Legal Officer of the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, said: "We believe that these lawsuits are frivolous, but we still have to oppose them vigorously … fighting for the right of developers to create free and open-source software without fear of legal retaliation.” <br><br>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Block and co-founder of the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, said, "the outcomes of these cases are important for everyone, even those who may not be interested in Bitcoin, because these lawsuits could have serious detrimental effects on open-source development writ large, which will negatively impact our lives in ways we may not even realize until it’s too late."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNDIyMDIx/security-lock-and-fingerprint-key.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Great Restoration: How Bitcoin Can Fix The Art World]]></title><description><![CDATA[The traditional art market is opaque, exclusive and difficult for creators to navigate.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rebel Money, a visual artist who focuses on Bitcoin themes and advocates for other artists in the space.</em></p><p>For centuries, the traditional art market has been dominated by established auction houses and galleries, where works of art are sold for millions of dollars. Despite its longevity, the art market has been criticized for its opaqueness, exclusivity and the difficulties faced by new collectors when navigating its intricacies. In fact, it has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/art-market-we-know-could-thing-past-anders-cederholm-nielsen/">been described as</a> "the most corrupt industry in the world." </p><p>Given that Bitcoin was designed to counter large, corrupt monetary policies, many wonder if it can also disrupt the shady and unscrupulous practices of the art world. If so, how might Bitcoin achieve this transformation?</p><h2>Closed Source</h2><p>From an artist's perspective in the traditional art world, comprehending the intricate economics of selling their artwork and where the funds end up is a daunting task. Unfortunately, artists are often left in the dark about the financial aspects of their craft, which can be disheartening and even exploitative. </p><p>There appears to be a deliberate effort to infantilize the artists, depriving them of a comprehensive understanding of the financial transactions involving their work, and rendering them vulnerable to manipulation by powerful intermediaries in the industry. Art galleries are not immune to such practices, as they take advantage of the complex processes involved in the purchase of artworks, which typically requires the involvement of multiple intermediaries such as banks, auction houses and art dealers. </p><p>This can create a sort of sleight of hand, making it easier for galleries to obscure the actual sale value of artwork, and resulting in the artist being kept in the dark about the true value of their work. </p><p>The murky economic model applies not just to artists but also for new collectors trying to navigate the market. Large galleries often change prices depending on who they are selling to, which can make it difficult for new collectors to acquire pieces. This tactic allows galleries to maintain control over who owns the art, limit the supply and ensure that the art will not end up in the secondary market, leading to a <a href="https://mises.org/wire/cantillon-effects-why-inflation-helps-some-and-hurts-others">Cantillon-style effect</a>.</p><p>In addition to the challenges faced by new collectors, museums and prestigious collectors often have access to special work and can pay less for pieces. Having their names associated with certain pieces can also boost the value of the artwork. For example, the Guggenheim has <a href="https://qz.com/103091/high-end-art-is-one-of-the-most-manipulated-markets-in-the-world">reportedly received discounts of 30% or more</a> for certain pieces because of their association with the museum. </p><p>These pricing tactics and exclusivity practices can leave new collectors feeling frustrated and unable to acquire pieces, no matter the cost. Even celebrities like Daniel Radcliffe, known for his role in the “Harry Potter” movies, have been turned down when trying to acquire pieces. <a href="https://observer.com/2012/02/harry-potter-and-the-boring-art-fair-story/">Radcliffe told Time Out London</a> that, in 2012, he attempted to purchase a Jim Hodges piece but was told, "No, we’re waiting for a more prestigious collector to take that."</p><p>While it may be tempting to assume that large auctions at industry giants such as Sotheby's or Christie's are fair and open, the reality is that the price of art at auction can still be manipulated. Despite the seemingly-transparent nature of auctions, there are still ways for insiders to control the outcomes. One example is the practice of "<a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-auction-house-buzzwords-new-collectors">chandelier bidding</a>," where an auctioneer takes extra phantom bids from non-existent bidders in order to artificially inflate the price of a piece. This technique is used to create an illusion of competition, driving up the price and creating a sense of urgency among bidders. In addition to chandelier bidding, collectors may also bid on lots simply to raise the bidding temperature, even if they have no real interest in the accompanying piece, in order to protect the value of their existing collection. </p><p>As a result, auction prices may not always reflect the true market rates, and may instead be influenced by these behind-the-scenes tactics.</p><h2>Can Bitcoin Fix This?</h2><p>The use of Bitcoin in the art world has the potential to address the issues of corruption and inequality in the industry. Bitcoin offers a more efficient and transparent transaction mechanism, eliminating the need for multiple intermediaries and enabling immediate payment for artists after the sale of their artwork.</p><p>However, the human layer of Bitcoin adoption in the art world is complex. While Bitcoin has the potential to be a powerful tool for good, it can also be misused by those with malicious intentions. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has the ability to incentivize ethical behavior in the art world. As Bitcoin is not subject to inflationary pressures, it reduces the exploitation of artists in revenue sharing and eliminates the need for potentially-questionable practices.</p><p>Bitcoin auction sites such as <a href="https://scarce.city/">Scarce.City</a> and <a href="https://plebeian.market/">Plebeian Market</a> have recognized the gap in the market and are leveraging Bitcoin's capabilities to create a more ethical approach to art sales. By charging lower fees and offering a transparent bidding process open to all, these companies aim to disrupt the traditional gallery and auctioneering worlds. With direct payments to artists and collectors after the auction, the use of Bitcoin in the art world could bring more fairness and transparency to the industry.</p><h2>P(ower)2P(ainters)</h2><p>And Bitcoin's disruptive potential extends beyond just providing a more efficient and transparent means of buying and selling art. It has the power to fundamentally change the traditional art world's structure by offering a decentralized, peer-to-peer relationship between artists and collectors. This shift is crucial because it enables artists to have direct relationships with their collectors, rather than relying on galleries to control access to their work.</p><p>In the conventional art market, the artist's relationship with the collector is often non-existent, and it is the gallery that dictates who gets to collect the artwork. However, with Bitcoin, artists have the opportunity to create beautiful and meaningful relationships with their collectors, as both parties navigate and learn from each other. This relationship-building process is facilitated by the fact that Bitcoin enables transactions to occur directly between artists and collectors, without intermediaries.</p><p>The emergence of digital art collectibles, such as Counterparty tokens, Ordinals and Rare Pepes, has further amplified this effect. With these digital art collectibles, artists can easily send their pieces to collectors around the world and reward them with additional sub-assets in the future. This new dynamic empowers artists to grow their work organically as their relationships with their collectors develop.</p><h2>Fake Rares</h2><p>Counterfeiting and the forgery of artworks have plagued the art industry for centuries and continue to be major concerns for galleries, auction houses and collectors. In fact, the Fine Art Expert Institute's report suggests that the market for fake artworks is worth approximately <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a12108723/fake-art-how-to-avoid-scams/">$6 billion per year</a>. Moreover, in some categories of artwork, the percentage of fake artworks may <a href="https://www.widewalls.ch/magazine/more-then-half-of-art-is-fake">reach as high as 70%</a>. To make matters worse, <a href="https://www.insider.com/cases-of-faked-and-forged-artwork-2019-1">some experts suggest</a> that up to 20% of art pieces displayed in museums around the world could be counterfeit.</p><p>The rise of Bitcoin presents an opportunity to combat art forgery and counterfeiting through its immutable ledger. This technology can provide a transparent and secure platform for art sales, addressing the issue of authenticity and provenance. By embedding tokens in physical art pieces or digital art, these assets can be tracked transparently from owner to owner, ensuring that the buyer is purchasing a piece of authentic art.</p><p>This method of tracking art pieces has significant potential to mitigate the risk of forgeries and counterfeits in the art market. It also offers art collectors and investors a transparent way to purchase art pieces with confidence, knowing that they are genuine and have a reliable provenance. Furthermore, it may discourage counterfeiters from creating fake artworks altogether, as their creations can be easily detected and traced back to the source, leading to legal consequences. As such, Bitcoin can play a pivotal role in reducing the circulation of fake art, ensuring that the art industry remains a safe and secure place for art collectors, investors and enthusiasts.</p><h2>1494 All Over Again</h2><p>More and more art and artists are being drawn to Bitcoin every day. This is not a surprise, as creators are primed for adoption of Bitcoin. Artists know that proof of work and energy transmutation have always been a part of the alchemical process of painting. Selling artwork for sats is an artist's way of mining.</p><p>With greater adoption, Bitcoin principles such as leveraging open-source information, emphasizing transparency, remaining borderless and promoting decentralization will influence the traditional art market through the nuts and bolts of the network and, perhaps more importantly, the culture and behavior surrounding it.</p><p>It gives artists and collectors new tools to sell art and forge relationships directly. While there will always be a role for the gallerist, transparency is the basis for growth in Bitcoin art, and building off of it can create a more ethical and creative ecosystem.</p><p>In 1494, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/10/04/162296423/the-accountant-who-changed-the-world">invention of double-entry accounting</a> ushered in a new era of human prosperity and a golden age of artistic expression. While it’s not a silver bullet, Bitcoin offers a real hope of echoing history and paving the way for a Renaissance in the art world in terms of creativity, freedom and ethics. Embrace the great restoration.</p><p><strong><u><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1rqRbWHeYtwtb1OHKMs0d5?si=2me3VzVZQGOI3hn7xqJ6og&amp;nd=1">For more, listen to the Bitcoin Magazine Podcast episode featuring a conversation between Rebel Money, Dennis Koch and X Nardo.</a></u></strong></p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rebel Money.

The filing follows a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2022/petn4-789.pdf">July 2022 petition</a> from Coinbase asking the SEC to use formal rulemaking to provide guidance for the crypto sector. Coinbase claims that the SEC has not yet responded to its petition, so it has filed the legal challenge to compel the SEC to respond either positively or negatively to its request.</p><p>The Administrative Procedure Act requires the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s rulemaking petition “within a reasonable time.” If the SEC decides not to respond, Coinbase will have the right to challenge that decision in court. Coinbase does not seek to dictate the SEC’s response, only to require that the agency responds at all, according to a<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-takes-another-formal-step-to-seek-regulatory-clarity-from-sec-for"> statement released by the company.</a></p><p>Coinbase and other crypto firms are facing potential regulatory enforcement actions from the SEC, even though the agency has not stated its position on the application of the law to the crypto sector. Coinbase asserts that regulatory clarity is long overdue for the industry, and that new rules would be “a critical step to giving the public notice about what activities they can and cannot engage in.”</p><p>Coinbase said it recognizes that clear rules are needed for the industry and has asked for rules to be developed. The exchange’s decision to challenge the SEC is an attempt to compel basic rulemaking, according to the firm. Coinbase added that it will continue to take every step available to seek regulatory clarity until the industry gets that clarity. </p><p>Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase Paul Grewal said in <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1650655478014410753?s=20">a statement on Twitter</a> that “The crypto industry, and its users need clear laws and rules to follow that are built for a new technology.

María’s hit Spanish Bitcoin book has been translated into English for an entirely new audience.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Magazine Books, the book publishing branch of BTC Inc., has announced the release of "The Philosophy of Bitcoin" by Álvaro D. María in English. The book was originally published in Spanish in 2022 as "La Filosofía de Bitcoin" and received much attention for its unique exploration of Bitcoin's disruptive nature to civilization. Ellen Sullivan, the publisher of Bitcoin Magazine Books, said that it's a great privilege to work with Álvaro and to deliver his groundbreaking work to English-speaking readers. "We plan to honor that commitment with a launch that we hope will be heard around the world. Everyone, Bitcoiners or not, should read this book."</p><p>"The Philosophy of Bitcoin" delves into the nature of Bitcoin and its political implications. The author, Álvaro D. María, with his unique background in philosophy and law, analyzes its innovations and explains why institutions are being challenged as a result of Bitcoin's emergence. In the book, he argues that Bitcoin is comparable to other revolutionary technologies like gunpowder or the internet. Through a deep philosophical exploration, readers will learn how Bitcoin is changing the way we think about money, power, and the role of the State in society.</p><p>According to María, "Bitcoin redefines the right to property by making it absolute and poses a new challenge to states, opening the door to new political forms by changing the current bargaining power. If gunpowder accelerated the passage from the Middle Ages to the Modern Age, Bitcoin will help accelerate the passage to the Information Age."</p><p>"The Philosophy of Bitcoin" is available now in the <a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books">Bitcoin Magazine Shop</a>, and Álvaro D. María will be signing copies of his book at <a href="http://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023</a> at the Book Signing Booth. This is a unique opportunity for readers to meet the author and delve deeper into the ideas presented in his book. Bitcoin Magazine Books is committed to bringing high-quality, thought-provoking literature about Bitcoin to a wider audience.

Here’s an essential guide to understanding money and its role in today’s economic system.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Money is something that most of us take for granted, as we use it daily to buy goods and services. We constantly transact in money, think in money and strive to earn more of it. However, few genuinely understand what money is, and even those who do often perceive it in very different ways. </p><p>Some say that money is a form of energy that can be transformed and exchanged. Others see it as a technological tool that facilitates trade and commerce. Still others argue that money is a social construct shaped and governed by cultural norms and values. All these views can be correct since the concept of money is much deeper than the way it is commonly framed. </p><p>Our perspectives on money shape our views on how we use it. Money assumes various forms, spanning physical tender, precious metals, bank deposits, credit and, more recently, bitcoin. The most recognized form of money today is physical tender, encompassing coins and paper notes, which are distributed by the government. </p><h2>So, What is Money? </h2><p>Money is, first and foremost, a means to transact, to purchase goods and services. This function is commonly referred to as a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a>. It is a good you acquire not for its own sake but merely as a <em>means</em> to purchase another good.</p><ul><li>✅ Money is a market good, a good you acquire in order to acquire other goods. For this to happen, the market (sellers) must accept it as a medium of exchange.</li><li>❌ Money is not a consumption good, goods that directly satisfy consumer wants and needs. (Examples: a shirt, a pair of shoes, bread, cola, etc.)</li><li>❌ Money is not a capital good, which are physical assets that an organization uses to manufacture products and services that consumers will use later — e.g., machines, tools, vehicles, buildings, etc.</li></ul><p>How we conceptualize and understand money has evolved over time, and different schools of thought have emerged regarding its nature and function. </p><p>Karl Marx would say that money is the product of a commodity economy, where the source and nature of money are based on the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/labor-theory-of-value.asp">labor theory of value</a>, while Carl Menger, the founder of the Austrian school of economics, defined money as the relative ability for goods to be sold in a given market at a given time and price — a good’s “salability.” The most salable good is the good chosen to facilitate indirect trade based on the lowest rate of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingutility.asp">declining marginal utility</a>. </p><p>Proponents of the Austrian school would say that the supply of money is either extremely durable in relation to current production — as it was under the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/gold-standard">gold standard.</a> Another view is that money is determined exogenously by a government authority — a position often taken by many of today’s economists, educated in a largely Keynesian paradigm. In recent history, the choice has been either gold or government.</p><p>The global economy has undergone significant changes since money’s last fleeting connection to gold ended in 1971. The fiat standard has enabled central banks to print money with complete discretion, leading to inflation and currency devaluation. Digital money ushered in novel opportunities for enhanced global trade and investment while intensifying competition and economic uncertainty. The shift to untethered money has brought forth a plethora of advantages and disadvantages, which shape today’s economic landscape.</p><h2>Why Do We Need Money? </h2><p>Money is necessary for a society that wants to trade, as it facilitates exchange and allows us to meet our basic survival needs — like shelter, food and clothing — and enables us to live within specific security and safety standards.</p><p>Without the invention of money, people would still be using barter or keeping ledgers of credit and debt. Barter works well when the needs and supplies of two parties match, as they can simply exchange these items directly without any monetary medium.. This is called the coincidence of wants or the double coincidence of wants.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTY4OTcyMTk4OTc0/coincidence-of-wants.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>It’s immediately apparent that a barter economy restricts the ability to trade, as it requires people to possess goods (preferably non-perishable) that they are willing to swap. They must also find other people who want the goods you own, and lastly, you must want the goods they possess. The coincidence of wants does not support a scalable monetary system. </p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTgyNjYyNDA3ODEw/barter-doesn_t-scale.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The solution is for society — or the market — to agree on an efficient good that will enable the exchange of products and services between all market participants. Money removes the necessity to find a particular person to barter with while offering a market to exchange your goods or services for a common medium of exchange. You will use that medium to buy what you need from others who also accept it as money.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>By providing the optionality, money is the best natural mechanism to save for the future. It allows economies to thrive by increasing trade and commerce; modern economies could simply not exist without money. </p><p>With little access to money, our freedoms and time are limited as we are forced to spend most of our time working to obtain the money necessary to cover the basic necessities. Having access to more money is empowering, as it allows us to make more informed decisions about the hours we need to work and the goods and services we consume — the neighborhood we live in, the car we drive, the restaurants we eat at and even the healthcare we choose.</p><p>It also provides beneficial opportunities for our children, as parents can afford better food, better education and a better way to pass on their wealth, assuming that the money can hold its value through time — which is one of the three universally accepted functions of money. </p><h2>Functions of Money </h2><p>Money has taken different forms over the years, from gold and silver to glass beads in Africa or wampum used by Native Americans. What’s remained constant across continents and throughout history is that money must perform the following three functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</p><p>1.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange"><strong>Medium of exchange</strong></a>: Money serves as a medium of exchange when it allows people to trade goods and services easily without resorting to barter. This simplifies transactions and makes commerce more efficient.</p><p>As an intermediary between the products or services people want to trade, money is a suitable medium of exchange. “[money] is not acquired for its own properties, but for its salability.” – “The Bitcoin Standard,”<em> </em>Saifedean Ammous.</p><p>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account"><strong>Unit of Account</strong></a>: Money provides a standard measure of value, enabling people to compare the worth of different goods and services. A consistent price allows people to measure the market value of goods, services, economic activities, assets and liabilities. The price is what indicates the measurement of a good’s market value relative to other goods on the market.</p><p>When goods, services, assets or salaries are quoted in a recognizable unit of account, it allows buyers and sellers to quickly determine if a trade is worthwhile. Prices expressed in a unit of account lets market participants decide to operate complex tasks, accumulate capital or engage in economic calculations.</p><p>3.&nbsp;<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value"><strong>Store of Value</strong></a>: Money serves as a store of value, allowing individuals and organizations to save and store wealth through time, without its value deteriorating. Current expectations of future supply and demand for an asset drive the ability of something to be a good store of value.</p><p>A store of value must be a durable good with limited supply issuance. Consumption goods such as milk and capital goods like machinery or cars are poor stores of value because they can perish, corrode, depreciate or lose value over time.</p><p>Andreas Antonopoulos, a long-time Bitcoin educator, argues that technology and network systems in the modern era may have given rise to a darker side of money. He introduced a fourth function:</p><p>4.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyK4P7ZdOK8"><strong>System of Control</strong></a> (external link): Money as a system of control refers to how money can be manipulated to serve political agendas. This has turned financial services companies into deputies of the system. As deputies, they get certain perks, such as never going to jail, but this has come at the expense of corruption and economic exclusion.</p><p>When money is used as a system of control, it corrupts its other functions, including its ability to serve as a medium of exchange and store of value. Money abused in this way works to the advantage of corrupt politicians and dictators, as it ensures that political dissent can be censored very effectively by limiting transactions or blocking purchases.</p><p>In the 20th century, governments monopolized the issuance of money and continually undermined its use as a store of value, creating a false narrative that money is primarily a medium of exchange. Money that doesn’t store value into the future results in a society that concerns itself less about the future.</p><p>Sound money, in contrast, is defined as money with a purchasing power determined by markets, independent of governments. Market participants, left to their own devices, naturally select a monetary medium that best fulfills the three functions of money. To achieve this status, it needs to have strong monetary properties. </p><h2>Properties of Money</h2><p>There are six widely accepted properties of money and it has been this way for centuries. So long as an item has these properties, it’s a good candidate for becoming money. Whichever monetary candidate records the highest score against these properties is likely to be used as the de facto unit of trade. </p><h3>Standard properties: </h3><ol><li><strong>Durable</strong> — Money must be durable to be passed around and used repeatedly without the danger of wear and damage and the consequent depreciation of its value.</li><li><strong>Portable</strong> — Money should be easy to transport, physically or digitally, so that it can be transferred in trade. Cash and gold are portable in small quantities, yet more significant amounts can be challenging to move over long distances or through border controls. </li><li><strong>Divisible</strong> — Money must be capable of being divided into smaller parts. For example, a $10 bill can be exchanged for two $5 bills without diminishing its (combined) value. A cow or a stone, on the other hand, is not divisible. </li><li><strong>Fungible</strong> — Money should be completely interchangeable: one dollar should always be equal to another dollar, the same way two $5 bills are interchangeable with one $10 bill.</li><li><strong>Scarcity</strong> — Scarcity, or limited supply, is another essential property of sound money. Computer scientist Nick Szabo defined scarcity as “unforgeable costliness,” meaning the cost of creating something cannot be faked. If money is too plentiful, it loses value over time as more units can and will be created, and more will be required to purchase a good or service.</li><li><strong>Verifiable</strong> — Money should be a verifiable record accepted as a medium of exchange to pay for goods and services or to repay a debt in a specific country. It should be easy to recognize and hard to counterfeit; otherwise, it would lose value for payment purposes and would be rejected by vendors.</li></ol><p>Each of these properties underpins the functions of money, encapsulated by Erik Yakes below as well as in his <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-dimensions-of-money">series on the dimensions of money.</a> Clearly, owning a scarce good that’s durable is a good means of storing value through time. But that’s not enough to make something money; it also has to be desirable, or acceptable and portable if it is to be used in exchange for other goods and services. Once this is achieved, it can become a unit of account so long as it’s divisible and fungible. </p><figure>

    </figure><p>Since the invention of digital money, three additional monetary properties can be considered, including established history, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/uphill-battle-bitcoin-ban">censorship resistance</a> and programmability, which have significantly impacted how we perceive and use money in the digital age.</p><h3>Additional Properties: </h3><ol><li><strong>Established history</strong> — The Lindy effect suggests that the life expectancy of certain non-perishable entities, such as technologies or ideas, is directly related to their current age. In essence, the longer these entities have survived and remained relevant, the greater their chances of continued existence into the future. This longevity indicates resistance to change, obsolescence or competition, which increases their chance of survival over time.</li><li><strong>Censorship resistance</strong> — Decentralization ensures that nobody, nowhere, can have their money confiscated or blocked from usage. Censorship resistance is a relatively new monetary property for those who want to be sure their wealth is untouchable.</li><li><strong>Smart/Programmable</strong> — Typically refers to blockchain technology systems which allow certain conditions to be met before money can be spent. It’s a mechanism for specifying the automated behavior of that money through a computer program. </li></ol><p>Money does not need to be “backed” by anything; it only needs these properties to have value. </p><p>The idea that money must be backed by something only exists because paper money was once redeemable or “backed by” gold, where intrinsically useless fiat money piggybacked onto gold’s valuable properties.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjE0MzM3NzkxMDM4/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Bitcoin promises to be the next step in the evolution of money. It’s built upon the same properties that once made gold the de facto monetary medium for centuries, only it’s been enhanced with the additional properties of extreme portability and fungibility — those very properties that allowed fiat to usurp gold during the last century.</p><p>Unlike gold and fiat, bitcoin is built for the digital age. Its supply is strictly regulated by its code and enforced by those who use it. It’s a system of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-a-world-of-rules-without-rulers">rules without rulers</a>, that allows transactions to be transmitted globally in mere seconds and settled within minutes without incurring the exorbitant expenses and approval typically associated with traditional financial systems.</p><p>For the first time in history, we have a monetary system based on a distributed, immutable technology that is transparent, objective, programmable and well suited to move economic value across time and space without relying on a trusted intermediary and the issuance by central banks. Satoshi Nakamoto created peer-to-peer electronic cash that would not require trust in third parties for transactions, and its supply could not be altered by any other player. </p><p>It’s often said that gold is the king’s money, and fiat is government money. If so, then bitcoin is undoubtedly the people’s money. </p><p>Read more &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">What is Bitcoin</a></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>Many who theorize about money believe that the connection to a commodity at its origin is the real reason any money could initially gain value, or hold that the support of rulers is what establishes monetary value; proponents of those arguments therefore believe that money is a creature of the state. </p><p>Money has a considerable history and has evolved numerous times. The last significant evolution marked the end of the gold standard and ushered in the beginning of fiat money. The state — via central banks — eventually destroyed two critical properties of money: soundness and sovereignty. These are the properties that enabled value to be passed down through generations. </p><p>The emergence of Bitcoin should be viewed within this scheme of things. As a medium of exchange, a global unit of account, a store of value, an international and online method for settlement, it’s conducive to individual sovereignty.</p><p>Bitcoin emerged as an alternative to government restrictions on individuals who transfer money and as an alternative to the state’s control over the money supply. As long as those premises continue to exist, then demand for bitcoin will continue to increase.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk2ODU0NTU1MjgxOTkwNzE4/what-is-money-feature-image.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTY4OTcyMTk4OTc0/coincidence-of-wants.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTgyNjYyNDA3ODEw/barter-doesn_t-scale.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NTkwNzE1NDcwOTEw/money-as-a-medium-of-exchange.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjA3ODk1ODY0OTYy/unnamed.png" height="376" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2ODU0NjE0MzM3NzkxMDM4/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unit of Account: A Comprehensive Guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[Unit of AccountUnit of account is the thing that measures the value of goods and services.

In simple terms, it is a standard measure of value, a common scaling system through which the value of products can be calculated and compared.</p><p>Countries typically have distinct units of account, identified as the national or regional currency, such as the euro (EUR) or the British pound (GBP). At the same time, internationally, the U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of account that is mainly used for global invoicing and setting prices internationally. </p><p>Unit of account is one of money’s three universally agreed <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">functions of <em>money</em></a> that Bitcoin Magazine is reviewing; the other two are <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/store-of-value"></a></em> and <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/medium-of-exchange"></a></em>.</p><h2>What is a Unit of Account</h2><p>A unit of account is whatever forms the standard measure for comparing prices with incomes or assets; it allows money users to assess the value of money and is the common denomination for transfer value across different types of goods and services. When a unit of account is defined by the same measure or denomination (such as a specific currency), it’s easier to compare the value of various assets and transactions. </p><p>Having a standard measure makes it easier to determine the value of two different items, such as the price of a house and a car. Knowing the car’s cost and the house’s price makes budgeting and transactions easier to assess.</p><p>It also allows us to process mathematical operations, such as calculating profits, losses and income, giving numerical values to what we produce, trade and consume.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Typically, what we identify as a unit of account is money — in recent times, backed by governments and national currencies. It’s what we use as a standard measure for all our daily transactions.</p><h2>Money as a Unit of Account</h2><p>Money as a unit of account is also used to measure a country’s economy. For example, the American economy is measured in U.S. dollars, the Chinese in yuan and so forth. Internationally, things tend to be simplified with the U.S. dollar as a unit of account, making it easier to compare different economies.</p><p>Money is the standard measure used in economics and financial markets to establish how much people can borrow or lend, and keep track of their assets’ value. Applicable interest rates are also calculated in the same unit of account.</p><p>Finally, money is also used to calculate the net worth of individuals, businesses and organizations of different types, including the monetary value of their assets. </p><h2>Essential Elements of a Unit of Account</h2><p>To gain acceptance as money by the market, a good typically goes through a three-stage process: starting as a store of value, progressing to a medium of exchange and finally becoming a unit of account to establish its quantifiable monetary value.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>We’ve seen that a unit of account is used as a standard unit of measurement for the market value of goods and services and to be salable. For a good to be defined and credible as a unit of account, it must have the following properties:</p><p><strong>Divisibility</strong>: As a unit of account, money must be divisible into smaller units to facilitate transactions, express the value of goods and services more accurately and effectively, and compare various items’ values more easily. </p><p><strong>Fungible</strong>: Fungibility is an essential characteristic of a unit of account and occurs when two units of the same currency are interchangeable. Hence, the value of one unit of account is identical to another of the same kind. One dollar bill, for instance, has the same value as another dollar bill. Often seen as a property of a medium of exchange, its importance lies in its function rather than its classification.</p><h2>How Does Inflation Affect the Unit of Account?</h2><p>Inflation doesn't make the Unit of Account (UoA) function worse; however, price instability does make it challenging to compare the worth of goods and services over time. The unit of account serves to facilitate the understanding of supply and demand dynamics in the economy, but its reliability is severely eroded by inflation. </p><p>As a result, market participants may struggle to make informed decisions regarding consumption, investments and savings. </p><h2>What Makes a Good Unit of Account?</h2><p>Money that is divisible, and fungible makes a good unit of account. Money not impacted by inflation would make an even better unit of account. People often argue that we should have a type of money that's measurable, stable and constant, like the metric system.</p><p>If the unit of account was standardized like the metric system, it would be much easier to accurately and consistently assess the value of goods and services over time. However, value is subjective and shifting, and the world’s circumstances differ over time, so there cannot be any guarantee that value is always represented in the same way. </p><p>While we will never have a type of money that becomes as measurable as the metric system, we can have money that has a preprogrammed, inelastic supply and is detached from the real-world value of things.</p><h2>Bitcoin as a Unit of Account</h2><p>If a type of money has the primary properties discussed, is accepted globally and is also censorship resistant, it’s potentially the best unit of account ever created. </p><p>Bitcoin, however, is still relatively new and has a lot of maturing to do before it can be recognized as a consistent unit of account. Since Bitcoin has a fixed maximum supply of 21 million coins, it is not subject to the same inflationary pressures of traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed ad infinitum by central banks. This should provide a level of predictability and certainty for businesses and individuals when assessing the value of goods and services, making long-term financial planning easier and more reliable.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of inflationary pressures on the unit of account would also promote more responsible economic decision-making by governments and businesses. Since the temptation to print more money to fund government programs or stimulate the economy would be removed, policymakers would have to find other ways to manage economic growth, such as through innovation, productivity and investment.</p><p>In addition, If bitcoin were to become the global reserve currency, it would promote greater international trade and investment by eliminating the need for currency exchanges and mitigating the risk of currency fluctuations. This would make it easier and less expensive for individuals and businesses to transact with one another across borders, facilitating greater economic cooperation and growth worldwide.</p><p>Overall, a unit of account not impacted by inflation would offer a stable foundation for the global economy, enabling businesses and individuals to plan for the future more confidently while promoting more responsible economic decision-making and international trade.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MzA0MTc3NjU2ODM4/unit-of-account-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5NTQ0Njk1ODI1NDE0/scales.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is a Store of Value?

This term is used to describe a mechanism that enables individuals to preserve their wealth without experiencing any loss in value over time. </p><p>It is one of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">three functions of <em>money</em></a><em> </em>that Bitcoin Magazine is exploring; the other two are <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a></em> and <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/unit-of-account"></a></em>.</p><h2>What is a Store of Value</h2><p>A store of value is an asset, a currency or a commodity that can be trusted to hold its value over time; ideally, it doesn’t bear much risk. Traditionally, people who are less tolerant to risk will invest in a store of value with an enduring lifespan, a stable demand and low volatility. </p><p>Fiat currencies are weak stores of value since they depreciate over time due to inflation. Commodities like bitcoin, gold and a collection of other monetary metals have good store-of-value attributes because they are relatively limited in supply and do not deteriorate over time, thereby maintaining their value.</p><p>Salability is the critical property that allows something to be freely used as money and defines a physical good or asset that can be quickly sold. To have salability, money must be divisible (scale dimension), transportable (space dimension) and durable (time dimension). When an asset possesses salability across time, we have a good store of value because it can be trusted to maintain its value into the future.</p><p>One benchmark often used to understand the store-of-value function is that the value of an ounce of gold happened to match the price of a high-quality men’s suit. This principle is known as the “gold-to-decent-suit ratio,” and its roots can be traced back to Ancient Rome, where the cost of a top-of-the-line toga was said to be equivalent to an ounce of gold. After 2,000 years, the price — defined in gold — of a high-quality suit is still close to the price of an equivalent Ancient Roman toga.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Another example is the price of one barrel of oil in fiat versus gold. In 1913, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=rwtc&amp;f=m">one barrel of oil cost $0.97</a>, while <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/energy">today it’s about $80</a>. In contrast, <a href="https://onlygold.com/gold-prices/historical-gold-prices/">one ounce of gold would buy 22 barrels of oil in 1913</a>, while it buys roughly 24 today — showing barely any difference in the gold price (good store of value) versus a big depreciation of the fiat currency (bad store of value).</p><h2>Why do we need a store of value?</h2><p>Money is an essential tool for trading goods and services, but it is also important to have a good store of value to save and secure a better future for ourselves and our families. While fiat currencies are suitable as a medium of exchange, they are not reliable stores of value, as they lose value over time due to inflation, historically around 2-3% per year.</p><p>In extreme cases, such as in Venezuela, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> has led to astronomical rates of inflation, making these fiat currencies very poor stores of value. While these examples serve as outliers, rising inflation levels are becoming more common in modern times, leading to a natural mechanism to save for the future and to find ways to beat 2-3% inflation rates.</p><p>It’s important to have a reliable store of value to secure the value of our hard-earned money over time. As poor stores of value, fiat currencies are thought to discourage people from saving or even earning money in the first place. </p><h2>Is money a good store of value?</h2><p>In the modern age, we use “fiat” currencies,, the term derived from the Latin word “fiat” meaning a decree or an arbitrary order; it’s basically a promise of what a value could be. Such a concept was established when governments’ paper or minted money could be redeemed for a set amount of a physical commodity. Since then, the term fiat has remained, even though currencies aren’t backed by commodities or possess any intrinsic value of their own. </p><p>While fiat currency has many properties that identify it as money, it’s a poor store of value since it isn’t linked to physical reserves, such as gold or silver. The result is that fiat currencies gradually lose value due to inflation or suddenly in the event of hyperinflation. </p><p>Fiat currencies are considered soft money because they are too dependent on a government’s price stability targets — generally focused on price stability, with general prices increasing at 2% per year — instead of allowing the market to naturally decide prices. This approach leads governments to gradually siphon off the value of the money while increasing the price of everything else in the process.</p><h2>Essential Elements of a Store of Value</h2><p><br>During its evolution as money, an item will develop through three different phases, starting with a <em>store of value</em> before becoming a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/medium-of-exchange">medium of exchange</a></em> and eventually a <em><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money/unit-of-account"></a></em><em>. </em>The three dimensions of the most salable goods are across time, space and through scales.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>A store of value is the most salable good, one that has the ability to preserve its value over time.</p><p>To possess the function of a store of value, a salable good should be scarce; it must have a limited supply compared to other goods. It should also be durable so that it can be used repeatedly without losing its functionality. </p><ul><li>Scarcity: a good that’s limited in supply relative to other goods and to the demand for it. Computer scientist <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/nick-szabo">Nick Szabo</a> defined scarcity as “unforgeable costliness,” meaning the cost of creating something cannot be faked. If money is too plentiful, it loses value over time as more units can and will be created, and more will be required to purchase a good or service.</li></ul><ul><li>Durability: this property refers to the ability of a good to maintain its physical and functional properties over time. This means that the currency should be able to withstand wear and tear and remain in circulation for a long period without deteriorating or losing its value.</li></ul><ul><li>Immutability: Immutability is a desirable and new property of money because it ensures that once a transaction is confirmed and recorded, it cannot be altered or reversed. </li></ul><h2>What's a good store of value?</h2><p>Many different assets can serve as a store of value, but defining the best is constantly debated among investors and largely depends on market dynamics and investors’ preferences. It is worth noting that certain assets may lose their store-of-value status over time. A prime example of this is silver, which experienced a decrease in its store-of-value functionality as its supply increased due to its growing use in industrial applications rather than its traditional use as a monetary metal.</p><h3>Bitcoin</h3><p>Initially regarded as a speculative asset due to its notable price fluctuations, bitcoin increasingly became a store of value as investors and more people realized its potential worth as a new monetary asset. Bitcoin represents the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-discovery-of-bitcoin-is-a-puzzle">discovery of digital, sound money</a> and is a scientific revolution that is proving so far to not only be a store of value but also a means to increase value. </p><p>Bitcoin is becoming a significant force in the economy because it meets the requirements of a store of value better than any other form of money.</p><ul><li>Scarcity: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins, which makes it resistant to the arbitrary inflation that ails traditional currencies. This limited supply gives it a scarcity value, making it a valuable asset to hold and store wealth.</li></ul><ul><li>Durability: Bitcoin is a purely data-based, immutable form of money. Its digital ledger system uses proof of work and economic incentives to resist any attempts to alter it, ensuring that it remains a reliable store of value over time.</li></ul><ul><li>Immutability: once a transaction is confirmed and recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or reversed. This immutability is a critical feature of Bitcoin because it ensures that the integrity of the ledger is maintained, and transactions cannot be tampered with or falsified. This is especially important in an increasingly digital world, where trust and security are paramount concerns.</li></ul><h3>Precious Metals</h3><p>Precious metals like gold, palladium and platinum have long been good stores of value due to their perpetual shelf life and industrial use cases. They are relatively limited in supply which makes their value appreciate relative to fiat money. Bitcoin is even more limited in supply than gold and precious metals and has <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-vs-gold/">appreciated in value against gold</a> since its inception.</p><p>Physically storing large quantities of gold is expensive and challenging. For this reason, investors often choose to invest in digital gold or gold stocks, which are subject to counterparty risks. Gemstones like diamonds and sapphires are useful too as they are easier to store and transport.</p><h3>Real Estate</h3><p>Real estate is one of the most common stores of value due to its tangibility and utility. Over time, its value tends to increase, at least this has been the case since the 1970s. Before then, real estate and land kept pace with prices, having real returns around ~0% over longer periods (subject to wars and crashes, etc). Despite temporary downfalls along the way, it remains stable, offering physical land or construction owners a sense of safety when investing in it.</p><p>Real estate can be any physical property like land or a home that can be used as a primary residence, a vacation home, or a commercial property to rent or sell. The downside of real estate is that it’s not liquid or censorship resistant. This lack of liquidity can be problematic for property owners who require access to cash quickly and can be subject to government intervention or legal action. </p><h3>Stock Market</h3><p>Buying stocks on the NYSE, the LSE and the JPX markets has proved to be a good investment over time because they have increased their worth over the years: Stocks have been decent stores of value. However, they may experience high volatility and depend highly on market forces and economic movements, which makes them similar to fiat currencies.</p><h3>Index Funds/ETFs</h3><p>Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are another way to get exposure to the stock and equity markets and provide an easy way for investors to diversify their portfolios. </p><p>Over a long time, such markets have also proved to increase in value, making them good stores of value. ETFs are also more cost- and tax-efficient than similar mutual funds. </p><h3>Other stores of value</h3><p>People can get creative with their favorite stores of value that sometimes match their passions or interests. For example, fine wines, classic cars, watches or art can be good stores of value as their worth typically appreciates over time.</p><h2>What’s a bad store of value</h2><h3>Perishable items</h3><p>Perishable items are goods that expire and lose value over time, gradually becoming worthless. </p><p>Food makes for a poor store of value, as it has an expiry date. A ticket to a concert or for transport becomes worthless after the expiry date, and are also considered perishable.</p><p>Therefore, they are not considered a good store of value.</p><h3>Fiat money</h3><p>We mentioned that fiat currencies do not retain their value over time, as the chart below shows.</p><p>It is mainly due to inflation that they lose value because every year, the price of goods and services tends to rise compared to the dollar and other fiat currencies. As a result, currencies consistently lose purchasing power.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Cryptocurrency</h3><p>Cryptocurrency alternatives to bitcoin are very similar to speculative stocks, with even higher risks since most have short lifespans and almost all lose value versus bitcoin over the long term. </p><p>Cryptocurrencies with longer lifespans prioritize functionality over security, scarcity and censorship resistance, making them poor stores of value, considering their poor economic propositions and weak use cases.</p><p>According to research conducted by <a href="https://twitter.com/alphaazeta/status/1641534991556288532">Swan Bitcoin</a>, altcoins have proven to be a bad investment. The study analyzed 8,000 cryptocurrencies since 2016 and found that 2,635 of them had underperformed versus Bitcoin and a staggering 5,175 of the cryptocurrencies no longer exist.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjUwNDkwNTY1NjM4/unnamed-3.png" height="425" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h3>Speculative Stocks</h3><p>Speculative stocks are small-cap assets, also called penny stocks, that trade at less than $5 per share. They are not considered good stores of value because they are highly speculative. </p><p>Due to their high volatility and low market caps, they can quickly and suddenly increase a lot or lose all of their value. They are considered risky investments and certainly do not make good stores of value. </p><h3>Government bonds?</h3><p>For a long time, government bonds like U.S. treasuries were considered great stores of value simply because governments backed them. However, negative interest rates applied for years have highly affected the economies of big countries like Japan, Germany and other European countries, making government bonds unattractive for the average investor. Some bonds are meant to protect beneficiaries from inflation such as I-bonds and TIPS. However, they are still government-led and rely on the Bureau of Labor Statistics to accurately calculate the inflation rate (which it may choose, or be influenced, not to do).</p><h2>The bottom line</h2><p>​​To sum up, a store of value tends to maintain or increase its purchasing power over time, depending on the law of supply and demand, which can also be used to determine whether or not something might be a good store of value. </p><p>Many still regard bitcoin as an experiment. However, its relatively short life has proved that it offers all those properties typical of money and is a good store of value. The next challenge will be to prove that it can also be a unit of account.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MTM4Mjg0NTQ1OTQ3/store-of-value-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MTk3ODc3MjE2MjYy/gold-to-decent-suit-ratio.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjM4OTQ3ODQxOTQ3/unnamed-2.png" height="337" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MjUwNDkwNTY1NjM4/unnamed-3.png" height="425" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is a Medium of Exchange?

Barter is not suitable as a means to exchange goods and services in an economic system larger than a tribe or family; barter was unsuitable for expanding societies that needed a more efficient method to exchange goods and services. </p><p>Hence, about 2,600 years ago, a new and more sophisticated medium of exchange emerged in Lydia — a region recognized as modern Turkey — and materialized with stamped coins to face the challenges of barter and facilitate trade.</p><p>A medium of exchange is an intermediary item that is widely accepted to facilitate the trade of goods and services between two parties. It is one of money’s three universally agreed functions, along with store of value and unit of account. A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/store-of-value">store of value</a> is any asset that maintains its value over time without depreciating. A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/unit-of-account">unit of account</a> is a standard monetary unit that measures the market value of goods, services, economic activities, assets and liabilities. </p><p>Bitcoin Magazine takes you through the significance of money and its different spectrums. After exploring <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">what money is</a> and what underlines its value, we now dive into its primary functions, starting with the medium of exchange.</p><h2>What is a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument that facilitates the buying and selling of goods or services. In remote times, shells, whale teeth, salt, tobacco and other objects that occurred rarely in nature were employed. Nowadays, currencies are the most common media of exchange as they’re suitable intermediaries between the products or services people want to trade. Still, currency needs to possess specific properties.</p><p>The first medium of exchange coin was created by the Lydians, who hailed from Anatolia in modern-day Turkey. The coin was made of a gold and silver alloy to certify weight and purity and was stamped with images of merchants, landowners or other well-known entities.</p><p>While gold and other metals had likely already been used as a medium of exchange, the Lydians first issued official standardized coins that could be accepted as an intermediary good with a set value recognized as money. They thereby economized on the assaying of the unstamped coins, cutting out some transaction costs in dealing with monetary metals.</p><p>In our modern economies, governments must ensure that their currencies are made widely available to the public, that they are not easy to counterfeit and that they are available in sufficient quantities to satisfy public demand.</p><h2>Why Is a Medium of Exchange Needed?</h2><p>A medium of exchange allows us to trade more efficiently by solving the barter problem, often referred to as the coincidence of wants — a term used to describe an instance where I have the item that you want and you have the item that I want. The mental burden of having to find this exact scenario over and over again in order to trade is considerable, and an impediment to a growing economy. </p><p>Imagine I have a battery and want to trade it for some medicine. I would have to find someone with medicine who is in need of a battery and then negotiate a trade, which can be a complicated endeavor. A medium of exchange makes trade more accessible by allowing people to trade goods indirectly for other good</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As the primary purpose of a medium of exchange is to facilitate transactions between parties, to be effective a medium of exchange must be recognized and accepted by all parties. Here, the concept of a medium of exchange converges with the purpose of a good store of value since its stability allows owners to store it for an extended period with relatively low risks as an investment.</p><h2>Money As a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>Money serves as the most efficient medium of exchange that eliminates the issue of the coincidence of wants commonly associated with barter, allowing individuals, companies and systems to transact with ease.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc4OTc2MTQ5NTMwNTIz/medium-of-exchange.png" height="692" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>As an intermediary tool, money enables buyers and sellers to participate in the market as equal players, leading to fair trade and increased production efficiency. This is because money helps producers to identify what goods or services to produce and the optimal pricing model for them. Likewise, buyers can plan their purchases based on predictable and stable pricing models.</p><p>When purchasing a product or service, buyers typically bid according to the asking price, which in turn allows producers to determine the variety and quantity of items to be produced. However, if consumers are unable to accurately value a product or service, it can lead to difficulties in budget planning, potentially resulting in a chaotic economy due to the challenges of estimating demand and supply.</p><h2>Essential Elements of a Medium of Exchange</h2><p>An item or system must possess certain properties that facilitate efficiency and functionality to be a suitable medium of exchange. It’s not necessary for an item to be backed by a commodity or any other asset to become money. Instead, it must evolve to become the most salable good following an evolutionary process that starts with being recognized as a store of value before being a medium of exchange and eventually becoming a unit of account.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>The three dimensions of the most salable goods are across time, space and through scales.</p><p>To possess the function of a medium of exchange, a salable good should be easily transported and accepted over long distances, and be used in indirect exchange for trade rather than for direct consumption.</p><p>Such a function can be achieved through two key properties: wide acceptability by the public and portability, which makes it easy to move over large distances.</p><h2>What Makes a Good Medium of Exchange</h2><p>The aforementioned properties make any item or system a good medium of exchange. Also, a good medium of exchange should hold value over time and be censorship resistant other than serving its purpose as an intermediary for exchanging goods or services between two parties.</p><p>In the case of currencies serving the purpose of money, they are only as good as the governments that issue them. Political instability, rampant inflation and government malfunction inevitably affect the value and stability of a nation’s currency.</p><h2>Digital Evolution</h2><p>The digital era has brought new opportunities to develop an innovative monetary system based on protected cryptography and distributed networks that ensure decentralization. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/nick-szabo-on-bitcoin-2021">Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency</a> that can be regarded as a good medium of exchange, possessing all the essential criteria that make trade transactions easy, fast and secure. It’s already proved to be a good store of value and, since it owns the properties necessary to be a good medium of exchange, it also has the potential to become a unit of account.</p><p>One key advantage of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is its ability to settle transactions quickly. Bitcoin transactions are confirmed and settled every 10 minutes on the blockchain, making them faster than traditional banking methods, which can take days or even weeks to complete. This speed is especially important for businesses that require fast and efficient payment processing.</p><p>Another important feature of bitcoin as a medium of exchange is the efficiency of its Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a second-layer solution built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables instant and low-cost transactions between parties. With the Lightning Network, market participants can conduct microtransactions without having to wait for confirmations on the blockchain, making it a highly efficient solution for small transactions.</p><p>It also provides extra properties like censorship resistance to better protect the people who live under authoritarian governments, and absolute scarcity, since its total supply moves closer to the maximum 21-million amount with every new block mined. Bitcoin’s revolutionary system may disrupt the status quo and its limitations, but it’s still in the infancy stage and like anything so innovative, it will take time to catch on.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Society has evolved throughout the centuries, as have its monetary systems, which have adapted to its expanding size and economy. Despite the complexity of global commerce being made more efficient by the internet, many challenges, like online security and privacy, still need to be overcome. While these challenges are unique to the modern era, evolution is inherently part of the nature of trade. </p><p>The methods and means of trade are in a perpetual state of change and development, keeping up with technological advancements and the evolving needs of society. Despite these changes, the properties that underpin trade remain constant. As the trading landscape transforms, the fundamental properties of wide acceptability, portability, value preservation and, more recently, censorship resistance are required for a tool to function well as a medium of exchange, and they have remained unchanged over time. </p><p>Therefore, as trade continues to evolve, the importance of these underlying properties will continue to be crucial in determining the success and stability of any economy. The good that best satisfies these properties should emerge as the dominant medium of exchange, but this evolution can take time.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3NDc5MDYzOTI3OTI0NjM1/medium-of-exchange-feature-image-with-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDAyOTkzMDc2MTIz/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc4OTc2MTQ5NTMwNTIz/medium-of-exchange.png" height="692" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3NDc5MDIyMzIwNDI4MDM4/unnamed.png" height="366" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Art Of The Orange Pill: Lessons On Pitching Bitcoin From A Third-Generation Salesman]]></title><description><![CDATA[A former sales account manager describes pitching Bitcoin with a focus on influencing perspectives while maintaining honesty and integrity.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-to-pitch-bitcoin-like-a-salesman</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-to-pitch-bitcoin-like-a-salesman</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Orange Pill]]></category><category><![CDATA[Adoption]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Source Node]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMDc2OTYwOTgwNDQ0NTI2/handshake-spending-transaction.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">A former sales account manager describes pitching Bitcoin with a focus on influencing perspectives while maintaining honesty and integrity.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Source Node, a former sales account manager with a background in training and industrial-organizational psychology.</em></p><p>When I pitch Bitcoin to a relative, to a friend or to a complete stranger in the bathroom stall next to me, they will inevitably ask, "How is this benefiting you? Are you going to make money from me buying bitcoin?" </p><p>In one sense, the honest answer is yes, but my main objective is actually to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Eightfold-Path">alleviate suffering</a>. </p><p>Will any single investor buying bitcoin make my bitcoin increase in value? Not unless I'm convincing a hyper-rich <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-america-should-ban-crypto-regulation-economy-finance-china-england-trading-currency-securities-commodity-gamble-11675287477?mod=article_inline">communist sympathizer</a> like Charlie Munger to hop onboard. The average investor buying $1,000-worth of BTC is not going to change the price of bitcoin. In fact, even a very wealthy investor allocating $100 million may not significantly change the price of bitcoin. In that sense, I am not benefiting directly from convincing individuals to buy bitcoin at all.</p><p>However, given the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/an-objective-look-at-bitcoin-adoption">early stage</a> of adoption that we are currently experiencing, the asymmetric upside of investing in bitcoin today has the potential to turn a relatively-small investment into life-changing financial security. For this reason, the motivation to pitch Bitcoin to people I care about is greater now than it will be in the future. The potential future which Bitcoin enables for myself and for society is the primary driving force behind my participation in the network. The prospect of living in a world of abundance, voluntary behavior and geopolitical cooperation is becoming more achievable by the block. I wish to benefit from the transition to that world and I wish for those whom I love (as well as random strangers I encounter) to benefit from it as well. </p><p>I know I am not the only one who holds this view. It seems to be a natural inclination for nearly every Bitcoiner to compulsively <a href="https://ibb.co/HtjG941">pitch</a> Bitcoin to their friends, relatives and acquaintances. Unfortunately, I have seen many people become exhausted with these pitches. This exhaustion seems to slow down adoption more than support it, which indicates to me that some of what I have to share regarding sales may be helpful.</p><p>Every Bitcoiner who crosses the threshold into this <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-as-a-human-resources-department">decentralized organization</a> brings with them a unique profile of knowledge, skills and interests. I have always had a passion for the discipline of sales. But as a third-generation salesman on my father’s side, I am frequently disgraced by the state of the trade. The word “salesman” often conjures up visions of a pushy vacuum peddler on your doorstep, a slippery used car dealer or an overpaid executive who is better at golf than he is at demonstrating the product that his company manufactures. This is not the vision I have of sales as a vocation or as an art.</p><p>Illustrated broadly, everyone is engaged in sales. Most sales people know this. There is nothing invasive about representing oneself in a conscious manner, sharing a vision and educating in a way that caters to individual differences. Sales is about influencing the perspectives of others to motivate behavioral change. Nowhere in that process does a salesperson have to sacrifice honesty, integrity or reputation.</p><p>Throughout this article, I will refer to anyone we might be pitching Bitcoin to as a “customer.” This isn’t meant to be cold and impersonal, but rather an illustrative metaphor. There are tools which can assist us in developing an effective approach to discussing Bitcoin with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-needs-a-marketing-department">prospective customers</a>. </p><p>The following information is a summary of what I have found to be effective in pitching Bitcoin and my best attempt at describing the attitudes which have supported the greatest success stories. </p><h2>The Outer Strategy</h2><p>The Bitcoin sales cycle is long. Bitcoin isn’t just sold once, it’s sold continuously every moment that a person chooses to hold it. Bitcoin is conceptualized and utilized differently by each participant in the network based on their unique needs and lifestyle choices. Due to the longevity and complexity of a proper Bitcoin pitch, I have found that “<a href="https://challengerinc.com/the-challenger-books/">The Challenger Sale</a>” model is especially well suited for selling Bitcoin.</p><p>“The Challenger Sale” by Matthew Dixon and Brent Adamson outlines research on sales performance across many industries and outlines <a href="https://www.impactplus.com/blog/the-5-types-of-sellers-of-the-challenger-sale">five basic types</a> of salespeople. The salespeople who consistently outperformed their counterparts, during strong as well as weak economic conditions, fell under the category that the book is named after. These sales people had certain traits in common and in my observation, many Bitcoiners exemplify these traits as well. I will touch on the research findings briefly, but if you want a deeper dive into nuances of the topic, I would recommend picking up a copy of the book.</p><p>“Challengers,” as they are differentiated from their counterparts, frequently hold a unique <a href="https://www.hope.com/">view of the world</a>, they love to debate, they are not afraid to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/op-ed-why-bitcoins-toxic-maximalism-makes-sense">push</a> the customer and they have a deep understanding of the customer’s business. From my interactions with Bitcoiners over the years, I see these qualities very frequently. Challengers also tend to find themselves in teaching roles, which is reflected through the many books and podcasts created as Bitcoin educational tools. </p><p>The challenger is well read on every aspect of the sale and can preempt arguments against their points of view. Achieving this degree of intellectual karate may lead you toward reading about economics, engineering, psychology, history, philosophy, spirituality, physics and ecology. In order to approach a topic holistically, one must understand the foundations, the arguments and the counterarguments. Be ready not just to agree or disagree, but to provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning if required. </p><p>Every person you interact with will have a different path to understanding Bitcoin. Certain key pieces of information will ignite a fire of interest in one person and have no effect on another. Learn to find these key areas of interest through practice and repetition. As a general tip, I have found that pitching Bitcoin to people close to my own age is more effective than trying to sell across generational gaps. Studying <a href="https://postimg.cc/rRLtZjdw">integral theory</a> is helpful with the process of understanding customer value systems as well.</p><p>There is a critical balance to be achieved regarding debate and pushing the customer. When you are pushing the customer, keep the conversation friendly. It is possible to chip away at someone’s defenses with humor and creativity rather than by annoying or humiliating them. Emotional intelligence is required to find the right balance between pushing, pulling and resting. </p><p>It’s important to be up front about bitcoin’s performance over the short term and the long term. It is your job to carefully gauge the customer's risk tolerance and conviction in the face of volatility. If you get the impression that someone is buying just because they trust what you are saying, tread carefully. Unless the person you are speaking with understands how to responsibly self custody and to avoid trading on leverage, you may want to dissuade them from buying in large amounts. If your customer bites off more than they can chew and gets burned, it will take them even longer to benefit from Bitcoin.</p><p>Customers who walk away from a conversation having learned something valuable are much more likely to pick up the phone and call that salesperson back. However, there is a difference between being a source of knowledge and being a firehouse of unsolicited opinions. Sometimes, the best way to start a teaching discussion is to ask some questions. Effective teaching is not a forceful process. It is your job to pique the interest of whoever you are speaking with so that they begin to request further information. Try to avoid going on <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=sperg%20out">extensive monologues</a> and maintain engagement from whoever you are speaking with.</p><p>Tailoring a pitch to a grocery store cashier or to a hedge-fund manager will be very different discussions. These approaches are unique for each individual, but there are two primary categories: One approach is bottom up (related to price inflation) and the other is top down (related to central banking and market forces). Both begin with a discussion around the dollar and how it functions. Most people will dismiss Bitcoin as pointless until they understand the problem it is solving. When discussing the <a href="https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard-chapter-1">fiat problem</a>, I have found that speaking rationally about poorly-aligned incentives is generally more effective than launching into a verbal summary of “The Creature From Jekyll Island.” </p><p>The corporate media has been fairly effective at turning the word “Bitcoin” into something scary. Most of the time, I don’t even say the word “Bitcoin” until I get a clear sign of engagement. Open-ended questions are an effective way to gauge the level of understanding you’re cooperating with. For example,“How much do you know about Bitcoin?” or, “If I provided you with infinite funds, describe how you would attack the Bitcoin network or stop people from using it.” Leave room for the customer to <a href="https://www.runn.io/blog/never-split-the-difference-summary">disagree with you</a> and take their disagreement as a positive step in the debate process.</p><p>The ability to transcend political discussions makes controlling the direction of the conversation much easier. Money supersedes politics and the discussion can always be returned to the banking system. I continuously maintain that whatever political issue may be irritating the customer, it will only get worse until the money is fixed. Any effort to fix a societal problem without fixing the money is like using a bucket to throw water out of a ship without addressing the hole causing the ship to sink. </p><p>Remember to be measured in your approach. You don’t have anything to prove to anyone. Don’t forget what is most important to you and don’t get caught up in the desire to be right or to prove someone else wrong. When you’re laying on your deathbed, you won’t be kicking yourself for failing to orange pill a relative at Thanksgiving, but you might regret burning a bridge with someone you love over an unnecessary argument.</p><h2>The Inner Game</h2><p>Book smarts and creative problem solving are important tools, but when it comes to sales, the most critical skill to develop is emotional attunement. An effective salesperson will accurately read the emotional tone of the conversation in real time and adjust their approach as needed. There are a number of skills involved in this form of emotional intelligence, the most important of which is learning to accurately read and interpret <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/non-verbal-communication">nonverbal communication</a>. </p><p>In my experience, the primary impediment to emotional attunement is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_New_Earth">egotistical dysfunction</a> on the part of the salesperson. The ego is critical to human functioning and is not to be vilified, but it should not be running the show either. The degree to which a salesperson can relate to a prospective customer is a question of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiSsxVM0B-U">spiritual development</a> more than business acumen. Nothing is more attractive or conducive to building trust than authenticity and honesty. In order to live with authenticity, we are required to <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61315.The_Presence_Process">face discomfort</a> and integrate the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/179FNB8TC1KikVhii4kEgQ?si=2e625aa1d6e5405a">aspects of ourselves</a> that we reject. Without understanding your own intentions, you cannot understand the intentions of others. </p><p>Present yourself in the most transparent way possible. Deceitful action and hypocrisy are repulsive to the human spirit. The fiat system has a way of holding us hostage in situations which pressure us to compromise our values. As a result, we find ourselves alienated from our true intentions and separated from authentic relationships. Bitcoin enables us to liberate ourselves from these discouraging moral concessions, if we wish to do so.</p><p>Regardless of the behavior of those struggling to maintain a broken system, Bitcoiners can choose to persevere in equanimity. This temperament can only serve to vaporize phony criticisms of Bitcoin with the light of truth. Maintaining the higher ground will depend on a certain degree of personal and collective purification. Admit your faults and shortcomings without any reservation as soon as you perceive them. Striving to prove others wrong is a silly game which benefits no one. Striving to be effective in <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/how-to-argue-win-every-time-gerry-spence/1111811437">achieving your goals</a> is a worthwhile undertaking.</p><p>If you let your ego enter the Bitcoin sales pitch, you are more likely to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Agreements">take criticisms personally</a> and the conversation will drift into alienation. If you approach the discussion honestly and <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/learn-nvc/what-is-nvc">compassionately</a>, you will create an ally rather than an enemy. I have often encountered a tremendous amount of resistance in conversations about Bitcoin and returned to that person months later to find that they have internalized much of what I said. </p><p>If the conversation remains respectful, you can walk away and let the orange marinade do its work. This is especially true as bank failures and inflation continue to draw attention to the issue at hand. Very few people are ready to change their minds in a single conversation. In fact, my recommendation would be to forego the intent to change anyone’s mind, but rather to provide information so that your acquaintance can reach their own conclusion. </p><p>When anger enters a discussion about Bitcoin, your customer will fail to see the countless hours of research you have applied to understanding the topic. If you get rattled by their questions or comments, they will only see fear, uncertainty and doubt. If you strike a condescending tone, you run the risk of pushing them away from Bitcoin rather than compelling them to learn more about it. If you feel animosity arising, take a step back and breathe.</p><p>Another common sales pitfall worth avoiding is “trash talking the competition.” It might be tempting to attack fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, altcoins or gold. Attacks like this exhibit weakness. Handling objections with grace develops confidence in the person you are speaking with. People are often very emotionally attached to their investments. Attacking them will cause the customer to double down and become much less open to hearing what you have to say. I do not denounce anyone for making certain investments, but I will gladly explain why bitcoin is likely to be superior in comparison to other assets.</p><blockquote><p>“It is only against the big waves that (a surfer) is required to use all his skill, all his courage and concentration to overcome; only then can he realize the true limits of his capacities. At that point he often slips into a superconscious state and attains his peak. In other words, the more challenging the obstacle he faces, the greater the opportunity for the surfer to discover and extend his true potential. The potential may have always been within him, but until it is manifested in action, it remains a secret hidden from himself. The obstacles are a very necessary ingredient to this process of self-discovery. Note that the surfer in this example is not out to prove himself; he is not out to show himself or the world how great he is, but is simply involved in the exploration of his latent capacities. He directly and intimately experiences his own resources and thereby increases his self-knowledge.”&nbsp;</p><p>–Timothy Gallwey, “<a href="https://mentoringgroup.com/books/the-inner-game-of-tennis.pdf">The Inner Game Of Tennis</a>”</p></blockquote><p>The above quote is no excuse for misleading unsuspecting financial refugees. Clown coins, vaporware and moral hazard should be dismissed resolutely. Those who support such misguided activities should be discredited mercilessly. However, all of this can be accomplished without losing your cool. Holding on to hate will not benefit you in any way. Always be ready for your detractors to <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2017:3-4&amp;version=NIV">switch to your side</a>. There is no need to make it harder for them to do so by treating them in a cruel manner. </p><p>I have found it helpful to frame all forms of “altcoin” investing as gambling behavior. In this way, I can view these choices through the lens of <a href="https://drgabormate.com/book/in-the-realm-of-hungry-ghosts/">addictive compulsion</a> rather than stupidity or some other judgmental interpretation. I do not enable addictive behavior by accepting excuses, but I do not criticize it either. The road out of addiction is often barricaded by trauma and maladaptive assumptions. Harsh judgment does not assist in dissolving these barriers, but rather reinforces the separation between the real world and the addict.</p><p>The only reason I am able to write this article is because I have broken every suggestion in it at one point or another and witnessed the results. I may continue to break these recommendations in the future, but I maintain a continuous practice of humility, compassion and patience. Self judgment stifles growth more than it fosters it. If you punish yourself for behaving differently than you would like, your actions will become contrivances; like a child who is constantly afraid of their <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/111209.Unconditional_Parenting">parent’s scorn</a>. This will likely counteract any efforts you apply toward living with more authenticity. </p><p>Acting out of a genuine desire to enhance life will help you to root into a more authentic lifestyle. That type of authenticity is magnetic. Look inward at your reservations and intentions. If you are trying to orange pill others to convince yourself of Bitcoin’s value or to prove yourself to the world, you will be better served by reserving your opinions until you no longer have these insecurities. If you are beyond the need for approval, your rate of success will increase dramatically. Act on the truth that you know. Unlike Bitcoin, you don’t need consensus for validation.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Source Node.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Ahmed Botan, a marketing professional with a focus on Bitcoin-based projects.</em></p><p>Bulgaria, a small country located in Southeast Europe, nestled between Romania and Greece, is set to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world. </p><p>The reason for this is its possession of 213,000 bitcoin, which its authorities seized from a group they labeled as criminals in 2017. According to the <a href="https://www.coininsider.com/bulgarian-government-owns-3-billion-usd-bitcoin/">South East European Law Enforcement Center</a> (SELC), the group hacked the Bulgarian customs agency’s computers and made changes to the system so that their partner companies could import goods while avoiding paying taxes on them.</p><p>Immediately following the crackdown, the bitcoin seized was worth about $500,000, however, it would now be worth closer to $6 billion dollars, as of April 2023. While the <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=02b41baf-5f0d-4696-a580-5aba28b2a8ca">details around the BTC seizure are unclear</a>, and it is not totally clear whether the country still holds that bitcoin or what it plans to do with the stack if it does, the potential of a nation like Bulgaria holding this much BTC is worth exploring.</p><p>As the value of bitcoin is, in the view of many, set to go up a lot higher still in the coming years, Bulgaria could stand to become very wealthy.</p><h2>The Rising Price Of Bulgaria’s Bitcoin</h2><p>While the future price of bitcoin is impossible to predict, there are some prominent examples of experts explaining why they are confident Bulgaria’s bitcoin holdings will grow exponentially in value. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Croesus_BTC">Jesse Meyers</a>, the COO of Onramp Bitcoin who holds an MBA from Stanford University, <a href="https://jessemyers.substack.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation">has predicted that the bitcoin price will hit $10 million in the coming decades.</a> Ark Invest CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/CathieDWood?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Cathie Wood</a> has predicted <a href="https://milkroad.com/predictions">bitcoin will reach $1 million by 2030</a> in a bullish scenario. Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes">Arthur Hayes</a>, co-founder of BitMex <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/arthur-hayes-thinks-bitcoin-can-still-hit-1m-this-cycle/">believes that bitcoin could hit $1 million by 2026</a>.</p><p>Most recently, the former CTO of Coinbase, <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis">Balji Srinivasan</a>, has predicted that <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-coinbase-cto-makes-2m-bet-on-bitcoin-s-performance">bitcoin would hit $1 million by June 15, 2023</a>, wagering $2 million to that effect.</p><p>While most people don't believe that the bitcoin price can reach $1 million by then, anything is possible. For example, if there was an extended banking crisis and hyperinflation of the U.S. dollar, as predicted by Srinivasan, who knows how valuable Bulgaria’s bitcoin stack will become?</p><p>For instance, shortly after Srinivasan’s bet (although this was certainly unrelated), several nations, including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya and more <a href="https://www.newsafrica.net/article/is-it-time-for-africa-to-ditch-the-us-dollar-in-international-trade-deals">began moving away from using the U.S. dollar in their trades</a>, With the Kenyan president warning citizens to <a href="https://winepressnews.com/2023/03/28/kenya-president-tells-citizens-to-get-rid-of-holdings-of-us-dollar-as-nations-dump-the-dollar-and-begin-to-embrace-petroyuan/">get rid of their dollar holdings</a>.</p><p>The United States government has measures in place to prevent further bank runs, like the Federal Reserve's <a href="https://news.research.stlouisfed.org/2023/03/fred-adds-bank-term-funding-program-data/#:~:text=This%20program%20was%20launched%20on,in%20connection%20to%20this%20program.">$25 billion bank-term funding program</a> (BTFP) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) openness to cover all deposits.</p><p>I think, if the FDIC decides to insure all deposits, that will be enough to deter true bank runs, but it’s clear that the U.S. dollar is not as strong as it used to be. And that opens the door for a decentralized, global monetary unit like bitcoin to rise.</p><p>As a result, if Bulgaria holds onto its BTC stash, it could amass more value relative to the holdings of other countries around the world and become one of the world’s richest.</p><h2>So, What Will Bulgaria Do With Its Bitcoin?</h2><p>Bulgaria could use future bitcoin gains to invest in its economy, but it will have to pay off national debts first. As of 2022, Bulgaria’s <a href="https://www.ceicdata.com/en/indicator/bulgaria/national-government-debt">national government debt reached $20 billion</a> in 2022.</p><p>By 2030, if the bitcoin price hits $1 million and it still holds its seized, 213,000 BTC stash, its holdings could be worth $213 billion.</p><p>After paying off its debt, Bulgaria could use the funds generated from selling the 231,000 BTC to invest in various industries, such as technology or real estate. Moreover, the Bulgarian government could use the funds generated from the sale of its bitcoin to improve the country's infrastructure, education and healthcare. By investing in these essential sectors, Bulgaria could attract foreign investment, and this would further boost the country's economy.</p><p>Bulgaria has a significant opportunity to become one of the wealthiest countries in the world if it HODLs its bitcoin and sells some at the right time. But it seems wise for the country to keep a significant portion of bitcoin in reserve in perpetuity, as fiat currencies like the dollar continue to deteriorate.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ahmed Botan.

    </figure><p>My husband and I decided to become Bitcoin educators because we passionately believe that Bitcoin is a money standard everyone should know about. However, it can be very discouraging sometimes when most people see us as religious, cult evangelists who they should avoid or only politely tolerate. </p><p>But then, out of the blue, I’ll experience amazing conversations with people who are ready to hear what we have to say. They are just waiting to find someone to discuss Bitcoin who can help them understand it better.</p><p>This article describes three such encounters I’ve had in unexpected places. <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1339572-when-the-student-is-ready-the-teacher-will-appear-when">As the saying goes</a>, (slightly modified), “When the student is ready, the teacher (me) will be sent to them.”</p><h2>One: GoDaddy Tech Support</h2><p>A few months ago, when my husband Scott and I were just starting our financial-literacy- and Bitcoin-focused organization <a href="https://www.freemarketkids.com/">Free Market Kids</a>, we had a lot of trouble getting our website to work correctly. I spent hours with tech support through various service providers. During this incident, I called GoDaddy support and was instructed to reboot my computer. </p><p>While we were waiting for the computer to do its thing, instead of sitting on the line in silence, I began to chit chat with the support guy about where he was located, the weather, etc. Pretty soon, we were asking each other about our work and life experiences. </p><p>He asked, “So, what is Free Market Kids?” </p><p>“Well, we teach people about Bitcoin and money with our board games,” I answered.</p><p>“Bitcoin!” Sighing deeply, he continued, “I sold mine years ago.” </p><p>He explained that, early on, he had been persuaded by his friend to mine Bitcoin. When the price went up, he got excited and sold all his bitcoin because he needed the cash for something. </p><p>“And now,” he lamented, “I’m watching the bitcoin price go up like crazy, and I can’t believe I blew my chance!”</p><p>I asked him what he knew about Bitcoin, aside from what his friend told him to do. </p><p>“Very little,” he replied. </p><p>So, I explained the fundamental properties of Bitcoin to him and pointed out that he could always get back in. Thirty minutes later, long after my computer had rebooted and the original issue was resolved, we finally ended the call.</p><p>I was so excited about the conversation I went to tell my husband about it. </p><p>“I thought you were on GoDaddy support?” Scott asked.</p><p>“I was!” I responded excitedly.</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><h2>Two: The Veterinary Office</h2><p>In preparation for some conferences we were attending, I designed a company t-shirt. Unfortunately, the first batch didn’t turn out well, so I decided to wear it around the house. Remembering a veterinarian appointment at the last minute, I rushed out with our dog, forgetting that I was sporting our company shirt.</p><p>After getting checked in and ushered to a tiny exam room, I sat down to wait with my elderly standard poodle, Ava, panting by my side. Moments later, the door opened, and the vet tech walked in, clipboard in hand. He looked at me without saying anything and squinted his eyes. </p><p>“Uh, do I have something on my face?” I thought, feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>Then he broke the awkward silence and said, “Bitcoin, huh?”</p><p>“Yes?” I answered tentatively, looking down at my shirt.</p><p>“I have some questions for you!” he boomed. “Someone told me that bitcoin will go to zero. What do you think?” </p><p>“Uh, right… What do you know about Bitcoin in general?” I responded.</p><p>“Not much,” he admitted.</p><p>We chatted about Bitcoin, and he had endless questions. I watched the pen in his hand hover over Ava’s chart, but we didn’t talk about that patient, panting dog for a long time.</p><p>The vet visit that was supposed to take 20 minutes ended up taking an hour and a half.</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><h2>Three: The Jewelry Store</h2><p>I went to a jewelry store to replace a broken necklace. Once again, I was wearing our company shirt and running errands. Two ladies stood behind the counter. While one was packing up my purchase, the other eyed me intently, leaned toward me, and whispered, “My brother is into cryptocurrency, but I don’t understand it. I know the economy is going to sh*t, but I don’t have a million dollars to invest in bitcoin.” </p><p>She continued, her eyes filled with tears, “I’m a single mom, and I’m scared of what’s going to happen.” </p><p>She looked tired, discouraged and very concerned.</p><p>“You don’t need a million dollars to invest in bitcoin,” I answered. “You can start with very small amounts, $1 or $5.” </p><p>We chatted for a long time, and I hugged her before we said goodbye. </p><p>“There’s a reason we met today,” I told her. “Reach out to me any time!”</p><p><em>When the student is ready, the teacher will be sent to them!</em></p><p>And, oh, maybe I should wear our company shirt more often!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tali Lindberg.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Steven Hay, a writer, former trader and art dealer.</em></p><p>I’m a long-time Bitcoiner, preparing to travel and hopefully relocate permanently to El Salvador in 2023. Like many Bitcoiners, I wish to be a part of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-news/what-el-salvadors-bitcoin-law-brought">amazing changes</a> happening in this country. And I’d like to share an idea which I strongly believe has the potential to accelerate those changes.</p><p>Similar to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">volcano bond concept</a>, this idea employs Bitcoin-linked assets to raise funds for the building of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-president-nayib-bukele-released-model-of-bitcoin-city">Bitcoin City</a>, or any other worthy project. Unlike bonds, however, these relatively-straightforward assets impose no legal or financial obligations upon the nation. They are simply created and then sold on the free market.</p><p>My idea revolves around something many of you have heard of: Bitcoin Ordinals. This new protocol, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-bitcoin-ordinals">launched in January 2023</a>, allows for the creation of “Bitcoin NFTs” linked to single satoshis. Known as “inscriptions,” these special satoshis are bound to data which is permanently embedded within Bitcoin’s blockchain. This data can take the form of images, text, video, etc.</p><p>Mere months after its creation, this new form of digital asset has already received considerable investment, with <a href="https://dune.com/domo/ordinals-marketplaces">at least $21 million in volume traded over the six major marketplaces</a> and additional trades conducted over the counter.. Galaxy Research<a href="https://www.galaxy.com/research/whitepapers/bitcoin-ordinals-inscriptions-5-billion-nft-market/"> estimates</a> that the Ordinals market will grow to $4.5 billion in total value by 2025. This figure may well prove to be conservative — especially if the government of El Salvador becomes an official participant in this space.</p><p>Already, renowned luxury goods makers like Bugatti and Asprey are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bugatti-and-asprey-announce-bitcoin-inscriptions">involved</a> in Ordinals. If private companies are expected to achieve millions of dollars in sales in this new market, how much more could a sovereign state achieve? As the Ordinals market matures and begins to attract mainstream investment, it seems certain that collections of historical significance will reach valuations which reflect their importance and rarity.</p><p>My suggestion is that the government of El Salvador continue to successfully implement new ideas by releasing an official Bitcoin Ordinals collection. Perhaps such a collection might comprise art or photography which highlight the country’s natural beauty, architecture and culture. Alternatively, it might feature scans of official documents relating to the new Bitcoin laws or Bitcoin City plans. Such inscriptions might confer certain benefits to their owners, such as discounts on government service fees. The purchase of a governmental inscription might even form part of a future El Salvadoran <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-citizenship-by-investment">citizenship by investment</a> (CBI) program. The possibilities are virtually endless.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe that the potential upsides are high while the risks are low and manageable. I believe that the goodwill of Bitcoiners and the world’s interest in El Salvador’s rapid improvement will lead to a great demand for what might be called its “national digital art treasures.” If the technical and creative aspects are handled correctly by the relevant professionals, I believe that such an endeavor can only bring great benefits to the people of El Salvador and to the global Bitcoin community.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Steven Hay.

    </figure><p>The General Assembly of North Carolina has introduced a bill that would ban the usage of bitcoin as payment to the state or state agencies.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a source familiar with the matter, the original intent of the introduction of the bill was to prevent the usage of CBDCs in the state — however, the wording in the bill encompasses cryptocurrencies and bitcoin instead of CBDCs, and appears to be a direct anti-bitcoin and cryptocurrency usage bill. </p><p><a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2023/Bills/House/PDF/H690v1.pdf">The bill</a>, which carries the short title of “No Cryptocurrencies Payments to State,” and is sponsored by House Representatives <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/630">Warren</a> and <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Members/Biography/H/663">Brody</a>, provides two definitions. <br><br>It defines cryptocurrency as, “digital or virtual currency that relies on cryptography to effect transfers and a decentralized network to record transactions,” and a state agency as “any institution, bureau, board, commission, officer or political subdivision of the State.” </p><p>The bill then proclaims that “no State agency shall accept a payment using cryptocurrency,” and that the “act is effective when it becomes law.”</p><p>Although short, the bill would be a step in the wrong direction for the state, which just recently saw other legislation pushed forward <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/north-carolina-county-pushes-forward-with-plan-to-halt-bitcoin-mining">to halt bitcoin mining</a> operations in the county encompassing the city of Asheville. <br><br>The source familiar with the matter stated that it is likely that this bill will be contested and that efforts to educate legislators will likely take place.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNTY1MTQ0NDExNjEyODM1/ac-btc.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[eToro On Their Partnership With Twitter To Bring Bitcoin Investing To The Platform]]></title><description><![CDATA[The synergies present in the partnership demonstrate how integrations can bring bitcoin investing to entirely new audiences.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/etoro-on-their-partnership-with-twitter-allowing-bitcoin-investing</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/etoro-on-their-partnership-with-twitter-allowing-bitcoin-investing</guid><category><![CDATA[Etoro]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Twitter]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 17:56:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MjQwNDMz/bitcoin-price-market-analysis.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The synergies present in the partnership demonstrate how integrations can bring bitcoin investing to entirely new audiences.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

They confirmed that in partnership with Twitter, they hope to introduce more educational resources about bitcoin and other financial assets to their users through this partnership, but for now, eToro is focused on making the $Cashtags partnership a success. <br><br>eToro’s spokesperson said that the company believes that the future of investing is social investing and fostering dialogue in large networks, and that the inherent short form and ease of messaging on Twitter appeals to today’s investor. “Twitter is a space for conversation, where networking and interesting financial dialogue take place, eToro is a financial services provider built on the belief that social investing is the part of the future and that we can all do better by investing together and fostering dialogue in large networks,” they reiterated.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MjQwNDMz/bitcoin-price-market-analysis.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Culture War Won’t Win Mass Adoption]]></title><description><![CDATA[Prominent Bitcoiners, many of whom advocate “lifestyle maximalism,” may be hurting adoption by leaning in one political direction.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-bitcoin-culture-skew-right</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-does-bitcoin-culture-skew-right</guid><category><![CDATA[Climate change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Influencers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Libertarians]]></category><category><![CDATA[Progressives]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Trey Walsh]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMzA4MDI5NDE1NjYzMTM3/aa-btc-2.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Prominent Bitcoiners, many of whom advocate “lifestyle maximalism,” may be hurting adoption by leaning in one political direction.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Trey Walsh, the senior director for youth programs at the MassHire Metro North Workforce Board in Somerville, Massachusetts.</em></p><p>Since its inception in 2009, Bitcoin has caught the world by storm, leaving many stumped by its continued adoption and growing number of use cases, and leading many others to continually dismiss it or manufacture cultural and political narratives about it to satisfy their own agendas. </p><p>We will never know the true intentions behind the creation of Bitcoin due to the pseudonymity of its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, but it is widely believed that Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and a widespread distrust of traditional financial institutions. Since 2008, this distrust of financial institutions, our political system and global organizations such as the World Bank and World Economic Forum has arguably continued to grow, while Bitcoin gains steam and interest continues to pique in its direction. </p><p>As more and more folks begin to notice Bitcoin, they also tend to notice what I consider to be Bitcoin’s “social layer” — and in this context, I’m referring to the range of social and cultural norms and values that have emerged among its users and biggest voices. </p><p>Every movement — in this case, a technological and monetary revolution — has a social layer and culture. Bitcoin is a complex and evolving phenomenon, with many nuances, but I would argue it is one that has been dominated, at least in the context of the United States, by those on the political right — ranging from those with far-right wing, fringe ideologies to Libertarians to mainstream Republicans. </p><p>This dominance resonates for liberal democracies throughout the West, but as an American, I will focus on the U.S. While Bitcoin users and holders may vary greatly across the social, cultural and political spectrums, many of Bitcoin’s biggest proponents and greatest public figures would identify most often with the political right and are predominately white men. </p><p>This is a value-neutral statement; an observation of the current demographic and ideological camp of prominent Bitcoiners. However, many people I know have been “turned off” from Bitcoin because they don’t see their values represented in the community. Those from marginalized groups, the LGBTQ+ community, progressives and many others can become distracted and outright dismiss Bitcoin as one of the fringe or radical ideas that have come from prominent Bitcoiners or prominent conservative politicians who express support for Bitcoin. </p><p>I would perhaps be saying the same thing if prominent Bitcoiners were arguing for far-left, fringe ideas as well. It doesn't help that many in the mainstream media have associated Bitcoin with <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/far-right-extremists-raise-millions-cryptocurrency-bitcoin/">white supremacy fundraising</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/08/crypto-mining-could-hinder-battle-against-climate-change-white-house.html">escalating global warming concerns</a> and a range of other biased attacks. But in any case, I believe that, for Bitcoin adoption to grow, Bitcoiners — and, in particular, prominent Bitcoin educators, public figures, etc. — must focus on the ideals, values and benefits of Bitcoin for <em>everyone</em>. In doing so, we may build the greatest and most diverse coalition of people fighting for a cause that our nation or world have ever seen. This coalition and community should have their values rooted in the fundamentals and spirit of Bitcoin, not merely in what has been viewed as mainly conservative ideology. </p><h2>This Progressive’s Bitcoin Battle</h2><p>Speaking from my own experience, when I really began to study Bitcoin in the spring of 2021, the first place I went to to learn more and get recommendations on who to follow, which books and resources to read, etc., was Twitter. Prior to my journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole, I viewed crypto as something for “crypto bros,” number-go-up technology and generally something I didn’t personally align with as a progressive and nonprofit professional. </p><p>Thankfully, I soon discovered folks like Alex Gladstein, who spoke of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/alexgladstein">Bitcoin’s human-rights-promoting qualities</a>, and Willy Woo, who spoke of <a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/willy-woo">Bitcoin on-chain research</a>. Soon after, I purchased “The Bitcoin Standard” by Saifedean Ammous and was captivated by the history and the argument for the economics of Bitcoin and explored more concepts in Austrian economics. I was sold on the benefits and arguments for Bitcoin, and since then I have read countless other books and articles that have deepened my knowledge and conviction for Bitcoin. </p><p>At the time, I peripherally understood that the Bitcoin community and many of its main proponents in the West and United States leaned Libertarian. Once you go down the Bitcoin rabbit hole and are convicted enough to label yourself a Bitcoiner, it's hard not to accept some Libertarian-leaning arguments and become skeptical of our current system. Bitcoin is, after all, the separation of money from state, and decentralized to the point that it is censorship resistant and holds firm to many economic principles sought after by the Austrian economic camp. </p><p>As I continued to trek through a wide variety of content from Bitcoiners, I noticed many seemed to be focusing a lot of time and energy on things that had little to do directly with Bitcoin and much more to do with a disdain for progressives, vaccinations and the LGBTQ+ and trans communities, and the promotion of gun culture, a carnivore diet, many far right, anarcho-capitalist ideals and more. </p><p>For me, as a progressive, it was distracting and at times deeply infuriating. Surely everyone is entitled to their own opinions, and I personally am a bit of a free-speech maximalist, but many of these folks have prominent Bitcoin podcasts, books or articles, and have professed that they want to increase Bitcoin adoption and have the world move toward a Bitcoin standard. One such interaction early on convinced me to explore the cultural/political side of Bitcoin more, as I felt it posed a significant threat to increased adoption and was much more likely to be co-opted by political factions, partisanship and nefarious actors. </p><p>I was following Ammous on Twitter. I have since been blocked so, unfortunately, I am unable to quote the exact tweets, but he was tweeting about a carnivore diet, the benefits of this and the risks of veganism, etc. As a vegan and Bitcoiner, I responded, as I believe “thought leaders” in the space should be exposed to a wide variety of views and the experiences of their audiences and others in the community. I was respectful, but responded stating that I am a vegan and I grow weary of associating Bitcoin so strictly with any diet or lifestyle, as he was arguing, and also associating particular diets with a “fiat” mindset, as he has in countless talks, articles and his book “The Fiat Standard.” He responded by stating that, because I was vegan, I was malnourished and he seemed to have a distaste for my presence in the community of Bitcoiners. Now, with his book being the first that I read in the space, it was a bit shocking to see how quickly he attacked a view that dissentented from his own. Surely, Bitcoin is for everyone and that community is going to have a diverse set of opinions and perspectives, right? </p><p>This is just one example of many that I have witnessed. I’m not here to harp on toxic Bitcoin Maximalism, personal stories of silly, unkind interactions on a social media app, but there are questions to be asked about when and why this community evolved into its current form, dominated by right-leaning ideology, while the general population of crypto and bitcoin investors is actually quite diverse politically, ideologically, racially, etc. </p><h2>When Did Bitcoin Become Associated With The Right?</h2><p>For that, I would refer you to Jameson Lopp’s recent article, “<a href="https://blog.lopp.net/history-of-bitcoin-maximalism/">A History Of Bitcoin Maximalism</a>.” As I mentioned, I began studying Bitcoin in early 2021 — so much of this culture and evolution occurred prior to my time in the Bitcoin social space. But it’s worth noting that, circa 2018 and on, “Bitcoin Maximalism” as many know of it today really gained steam and transformed into what Lopp calls “lifestyle maximalists,” who are focused on things such as a carnivore diet, conservative Christian identities, “traditional” values, weightlifting, guns, etc. This was further amplified by COVID-19, with lockdowns, government intervention, vaccines, etc. This exists to this day, but is slowly evolving with the understanding that more diverse voices are entering the space, such as progressives and environmentalists who see the humanitarian and positive environmental benefits that Bitcoin offers. </p><p>As I’ve stated, I personally identify as a progressive, but my intention is not to have progressive voices (which span a wide variety of perspectives and opinions, I should add, for those who have cast all of “us” as the same) be the dominant voices, but rather for the Bitcoin social community to reflect a more inclusive body of constituents, regardless of their political/lifestyle choices, which can all agree on the fundamentals of Bitcoin: the non-partisan, freedom money tool. </p><p>Bitcoin is for everyone, and its loudest champions and voices with the largest audiences should keep this in mind if they profess themselves to be Bitcoin Maximalists, freedom maximalists, seeking a bitcoin standard, seeking mainstream adoption, etc. I would ask these folks (many of whom I respect): What do you value more? Bitcoin education and its increased adoption to create a better world, or your audience-capture bent towards “lifestyle maximalism”?</p><p>Since Bitcoin is for everyone, we all must be aware of the diversity of views and identities out there. If you’re immediate rebuttal is, “Well, stop trying to make Bitcoin political,” or, “If someone’s opinion gets in the way of someone getting bitcoin, then they don’t deserve it anyway,” ask yourself two things: Do you come from the “dominant” position within the outspoken Bitcoin community (right leaning and/or libertarian)? And what is your opposition to helping onboard folks to Bitcoin who may be turned off by views they consider fringe or off putting? </p><p>I fear many prominent Bitcoiners are not taking seriously enough this “social layer,” as a factor in Bitcoin’s global adoption and ultimate success, exclaiming things like, “Bitcoin has already won,” “you can’t stop Bitcoin,” “everyone gets bitcoin at the price they deserve," etc. </p><p>As great as a technology is and can be, one that all us Bitcoiners see endless possibility and hope for humanity in, I do worry that we are at a critical point — one that I believe will succeed ultimately, by the way — where culturally, the Bitcoin community must broaden its horizon, become more inclusive and mainstream with its narratives, or else adoption could slow or stop altogether. I know that many media outlets will not stop their false tirades against Bitcoin, but the community doesn’t help itself if prominent Bitcoiners continue to obsess over diets, anti-vaccine takes, patriarchal traditional values, attacking and dismissing anyone that doesn’t agree with their political perspective as “brainwashed by the fiat machine.” </p><h2>Bitcoin And The ‘Climate Crisis’</h2><p>One such example that many prominent Bitcoiners are adamant about refuting is climate change or the “climate crisis.” As a progressive, vegan and environmentalist, I am deeply concerned about the data-supported climate change that we are seeing and I do see this as a crisis that is in need of creative solutions (<a href="https://www.whatbitcoindid.com/podcast/can-bitcoin-mining-save-the-environment">many of which, I think, can be found in bitcoin mining</a>). </p><p>I do believe there is much to be debated in terms of <em>addressing </em>this issue, but the fact of the matter is, the majority of Americans believe <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/08/15/poll-climate-change-americans-congress">climate change is happening</a> and that more should be done to address this. However, many prominent Bitcoiners have argued there is <a href="https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1645488341062676480?s=20">no climate crisis</a>, and some in fact have argued that more <a href="https://twitter.com/SGBarbour/status/1647361326153342976?s=20">carbon is good for our planet</a>. </p><p>While I believe that much of the rhetoric from Bitcoiners combating the notion of a climate crisis is in response to governments who may be taking harsh stances against fossil fuels, which could put the stability of grids at risk or force reliance on other nations’ energy sources, this type of rhetoric can turn away large portions of the population. With increased attacks on Bitcoin from politicians like Elizabeth Warren and news outlets such as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/09/business/bitcoin-mining-electricity-pollution.html">The New York Times</a>, it’s important for Bitcoiners to set the record straight while also putting forth arguments that many Americans can grasp and understand from their political worldviews. </p><p>In fact, many environmentalists who support Bitcoin see huge potential in bitcoin mining and its ability to utilize more renewable energy sources, and more focus on this argument from folks like <a href="https://twitter.com/thetrocro">Troy Cross</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jyn_urso">Margot Paez</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DSBatten">Daniel Batten</a> is helping the mainstream audience see Bitcoin as a potential tool in the renewable energy transition. </p><p>Folks arguing against labeling our climate change as a “climate crisis” are free to express their views, but must also understand the effect this may have on increasing Bitcoin adoption among a population that predominantly believes climate change is real and that we must do more to address fossil fuel/carbon emissions. </p><p>The fact of the matter is that the average American does not care about the Bitcoin white paper, best practices for privacy, the Bitcoin block size or most of the “lifestyle maximalism” takes. And I believe many will be among the last to realize the importance of Bitcoin because they have a fairly stable currency, comfortable living standards, etc. </p><p>But what people can start to gravitate toward are what all of us gravitated toward from the beginning: Bitcoin is a great savings account, it protects human rights globally, it has a fixed supply so it’s deflationary, it’s easy to use and send domestically and globally and you can own it in self custody — no bank IOUs and no trust! </p><p>With our focus on the fundamentals of Bitcoin, we may begin to move past and beyond its political, partisan takes and into mass global adoption. </p><h2>The Road To Mass Adoption</h2><p>As we’ve seen, there is evidence to suggest that support for Bitcoin from the general population is more varied across the political and identity spectrums than one might think if they only pay attention to Twitter, mainstream media articles and the loudest voices. As many know at this point, social media is a poor indicator of where the majority of people lie on issues. Social media tends to bring out the most extreme views — for instance, those from the far right and far left — creating arguments that generate engagement rather than true representation of the diverse community that tends to lean toward a moderate view. </p><p>I would argue that Bitcoin, just like many other issues in our world, has been co-opted by political extremes and by “lifestyle maximalists,” and that the road to mass adoption is in ensuring that we explain the fundamentals of Bitcoin that appeal to the masses, rather than the co-opted fringe views that have little or nothing to do with Bitcoin. </p><p>This is not about censoring views or speech, but rather about encouraging those Bitcoiners in positions of power and influence to keep in mind the diversity of our population and the hope for Bitcoin’s mass adoption. In politics and in life, those in positions of power often engage in rhetoric and topics that are actually a distraction from the real issues average citizens face. As folks continue to wake up to this reality, as inflation grows, the state of our economy continues to erode, more folks continue to ask questions — the same questions being asked after the 2008 financial crisis. Why is wealth inequality so high? Why are my savings dwindling and affording things is growing harder by the year? Do politicians even care? </p><p>As the distrust in government and financial institutions continues to grow, we have a real opportunity to present folks with the alternative and the hope that Bitcoin brings to our world — a tool that separates money from the State; doesn’t require trust; is verifiable and decentralized through the blockchain, miners and full-node operators; and provides people with savings that won’t erode over time to reward their hard work. </p><p>Bitcoin is non-partisan, and I don’t think fringe arguments from Bitcoin “lifestyle maximalists” that go against majority-held beliefs and opinions help Bitcoin’s continued widespread adoption. Luckily, more folks in the Bitcoin community are waking up to this, and more diverse opinions and perspectives are flooding into the Bitcoin community to truly represent the masses, the everyday citizen. Bitcoin is for everyone, and the more that the Bitcoin community reflects that, the closer we will be to mass adoption. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Trey Walsh.

    </figure><p>Bitcoin Magazine has announced the launch of its new book publishing branch, Bitcoin Magazine Books. The venture aims to provide readers with educational literature on Bitcoin, its impact on global economies and its role in shaping the world's financial future. As the adoption of Bitcoin increases, the need for accurate and informative resources becomes crucial in understanding the complex topics surrounding Bitcoin and navigating the rapidly evolving landscape.</p><p>The launch of Bitcoin Magazine Books is marked by the release of two new publications, "Hidden Repression" by Alex Gladstein and "A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin" by C. Jason Maier. These publications are not just for Bitcoin enthusiasts, but for anyone interested in global economic and political developments.</p><p>"<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/hidden-repression">Hidden Repression</a>" by Alex Gladstein addresses how the world's monetary system exploits the weak and how citizens in the global south are turning to Bitcoin as a way out. Gladstein states, "I’m delighted to be working with Bitcoin Magazine to publish Hidden Repression, which seeks to illuminate the true nature of the world financial system and how, at its core, it remains a mechanism of the powerful stealing from the weak."</p><p>"<a href="https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/a-progressives-case-for-bitcoin">A Progressive's Case for Bitcoin</a>" by C. Jason Maier presents a well-researched and thoughtful case for the value of Bitcoin, grounded in fact and avoiding sensationalism and hype. Maier hopes to combat some of the misinformation that people often hear about this new technology, stating, "Bitcoin is our best chance to make the world more just, equitable and peaceful, and it is critically important that more people fully understand it."</p><p>Both books are available for purchase from the Bitcoin Magazine store for $29.99, and they will also be available for purchase at the upcoming <a href="http://b.tc/conference">Bitcoin 2023 Conference</a> in Miami on May 18-20. The authors will be present at the conference's general admission days, where they can sign the books at the Book Signing booth.</p><p>Bitcoin Magazine Books aims to publish high-quality books that offer readers valuable insights into Bitcoin's role in shaping the world's economic future. With the launch of these two new publications, Bitcoin Magazine Books is off to a strong start, and readers can look forward to more exciting books in the future.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNDgzNTg3/bitcoin-to-the-moon.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Orange Pill App Is Accelerating Hyperbitcoinization In Real Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[Orange Pill App brings Bitcoiners together, demonstrates demand for adoption to local businesses and propels the bitcoin standard.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/orange-pill-app-joins-bitcoin-in-person</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/orange-pill-app-joins-bitcoin-in-person</guid><category><![CDATA[Meetups]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Merchants]]></category><category><![CDATA[Orange Pill App]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Robert Hall]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Apr 2023 13:01:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4MTgwMTQ4ODgzODI2NDc0/20220318_btcfinal_attendingmeetups.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Orange Pill App brings Bitcoiners together, demonstrates demand for adoption to local businesses and propels the bitcoin standard.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Robert Hall, a content creator and small business owner who has an Orange Pill App profile.</em></p><p>The team over at <a href="https://www.theorangepillapp.com/en">Orange Pill App</a> is breaking new ground toward Bitcoin adoption on a peer-to-peer level. But if you don’t know anything about this platform, here is a quick rundown: </p><p>It’s an app available on iOS or Android that helps you find local Bitcoiners in your area. How often have you felt like you are the only Bitcoiner in town? I know I have plenty of time. Wouldn’t it be nice to make new friends that love Bitcoin as much as you do in real life?</p><p>This is what the Orange Pill App is all about: building friendships and building a thriving Bitcoin community one meetup or connection at a time. As of this writing, there are thousands of users.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Users can list their Bitcoin-focused events and attract attendees from their areas. Source: Orange Pill App</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>In addition to helping you to find new Bitcoiners in your area, Orange Pill App is also on a mission to orange pill businesses. How much better would it be if we could spend sats at our local bars, hotels or restaurants? That would be awesome, right?</p><p>It definitely would add some rocket fuel toward the goal of achieving a bitcoin standard. To make this happen, <a href="https://medium.com/@orangepillapp/bridging-the-gap-orange-pill-app-and-btcmap-org-3552f1766339">Orange Pill App has partnered with BTCMap.org</a> to use demand-side pressure to orange pill merchants en masse.</p><p>When this new feature is launched, the app will be able to plug the number of its users into BTC Map to show how many Bitcoiners are in a given area. This data will be shown to business owners so they can understand if there is an active group of Bitcoiners ready to spend sats at their establishments.</p><p>This is a win for small business owners, because they can instantly gain new customers without advertising. Bitcoiners are eager to spend sats and support businesses that accept bitcoin. One thing I understand about Bitcoiners is they are loyal and believe in Bitcoin to the core of their beings.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This is a win for Bitcoin educators as well. Instead of spending valuable time explaining Bitcoin's tenets to each individual business owner, those owners can see the demand with their own eyes. </p><p>And, once one business starts accepting bitcoin and seeing results, word will spread like wildfire among other business owners. It’s all about creating a network effect at the business level.</p><p>The road to hyperbitcoinization will take different methods and vectors to reach the masses. This could be a highly-effective method of orange pilling the people who we need to create a new Bitcoin-based economy!</p><p>My hat is off to the team over at Orange Pill App. I can’t wait to see what else it comes out with in the coming months and years. Remember: stacks friends who stack sats!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Robert Hall.

The <a href="https://github.com/civkit/paper/blob/main/civ_kit_paper.pdf">paper</a> was authored by Antoine Riard, Nicholas Gregory and Ray Youssef, who have shared the paper with the Bitcoin developer community for feedback. The Civ Kit combines the Nostr architecture with the Lightning Network, prioritizing “privacy and security through escrowed trades, decentralized identity, moderation, a P2P messaging protocol, and know-your-peer (KYP) oracles for adjudication,” a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine stated. The system aims to support all kinds of trading, including goods and services.</p><p>“The researchers will gradually release code and modules, extensively building on top of the Lightning Dev Kit and Nostr libraries,” the press release explained. “Civ Kit development will bind to the same open-source and transparency standards as Bitcoin Core and libsecp256k1.”</p><p>The Civ Kit's design will emphasize trust and reputation within the marketplace, and the press release described how borrowing and lending can be added by using a universal credit score for all traders calculated by a combination of success of trades (Web-of-Stakes) and Web-of-Trust techniques that act as a “trustless source of truth.” The Civ Kit has been “peer-reviewed by some of the best minds in the Lightning and Discreet Log Contract engineering communities,” the press release said.</p><p>Nicholas Gregory, one of the authors of The Civ Kit, has been involved in developing Bitcoin infrastructure since 2016, and hopes that the initiative will boost Bitcoin's circular economy. He stated, "I truly hope this initiative serves as a unique piece of the puzzle to boost Bitcoin's circular economy, which, if we're honest, has not reached its full potential in 2023."</p><p>Ray Youssef, founder of Paxful and the Built With Bitcoin Foundation, another of the paper's authors, said he is committed to carrying on the work of Satoshi Nakamoto to provide the world with the ability to build unstoppable free markets. <br><br>“The title of the Bitcoin white paper spoke about ‘a peer-to-peer electronic cash system’ — yet the P2P industry is under attack from international powers who feed off centralized fiat currencies and the control they wield,” Youssef said. “At the same time, billions of people have been relegated to non-existence by this failed system. Bitcoin is the solution and we’re not backing down.”<br><br>The team behind the white paper is working to integrate the research into <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-entrepreneurs-introduce-noones-app-aimed-at-empowering-financial-freedom">Noones</a>, a new company dedicated to financial freedom in the Global South. The Civ Kit is open for collaboration and publicly <a href="https://github.com/civkit">available</a> on GitHub.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Stamps Are Attracting Collectors And Creators With Blockchain Permanence]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Stamps seek to offer greater permanence and security on the blockchain, attracting collectors and creators.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-stamps-offer-blockchain-permanence</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-stamps-offer-blockchain-permanence</guid><category><![CDATA[Marketplace]]></category><category><![CDATA[NFTs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Apr 2023 18:44:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDI3MzM2NzA3OTQxNjI1/flag-freedom-nation-adventure-innovation.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Bitcoin Stamps seek to offer greater permanence and security on the blockchain, attracting collectors and creators.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Frank Kashner, founder of UnChainDemocracy.org.</em></p><p>In 1971, I joined a communist party while working in the factory of the highest-paid General Electric (GE) defense plant in the country. I was repulsed by pictures of our military dropping napalm on Vietnamese children, convinced that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/opinion/vietnam-war-necessary.html?auth=login-google1tap&amp;login=google1tap">the justifications of our government </a>were lies, and I was drawn to the idea that “the working class” would soon take over the world and create a utopia. </p><p>The group that I joined was split off from the American Communist Party. It <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Say-Want-Revolution-Worker-Student/dp/0578406543">was supposed to be “democratic and centralist</a>.” I quit the group after two months when it tried to give me orders without understanding what was actually happening. I saw that it was all about Centralism without any democracy. But I stayed in the GE factory for 13 years, participating in movements that reformed both the worker’s union and GE.</p><p>But what about “revolution” and who are the “workers”? I did not have a violent bone in my body, and treated the terms “revolution” and “workers” like metaphors, not taken seriously by me or anyone else (including our probable FBI monitors). But the need for dramatic social and political change stayed with me, and my notion of the “workers” grew to include almost everyone who is not a billionaire or flunky. </p><p>Over the years, I have participated in personal, union, community, school, environmental and political reform efforts, always aware that, even though we often won victories, we were shoveling shit against the incoming tide of empire, greed, militarism, autocracy and disintegration. </p><p>In 2017, I met Bitcoin and was entranced by the idea of money that was independent of corporations and governments, that was limited to 21 million, created by solving math problems, guarded by vigilant nodes, decentralized and not rigged by and for the elite. Over this past year, I have learned from the brilliant Bitcoin community, including people like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50157837-the-price-of-tomorrow">Jeff Booth</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Jason Lowery</a>. Bitcoin is a tool of international, non-violent economic revolution against corruption. Bitcoin strikes at the heart of corporate and governmental theft from our families, of our labor, our property and our intellect. </p><h2>Wake Up To Bitcoin</h2><p>This applies to every governmental fiat, debt-based system in the world. In his magnificent book, “<a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf">Debt: The First 5,000 Years,”</a> David Graeber shows us how national, debt-based systems always result in inflation, and then in war and revolution. Bitcoin does not replace the need for political organizing and resistance, but I am now convinced that political and economic reform cannot succeed peacefully without Bitcoin. For the first time in history, Bitcoin offers a non-violent path to stable and increasing value of our labor, in all of its forms, for we “workers of the world.” Progressives have been slow to do the work to understand economics and Bitcoin, and to join this movement. To them, I say, “wake up!”</p><p>Many of you reading this have tried to reach friends and relatives about Bitcoin, often without success. For some of them, I have a possibly more compelling message.</p><p><a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/statesofdamage/syllabus201516/graeber-debt_the_first_5000_years.pdf">Graeber</a> points out that our economy has depended upon military spending as great as all of the other nations of the world combined. This spending has in turn depended upon the dollar being the global reserve currency. Other nations are now moving away from the dollar. That movement, plus the billionaire wealth gap (grab), plus our current mountain of debt and the resulting inflation, is running out the clock of our economic system. This result follows:</p><p>Our crumbling infrastructure, insurance-dominated healthcare, insufficient housing, schools under attack, racism, misogyny, religious nationalism, an inability to respond to the destruction caused by global warming, and our dissolving social fabric are problems that cannot be solved under our current debt-based economic system. As our economy inevitably declines, every other just cause suffers. If you care about any of those things and the future of our children, then you need to learn about Bitcoin.</p><p>Every government in the world, capitalist and communist, is now deep in debt, the money stolen from current and future generations. They are all unsustainable, economically and environmentally. They are all Ponzi schemes. And like all Ponzi schemes, they depend upon our <a href="https://www.mackinac.org/OvertonWindow">knowledge, belief and acceptance</a> to keep going. Historically, systems that reached high levels of misery and inequality, ended in revolution, war or both.</p><h2>Bitcoin Changes Things</h2><p>For the first time in human history, we have a vehicle that goes to the heart of our financial and economic system. It is increasingly available for both savings and transactions. It steps around police and military batons, guns and tanks, and establishes unimpeachable value for our labor, for our remittances home, for our savings and our retirement. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Softwar-Projection-National-Strategic-Significance/dp/B0BW358F37">Lowery posits </a>that Bitcoin can replace much of our over reliance on violent military (non)solutions.</p><p>The corruption of our political systems sits atop patronage and cultural hierarchies, some, centuries old, <a href="https://unchaindemocracy.org/democracy-in-chains-a-review">some modern</a>. The hierarchies, dominating both U.S. political parties, are designed to shield and obscure those responsible (remember <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/style/jeffrey-epstein-little-black-book.html">Jeffrey Epstein and his client book</a>?) and limit participation in organizations for change, including Bitcoin. Our ability to have a say in how we are governed, at the federal, state or city levels, is decreasing as schools and towns face budget shortfalls, in step with the declining value of the money in our pocket. </p><p>Our democracy is under attack. At every level. This decline, as measured by groups that <a href="https://thefulcrum.us/big-picture/Leveraging-big-ideas/flawed-democracy">track freedom</a> worldwide, corresponds to <a href="https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/2021?endYear=1971&amp;amount=100">the U.S. dollar’s decline in purchasing power</a>. The dollar (including the value of our labor) goes down, freedom goes down! Massive strikes, demonstrations and resistance to the disintegrating world order are occurring in other countries, but are poorly covered in our corporate media. </p><p>Teachers, medical and healthcare workers, farmers, machinists, retail workers, transportation workers, the underemployed, the unable to work, of all countries: it is time to unite. We have nothing to lose but the chains of billionaires, their flunkies, their rotten financial and political system and their often cruel or clueless managers. For the first time in history, we have a tool that values our labor and ideas, that steps around their corruption, that enables us to transfer value at the speed of light, to avoid their fees, to make use of stranded and wasted energy.</p><p>Bitcoin is a peaceful, worldwide economic revolution with profound social and political implications. No weapons other than your learning, imagination, courage and participation are required. And you will have to see through all of their propaganda, their fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) aimed to delay, devalue and defeat it.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Frank Kashner.

    </figure><p><a href="https://www.bitstack-app.com/en">Bitstack</a>, a bitcoin savings app in France, has announced a $2.1 million (€2 million) funding round. The funding comes from a range of investors, including Founders Future, Y Combinator and Kima Ventures, among others. The startup will use the funding to expand its product offerings, make strategic hires and finance customer acquisition efforts, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Bitstack will soon offer its users the ability to auto-invest a percentage of their paycheck in bitcoin, send bitcoin between friends and earn bitcoin rewards when spending with the Bitstack Card, the company says.</p><p>Bitstack was launched on the App Store and Google Play in July 2022, and has since onboarded over 25,000 users in France according to the press release. Alexandre Roubaud, CEO of Bitstack, said "We are seeing a rapidly growing interest for Bitcoin in France, with over 50% of Bitstack users being first-time bitcoin buyers." The startup has also seen its number of active users increasing by more than 20% month over month, the press release states.</p><p>Since its launch, Bitstack claims its users have unrealized gains of 30% despite bitcoin’s downward trend in 2022. "Our ambition is to give people a new way to manage their money. At Bitstack, we believe that personal finance can be different, more accessible, more fun and more transparent thanks to bitcoin. With the launch of our new financial services and debit card, we continue our mission to democratize Bitcoin and create a more open financial system," said Roubaud.</p><p>Bitstack states it will open access to its bitcoin cashback debit card, available for free, by the end of 2023. Bitstack cardholders will be able to earn bitcoin rewards on every purchase, along with additional rewards at select retail partners. "Bitstack is democratizing the use of cryptocurrencies by creating an innovative new savings product that fits into everyday life," said Marc Menasé, founder of Founders Future. "We are more than proud to accompany these ambitious entrepreneurs at Founders Future to help them in their development in France and abroad."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNzA1NDk5OTk2NDMyMjUy/orange-pill-bitcoin-adoption.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unchained Announces $60M Series B Fundraising Round]]></title><description><![CDATA[Funding led by Valor Equity Partners and other existing investors will go towards the firm’s expansion and improvement.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-60m-series-b-fundraising-round</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-60m-series-b-fundraising-round</guid><category><![CDATA[multi-signature]]></category><category><![CDATA[fundraising]]></category><category><![CDATA[Custody]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unchained capital]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Funding led by Valor Equity Partners and other existing investors will go towards the firm’s expansion and improvement.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, funding will be used to expand Unchained’s client base and improve its suite of financial services.</p><p>Unchained’s collaborative custody model aims to use Bitcoin’s native multisignature capabilities to provide the benefits of self-custody while mitigating risks associated with self-custody. The model allows clients to share control of their bitcoin between private keys they hold themselves and private keys held by Unchained and other financial services companies. The platform currently secures over $2 billion in bitcoin across thousands of keys worldwide, according to the press release.</p><p>Vivek Pattipati, a Partner at Valor who will be joining Unchained’s Board of Directors, described Unchained’s current position, saying that “in the midst of market chaos, Unchained has emerged as a highly trusted provider of Bitcoin custody and financial services through superior technology, risk management, regulatory compliance, and client service.”<br><br>The company has originated over $500 million in bitcoin-collateralized loans since 2017, the press release states, while experiencing zero loan losses. The Unchained trading desk allows clients to buy bitcoin directly to cold storage, and its IRA offering allows clients to hold keys to their bitcoin within tax-advantaged retirement accounts, which the release notes is an industry-first.</p><p>Unchained feels that as bitcoin continues to grow in adoption, there is a tremendous opportunity for products that bridge into the traditional dollar ecosystem around credit, trading, investment and other financial services. “Using this fresh capital investment to expand our reach and suite of services, we hope to enable new entrants to Bitcoin to leapfrog centralized custodians into our safer collaborative custody model,” said Unchained CEO Joe Kelly.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMjU1NjA1NDIxNTQ5MTIz/technical-bitcoin-development-pixel.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Anita Posch Brings Financial Education To The World: ‘Bitcoin Gives Them A Choice’]]></title><description><![CDATA[Podcaster and non-profit educator Anita Posch discusses her mission to travel the world and bring Bitcoin to those who need it most.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/anita-posch-on-global-bitcoin-education</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/anita-posch-on-global-bitcoin-education</guid><category><![CDATA[anita posch]]></category><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Africa]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[women]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Becca Bratcher]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTky/bitcoin-adoption-map.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Podcaster and non-profit educator Anita Posch discusses her mission to travel the world and bring Bitcoin to those who need it most.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>As an American who grew up in the South, I am ashamed of the lack of financial knowledge I had as a young adult. Bitcoin made zero sense to me until I understood the history of money and what it means to have a peer-to-peer, apolitical, monetary system. This knowledge has opened my mind to the many things that Bitcoin can accomplish in regards to elevating human rights around the world. </p><p>Every single day, more human rights violations are reported in the media. From the <a href="https://www.hrw.org/tag/rohingya">Rohingya genocide</a> to the Russian invasion of <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/03/1135012">Ukraine</a> and a thousand more in between. The world we live in is corrupted by greed and those who misuse their power. Oftentimes, the power hungry use fiat currency as a means of control. That being said, Bitcoin’s case for improving human rights is the number one reason why I care about Bitcoin. </p><p>Enter Anita Posch: <a href="https://btcpodcasting.com/@anitaposch">Podcast</a> host,, <a href="https://learnbitcoin.link/">author,</a> non-profit <a href="https://bffbtc.org/">founder</a> and Bitcoin educator. Posch has a background of more than 20 years in web design and online entrepreneurship, and has made it her life’s mission to educate people who need Bitcoin the most. She has been on the ground working tirelessly, emphasizing the need for everyone, specifically women, to take control of their financial literacy through Bitcoin education and entrepreneurship. </p><p>I’m confident you will be inspired as you read her responses to my questions about how she is using Bitcoin education to empower more people around the world.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what <em>specifically</em> drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The first time I heard about Bitcoin was in 2011, I tweeted about it, but didn't really get into it, because I read an article and concluded that it's just another PayPal. </p><p>Well, it must have been a bad article. </p><p>In April 2017 I heard a talk at a conference about Bitcoin and open blockchains and their future impact on society and technology. This time, I was open and ready to learn something new. I had been an online entrepreneur and web designer for 20 years and was looking for new interesting topics as a basis for my work. I immediately understood that an uncensorable, collaborative, permissionless and open protocol to send value is a tool that can provide a level playing field for anyone globally. </p><p>I was definitely not able to verbalize this back then, because I had no clue how Bitcoin works, but my life experiences and my insights as a builder of online shops and marketplaces acted as some sort of internal compass to sense the groundbreaking importance of Bitcoin. This time, I wanted to be part of the development and decided to put all my efforts into understanding and learning to become a Bitcoin educator myself.</p><p><strong>How do you see Bitcoin positively impacting youth in the countries you serve; Ghana, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I have been working with my initiative, Bitcoin For Fairness, and from what I've learned, many young people realize how Bitcoin gives them a choice, an opportunity to participate in a global economy, to become free from financial oppression and lack of access to financial means in their home countries. </p><p>Take the people who live in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>, for instance. I visited and worked with them in May 2022. Bitcoin Ekasi is a township in Mossel Bay, South Africa, where 11 shops and a taxi driver are accepting bitcoin now after being onboarded by community members. Many of the 5,000 inhabitants have no access to bank accounts or chose to unbank themselves <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-enforces-universal-human-rights">because of the high fees and bureaucracy</a>. Young people living in the township are supporting their community with knowledge and practical education on how they can facilitate Bitcoin. </p><p>The coaches there earn their salaries in bitcoin and spend it in the local shops. Recently, yet another shop asked to be added to the Bitcoin economy because of the high grade of security that bitcoin offers compared to keeping cash. A few months ago, the neighborhood's supermarket, Pick n Pay, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/pick-n-pay-now-accepts-bitcoin">started accepting bitcoin</a>, too. That means the shop owners can use their earned bitcoin to restock their shops without the need to convert to the national currency, which saves fees and hassle.</p><p>A growing number of young people see how they can earn bitcoin through content creation, like on our BTC podcasting platform. It's free to host a podcast without losing your copyright (like on Anchor) and, at the same time, anyone can start earning bitcoin via <a href="https://value4value.info/">Value4Value podcasting</a> without the need to run their own Lightning nodes. </p><p>Value4Value means that the listeners can freely decide how many bitcoin, if any, they want to send to the host while listening to a podcast. As a podcaster myself, I saw the need for a platform that is not charging around $10 per month for podcast hosting, because it excludes many people from sharing their voices from the ground. </p><p>During my travels, especially to Ghana speaking at the first <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/africa-bitcoin-conference-starts-december-5">Pan-African Bitcoin conference</a>, it was amazing to meet and witness how many young people are starting educational groups, for instance, the Bitcoin Cowries in Accra, Bitcoin Mountain in Cameroon or the women-focused Bitcoin Dada in Kenya. I’m currently working on an online mentorship program called “Crack The Orange” for newbies and community leaders to gain a wider understanding of Bitcoin to share it with their community members. With my non-profit initiative, Bitcoin For Fairness, we’re supporting young women to create their own educational group in Zambia.</p><p>The four African founders of Qala, a program designed to train the next generation of African Bitcoin and Lightning developers, are inspiring, visionary young people themselves. All these initiatives contribute to job and wealth creation and will have a positive network effect on the ground.</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those close to you (such as close friends, etc.)?</strong></p><p>In the last few years, I have been trying to educate the naysayers on Twitter or other media platforms with arguments, facts and by sharing experiences of African and South American Bitcoin users on my podcast “The Anita Posch Show.” </p><p>I realized it's not easily possible to win an argument if the respondent has made up their mind already. Every answer you give will be opposed with opinions and their own perception. I never tried to convince anyone. If people show up and are interested in the topic, I'll explain and support. If not, then I won't touch the topic. The same is true for my friends. Most of them have their own ideas about Bitcoin, and don't take the time or interest to learn. A handful of my close friends have sought my guidance and done the work. I think they are very content today.</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>At first, let the numbers speak. Of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-enforces-universal-human-rights">1.7 billion unbanked people around the world</a>, <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/DSBatten/status/1645254782263910400">57% are women</a>.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pandp.20221016">American Economic Association</a>:</p><p>"In the USA alone approximately 8.4 million US households are unbanked with an additional 24.2 million US households classified as underbanked. Black women are significantly more likely than Black men or any other group to be unbanked or to be underbanked. Further, we find limited wealth is more frequently cited by Black women as the main reason why they do not engage with the banking system."</p><p>And according to <a href="https://www.wtwco.com/en-AE/insights/2022/11/2022-global-gender-wealth-equity-report#:~:text=New%20flagship%20research%20from%20WTW,to%20our%20Wealth%20Equity%20Index">WTW</a>:</p><p>"There is a significant gender wealth gap between men and women at retirement. Upon retirement women globally are expected to accumulate only 74% of the wealth that men have.”</p><p>Seventy-five economies globally “still <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/where-world-do-women-still-face-legal-barriers-own-and-administer-assets">limit women’s rights</a> to manage assets.” There are countries in which women are not allowed to own property or inherit it — they never will be owners of land that could be used as a security to apply for a loan or support their informal businesses. This is occurring mostly in countries in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>While women have been getting the same rights in many societies in recent decades, in general, women are still facing massive discrimination on the basis of gender. This inequality leads to exclusion from the financial system, because of a lack of wealth or because women can't produce an ID, which is necessary to be banked. </p><p>Bitcoin is fair in so far as it does not discriminate. Anyone can use it without the need to show an ID or the need to be wealthy already. There is no minimum limit to use bitcoin. Anyone can earn bitcoin through their work. Earning bitcoin will become the standard. </p><p>By educating women and girls about Bitcoin, we can support them in closing the gender wealth gap, when we factor in that Bitcoin's value has only appreciated in the long term. Nonetheless Bitcoin can be only one tool, it won't magically close the wealth gap, because men have more resources now, that's why they can earn or buy more bitcoin as well. That's why it's imperative to educate women and girls as early as possible as long as bitcoin is in its infancy, hence bringing education to the Global South especially for women, the queer community and human rights activists, is a strong focus of Bitcoin For Fairness.</p><p><strong>With the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/peer-to-peer-bitcoin-exchange-paxful-suspends-marketplace">recent closure</a> of peer-to-peer (P2P) platform Paxful, what other options for buying and selling bitcoin have you found to be successful in countries where there are no centralized exchanges?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are several other P2P options to buy and sell bitcoin without the need to show your ID, which is an important privacy protection.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker who resides in rural Midwestern America.</em></p><p>Rural America is not a monolithic entity, but rather a diverse and dynamic region that encompasses different landscapes, climates and cultures. Some rural areas are more prosperous and developed than others, depending on factors such as natural resources, infrastructure and industry. Some rural areas are more conservative and religious than others, depending on factors such as history, ethnicity and immigration. Some rural areas are more connected and integrated with urban areas than others, depending on factors such as distance, transportation and communication. </p><p>Growing up in rural America is not better or worse than growing up in urban or suburban areas. It is simply different. Each environment has its own advantages and disadvantages that shape one's life experiences and outcomes. The important thing is to appreciate the diversity and richness of rural America, and if you can do that, you will recognize the potential contributions that Bitcoin can bring to this region in particular. </p><p>Bitcoin's appeal lies in its ability to provide financial freedom, privacy and innovation to its users. Bitcoin also embodies some of the values that rural America cherishes, such as independence, self-reliance and entrepreneurship. Many rural Americans have embraced Bitcoin as a way to participate in the global economy, hedge against inflation and diversify their income sources. </p><p>Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme or a magic solution to all problems. It is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform the world of money and finance. But it also requires education, innovation and adoption to reach its full potential. Bitcoin will have truly made it when small-town America understands what it really is: a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that empowers people to be their own banks. </p><h2>Bitcoin Mining Is Ideal For Rural America</h2><p>In fact, some of the largest and most advanced bitcoin mining facilities are located in rural areas of the U.S., particularly in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-mining-firm-blockcap-moves-headquarters-to-texas-as-state-embraces-bitcoin">Texas</a> and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/wyoming-aiming-5-bitcoin-mining-hashrate">Mountain West region</a>. Bitcoin mining requires a lot of cheap and reliable electricity, which rural areas can provide thanks to their abundant natural resources, deregulated power markets and low population densities. Bitcoin mining also creates jobs, tax revenues and economic development for rural communities that may otherwise struggle to attract investment and innovation. </p><p>Bitcoin mining is not only a profitable business, but also a way to support the Bitcoin network and its ideals. By mining bitcoin, rural Americans are contributing to the security, decentralization and resilience of the cryptocurrency that best encompasses their values.</p><h2>Bitcoin Can Boost Small-Town America</h2><p>Bitcoin can benefit small-town America in many other ways as well. Here are some examples: </p><ul><li>Bitcoin can help small businesses compete and grow by lowering their costs and increasing their customer bases. Small businesses can accept bitcoin as a payment option and attract more customers who prefer to use digital currencies. They can also save money on fees by using bitcoin instead of credit cards.</li><li>Bitcoin can help farmers and producers sell their products directly to consumers without intermediaries or middlemen. Farmers and producers can use bitcoin to create their own marketplaces and set their own prices. They can also use bitcoin to track and verify the quality and origin of their products, enhancing their reputations and trustworthiness. </li><li>Bitcoin can help local communities fund their own projects and initiatives without depending on external sources or authorities. Local communities can use bitcoin to raise money for causes they care about, such as education, healthcare or infrastructure. They can also use bitcoin to reward volunteers or contributors who participate in their efforts. </li><li>Bitcoin can help individuals achieve financial freedom and independence by giving them access to an open, global financial system. Individuals can use bitcoin to save money for their future goals, such as buying a house, starting a business or retiring early.</li></ul><p>Of course, there are perceived challenges and risks involved in using bitcoin, such as price volatility, security, regulation and education. But these challenges can be overcome with time and effort, and that the benefits outweigh the costs. </p><p>Bitcoin is a benefit for rural America because it offers a decentralized and secure way of storing and transferring value. Unlike traditional financial institutions, bitcoin does not require physical infrastructure, intermediaries or fees. This makes it accessible and affordable for rural communities that may lack banking services or face high transaction costs. Bitcoin also empowers rural Americans to participate in the global economy and have more control over their own money. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Luke Groom, a civil engineer, JD-MBA student and part-time strategy associate with Marathon Digital Holdings.</em></p><p>In the last couple of years, Jordan Peterson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDZ60RbA0jI">has been diving down the sound money rabbit hole</a>, and for me it’s been a pleasure to watch from a distance. So many of the values he espouses align with the values that Bitcoin encourages, such as personal responsibility and a search for truth, so it was only a matter of time before he became interested in Bitcoin. </p><p>He has spoken with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXvQcuIb5rU&amp;t=6s"> Saefidean Ammous</a> and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQlA-I7PXf0&amp;t=6671s"> Robert Breedlove</a> in recent years and, even as a non-Bitcoiner per se,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvpXn-Iki8o"> captivated the audience</a> at the Bitcoin conference in Miami in 2022. A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHu5h26c4nc"> more recent conversation with Roy Sebag</a> was also enjoyable to listen to, though it illustrated for me the need to discuss the differences between gold and bitcoin, not just their properties as monetary units, but also the properties of their ledgers.</p><p>To be sure, gold bugs such as Sebag and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schiff">Peter Schiff</a> share many beliefs with Bitcoiners. I respect them and their work. There is a lot of overlap in the problems and solutions that both gold bugs and Bitcoiners address. But the arguments for bitcoin as a superior unit of account have been discussed at length. </p><h2>The Fact That Gold Has Other Tangible Uses Isn’t Relevant For Global Money</h2><p>Sebag and Schiff argue that gold is valuable, in part, because it has other uses such as in cell phone parts and dentistry, whereas bitcoin has no other uses. This is true; however, I am not sure how this is relevant. </p><p>Why do we need our money to have other features besides just being money? Where is that written? If the monetary premium for gold disappeared, and it was only used for its other tangible purposes, gold’s price would utterly collapse. Furthermore, if gold became the global unit of account as gold bugs want it to, gold would be used even less for nonmonetary purposes due to cost limitations. Its monetary premium would increase, thereby weakening their own argument about having other valuable uses. </p><p>A monetary unit need only have good monetary properties and interact well with its ledger. As the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money">generally accepted properties of money dictate</a>, an ideal monetary unit would be portable, durable, accepted, scarce, fungible, divisible and resistant to counterfeiting.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As a unit, bitcoin is equal or superior to gold in all of these features, with the exception of acceptability. <a href="https://8marketcap.com/">(Gold’s market cap is still roughly 20-times that of Bitcoin’s</a>, meaning it is still more widely accepted.) Talking about the units, however, is only a fraction of the conversation. We must also look at the ledger.</p><h2>The Bitcoin Ledger Is Superior</h2><p>Our modern society requires the use of ledgers to transact money. Moving physical dollars or physical gold around the world is simply too costly, dangerous and logistically challenging. Instead, we rely on the ledgers of credit card companies, banks and central banks to facilitate the “movement” of money. Our whole system, except the relatively few physical dollars in existence, is a system of entirely ledger-based money.</p><p>Because ledgers have become necessary in modern commerce, and because no one is advocating a return to society in which all commerce is conducted exclusively by in-person exchanges of money, when analyzing monetary systems, we must not only look at the units on our ledgers but also the ledgers themselves. Bitcoin’s properties as a ledger are what make it a far superior monetary system to anything in existence.</p><p>If we were to think of the properties that make up an ideal ledger, they would be: reliable, unattackable, verifiable, global, accessible, trustworthy and able to provide fast final settlement. While the sound money properties of gold versus those of bitcoin were relatively close when considering the units behind the ledger, when comparing the ledgers themselves, Bitcoin is far superior.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>From a monetary unit perspective, Bitcoiners and gold bugs agree that a gold-based system could encourage monetary responsibility and limit inflation. However, gold bugs have not provided any prevalent suggestions to improve the U.S. dollar ledger system. That current system is flawed in that it is unverifiable for individuals, inaccessible for individuals to interact with directly, and slow to process final settlement. How would a gold-based ledger be any better? </p><p>Furthermore, the gold bugs have not provided any meaningful suggestions about how to avoid the problems of debasement, which have been a constant for centuries.</p><p>We have already run the experiment of a gold-based ledger over the past 800 years. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medici_Bank">Medici family</a> popularized the ledger-based-gold-backed-banking in Italy and throughout Europe as early as the 12th and 13th centuries. Europeans, in effect, used ledgers to “transfer” their gold great distances. People and governments continued to use the system of overlapping ledgers backed by gold for centuries and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/money/The-decline-of-gold">each of those countries</a> saw a corruption of the ledger, the failure of their currency or the <a href="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/gold-price-history-3305646">debasement of gold</a>. So, what mechanisms do gold bugs suggest to avoid the corruption and debasement of a gold-based ledger in the future? I have not heard any.</p><p>Bitcoin is beautiful in that it provides an elegant solution to both the unit and the ledger. The unit provides all of the characteristics of sound money and the ledger is reliable, unattackable, verifiable, global, accessible, provides fast final settlement and is trustworthy. An individual can personally interact with the ledger and provide verified final settlement across the globe in a matter of minutes on a ledger that doesn’t require a trusted intermediary.</p><p>I have a lot of respect for gold bugs, and even own a modest amount of gold myself. With that respect in mind, I ask Peterson, Sebag, Schiff and the other gold bugs, when comparing monetary systems, to analyze both the unit and the ledger, then come to their own conclusions.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Luke Groom.

    </figure><p>Hyperbitcoinization is a future that all Bitcoiners hope to witness. It is defined via the <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/hyperbitcoinization/">Nakamoto Institute</a> as “a voluntary transition from an inferior currency to a superior one, and its adoption is a series of individual acts…” </p><p>But who are the individuals who must act to transition from using a given currency to using Bitcoin? I submit that today’s Gen Z college students will play a major role in that transition. Unfortunately, most of them are not following Bitcoin threads on Twitter, nor are they reading articles about the latest developments in monetary policy. Yet, they are the future leaders of our country and the world and possess the power to influence policy. It is crucial that we find a way to reach them and educate them about Bitcoin.</p><p>That’s why, as a passionate Bitcoin enthusiast, I am determined to make a difference and introduce this revolutionary freedom technology to college students. For me, making a difference means investing my time to impact, however slightly, those who have not yet joined the Bitcoin ranks. In this article, I share my experience and lessons learned with a recent example. My conclusion is we are empowered, obligated even, to make a difference in sharing Bitcoin with the young people in our lives.</p><h2>Visiting My Daughter With A Bitcoin Game In Hand</h2><p>I recently traveled to visit my oldest child at her college. Thankfully, she has a healthy friend group that shares traditional and respectful values. They’re good, salt-of-the-earth kids who just so happen to know nothing about Bitcoin. My perfect audience!</p><p>I arrived armed with nothing but my passion and a Bitcoin board game that I created with my husband, HODL UP. For the next two hours, I sat on a cold, hard, dorm-room floor playing the game with six students. My goal: to spark their curiosity about Bitcoin in a fun way. These students major in business, environmental science, mathematics and psychology. While they had all heard about Bitcoin through media headlines, they had no real knowledge of what it is and how it works, or even why it's important.</p><p>Explaining the game to them was fast and easy. They had no questions about Bitcoin. They just wanted to know how to play the game. So, I spent no time explaining the parts of the game and what they meant in real life. I simply told them each player’s options at each turn. The game began and the students picked up the pace quickly. </p><p>As the game progressed, the students shared friendly smack talk as they attacked and defended their play bitcoin. The room echoed with their laughter and it warmed my heart. At the same time, however, I was itching for them, any of them, to ask me anything about what they were experiencing in the game: the difficulty adjustment, the halving, the hot and cold wallets, anything. It was hard to hold my tongue and not spoil the fun.</p><p>The game ended with a three-way tie and a close fourth place. All the students had wide beaming smiles on their faces as they high-fived each other and celebrated. Then they began to help me pack up the game pieces. As the last piece was put back in the box, I was feeling anxious that <em>still</em>, no one had asked me any questions. “Oh my gosh, is someone going to ask me something?” I thought. “Somebody ask me something!”</p><h2>Now We’re Getting Somewhere</h2><p>The students all exclaimed that the game was super fun and thanked me for sharing it. </p><p>"Great, I’m glad you enjoyed it," I smiled and answered, but inwardly, I shouted: “Ask me something about Bitcoin!”</p><p>Nope!</p><p>Unable to contain myself any longer, I asked them, "Does anyone have any questions about the game?" </p><p>No response.</p><p>One more try: "Does anyone understand why Bitcoin has a difficulty adjustment?" </p><p>"What?” one student responded. “That was real?" </p><p>"Yes, everything in this game has something to do with how Bitcoin works in real life," I answered. "What did you learn about the hot and cold wallets? What's your best practice?"</p><p>One student answered, "Well, I learned that I should keep some money in cold but some in hot so I can make educated investments." </p><p>“What?” I thought. </p><p>"What do you think the hot and cold wallets represent?" I asked them.</p><p>A different student answered, "Liquid and non-liquid assets."</p><p>“Oh, now we're getting somewhere,” I thought. I clarified what cold storage really is and the importance of keeping their private keys offline. </p><p>Then I asked, “If you have a dollar and shoved it in your pocket, how can someone steal it without touching it?”</p><p>Without hesitation, one of the students replied, “Through money printing.” </p><p>I then explained that one of the best features of Bitcoin is that there will only ever be 21 million BTC, no more. No matter how much someone justifies needing more, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin with a scheduled release that is managed through halving events.</p><p>It was tough not to sound preachy. I wrapped up by telling the environmental science student how Bitcoin uses wasted energy, making it productive, and forwarded a couple of articles to him. I also gave a few book recommendations to the business student who said he wanted to read up on Bitcoin over the summer.</p><p>As I was driving home, I replayed the evening in my mind and wondered if I'd made any difference at all. Then I received a text from one of the students. He thanked me for the opportunity to play HODL UP. "It was rather insightful," he said.</p><p>“Insightful? ‘Insightful’ is good,” I thought. “I’ll take ‘insightful.’”</p><p>“I'm just there to plant a seed,” I reminded myself. Instead of focusing on trying to orange pill someone, I'm just planting a seed. In time, life and circumstances will water the seed and, hopefully, one day the person will find themselves sliding down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. But I can't insist on seeing the fruit of the seed as soon as I plant the seed. That feeds my ego but is the wrong focus for what I'm doing and will place an unnecessary and unhelpful strain on my interactions with students.</p><p>So, going forward, here are three things I plan to keep in mind and that I recommend to parents, grandparents and teachers in sharing Bitcoin with young adults:</p><ol><li>Warm up the audience and create positive association — it was infinitely easier to gain the students’ attention in discussing Bitcoin after they've associated a fun experience with Bitcoin than if I went in cold. Hence, the game first.</li><li>Focus on a good time, not on teaching the nitty gritty — keep things simple and light.

    </figure><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/foundation-devices-launches-new-bitcoin-hardware-wallet">Passport Batch 2</a> is the second-generation Bitcoin hardware wallet from <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>. Passport is built in the U.S., air gapped and utilizes open-source code. In this guide, you will see how simple self custody can be with a device like this, the differences between the Founder’s Edition and Batch 2 of the wallet and a walkthrough of select, advanced features.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIyODA0OTczMjMzNDcx/unboxing09.jpg" height="467" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><h2>Self Custody Made Simple</h2><p>“Self custody” means that you are in control of your private keys: this is how you maintain unrestricted access to your bitcoin. By extension, unrestricted access to your bitcoin means that you can send or receive bitcoin with anyone in the world for any reason at any time. You don't need anyone's permission, you won't be held against any financial institution's moral standards and nobody can stop you from making the transactions that you want to make. </p><p>With great power comes great responsibility, however, and self custody also means that you are taking radical responsibility for your bitcoin. You and you alone are responsible for managing your private keys in a way that allows you to access them, but not your adversaries. There is no 1-800 help line, there is no reversing of transactions and there is no one who can help you recover lost or forgotten information. This may sound intimidating or complicated, but tools like Foundation's Passport make self custody very simple and relatively easy to manage. </p><p>Passport makes it possible to self custody your bitcoin on a cold-storage device; this way, your private key is kept on a device that never makes a connection to the internet. Through the use of QR codes to sign transactions and the accompanying Envoy app, using the Passport to receive, secure and send bitcoin is easy and intuitive, even without an internet connection directly to the device. </p><h2>Unboxing</h2><p>Passport is shipped in a nondescript white box. There will be a shipping label (peeled off for privacy reasons in this demonstration) and a blue, tamper-evident seal on the outside of the box. The tamper-evident seal will be placed over the opening flap of the box and the seal will have a number on it that starts with “B799,” “B862” or “B863.” The full-length unique numbers are not saved by Foundation Devices, but the prefix is used to identify the production batch that the device was manufactured in. You can find a maintained list of these prefixes <a href="https://docs.foundationdevices.com/passport/setup">here</a>.</p><p><em>Privacy tip: Consider using a P.O. Box and an alias to avoid connecting your personally-identifiable information to Bitcoin-related items.</em></p><p><em>Security Tip: If the security seal shows any signs of tampering, contact </em><a href="mailto:hello@foundationdevices.com"><em>hello@foundationdevices.com</em></a><em>.</em></p><section><figure>

This app is available for iPhone or Android and enables a secure, guided setup experience for your Passport. While it makes for a convenient companion app, it is not required to use the Passport. You can use any wallet you want to monitor balances, build transactions or generate receive addresses. </p><p>With Envoy, you can also install the latest firmware updates from your mobile device using the included micro SD adapters. The security validation to ensure that your Passport has not been tampered with in transit can also be completed from the Envoy app. There is a beginner-friendly Bitcoin wallet built into Envoy that enables you to easily receive bitcoin to your Passport. You can also create transactions in Envoy, ready to sign with your Passport using the QR code communications, all while your private keys remain secured on the Passport. Envoy connects to the internet via <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> by default. </p><p>This guide will cover how to download Envoy from the F-Droid repository on an Android mobile device. The cool thing about F-Droid is that you can get apps from it without the need for a Google Play store account. The <a href="https://f-droid.org/docs/Security_Model/">F-Droid security model</a> enforces that all apps have a valid signature over the entire contents of the Android package (APK file), so you know you are getting the app intended for you by the developers who control the signing key of the repository you are using. </p><ul><li>With your mobile device, scan the QR code on the included notecard and it will take you to the Foundation Devices start page. </li><li>Click on the device you are setting up. In this case, Passport Batch 2.</li></ul><figure>

If your device fails the supply chain validation, it may have been tampered with or swapped out with a malicious device while in transit to you. In the unlikely event of a failure, contact the Foundation team via email at <a href="mailto:hello@foundationdevices.com">hello@foundationdevices.com</a>. If your Passport supply chain validation was successful, then select “Continue” in the Envoy app. </li><li>On the Passport, select “Passed.”&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><h2>PIN Code</h2><p>A PIN code on the Passport can be between six digits and 12 digits in length. Using a PIN that is easy to guess is not recommended. There is no way to recover a lost PIN. In the event that an incorrect PIN is entered into the Passport Batch 2 21 times, the device will self destruct and become permanently useless. If that occurs, your bitcoin is still safe, so long as you have your seed phrase (covered in the next section), it just means the device itself is ruined.</p><p>You can also enable security words which add a layer of protection in the event that your device is ever tampered with. If you enable security words, you will enter your PIN in two parts, a prefix and suffix. After entering the prefix, you will be presented with two English words, for example "moment auction." Because of the way that these words are generated, if anything has been tampered with on your Passport hardware or software, then these words will be different than the ones you were expecting. If the words are the ones you were expecting, then you enter your PIN suffix and complete the login process. </p><ul><li>On the Envoy app, you can just select “Continue” when you see the prompt to enter a six- to 12-digit PIN. The actual PIN setup will be carried out on the Passport.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><ul><li>On the Passport, use the “&gt;” arrow when you see the prompt to set up your PIN, which should be the first prompt you get after the supply chain validation procedure. </li><li>Using the “&gt;” arrow, acknowledge that there is no way to recover a lost PIN. You may want to consider writing your PIN down on paper or stamping it into metal and then storing it in a safe and secure location. </li><li>Using the “&gt;” arrow, acknowledge the warning to record your PIN somewhere safe.</li><li>Then, using the numeric keys, enter your desired PIN number. </li><li>Then enter it again to confirm.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><ul><li>Next, the Passport will cycle through “Setting initial PIN,” “Logging in” and, finally, you will receive a notice that the PIN was set successfully.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>

    </figure><p>Next time you turn on your Passport, you should be prompted for your PIN before being able to use the device. </p><h2>Seed Phrase</h2><p>The seed phrase is a human-readable representation of the initial entropy used to generate your Bitcoin private keys. Most commonly, seed phrases will be a list of 12 or 24 words. Backing up your seed phrase in a safe and secure way will enable you to access your bitcoin in the event your wallet is lost, stolen, destroyed, etc. So long as you have your seed phrase, you have access to your bitcoin. That also means that anyone else who gains access to your seed phrase has access to your bitcoin. </p><p>Take precautions to ensure you save your seed phrase in a safe and secure way. There are several methods, ranging from encrypted micro SD cards, to paper backups, to <a href="https://econoalchemist.github.io/SeedSigner/05_Seed-Backup.html">QR codes</a> to <a href="https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/the-domino-bitcoin-steel-plate-backup">steel plates</a> or <a href="https://www.econoalchemist.com/post/backup">washers</a>. Whichever method you choose, your seed phrase will work with a wide range of Bitcoin wallets. Many industry participants have implemented the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki">BIP39</a> standard, which defines how seed phrases work. This allows users to recover their bitcoin on a number of mobile, desktop or hardware wallets, regardless of which wallet they used to generate the seed phrase. Taking a picture or screenshot of your seed phrase is not recommended. </p><ul><li>Picking up where you left off, you will probably be at the prompt on your Passport asking you to upgrade the firmware. Since the Passport has not been connected to the Envoy app yet, this step will be skipped at this point and will be revisited after the seed phrase is created. You can update the firmware using the micro SD card at this point if you would like to do so before continuing on to create your seed phrase. </li><li>If you skipped the firmware update for now, then select “Create New Seed” on the Passport. </li><li>You will be asked if you want to generate a new seed phrase now, select the check mark. </li><li>You should see the Passport save the seed and then you will be notified that the new seed has been created and saved.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIyOTMxNDA2MDcxMTAz/seed_01.jpg" height="181" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><ul><li>Next, Passport will create an encrypted backup of your seed phrase and prepare to save it to the included micro SD card. Select the “&gt;” arrow.</li><li>Part of having an encrypted backup is having the code to decrypt it. Passport will generate this code and it will be required to to open your backup file in the future. Select the “&gt;” arrow. </li><li>Your Passport came with a perforated notecard, — on one side of the perforation is space to write down your seed words and, on the other side, is space to write down your code for the encrypted backup.

    </figure><p>Now you have an encrypted backup of your seed phrase to keep safe and secure in case you need to recover your wallet on another Passport in the future. Ensure that you keep the backup code safe and secure as well because it is required to decrypt your backup. The encrypted backup also includes all device settings, accounts, account labels, etc. You can see all of the details <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/2023/01/why-we-love-encrypted-microsd-backups/">here</a>. </p><p>Storing the micro SD card and the backup code in the same location kind of defeats the purpose, since if they are found then an adversary could steal your bitcoin.

    </figure><h2>Firmware</h2><p>Keeping the firmware up to date ensures that your Passport has the latest bug fixes, improvements, features and security patches. However, updating the firmware is not mandatory, your Passport will still work but just won't have any updates. </p><p>There are a few different ways to get the latest firmware, from the Foundation <a href="https://docs.foundationdevices.com/firmware-update">website</a>, from its <a href="https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-firmware">GitHub repository</a> or from the Envoy app. This guide will demonstrate the Envoy app method. </p><p>As a security precaution, the Passport will only install firmware signed by two out of four possible Foundation developer keys. Whichever method you choose, you will be saving the firmware file to the micro SD card and loading the update onto your Passport from there. This helps keep the device air gapped. </p><p>Make sure you have your micro SD card and included adaptor ready to plug into your mobile device. Also, you can always double check which firmware version your Passport has currently installed when you power the device on, it will show the firmware version number at the bottom of the screen during boot up. </p><ul><li>Insert the micro SD card into the appropriate adaptor for your mobile device. </li><li>Insert the adaptor into your mobile device.</li><li>A blue light should start flashing on the adaptor.</li><li>Open the Envoy app, you should see the latest firmware version number in the lower right-hand corner of the Passport card on the home screen. Press that firmware version number. </li><li>On the next screen, press “Continue” to confirm you want to update the firmware. </li><li>On the next screen press “Continue” to confirm you have connected the micro SD card. </li><li>Then Envoy will ask you where you would like to save the firmware. Navigate to the micro SD card folder location. </li><li>Then press “Save.” Be sure to give your Android device a moment to finish writing to the micro SD card. If you have issues with the firmware file not being written in its entirety, delete the damaged file from the micro SD card, save the firmware file again, then after pressing “Save,” manually eject the micro SD card from the notifications drop-down menu to force Android to flush to disk. </li><li>That should save the firmware file to your micro SD card and bring you back to the Envoy app. Press “Finished” to return to the homepage.&nbsp;</li></ul><section><figure>

The following section will compare the differences between the Passport Founder’s Edition and Passport Batch 2. Then the final section will demonstrate select advanced features. </p><h2>Comparing The Founder’s Edition And Batch 2</h2><p>The Passport Batch 2 offers many upgrades over the Passport Founder’s Edition. The following section describes these upgrades:</p><h3>Dimensions</h3><p>The Passport Founder’s Edition measures 100 millimeters (mm) long by 35 mm wide by 23 mm thick. The Passport Batch 2 measures 110 mm long by 39 mm wide by 19 mm thick.</p><section><figure>

The Passport Batch 2 features a micro SD card plus a USB-C port to charge the battery. The USB-C port is power-only and cannot transmit data. The micro SD card port in the Passport Batch 2 has more depth so that the micro SD card can be inserted further, whereas the micro SD card port on the Passport Founder’s Edition leaves roughly half of the micro SD card sticking out.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Keypads And Screens</h3><p>The keypads on both Passports are similar in that they both feature alphanumeric keys. However, the Passport Founder’s Edition keys have more of an oval shape and the keys on the Passport Batch 2 version have more of a rectangular shape. </p><p>The navigation keys on the Passport Batch 2 are copper in color, rectangular for the power and select controls, and square for the up/down/left/right controls. Whereas on the Passport Founder’s Edition, the power button shares the same key as the delete button. The key to the left of the up/down/left/right controls is dedicated to the shutdown function. The navigation controls on the Passport Founder’s Edition are more rounded in shape. </p><p>The screen on the Passport Batch 2 is a high-resolution, color, IPS display, bounded to ultra-strong glass. The display on the Passport Founder’s Edition has a plastic screen and it is not a color display. The brightness can be adjusted on both Passports. The display when measured diagonally is 43 mm on the Passport Founder’s Edition and 50 mm on the Passport Batch 2.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Batteries</h3><p>The Passport Batch 2 features a rechargeable and removable lithium-ion battery with a 1,200 milliamp hour (mAh) rating. The Passport Founder’s Edition features two AAA batteries. The lithium-ion battery has a much greater battery life and an industry standard form factor known as "BL-5C" and it can be obtained from many different online vendors for less than $10. Both Passports feature a removable magnetic back piece to quickly access the batteries.&nbsp;</p><section><figure>

    </figure><h3>Software</h3><p>Most of the menu options available on the Passport Founder’s Edition version 1.1.0 are also available on Passport Batch 2. Some of the folder configurations are a little different but most of the options are there with the exception of signing a text file. Passport Batch 2 also introduces extensions for Casa and Whirlpool, which add additional accounts in Passport that you can connect to. Both Passports can be connected to the Envoy app to make monitoring balances, generating receive addresses and building transactions easier. The next firmware release for the Founder’s Edition will be identical to the Batch 2 firmware. </p><p>This completes the comparisons section. In the next section, you will see how to use select features of the Passport. </p><h2>Passport And Whirlpool</h2><p>Whirlpool is a zero-link CoinJoin implementation supported by Samourai Wallet on Android mobile devices and by Sparrow Wallet on Linux, Mac and Windows desktops. Zero-link CoinJoin means that there are no deterministic links between the inputs and outputs of the CoinJoin transaction. Because multiple entities are involved with each CoinJoin, there cannot be any certainty as to which entity owns which transaction output. CoinJoins can be used as a technique to gain anonymity on a public blockchain, putting the decision to selectively reveal details about yourself back in your hands, thus giving you a layer of privacy separating your real-world identity from the transactions on a public ledger. </p><p>Passport supports Whirlpool accounts and this section will demonstrate how to setu p and use this feature on Bitcoin’s testnet. All the steps are the same for Bitcoin’s mainnet. There will be two wallets used in this demonstration; the first is Sparrow Wallet, acting as the hot wallet which is the wallet where the CoinJoin transactions will originate from, and the second is Passport, acting as the cold wallet where the outputs from the hot wallet CoinJoins will be deposited. </p><p>Using this technique offers a couple benefits. First, each deposit to the Passport will look like every other CoinJoin output to external observers on chain and, therefore, no one except for you will know that those unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are now in cold storage. So, as other CoinJoin participants continue mixing the other UTXOs from your CoinJoin transactions, the forward-looking anonymity set of your UTXOs in cold storage continues to grow. </p><p>Another benefit is that the Whirlpool account on Passport was designed in such a way that you can import it to a hot wallet at any time in the future and continue mixing those UTXOs as free-riders in Whirlpool, thus saving yourself from paying the coordinator fees a second time. Additionally, you won't pay any additional miners fees when importing this account to a hot wallet in the future as opposed to sweeping UTXOs. Understand, though, that importing the Whirlpool account to a hot wallet exposes the seed to an internet-connected device and therefore it is recommended to use a separate seed on your Passport for any accounts you plan on doing this with.</p><h3>Hot Wallet</h3><p>This guide assumes you have already installed Sparrow Wallet on your preferred desktop. If you haven't done so already, navigate to the <a href="https://www.sparrowwallet.com/download/">Sparrow download page</a> for detailed instructions. Consider your options for connecting to a public node, your own Bitcoin Core node or your own private Electrum server carefully. </p><p>Once you have your Sparrow Wallet application installed, open it and navigate to “File,” then “New Wallet”:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIyOTMwNjAwNzY0NzM1/whirlpool_01.png" height="441" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Then, name your new wallet and click on “Create Wallet”:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Next, you will have the opportunity to adjust a few settings. Unless you have a good reason to change these settings and you know exactly what you are doing, then it is probably a good idea to just leave the policy type, script type and script policy descriptor in their defaults, as demonstrated here. Then, click on “New or Imported Software Wallet”:</p><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 2 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/foundation-passport-bitcoin-wallet-guide">original article</a></em></div></section><p>You can add a passphrase or leave that field blank. This is kind of like having a 13th or 25th word added to your seed phrase that only you know. There is no way to recover a lost or forgotten passphrase and this will be necessary to access your bitcoin going forward if you decide to use it. </p><p>Make sure to write down your seed phrase words in order and keep them safe. Also write down your passphrase if you decided to use one. Consider keeping your seed phrase and passphrase separate from each other to help prevent loss of funds in the event that your secrets are discovered. Writing this information down in a notebook or stamping it into metal to protect it against environmental hazards are common ways that Bitcoiners keep their backups safe and secure. Anyone who gains access to this information will be able to steal your bitcoin, so make sure you keep it safe. Double checking your backup information is a good way to ensure you have copied it all down correctly. </p><p>Once you are ready, click on “Confirm Backup...,” then you will be asked if you have written this information down. When you click on “Re-enter Words…” you will then prove you have written your seed phrase down correctly by entering the words in order.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>A window will pop up and, if you have an SCODE for reduced coordinator fees, then you can enter it here. Then you can select your transaction priority or, in other words, the amount you are willing to spend on mining fees. Once you have these options set, click on “Next”:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIyOTMwODY5MDY4ODgz/whirlpool_19.png" height="442" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Then you can choose the pool size you want to join. There are four sizes to choose from, the 100,000 sat pool size was used in this demonstration which will create 20 UTXOs that are all 100,000 sats each. The coordinator fee for this is 5,000 sats. Click on “Preview Premix” once ready:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Then you will see a summary of the transaction you just constructed. This transaction is called "tx0" and you will notice that all of the selected inputs of various sizes and from various addresses are consumed in this transaction and 20 like-sized outputs are created. These like-sized outputs from tx0 will be used as eligible inputs to Whirlpool CoinJoin transactions. There are three other outputs in a tx0 as well; the coordinator fee, the toxic change and the miners’ fee. If everything looks good, then click on “Broadcast Premix Transaction”:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>From the deposit tab and the transactions sub-tab, you will be able to see that the bitcoin you deposited to this account has been sent out:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Then, if you click on the premix tab and the transactions sub-tab, you will see the bitcoin from your deposit account is now in your premix account:</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIyOTMxNDA1NzQzNDIz/whirlpool_24.png" height="443" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>So long as your wallet is connected to the internet, then your available like-sized outputs in your premix account will be registered as eligible inputs for the coordinator to use in CoinJoin rounds. As more participants add liquidity, more of your premix outputs will be CoinJoined. After going through a CoinJoin round, each UTXO will appear in your post-mix account, which you can view from the post-mix tab and the transactions sub-tab. So long as you leave your wallet open and connected, the UTXOs in your post-mix account will remain available as eligible inputs to CoinJoin rounds as free-riders, where they get mixed again and again with no added fees to you:</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The toxic change from tx0 is sent to your “badbank” account, which you can view from the badbank tab and transactions sub-tab. You want to be cautious about how you handle these outputs because they are linked on chain to any inputs used in the related tx0 they came from. For example, don't send some Whirlpool outputs and some toxic change to the same address because that would undo the anonymity benefits gained by using Whirlpool.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Cold Wallet</h3><p>Now that you have your hot wallet established and some bitcoin being CoinJoined in Whirlpool, you can set up the cold wallet extension on your Passport. This will be the account you are sending your CoinJoined outputs to for long-term cold storage. Using a separate seed from your primary cold storage seed for this process is recommended. If you want to import it to a hot wallet at any time in the future and continue mixing those UTXOs as free-riders, it will expose the seed to an internet connected device.</p><ul><li>Power on your Passport and log into it.</li><li>From the main menu, navigate to “Extensions.”</li><li>Then toggle on “Postmix.”</li><li>With the right arrow control, navigate over to the newly-added post-mix account and scroll down to “Connect Wallet.”</li></ul><figure>

into assets with $Cashtags, in addition to expanding the number of financial assets that users can see real-time prices for when using the feature. Currently users can see live price charts for a select few financial assets. After the eToro partnership, the list of $Cashtags that produce live price charts will be “hugely expanded,” according to a <a href="https://www.etoro.com/news-and-analysis/press-releases/etoro-partners-with-twitter-cashtags-to-further-financial-education/">press release</a>, while users will also be able to click through to the eToro platform to see more information on the asset and have the option to invest. The partnership will cover $Cashtags representing a wide range of instruments on the eToro platform, including Bitcoin.</p><p>Twitter added pricing data for $Cashtags in December 2022 and the feature has since seen widespread adoption with more than 420 million searches for $Cashtags since the start of the year, according to the press release. On average, the release says, there are 4.7 million $Cashtag searches a day with activity increasing around prominent earnings announcements. The most commonly used $Cashtag was $TSLA (Tesla), with $BTC (bitcoin) ranking in the top five.</p><p>Yoni Assia, CEO and co-founder of eToro, said, "Financial content on social media has provided education to many who have felt excluded by more traditional channels. Twitter has become a crucial part of the retail investing community — it’s where millions of ordinary investors go every day to access financial news, share knowledge and converse.”</p><p>"We believe real change starts with conversation and finance and investing is a growing part of that conversation,” said Chris Riedy, vice president, global sales and marketing at Twitter. “We are pleased to partner with eToro to provide Twitter users with additional market insights and greater access to investment capabilities. Twitter will continue to invest in growing the #FinTwitter community."</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMjI5NzEy/markets-price-chart.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin Policy UK Launches With Goal Of Capturing Bitcoin’s Opportunity For The UK]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin-focused policy group aims to educate policymakers on the benefits Bitcoin can provide.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-policy-uk-launches-with-aim-to-educate-policymakers</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/bitcoin-policy-uk-launches-with-aim-to-educate-policymakers</guid><category><![CDATA[Legislation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Policy]]></category><category><![CDATA[UK]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 16:59:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyNTM3MTYyODg3OTk2OTY0/individual-challenge-climb-peak-flag-mountain-top-photo.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The Bitcoin-focused policy group aims to educate policymakers on the benefits Bitcoin can provide.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Bitcoin Policy UK has launched with the stated aim of unlocking the potential of Bitcoin for the UK economy. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, The organization seeks to unite diverse stakeholders, such as policymakers, environmentalists, businesses, energy producers and Bitcoin experts, to explore how Bitcoin can benefit UK households, businesses and communities. The ultimate goal, according to the release, is to attract investments to the UK, generate jobs and drive new industries while tapping into wasted and stranded energy resources.</p><p>According to co-founder Krista Edmunds, "The UK has an immense opportunity to become one of the first jurisdictions globally to embrace Bitcoin.

    </figure><p>A new reference implementation (SRI) update for Stratum v2 has been announced by developers of the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new update is “a major milestone in democratizing transaction selections in pooled mining and decentralizing bitcoin,” as it allows miners to select transactions via a new sub-protocol and their node.<br><br>The developers are inviting miners, pools, firmware makers and the community to test the new implementation using the <a href="https://stratumprotocol.org/getting-started/#config-d-sv1-firmware--translation-proxy-jn-job-negotiator--sv2-pool">getting starting guide</a> they’ve put together, with CPU or actual mining devices. They also invite users’ feedback after testing using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1is27h37PtsXtXC9zSbweNfxcyEtHzATjdJphIy8hArw/">this form</a>.</p><p>It is recommended that new users test the software using SV1 mining devices by connecting to an SV2 pool via Translation Proxy. “Miners will run their own template provider (bitcoind) with the max fee policy,” the release describes. “Within the translation proxy sits a Job Negotiator that runs a sub-protocol responsible for distributing miner’s templates to the pool.”</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIzMTI4MTY4OTMyNjcx/image1.png" height="714" width="620">
        
        
        <figcaption><em>“Configuration allows mining devices running SV1 firmware to connect to an SV2 pool, and select their transactions locally via the Template Provider, further sending them to the pool via the Job Negotiator.”</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>The press release describes how the Job Negotiator “in combination with a template provider, gives the responsibility back to miners or an independent third party to provide a new template (select transactions), thereby making bitcoin pool infrastructure more decentralized.”</p><p>According to the description of <a href="https://youtu.be/nOIAhRVCThs">how a Job Negotiator (JN) works</a>, the downstream mining farm runs a JN that connects to a JN run by the pool, and requests a unique identifier for mining jobs using the AllocateMiningJobToken message. The pool sends back a unique token and a coinbase output used for payouts. The downstream JN then connects to a template provider, which sends a new template and SetNewPrevHash to the downstream JN. With these, a new job can be constructed and the downstream JN sends a CommitMiningJob message containing a proposed set of transactions to the pool. The pool always accepts the miner's proposal in the current iteration, but in the next release, miners will have the ability to fall back to a different pool or solo mine if the pool fails to accept transactions selected by the downstream's template provider. The Translation Proxy then sends a SetCustomMiningJob message to the pool, which verifies the work and sends back a SetCustomMiningJobSuccess message. The Translation Proxy then translates the message and sends the mining.notify message to mining devices, which submit shares to the pool through the Translation Proxy.<br><br>With the current industry-adopted mining protocol Stratum V1, the handful of mining pools participates in transaction selection, which makes bitcoin more prone to <a href="https://youtu.be/tFAC04jMUbU">censorship</a>. Stratum v2 is an updated protocol, which ensures that transaction selection is done by miners themselves. </p><p>The community has already tested the software on several popular mining devices; the press release encourages anyone who tests on different platforms to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1is27h37PtsXtXC9zSbweNfxcyEtHzATjdJphIy8hArw/https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1is27h37PtsXtXC9zSbweNfxcyEtHzATjdJphIy8hArw/">fill a form out</a>.</p><p>“With the next update,” the press release says, “we will add a fallback functionality that would allow miners to fall back to a different pool or solo mine in case the pool chooses not to accept their suggestion. Miners would, in that case, disconnect and fall back.”</p><p>Other updates include the aim to improve encryption and ensure compliance with the latest spec updates, in addition to plans to enable pools to perform spot-checks on block validity. The most significant development will be submitting a pull request for the template provider in Bitcoin Core.</p><p>The developers thank the Stratum v2 <a href="https://opensats.org/projects/stratumv2">crowdfunding</a> supporters and include a link to their <a href="https://discord.gg/UHckbC7x58">Discord</a> for those interested in being involved in the community.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzODM5Njc4ODI5MzcyOTEy/network-nodes.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk3MjIzMTI4MTY4OTMyNjcx/image1.png" height="714" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘A Better World Through Financial Freedom’: Why Preston Pysh Is Bullish On Bitcoin 2023]]></title><description><![CDATA[For Preston Pysh, the Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami is a chance to showcase a solution for the crumbling global financial system.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/preston-pysh-is-bullish-on-bitcoin-2023</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/preston-pysh-is-bullish-on-bitcoin-2023</guid><category><![CDATA[Feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Freedom]]></category><category><![CDATA[preston pysh]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin 2023]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Peter Chawaga]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 13:52:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3MjIxODg3NzI4NjkwMjU5/preston-pyshbitcoin-2022.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">For Preston Pysh, the Bitcoin 2023 event in Miami is a chance to showcase a solution for the crumbling global financial system.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p>As part of an investment-focused podcast that recently <a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonPysh/status/1586126918881275904">surpassed 100 million downloads</a>, Preston Pysh describes the basics of Bitcoin and explores its investment case, distilling some of the most prescient aspects of the technology for listeners who might not realize how important it is. He has a knack for hosting the most knowledgeable guests to break down the most pressing topics. </p><p>For instance, Pysh has released recent episodes describing Texas’ evolving Bitcoin mining policy with <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/bitcoin-is-a-strategic-national-necessity-pierre-rochard/">Pierre Rochard</a>, one exploring the state of the legacy financial system with <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/legacy-banking-system-alf-peccatiello/">Alf Peccatiello</a> and one explaining decentralized social media platform Nostr with developer <a href="https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/bitcoin-fundamentals/nostr-decentralized-social-media-william-casarin/">William Casarin</a>.</p><p>Pysh consistently hosts timely, in-depth conversations with insightful guests, producing one of the best outlets for exploring how Bitcoin is changing our world. Now, he’ll be bringing that insight to the stage at Bitcoin 2023, where his combination of traditional investment expertise and holistic understanding of Bitcoin’s implications will grapple with a global financial environment that seems to be spinning out of control.</p><p>“I suspect one of the hot topics that will be discussed is the central banks’ inability to get inflation under control and what that means for Bitcoin,” Pysh said in an interview with Bitcoin Magazine. “It seems like OPEC+ and BRICS nations are trying to exercise their control of energy production and distribution in the face of western central bank policies that attempt to control interest rates and sanctions. I expect this situation to get really intense in the second and third quarters of 2023 and the knock-on effect is going to demonstrate the lack of control that policymakers have over the price of fiat currency.”</p><p>While such a precarious economic situation is wreaking havoc in the form of wealth debasement and uncertainty across the world, Pysh remains optimistic about bitcoin the asset as a solution and bullish about its path for 2023.</p><p>“Bitcoin’s long-term HODLers display a level of conviction I’ve rarely witnessed in any other asset class,” he explained. “As central bank policies grow increasingly manipulative, I anticipate that by the end of 2023, we’ll witness these institutions lose a degree of control, injecting an unprecedented volume of fiat currency into the global economy. Consequently, I expect bitcoin to thrive and yield substantial gains relative to any other asset class as the year draws to a close.”</p><p>Perspective on the technical advancements of Bitcoin and their implications, in addition to his well-demonstrated expertise on more traditional finance, is what makes Pysh such a unique and powerful advocate. And it is with this perspective that he highlighted the progress made with one project in particular since the Bitcoin 2022 event.</p><p>“Since the last conference, I am thrilled by the ongoing developments in the Bitcoin community, particularly those related to Fediments, or ‘Federated Mints,’” Pysh reflected. “These implementations operate with a federation of guardians to manage funds, rather than a centralized entity, and integrate seamlessly with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network… The impressive progress on this front has been made amid bitcoin price dips, demonstrating the ingenuity and unwavering commitment of the Bitcoin community in driving substantial software infrastructure development and other essential building blocks.”</p><p>Like Pysh’s podcast, the Bitcoin Conference is designed to showcase the most insightful voices on any and every front of this monetary, technical revolution. It is a place where problems are exposed and a foundational solution is explored. For Pysh, Bitcoin 2023 will be the chance to do what he does best as a content creator: discourse with the brightest minds on earth and help others learn from them as he does.</p><p>“These gatherings offer a chance to unite with individuals who share a profound understanding and appreciation for a better world through financial freedom and empowerment,” he concluded. “All of the panel discussions are thought provoking and important for my own personal growth. Not to mention, how can you not love Miami?”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk3MjIxODg3NzI4NjkwMjU5/preston-pyshbitcoin-2022.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take It Easy, Man: The Philosophies Behind Bitcoin And ‘The Big Lebowski’]]></title><description><![CDATA[Dudeism, a philosophy inspired by “The Big Lebowski,” shares some core tenants that should intrigue Bitcoiners.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-big-lebowski-philosophy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-and-the-big-lebowski-philosophy</guid><category><![CDATA[religion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movie]]></category><category><![CDATA[philosophy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Taoism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hongumart]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5OTM5OTMwMzk3NDE5MjYy/guy-fawkes-zen-meditation-calm.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">Dudeism, a philosophy inspired by “The Big Lebowski,” shares some core tenants that should intrigue Bitcoiners.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Hongumart, a frontline healthcare worker.</em></p><p>Inspired by The Dude, the main character of the 1998 movie “The Big Lebowski” by the Coen Brothers, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dudeism">Dudeism</a> is a way of life, philosophy and religion. The main goal of Dudeism is to apply a modern version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism">Taoism</a>, an ancient Chinese teaching attributed to Laozi (rising to prominence in the 6th century), combined with ideas from the Greek thinker <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicurus">Epicurus</a> (who lived form 341 to 270 BC), in a manner that reflects the personality of Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski from the film. </p><p>Dudeism emphasized the practices of relaxing, keeping calm and taking it easy when faced with life's challenges, guided by a belief that this is the best way to live in harmony with ourselves and others. </p><p>Bitcoin is a digital currency that operates on a peer-to-peer network without relying on any intermediary or authority. It was created by an unknown person or group that used the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. The main idea behind Bitcoin is to enable online payments that are direct, secure and independent of any financial institution. Bitcoin is the most popular and widely-used cryptocurrency in the world. It has inspired many other cryptocurrencies that offer different features or use cases. Bitcoin's value and adoption have fluctuated over time, depending on various factors such as regulation, innovation, competition and market sentiment. </p><p>Bitcoin and Dudeism are two seemingly unrelated phenomena, but they share some surprising similarities: </p><ul><li>Both are decentralized and operate peer to peer: Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that operates without a central authority or intermediary, relying on a network of nodes to validate transactions and maintain consensus. Dudeism is a religion that rejects dogma and hierarchy, encouraging its followers to find their own paths and to live in harmony with themselves and others. </li><li>Both are inspired by cult movies: Bitcoin was created by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, which, by my estimation, could be a reference to the character Toshiro Mifune in the film “Yojimbo.” As noted above, Dudeism is based on the philosophy of the protagonist of “The Big Lebowski,” who embodies the principles of Taoism and Zen Buddhism. </li><li>Both are adaptable and resilient: Bitcoin is designed to be flexible and scalable, allowing for innovation and improvement through forks and upgrades. Dudeism is open to interpretation and integration, allowing for diversity and creativity among its adherents.</li><li>Both are countercultural and revolutionary: Bitcoin challenges the status quo of the traditional financial system, offering an alternative that is more transparent, democratic and inclusive. Dudeism challenges the norms of the modern society, offering a lifestyle that is more relaxed, authentic and peaceful. </li></ul><p>Dudeism and Bitcoin also share some similarities in their underlying principles and values. Both are inspired by ancient philosophies that emphasize simplicity, harmony and freedom. Both are also based on decentralized systems that do not rely on any external authority or intermediary. Both aim to provide alternatives to the conventional ways of living and transacting that are often seen as stressful, complicated and oppressive. Both also have a loyal and passionate community of followers who identify with their respective ethos and cultures. </p><p>These are just some of the similarities between Bitcoin and Dudeism. Perhaps they are not so different after all. Maybe they are both ways of abiding by the same universal truth: that nothing is fixed (except the bitcoin supply), everything flows and we should just take it easy, man.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Hongumart.

    </figure><p>Block’s <a href="https://www.tbd.website/">TBD</a>, a Bitcoin-focused developer platform, has partnered with <a href="https://yellowcard.io/">Yellow Card</a> to unlock a network of fiat on- and off-ramps and payments via Bitcoin in 16 African countries. This aims to make cross-border payments and liquidity exchanges more accessible and affordable, and provide compliant cross-border payments and fiat off-ramps, according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine. Yellow Card will be a launch partner for the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorseys-tbd-presents-bitcoin-based-decentralized-web5">Web5</a> protocol and the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorsey-square-decentralized-bitcoin-exchange-proposal-announced-tbdex">tbDEX</a> liquidity network. </p><p>Currently, cross-border payments in Africa can incur fees of almost 10% and take several days to clear using available systems. In March 2023, TBD and Yellow Card conducted a successful proof of concept for payment rails from the U.S. to Ghana, Nigeria and Kenya, in real time. Senders can initiate remittances in USD, while recipients can receive local fiat currency into bank accounts or mobile money wallets, such as M-PESA and MTN. TBD converts the USD into Bitcoin or stablecoins and facilitates the exchange between digital assets and local fiat currencies.</p><p>Alternatively, recipients can opt to hold their value in Bitcoin or USD stablecoins, which is “particularly valuable if they live in regions impacted by local currency volatility or hyperinflation,” the press release describes. TBD's next goal is to establish decentralized identity, trust and transaction protocols that enable a ubiquity of decentralized and trusted exchanges to occur.</p><p>Yellow Card will be one of TBD’s first partners to enable global payments and fiat off-ramps for end consumers to send USD or Bitcoin and receive payments in local fiat currencies. TBD provides APIs and developer services that make it easy for app developers to embed functionality that enables these transactions to happen in real-time for their end consumers. The partnership is part of Block's vision of developing global on- and off-ramps, with the goal of enabling the mainstream adoption of Bitcoin in commercial and financial applications at scale.</p><p>"We're thrilled to work with TBD and the Block team on tbDEX and their global payments initiatives,” said Chris Maurice, CEO and co-founder of Yellow Card. "The international payments space, especially in Africa, is in dire need of the innovative solutions we are building together, and this is the culmination of the vision behind Block’s initial investment in Yellow Card in 2021."</p><p>“We’re focused on advancing Block’s purpose of economic empowerment by breaking down the barriers to financial access across the Global South,” commented Emily Chiu, TBD co-founder and COO. “For TBD, this starts with driving more affordable cross-border payments and commerce to bring us closer to a more efficient and inclusive global economy. Yellow Card’s shared passion and expertise across the African continent makes them a partner we’re excited to accomplish this with.”</p><p>Wallets, fintech applications or liquidity platforms looking to connect with TBD are encouraged to contact partnerships@tbd.email.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NDg4MTA1ODc5ODA3NDkz/africa-bitcoin-technology.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Leading The Bitcoin Revolution, El Salvador Should Launch A Citizenship By Investment Program]]></title><description><![CDATA[El Salvador’s focus on Bitcoin makes it a natural destination for a citizenship by investment (CBI) program, drawing more sovereign individuals.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-citizenship-by-investment</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-citizenship-by-investment</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[el salvador]]></category><category><![CDATA[passport]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Citizenship]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Katie The Russian]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMTIzMjE5MDQwMjgxODU2/20220905_better-bitcoin-after-bukele---jeremy-from-escape-to-el-salvador.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">El Salvador’s focus on Bitcoin makes it a natural destination for a citizenship by investment (CBI) program, drawing more sovereign individuals.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

    </figure><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Katie The Russian, CEO of Plan B Passport.</em></p><p>It’s been almost two years since<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-to-declare-bitcoin-as-legal-tender"> the announcement that El Salvador would make bitcoin legal tender</a>. Since then, the government of El Salvador, led by President Nayib Bukele, has taken many more steps to attract capital to the country — offering <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2023-03-23/el-salvador-president-readies-bill-to-eliminate-taxes-on-tech">favorable tax policies, streamlining business regulations</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-one-year-later">generally developing a more positive reputation</a>.</p><p>But can El Salvador go even further and launch a citizenship by investment (CBI) program? </p><p>For those who don’t know, a CBI program allows capitalism to be applied to a government service. In this case, individuals can donate or invest money in the nation’s economy and, in return, they receive a passport for that nation.</p><h2>The Risks Of Running CBI Programs</h2><p>El Salvador definitely has the legal authority to operate a CBI program, however, launching one can potentially open up a can of worms that it would have to deal with. While leading the way in the Bitcoin revolution has earned it the respect of Bitcoiners, some groups, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, see El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption as a threat and have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-60135552">publicly expressed their concerns</a>. The same could be true for a CBI program.</p><p>El Salvador's passport is already powerful, providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to <a href="https://visaindex.com/country/el-salvador-passport-ranking/">about 150 countries</a>, including the EU, the U.K., all of Latin America and most of Eastern Europe. However, all of these relationships could be at risk if a CBI program causes concerns within the countries that have treaties with El Salvador. <br><br>Pressure from political allies has pushed previously-popular investment migration options, such as those in <a href="https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/cyprus-ends-citizenship-investment-program/">Cyprus</a>, <a href="https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/malta-citizenship-by-investment-changes/">Malta</a> and <a href="https://www.globalcitizensolutions.com/portugal-golden-visa-changes/">Portugal</a>, to re-think their offerings. As a result, these countries missed unique opportunities to serve as pioneers and create fully-integrated, customer-centric instruments.</p><h2>What A CBI Program Could Mean For El Salvador</h2><p>Now, El Salvador has the opportunity to completely disrupt the CBI market. </p><p>If done right, the country could become the preferred choice among wealthy migrants who view themselves as sovereign individuals. If done well, it also presents the opportunity to orange pill a great deal of high-net-worth individuals globally.</p><p>El Salvador stands to lead the way in a new era of citizen-government relationships, where citizens are treated as customers and governments are treated as service providers. And, luckily for El Salvador, this isn’t the first time a CBI program has been done. For instance, some Caribbean islands that are leading the CBI industry provide insightful data. <br><br>Based on some publicly-available information I’ve accessed and my personal experience in the industry, the combined revenue from the CBI programs of Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia contributed about $2.5 billion for the region in 2022 alone.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that the populations of all of those islands combined is only 10% of the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/el-salvador-population/">population of El Salvador</a>. </p><p>A similar CBI revenue would add more than 7% to <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=SV">El Salvador’s GDP</a>.<br><br>But would there be demand for such a program, coming from a Latin American country? </p><p>At Plan B Passport, we have seen a large amount of requests about this specific jurisdiction, which is not a surprise, considering that we cater specifically to Bitcoiners and that there are multiple factors that bring this community’s attention to El Salvador. <br><br>Of course, the tax regime and regulatory environments for businesses are a top priority, however, a country’s political stance plays a huge role in a Bitcoiners’ decision making process as well.</p><p>El Salvador is perfectly positioned across all of these factors and its president is boldly <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1571250107500175362?lang=en">taking a stance against</a> the World Economic Forum’s (WEF’s) 2030 agenda of “<a href="https://twitter.com/wef/status/808328302213689344?lang=en">you will own nothing and be happy</a>.” The geographical location of El Salvador is also increasing the value of its passport. Unlike the Caribbeans, it’s not an island and it allows access by land while also allowing access by water. </p><h2>What Should El Salvador’s CBI Program Look Like?</h2><p>If the program is implemented correctly, El Salvador will win a lot of business over the Caribbean CBI options. Considering the similarities between the power of El Salvador’s passport and the countries where CBI programs currently exist, it would make sense to establish the pricing close to what the market currently offers. </p><p>To give you some examples:</p><ul><li>Saint Kitts currently requires a $125,000 donation for a single applicant, or a $200,000 investment for government-approved properties, or a $400,000 investment into any real estate. </li><li>Saint Lucia requires a $100,000 donation for a single applicant. </li></ul><p>And let me clarify: Families that apply together do not have to donate that amount per each family member, but rather, the main applicant applies with dependents.<br><br>As a CBI service provider, we’ve noticed there are many roadblocks that clients run into. Solving those would benefit El Salvador’s CBI in favor of existing CBIs.</p><h3>Proof Of Funds</h3><p>Leading the way in transitioning from traditional finance toward a better monetary system, El Salvador can offer the first CBI program to officially accept self-custodied bitcoin holdings as proof of funds. This can be done easily with a “signing a message” process to confirm ownership of BTC conducted by the applicant, but I have yet to succeed in explaining it to Caribbean CBI representatives.</p><h3>Payment Method</h3><p>El Salvador can also be the first jurisdiction to accept bitcoin directly for donation and bond investment options. Currently, CBI applicants have to utilize traditional financial assets to transfer funds. Some jurisdictions allow intermediaries, however, it will cost an applicant 5% conversion fees. <br><br>We ran a poll within Plan B passport email subscribers and got some interesting data around this. When it comes to payment methods, our audience indicated the following preferences:</p><ul><li>USDT: 6%</li><li>USD (via bank transfer): 9%</li><li>BTC: 37%</li><li>Any: 48%</li></ul><p>We also asked what investment options the audience would want to see:</p><ul><li>Real estate investment: 39%</li><li><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/el-salvador-submits-bitcoin-bond-bill">Volcano bond</a>: 42%</li><li>Non-refundable donation: 19%</li></ul><h3>Additional Investment Options</h3><p>Of course, we’ve already heard about the volcano bonds, which would be the first bitcoin-denominated bond option to ever exist. Also, seeing Bukele make moves toward incentivizing tech companies to headquarter and incorporate in El Salvador reminds us of <a href="https://www.imidaily.com/editors-picks/armenian-govt-unveils-decision-to-offer-citizenship-for-150000-investment-in-property-bonds-shares-funds-and-more/">Armenia’s “golden visa,”</a> and this definitely puts the right motivations in place for investors. <br><br>For example, Armenia grants a golden visa to those who establish an IT business with a $1,000,000 capitalization or establish a venture capital firm with $80,000,000 in assets.</p><p>El Salvador could direct capital toward innovation by implementing such options into a CBI program.</p><h2>A CBI Program In Bitcoin Country</h2><p>Bitcoin enthusiasts also see CBI programs as ways to bring power back to the individual. These programs are seen as a form of pure capitalism applied to government services, allowing individuals to choose their "state service provider" based on the price and services offered, and take their funds with them. With competition between nation states for capital and talent on the rise, the mobility of capital and people has the potential to transform the way we think about citizenship and national identity, and CBI programs may be at the forefront of this transformation.<br><br>Allow me to remind you that throughout 2021 to 2023, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_in_El_Salvador">El Salvador’s government continuously purchased bitcoin</a> and put it on the country's balance sheet and, as of July 2022, it was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/el-salvador-buys-the-dip-adds-80-btc-to-treasury">holding 2,381 bitcoin</a>. Launching the CBI program could be yet another opportunity for the country to acquire more bitcoin.<br><br>While a CBI program could be a productive move for El Salvador, it is not without risks. However, with a powerful passport, favorable tax policies, a positive reputation and support from Bitcoin enthusiasts, El Salvador is well positioned to attract foreign investment and talent. If done correctly, a CBI program could be the next step in its transformation, bringing power back to the individual and changing the way we think about citizenship and national identity.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Katie The Russian.

    </figure><p>Developers are exploring the use of hierarchical channels to help speed up and make the Lightning Network (LN) more scalable. <a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2023-March/003886.html">Hierarchical channels</a> allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels, enabling quick and cheap resizing, without on-chain transactions which add delays and costs. In contrast, resizing channels on-chain can cause delays of several months and increases fees. The current proposals for resizing channels off-chain involve creating a channel factory or CoinPool and exchanging capacity between channels within the same factory or pool. Hierarchical channels allow for flexible off-chain resizing of channels without requiring an exchange of capacity within a limited pool of users. The hierarchical channels enable the creation of a two-party channel with two main outputs, one per party, plus zero or more Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC) outputs.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Each output from a hierarchical channel funds another channel that can be viewed as the root of an off-chain tree of outputs where the leaves are owned by single users. The parties can use a hashed timelock contract (HTLC) to exchange bitcoin, linking their HTLC to HTLCs in other (potentially hierarchical) channels, thus making payments over the LN.</p><p>With hierarchical channels, developers are proposing to solve two problems. Firstly, it allows for flexible resizing, near-instantly and off-chain, which is similar to the Lightning Network’s aim of allowing for near-instant off-chain payments. Secondly, hierarchical channels could be used by casual users who can send and receive bitcoin in a watchtower-free manner while the dedicated users can use all of their channel capacity to route payments, even while the casual user is inactive. Hierarchical channels would enable casual users to operate in a watchtower-free manner without stranding any capital.</p><p>The implementation of hierarchical channels could help overcome one of the biggest limitations of the Lightning Network, which is its scalability. It is expected that hierarchical channels would provide the necessary support for efficient Lightning Network payments without introducing additional delays, adding costs, and limiting scalability. The development of hierarchical channels does not require any changes to the underlying Bitcoin protocol.</p><p>Developers are proposing that hierarchical channels are an effective way of enabling flexible and off-chain resizing of channels within the Lightning Network.

    </figure><p><a href="http://spiral.xyz/">Spiral</a>, the Bitcoin-focused subsidiary of Block, has released its quarterly update. The projects Spiral has launched have released new updates and features for various products, including Lightning Development Kit (LDK), Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), Bitcoin Design Community and Bitcoin Product Community. <br><br>The <a href="https://spiral.xyz/blog/spiral-quarterly-update-q2-2023/">update</a> described how the Lightning Development Kit's LDK Node implementation aims to simplify the full suite of LDK APIs, allowing for an easier payment experience for users. Conor Okus, one of LDK Node's creators, shared a sneak peek of the technology during the Advancing Bitcoin 2023 conference in London. At the end of the workshop, all 30 attendees built a Lightning Wallet from scratch and made a successful payment.</p><p>On the other hand, the Bitcoin Development Kit saw a big milestone with the tagging of its 1.0 alpha release. This release included the new 1.0 framework and integration testing while APIs and internals are still under active development. This quarter, Kotlin, Swift, and Python language bindings can now broadcast raw transactions, create descriptors for BIP44/49/84 templates, access blockchain fee estimation and see more transaction and address info.</p><p>The Bitcoin Design Community has adopted Nostr Nets for community calls, and they also recently switched from Slack to Discord, though their Slack is still active. The community has also started a new series called Merchant Product Review, which analyzes bitcoin products and tools for merchants. They went deep on Tiankii, a merchant platform for El Salvadorians, along with the POS terminal functional on Breez.</p><p>Lastly, the Bitcoin Product Community was launched this quarter to encourage product managers to shepherd bitcoin projects from inception to completion. They held a Twitter Space to announce the community's formation and what to expect from it.</p><p>Developers Alekos Filini and Daniela Brozzoni announced their new hack.bs hacker space in Brescia, Italy. They teamed up with BitGeneration to bring bitcoin education to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitgeneration-is-bringing-bitcoin-education-to-italian-high-schools">Italian high school students</a> via talks and the BDK-based training wallet Padawan. Speaking of, this quarter, Thunderbiscuit listed Padawan on the Google Play store. Rajarshi Maitra hosted a "Mastering Bitcoin" cohort through his Bitshala initiative, and Vlad Kwasi published an article in Forbes about using bitcoin in Africa without Internet access.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2NDMxNzI4/bitcoin-painting-orange.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark To Nearly Double Bitcoin Mining Capacity With $144.9M Antminer Purchase]]></title><description><![CDATA[The public mining company has purchased 45,000 Antminer S19 XP miners in line with its goal of reaching 16 EH/s by end of year.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-to-nearly-double-bitcoin-mining-capacity</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-to-nearly-double-bitcoin-mining-capacity</guid><category><![CDATA[Antminer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxODU2NTUw/img_4392.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The public mining company has purchased 45,000 Antminer S19 XP miners in line with its goal of reaching 16 EH/s by end of year.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

The company expects all units to be delivered by the manufacturer by the end of September, with a 95% increase in computing power once deployed according to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.</p><p>CleanSpark has approximately 15.9 EH/s of machines on hand or under contract for delivery this year, edging closer to its year-end guidance of 16 EH/s. The company will deploy all of the acquired units at its bitcoin mining facility in Sandersville, Georgia, which is currently undergoing a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-buys-bitcoin-mining-facility-from-mawson-infrastructure">planned 150 MW expansion</a>. The machines will be deployed in multiple batches as they arrive on site and new rack-space becomes available, with all machines expected to be fully operational before year-end.</p><p>Zach Bradford, CEO of CleanSpark, stated, “As bitcoin’s halving draws closer, our focus on operational efficiency, our technical expertise, and our treasury management strategy, will all play a crucial role in solidifying CleanSpark’s position among the top bitcoin mining companies in America.” Gary Vecchiarelli, CleanSpark’s CFO, added, “Securing XPs at these prices means we have one less variable in our capital expenditure equation and puts us well on our way to achieving our year-end guidance of 16 EH/s.”</p><p>According to the press release, CleanSpark predominantly mines bitcoin with low-carbon energy sources, which account for over 90% of its energy mix, and the company follows what it describes as a “balanced capital management strategy” by selling some of its mined bitcoin to reinvest in growth. </p><p>This most recent miner purchase is in addition to a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-acquires-20000-bitcoin-miners">20,000 machine purchase</a> announced in February, with those machines fully paid for and in the process of being delivered to the company’s Washington facility. They are expected to be energized later this quarter, according to the press release, adding an additional 2.44 EH/s of machines to CleanSpark’s operational hashrate.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxODU2NTUw/img_4392.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk2NDE0NDk3MjI3ODEwMjkw/bitcoin-2023-website-article-banner.png" height="88" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pocket Bitcoin Announces Acquisition Of Bitcoin Wallet App Bitkipi]]></title><description><![CDATA[The acquisition means Pocket Bitcoin now has its own in-house wallet app for users looking to buy bitcoin using the service.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/pocket-bitcoin-acquires-bitcoin-wallet-app-bitkipi</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/pocket-bitcoin-acquires-bitcoin-wallet-app-bitkipi</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Acquisition]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchange]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMDc2OTYwOTgwNDQ0NTI2/handshake-spending-transaction.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="subtitle">The acquisition means Pocket Bitcoin now has its own in-house wallet app for users looking to buy bitcoin using the service.</p><!-- tml-version="2" --><figure>

This open letter follows a private appeal submitted via your office in March. We write as concerned Texas citizens who are independent and do not represent any company or lobby.</p><p>From the outside looking in, you seem to be a proud Texan who fights for the rights of all Texans, promoting liberty and freedom consistent with Texan values. SB 1751 is a notable departure, at least in critical aspects, from your past track record. It is misinformed, discriminatory, anti-competitive, harmful to the interests of grid stability, bad for consumers and a strategic setback for Texas.</p><p>For context, the bill concerns “virtual currency” mining and demand response. It seeks to limit the ability of bitcoin miners to participate in compensatory ERCOT programs, which incentivize load reduction, to 10% across all bitcoin miners in total. Prior to sponsoring SB 1751, it is unclear whether you engaged in discussions with bitcoin miners to better understand the matter or expressed any opinions on bitcoin or bitcoin mining at all. It is also unclear whether special interests lobbied for this bill, given you do not appear to have previously taken any positions on bitcoin, but on the merits alone, SB 1751 is problematic.</p><h2>Misinformed</h2><p>The bill concerns “virtual currency mining as demand response.” Really at issue is bitcoin, not “virtual currency” broadly. There are no miners of any currency other than bitcoin that could be of note participating in demand response programs or promoting grid reliability. Bitcoin is also definitionally not comparable to any other currency, and it is not virtual. Bitcoin is not “crypto”. Bitcoin is bitcoin, and if bitcoin is at the heart of your bill, a better understanding before legislating would be beneficial.</p><p>Bitcoin is a form of money with a fixed supply, which is global and permissionless. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. That is the basis of its value to the world. As was apparent from a recent tweet, you seem to recognize that inflation is a problem. Inflation is not a political phenomenon. Money is created by the Federal Reserve (“Fed”). The Fed has increased the money supply <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WTFSRFA?ref=bitcoiner.ghost.io">by $8 trillion</a>, or 8x since the Great Financial Crisis, which causes inflation and destroys savings. Bitcoin is designed to fix the problem of money printing, but nothing of value comes without cost. Bitcoin’s 21 million fixed supply is secured by energy, specifically power. In short, energy innovation has always been strategic to Texas. Energy is strategic to bitcoin and bitcoin will become increasingly strategic to Texas as a result. However, it is not just about power generation and demand. It is about the problems of printing money, which undermine the interests of all Texans and the state of Texas.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/loiskolkhorst/status/1528895479479934976"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>Texas is a leader in energy and all Texans need a form of money that the government cannot print out of thin air and at no cost. Texas power is securing the bitcoin network, which not only promotes grid stability and creates jobs and economic development, but it also secures the interests of all Texans, even those who do not yet use bitcoin as a superior form of money. We would be happy to hear your concerns and discuss this in more detail if it would be valuable.</p><h2>Discriminatory</h2><p>SB 1751 singles out bitcoin miners from all other industries. Setting everything else aside, this is discriminatory and creates an unlevel playing field. While other sources of demand have been identified as critical infrastructure, no other industry, including battery operators, have been restricted. Why bitcoin mining?</p><h2>Anti-Competitive</h2><p>Bitcoin miners compete in various ancillary services which ERCOT uses to compensate flexible loads to ensure grid stability. The entrant of bitcoin miners has made the bidding process more competitive, reducing prices. Restricting the ability of bitcoin miners to participate is anti-competitive and will result in marginally less participation in ancillary services by bitcoin miners which will marginally increase cost for ERCOT to achieve its reliability mandate.</p><h2>Harmful To Grid Stability</h2><p>SB 1751 disincentivizes bitcoin miners from participating in ancillary services, which promote grid stability. More participation in ancillary services not only reduces costs but also allows for ERCOT to have more resources at its disposal to achieve grid stability. As Texas power demand grows, more flexible resources will be needed to achieve grid stability. Why disincentivize large flexible loads, which are most often more efficient and lower cost than using peaker plants?</p><h2>Bad For Consumers</h2><p>Access to ancillary services creates marginal economic incentives for miners to come to Texas. Over time, more miners in Texas will lead to more power generation, more demand response and more participation in ancillary services. All three, individually and in aggregate, promote cheaper and more stable power prices for all Texas consumers.</p><h2>Strategic Setback For Texas</h2><p>Due to the fundamentals of energy development and as socialist-leaning states like New York have restricted mining, there has been a significant shift of bitcoin mining to Texas. From a mining perspective, Texas is known as the “center of hash.” Austin is also an emerging hub for bitcoin development. SB 1751 sends loud signals that Texas is not the free, deregulated market everyone believes it to be and that the state of Texas is antagonistic to bitcoin broadly.</p><p>Bitcoin mining incentivizes cheap power and its unique ability to respond at scale to all other sources of power demand helps achieve grid stability far more effectively and efficiently than any other single resource. Willingness by miners to shut down and NOT mine bitcoin in the interest of grid stability is a benefit to ERCOT and all Texans, which should not be economically disincentivized or disadvantaged relative to other industries. Mining projects are also highly capital intensive. Rash legislative action can have immediate impacts in dissuading miners to pursue large, long-term capital projects in Texas.</p><p>Even if you might not be concerned with its broader significance, this legislation will harm Texas strategic interests, beyond just ancillary services.</p><h2>Appeal To Reason And Reasonability</h2><p>Before moving forward with harmful legislation, we encourage you to engage further with bitcoin miners to better understand the matter generally and the consequences of your legislation specifically. Pausing work on SB 1751 is the only sensible and reasonable course. Please do not shoot and aim later. Additionally, we would ask that you engage with the Texas bitcoin community to understand the importance of bitcoin and why it is strategic to Texas and all Texans.</p><p>Bitcoin needs no favors nor competitive advantages. It just should not be subject to regulatory discrimination. The rights of Texan bitcoin holders, including miners, should be protected. <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/html/HC00089I.htm?ref=bitcoiner.ghost.io">House Concurrent Resolution (HCR) 89</a> sponsored by Cody Harris, Texas House of Representatives, District 8 is a great example. It aims to protect the rights of Texan interests in bitcoin, rather than advantaging bitcoin in any way. That is all we ask of you and your colleagues.</p><p>It is clear you are a proud Texan and your values align with the ethos of bitcoin. Most importantly, we simply wish you to engage with the citizenry prior to legislating. But rest assured, regardless of how you proceed, <em>everything is good for bitcoin</em>, which is a theory formally known in Keynesian economics as the Nakamoto Paradox. If you would like to discuss SB 1751 or bitcoin more generally, we are in Austin or would come to Brenham. Godspeed.</p><p><em>“Govern wisely and as little as possible.”&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>-Sam Houston</em></p><p>Best,</p><p>Parker A. Lewis</p><p>Will C. Cole</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Parker A.
