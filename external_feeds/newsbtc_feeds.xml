					<description><![CDATA[The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the recent filings for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), stating that they are insufficient. This comes after asset management giants BlackRock and Fidelity submitted their applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. Related Reading: Cardano Shows Signs of Recovery: When Will it Reach $0.30? The Wall Street Journal reported that the SEC shared its perspective on the filings with Nasdaq and Cboe. Specifically, the agency expressed that the filings lacked clarity and comprehensiveness. Following the release of this news, Bitcoin experienced a drop of nearly 2% in its value. Similarly, other altcoins, including XRP, also saw a decline in their respective charts. Over the past 24 hours, XRP witnessed a decrease of approximately 1%, while on the weekly chart, it recorded a loss of more than 4%. As a result, the technical outlook turned bearish, leading to a decrease in investor interest. The charts reflected a decline in both demand and accumulation. Currently, XRP is hovering around a crucial support level, and a breach of this level may potentially trigger an upward movement for XRP. The market capitalization of XRP decreased, indicating that sellers had a stronger grip on the market. XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart As of the time of writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.46. Currently, XRP has reached its lowest level since the end of May. This level has historically acted as a significant support level for the coin. This level is often referred to as a bullish order block, and it has the potential to drive price recovery. Looking ahead, the first hurdle for XRP would be the resistance at $0.48, followed by a potential move above the $0.50 mark. However, if XRP faces another rejection at $0.50, it could lead to a return to trading at $0.46 and possibly even a further decline to $0.43. Technical Analysis Due to low demand, there has been a decline in buying interest. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently below the half-line and close to the 40-mark, suggesting that buyers have lost their influence and sellers have gained control. Similarly, XRP has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average line. This indicates a weakening demand and implies that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market As demand for the altcoin decreased, the altcoin generated sell signals, although these signals were diminishing in size. This indicates that the bearish momentum might be subsiding. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) showed red histograms associated with the sell signals, but their size was decreasing. This suggests that while bearish sentiment still existed, the price could potentially experience a rebound in the near future.

					<description><![CDATA[Institutional trade volume on the OKX Liquid Marketplace has surpassed $3 billion, the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volume announced on Friday. The Liquid Marketplace is an on-demand liquidity network for professional and institutional traders. This platform allows traders to send requests for quotes (RFQs) to market makers for large digital asset transactions.  OKX Liquid Marketplace Experiences Rapid Growth In Q2 In a press release on Friday, OKX announced that its Liquid Marketplace has now exceeded $3 billion. “This milestone is a testament to the Liquid Marketplace&#8217;s success in providing institutional traders with deep liquidity and reliable execution,” the press statement read. Related Reading: Whales Dive Into XRP, Accumulating $170 Million Worth: What’s Their Game Plan? In April 2023, OKX revealed that the institutional Liquid Marketplace recorded over $1 billion in trading volume in the first quarter of 2023. As of now &#8211; the end of June and 2023 Q2, this figure has more than tripled, surpassing the $3 billion mark. Furthermore, the Liquid Marketplace has been advancing in innovation and product development lately. A few days ago, OKX disclosed the launch of the “Nitro Spreads” feature on the institutional trading platform. Nitro Spreads allows professional and institutional traders to make complex basis trades in a single click. Basis trading refers to trading the difference between an asset’s price on two distinct markets, such as spot vs futures, to generate profits.  This type of trading can be cumbersome, as it usually requires both legs of the trade to be executed simultaneously. However, Nitro Spreads automates this process by executing the two legs of the trade via a central orderbook. On the Liquid Marketplace, traders can use the feature across any combination of the spot, perpetual, and futures markets. OKB Price Slows Down, Makes No Significant Movement In The Past Week While the OKX ecosystem has been surrounded by positivity in recent days, this has not been reflected in the price of OKB, the exchange’s native token. The coin has not registered any loss or gain in the past seven days, according to CoinGecko data. That said, the OKB token appears to be losing the momentum that pushed its price by nearly 13% in the previous week. The cryptocurrency has also not made any significant price movement since then.

Price data reveals that OKB has been in a ranging market in the past few months, trading between the $55 and $40 price points. Since reaching a yearly high of $57.98, the cryptocurrency’s price has decreased by roughly 23%. As of this writing, the OKB token changes hands at $44.53, representing a 2.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the coin has a 24-hour trading volume of more than $6 million, with a 33.7% increase in the last day.

					<description><![CDATA[Litecoin has observed a sharp increase of around 18% during the past day as the much-anticipated halving is just over a month away now. Litecoin Outperforms Market With A Strong 18% Surge Like most of the wider cryptocurrency market, LTC had enjoyed a sharp rally a week or so back, which had taken its price above the $90 mark. Unlike coins like Bitcoin, however, the asset had failed to maintain at these post-surge levels, as it slid off during the days that followed, until eventually bottoming out at the low $80 level. In the past day, however, tides seem to have rapidly shifted for Litecoin, as the asset is now trading above $101 after registering a sharp growth of 18% during the last 24 hours. The below chart shows how the cryptocurrency has performed recently. Looks like the coin has observed a sharp uptrend today &#124; Source: LTCUSD on TradingView As you can see in the graph, Litecoin was around the $81 level only a couple of days back. This latest turnaround for the asset has meant that it has now surpassed the high registered around the start of the month. In terms of daily returns, LTC has outperformed almost all the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap; Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is the only exception with its whopping 26% gains in the same period. Related Reading: Stablecoin Cap Shows Early Sign Of Reversal, Why This Could Benefit Bitcoin As analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; pointed out on Twitter, Litecoin formed a golden cross just before this surge, as its 50-day moving average (MA) has crossed over its 200-day MA. 2020 it is#Litecoin has golden crossed, days after a death cross Does the rest of history repeat? https://t.co/sGlMhgKE0R pic.twitter.com/CRSaqHSbGt — Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; (@tonythebullBTC) June 30, 2023 Interestingly, only a few days ago, the same MAs had also formed a cross of the opposite type: the death cross. The bullish cross canceling this bearish one out merely days later is a pattern similar to the one seen back in 2020, which preceded the bull run. LTC Only Has 34 Days To Go For The Next Halving Litecoin also has a strong bullish narrative coming up in the form of its halving. The &#8220;halving&#8221; is an event where the block rewards of the cryptocurrency are permanently cut in half. As the block rewards are the only way to introduce new LTC into the circulating supply, the halving tightens up its production rate. This increased scarcity is why the event has historically been hyped up as a bullish one. Related Reading: Altcoin Whales Show Highly Active Day, Volatility Incoming? Halvings take place roughly every four years, and the next one is estimated to place on August 3, 2023, which is just 34 days away.

					<description><![CDATA[The Ethereum network is currently witnessing a surge in interest following the recent Shanghai upgrade, which has expanded the options for holders of Ethereum (ETH). This has resulted in an uptick in the number of people staking their ETH in beacon deposit contracts, an indication of the growing confidence in the Ethereum blockchain since the upgrade. Since the Shanghai upgrade, the quantity of staked ETH has been increasing at a swift pace. This growth recently hit a peak, breaking previous records and suggesting that Ethereum&#8217;s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) has been received positively by the market. New Era For Ethereum The amount of Ethereum staked has now hit an all-time high (ATH), surpassing 25.8 million ETH, equivalent to a value of over $48 billion, according to the latest data shared by blockchain and crypto industry analytics platform, CryptoRank. Related Reading: Ethereum Staking Hits Over $40 Billion After Shanghai Upgrade: What It Means For ETH This development has caused quite a stir in the crypto community and provides insight into the evolving dynamics of the Ethereum blockchain. Just a month earlier, in late May, the Ethereum deposit contract balance had crossed the $40 billion mark. This upward movement underscores the effectiveness of the new features introduced during Ethereum’s transition from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the PoS consensus mechanism after the Merge upgrade. Furthermore, the impact of the Shanghai upgrade on the Ethereum ecosystem has been profound. The surge in the Ethereum staking ratio since the upgrade is indicative of growing interest and faith in the Ethereum blockchain&#8217;s potential.  This, in turn, reflects on the success of the Shanghai upgrade and the Merge in aligning ETH with market expectations and needs. While the influx of staked ETH steadily rises, Ethereum&#8217;s creator, Vitalik Buterin, has recently expressed concerns regarding the potential strain this could put on the network&#8217;s consensus. In a recent blog post, he urged caution, stating, &#8220;Don’t overload Ethereum’s consensus.&#8221; Buterin went on to emphasize that utilizing Ethereum&#8217;s consensus for diverse functions could introduce elevated systemic threats to the ecosystem and should be actively discouraged. Despite this cautionary advice, there has been no decrease in ETH staking activity, only a consistent increase.

The second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization has surged from trading below $1,700 earlier this month to trading as high as $1,890, at the time of writing. Notably, the asset tapped and traded above $1,900 earlier today before slightly retracing to a 24-low of $1,843. Meanwhile, ETH has recorded more than $20 billion added to its market cap over the past two weeks. ETH trading volume has also surged over the same period indicating a rising trading activity.

					<description><![CDATA[The recent downturn in the XRP market has not deterred large-scale investors, often referred to as &#8216;whales&#8217;. Amid a 12% drop in XRP&#8217;s price between June 22 and June 28, they instead saw an opportunity rather than a setback, amassing 360 million XRP worth approximately $170 million. This significant investment demonstrates the high-stake moves that define the crypto markets. While such large-scale purchases are not unusual in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, this particular accumulation of XRP seems to suggest a confident long-term outlook on the asset by these whales, despite the current bearish trend. #Ripple whales bought the dip! While the price of #XRP dropped 12% from June 22 to June 28, whales bought 360 million $XRP worth nearly $170 million. pic.twitter.com/QI0m45cIio — Ali (@ali_charts) June 29, 2023 XRP Whale Movements Amid Market Fluctuations On June 22, XRP&#8217;s price hit a weekly high of $0.52. But this peak didn&#8217;t last long. The subsequent reversal led to a drop, triggering increased profit-taking as many felt the asset was overvalued. Related Reading: ‘Ripple (XRP) Is A Must-Hold For The Next Bull Run,’ Says Bitcoin Maxi Consequently, XRP has been on a downward slope, breaking key support levels, and presently trades below the earlier $0.5 mark. This puts the asset&#8217;s decline at around 4.3% for the past week. However, the picture is not all gloom and doom. The market capitalization of XRP sits at $24.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This ranking comes even amid the notable downward pressure. Despite the past week&#8217;s bearish trend, the last 24 hours have shown some signs of recovery for XRP. The token has experienced a slight uptick, gaining 2.1% in price. This positive movement has bolstered the asset&#8217;s market cap by over $500 million, pushing it up from just below $24 billion earlier this month to the current $24.8 billion. Even so, XRP&#8217;s daily trading volume has experienced a significant fall, dropping from the $1 billion mark seen earlier this month to below $600 million in the last 24 hours. The token&#8217;s price has remained somewhat stable, with a 24-hour low of $0.46 and a high of $0.47. Effect On The Market While the whales&#8217; massive XRP purchase is newsworthy, it&#8217;s not the only factor at play. The modest price uptrend could be attributed to an overall slight bullish sentiment reverberating throughout the broader cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, the front-runner in the crypto space, has also displayed a minor upward trend, which typically influences the performance of other digital assets, including XRP. In this volatile world of cryptocurrencies, it&#8217;s crucial to keep an eye on such significant moves as the ones made by the whales. Their actions could set the stage for what&#8217;s next for XRP and other cryptocurrencies in the weeks and months to come. Ripple Labs has actively sought to have the Security and Executive Commission (SEC) lawsuit against it dismissed, asserting that XRP, unlike conventional securities, operates as a digital currency due to its practical use and decentralized features. The company is challenging the SEC&#8217;s authority in this regard and condemns the regulatory body for not offering clear guidance on the status of XRP as a security. Related Reading: XRP Price Topside Bias Vulnerable Unless It Climbs Above $0.50 Ripple claims that the ongoing legal dispute has adversely affected XRP holders and stifled progress in the cryptocurrency sector. The court&#8217;s ruling on Ripple&#8217;s request for dismissal is eagerly awaited, and it could substantially impact the trajectory of the lawsuit. Should the request be granted, it could significantly undermine the SEC&#8217;s case, but if denied, the legal battle will continue with the SEC&#8217;s charges against Ripple remaining active.

Amid a 12% drop in XRP&#8217;s price between June 22 and June 28, they instead <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1674366754322104325?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saw</a> an opportunity rather than a setback, amassing 360 million XRP worth approximately $170 million. This significant investment demonstrates the high-stake moves that define the crypto markets.</p>
<p>While such large-scale purchases are not unusual in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, this particular accumulation of XRP seems to suggest a confident long-term outlook on the asset by these whales, despite the current bearish trend.</p>

<p>While the price of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#XRP</a> dropped 12% from June 22 to June 28, whales bought 360 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$XRP</a> worth nearly $170 million. <a href="https://t.co/QI0m45cIio" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/QI0m45cIio</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1674366754322104325?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">June 29, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>XRP Whale Movements Amid Market Fluctuations</h2>
<p>On June 22, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-vulnerable-0-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">XRP&#8217;s price</a> hit a weekly high of $0.52. But this peak didn&#8217;t last long. The subsequent reversal led to a drop, triggering increased profit-taking as many felt the asset was overvalued.</p>

<p>Consequently, XRP has been on a downward slope, breaking key support levels, and presently trades below the earlier $0.5 mark. This puts the asset&#8217;s decline at around 4.3% for the past week.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">However, the picture is not all gloom and doom. The market capitalization of XRP sits at $24.8 billion, making it the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This ranking comes even amid the notable downward pressure.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the past week&#8217;s bearish trend, the last 24 hours have shown some signs of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/ripple-thrives-despite-legal-battle-whats-the-market-reaction-of-xrp/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">recovery for XRP</a>. The token has experienced a slight uptick, gaining 2.1% in price. This positive movement has bolstered the asset&#8217;s market cap by over $500 million, pushing it up from just below $24 billion earlier this month to the current $24.8 billion.</p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/4qBcmQ3P/" alt="Ripple’s XRP price chart on TradingView" width="2770" height="1556"/>
<p dir="ltr">Even so, XRP&#8217;s daily trading volume has experienced a significant fall, dropping from the $1 billion mark seen earlier this month to below $600 million in the last 24 hours. The token&#8217;s price has remained somewhat stable, with a 24-hour low of $0.46 and a high of $0.47.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Effect On The Market</h2>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">While the whales&#8217; massive XRP purchase is newsworthy, it&#8217;s not the only factor at play. The modest price uptrend could be attributed to an overall slight bullish sentiment reverberating throughout the broader cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the front-runner in the crypto space, has also displayed a minor upward trend, which typically influences the performance of other digital assets, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-xrp-is-a-must-hold-for-the-next-bull-run-says-bitcoin-maxi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">including XRP</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this volatile world of cryptocurrencies, it&#8217;s crucial to keep an eye on such significant moves as the ones made by the whales. Their actions could set the stage for what&#8217;s next for XRP and other cryptocurrencies in the weeks and months to come.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Ripple Labs has actively sought to have the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ripple/ripple-vs-sec-deaton-verdict-date-xrp-loses-steam/?swcfpc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">Security and Executive Commission (SEC) lawsuit</a> against it dismissed, asserting that XRP, unlike conventional securities, operates as a digital currency due to its practical use and decentralized features. The company is challenging the SEC&#8217;s authority in this regard and condemns the regulatory body for not offering clear guidance on the status of XRP as a security.</p>

<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Ripple claims that the ongoing legal dispute has adversely affected XRP holders and stifled progress in the cryptocurrency sector. The court&#8217;s ruling on Ripple&#8217;s request for dismissal is eagerly awaited, and it could substantially impact the trajectory of the lawsuit.</p>
<p class="selectable-text copyable-text iq0m558w" dir="ltr">Should the request be granted, it could significantly undermine the SEC&#8217;s case, but if denied, the legal battle will continue with the SEC&#8217;s charges against Ripple remaining active.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB)&#8217;s gains have been tempered by various challenges, hindering its further upswing. The declining inflows of stablecoins on the Arbitrum network have raised concerns among investors and enthusiasts alike, as it signals potential obstacles for the growth and development of the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.  As a Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, Arbitrum initially garnered significant attention and saw impressive gains, but recent hurdles have dampened the optimism surrounding its future prospects.  While the decline in stablecoin inflows is a cause for worry, there are potential avenues for growth that could help revive Arbitrum&#8217;s momentum.  Source: Coingecko Resilient Growth Amidst Volatility: ARB Performance Despite facing market volatility, both the Arbitrum protocol and its native token, ARB, have demonstrated remarkable growth.

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin and crypto market eagerly observed the expiry of the quarterly BTC and ETH options today (at 8:00 am UTC / 4:00 am EST). It was the second largest in history with a volume of 159,000 BTC options and 1.25 million ETH options with a total value of almost $7 billion. The market was expecting a sharp increase in volatility, but it failed to materialize. In the run-up, the BTC price briefly spiked as high as $31,300 before seeing a pullback towards $30,700. The event has thus pretty much become a nothing burger. Options analysts at Greeks.Live confirmed a few minutes ago that the quarterly expiration has been completed, with more BTC block calls being traded in the last few days, mainly to close and roll positions at the end of the quarter, with ETH being mainly in the order book, adding: With the quarterly expiry, the market has seen a release of positions that have built up in recent months, and options could see a larger shift if the market supports it in July. Although volatility levels have risen this month and market makers are happy to actively buy positions, the downward trend in major term IV is very much in evidence amidst the strong selling pressure from quarterly delivery. What&#8217;s Next For Bitcoin? Today&#8217;s daily close could become extremely important for the Bitcoin price. Today is month-end, quarter-end and the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index, the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge, will be released at 8:30 am EST (12:30 pm CET). On Tuesday, the U.S. market is closed for the Fourth of July, Independence Day. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Key Indicators Suggest A Strengthening Case For Rally To $32K The Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) price index is preferred by the Fed because it provides broader coverage of consumer spending, includes chain weighting to accurately track behavioral changes, accounts for the substitution effect, and uses comprehensive data sources. The PCE is therefore considered a more flexible and representative indicator of inflation compared to other indexes such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While headline CPI data have looked extremely good in recent months, core inflation has been shown to be very sticky. A lot of focus today will therefore be on core PCE. The expectation for PCE inflation is 3.9% and for core PCE 4.7% year-over-year. A surprise to the downside has the potential to provide a bullish boost to both the traditional financial market as well as the Bitcoin and crypto markets. Related Reading: Dawn For Bitcoin: $5 Billion In Options Expire And Could Push Price Towards $31,000 As renowned analyst @rektcapital writes via Twitter, BTC is positioning itself for a monthly close above a resistance that had rejected the price for the past three months. Currently, BTC is holding above the same level (black). Thus, the monthly as well as the quarterly close could be an extremely bullish harbinger for July. Is The Best Time To Buy Next Monday? Analyst @tedtalksmacro recently published an analysis about Bitcoin&#8217;s historical performance via Twitter. The result may suggest that the upcoming Monday, July 3, is the best option for a Bitcoin buy, at least historically. As the analyst noted, July has been the best performing month since October 2009. However, the data is skewed due to a 10x in July 2010. Taking only the last five years of data, the best performing month is October, closely followed by July. On a weekly basis, Mondays are the best day to buy and hold BTC. This assumes that buyers do not hold BTC on any day other than the nominated one, as the analyst evaluated. At press time, the Bitcoin price hovered below the $31,000 resistance zone, trading at $30,856. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

<p>On a weekly basis, Mondays are the best day to buy and hold BTC. This assumes that buyers do not hold BTC on any day other than the nominated one, as the analyst evaluated.</p>
