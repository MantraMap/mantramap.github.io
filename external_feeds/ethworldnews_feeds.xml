<p>Layer 1 blockchain Avalanche has&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1613235554711400448?s=20&amp;t=E0UYS2T7yutSfJEYd8oq5w" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a>&nbsp;that it has partnered up with cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services to bring scalable blockchain solutions to enterprises and governments around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>AWS now supports Avalanche‚Äôs dApp ecosystem and infrastructure</strong></h2>



<p>According to an&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ava-labs-and-aws-bring-scalable-blockchain-solutions-to-enterprises-and-governments-295040a34263" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update</a>&nbsp;from Avalanche, Amazon Web Services now fully supports the blockchain‚Äôs infrastructure and decentralized applications ecosystem. This includes one-click node deployment through the AWS Marketplace, and AWS GovCloud for FedRAMP compliance use cases which is a prerequisite for enterprises and governments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to the partnership, developers will be able to use AWS to deploy scalable, fault-tolerant, and compliant offerings, all while efficiently reducing compliance expenses.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>It has been a huge boon for both individual and enterprise developers to be able to spin up nodes and test networks on the fly with AWS in whatever legal jurisdiction makes the most sense for them‚Äù </p><cite>Emin G√ºn Sirer, Founder and CEO of Ava Labs.</cite></blockquote>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/avalabsofficial?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">@avalabsofficial</a> also plans to add Subnet deployment as a managed service to the AWS marketplace, allowing individuals and institutions to launch custom Subnets with a few clicks.</p>&mdash; Avalanche üî∫ (@avalancheavax) <a href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1613235559853617152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">January 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The partnership also makes Ava Labs a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN), which paves the way for customers to deploy custom offerings on AWS. Ava Labs has indicated that it may add&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/avalanche-290m-incentive-program-to-boost-subnets/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Subnet</a>&nbsp;deployment as a managed service to the AWS Marketplace to help both firms launch custom Subnets. This will include a feature to distribute validators securing the Subnet across different regions and availability zones to improve robustness.</p>



<p>As for the developers, the partnership will bring more flexibility, in addition to the added strength of the network. AWS and Ava Labs are also collaborating on events for developers and entrepreneurs to make building on Avalanche easier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Avalanche&#8217;s native token&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$AVAX</a>&nbsp;has gained more than 15% since the news came out. The token is currently trading at $14.22. Traders have scrambled to buy the token, resulting in a 16% increase in its trading volume over the past three hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Landis Rath &amp; Cobb lawyers stated the recovery claim during a bankruptcy hearing on Wednesday</li><li>The $5 billion in question was reclaimed in &#8220;cash, liquid crypto, and liquid investment securities&#8221;, per the court hearing.</li><li>FTX bankruptcy CEO John Ray previously tagged the company&#8217;s recovery efforts at around $1.2 billion in December 2022.¬†</li></ul>



<p>Attorneys from Landis Rath and Cobb told a judge that FTX recovered some $5 billion as bankruptcy hearings for the defunct crypto exchange continued on Wednesday. According to Landis Rath and Cobb lawyer Adam Landis, the company reclaimed the stated value in cash, liquid cryptocurrencies, and liquid investment securities.¬†</p>



<p>FTX‚Äôs legal representatives noted that the latest recovery did not include approximately $425 million in customer crypto <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3-5-billion-ftx-customer-crypto-bahamas/">seized</a> by Bahamian authorities in late December 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, Wednesday‚Äôs court claim boosted the company‚Äôs recovered assets value by a considerable margin. On December 20, 2022, bankruptcy CEO John Ray III said the sunken crypto exchange had secured roughly $1.2 billion in value. Ray noted that loose accounting structures in Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs crypto empire made it tricky to track down assets.</p>



<p>The latest clawback by the bankruptcy management under Ray could propel the estate‚Äôs holdings to over $7 billion, making more funds available for customers, creditors, and investors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Crypto Twitter Puzzled By Mystery $5 Billion Recovery&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Observers on Crypto Twitter were skeptical regarding claims of a massive $5 billion <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/11/ftx-has-recovered-5-billion-worth-of-liquid-assets-lawyers-say-bankman-fried-crypto.html" rel="noopener">recovery</a> by FTX‚Äôs bankruptcy team. Coinbase director Conor Grogan pointed out that on-chain wallets controlled by the defunct exchange held less than $4 billion in value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Users also enquired whether or not the $5 billion in question included over $400 million in Robinhood shares seized by the Department of Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crypto proponent Adam Cochran also speculated that Sam Bankman-Fried himself could be involved in the mystery recovery. The user noted that SBF supposedly offered Elon Musk $5 billion in equity to support his Twitter takeover.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<h2>FTX Asks Judge To Ignore Celsius Precedent</h2>



<p>FTX attorneys filed a motion to redact all creditor information and protect customer privacy.. The request was opposed by media organizations including Bloomberg, the Financial Times, and the New York Times who argued in favor of the precedent set by Celsius.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Celsius‚Äôs bankruptcy proceedings <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-users-doxxed-bankruptcy-filing/">revealed</a> 14,000 pages of user information including account names and transaction histories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lawyers representing the fallen crypto exchange suggested sealing customer data for a period of six months. FTX attorneys argued that this time will be sufficient for the court to assess the value of the data and whether it should be made public.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Voyager Digital was granted court approval allowing the defunct crypto broker to sell off some of its assets.</li><li>The deal was previously halted by an SEC inquiry. </li><li>Binance US will splash a whopping $1 billion as payment to Voyager, per previous reports.</li><li>The deal is still subject to a bankruptcy court hearing slated for March 2022.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Binance US received approval from a&nbsp; bankruptcy court to proceed with a deal geared toward purchasing assets under beleaguered cryptocurrency brokerage service Voyager Digital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both entities <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-assets-1-billion/https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-voyager-digital-assets-1-billion/">agreed</a> to a massive $1 billion deal in late December 2022 as previously reported. However, an inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) temporarily blocked the deal from finalizing. The SEC <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sec-objects-binanceuss-deal-buy-voyager-digital-2023-01-04/" rel="nofollow noopener">questioned</a> whether the crypto exchange could indeed satisfy the financial requirements attached to the agreement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FTX‚Äôs sister firm Alameda research also filed a complaint against the deal, claiming that the agreement ‚Äúignores fundamental requirement and protections of the Bankruptcy code‚Äù. Voyager‚Äôs lawyers fired back at Alameda‚Äôs ‚Äúhypocrisy and chutzpah‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Judge Issues Conditional Approval</h2>



<p>U.S. Judge Michael Wiles approved Voyager‚Äôs deal with the crypto exchange late on Tuesday, per the court filing. Judge Wiles ordered that the defunct crypto broker hold a vote with its creditors regarding plans to offload some assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, another hearing was scheduled for March 2 to finalize the agreement and consider the votes from Voyager‚Äôs creditors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, the $1 billion purchase agreement could herald relief for Voyager customers frozen out of their crypto since July 2022. The crypto broker declared bankruptcy due to a liquidity crisis and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/voyager-digital-3ac-default-notice/">exposure</a> to fallen crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Terms of the deal with Binance US will allow Voyager customers to receive about 51% of their holdings stuck on the brokerage service.</p>



<h2>Binance CEO Gunning For Workforce Growth In 2023</h2>



<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said the leading crypto exchange has plans to expand its team in 2023. The company boasted over 8,000 employees at the end of 2022, growing from 3,000 in 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zhao noted that Binance could increase staff count by some 15-30% during a blockchain conference in Switzerland. The comments echoed previous remarks from CZ who noted that Binance has a war chest big enough to keep the lights on through a bear market.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>Gala Games‚Äô native token $GALA has gone up 142% over the past week according to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gala" rel="nofollow noopener">Coingecko</a>.</li><li>The play-to-earn platform recently announced the acquisition of Ember Entertainment, which had positively impacted the token‚Äôs price.¬†</li><li>The platform has also partnered up with Hollywood superstars Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg.</li><li>Opportunistic traders have begun shorting the token while anticipating the momentum to die out.¬†</li></ul>



<p>Gala Games, the popular blockchain-based pay-to-earn <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gala-games-attack-token-bleeds/">platform</a>, revealed multiple high-profile developments over the past couple of days. These developments have had a rather bullish effect on their native token $GALA. The ERC-20 token has gone from $0.023 all the way up to $0.045, within a span of 48 hours, marking an impressive bullish run of nearly 100%.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gala Games acquires Ember Entertainment</strong></h2>



<p>Earlier today, Gala Games confirmed that it had&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612610162304376832?t=XT8CW9cJ5OXA6ydB5yx_SQ&amp;s=19" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a>&nbsp;Ember Entertainment, the game studio behind the popular play-to-earn game The Walking Dead: Empires. Both parties were involved in the development of this game and rumors about the acquisition had been going around over the past few days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The acquisition paves the way for Gala to onboard more than 20 million active users. According to an update provided by the platform, two high-priority games, Dragon Strike and Meow Match, are currently at the center of their attention. Both the games will be integrated into the platform‚Äôs layer 1 blockchain and use the native token $GALA as gas fees. According to the platform&#8217;s developers, 50% of the gas will be burned while the rest will be distributed among the node operators, founders, and partners of the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to the acquisition, Gala Games also announced partnerships with popular Hollywood stars Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg. Furthermore, the GALA token will be used to power its flagship play-to-earn game&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/GoGalaGames/status/1612565011909562378?s=20&amp;t=9Vgr8cf4C5_KQR1eXCdzkA" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Townstar</a>. All $TOWN tokens will be swapped for GALA at a 2:1 ratio.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The impressive bull run of GALA came to an end earlier today after opportunistic degen traders started shorting the token. The traders anticipated that the momentum of the news was set to run out and that the token would correct itself. Data from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gala/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>&nbsp;shows that the $GALA is currently trading at $0.042. The recent developments led its trading volume to skyrocket to levels which were last witnessed in March 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Gemini President Cameron Winklevoss said there&#8217;s no path forward as long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of Digital Currency Group.</li><li>The letter demanded that the DCG board out Silbert and install new management, while also accusing Silbert&#8217;s conglomerate of accounting fraud.</li><li>Tuesday&#8217;s letter was the latest in the spat between Gemini and DCG after Winklevoss publicly called out Silbert on January 2, 2023.</li></ul>



<p>President and Co-Founder of Gemini Cameron Winklevoss escalated the ongoing spat with Digital Currency Group CEO and Founder Barry Silbert, accusing Silbert of accounting fraud and demanding that the company‚Äôs board install new management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Winklevoss shared an open letter to the DCG board via Twitter on Tuesday, claiming that Genesis defrauded 340,000 Gemini Earn users and other creditors of roughly $1.67 billion by making ‚Äúfalse statements and misrepresentations‚Äù regarding Genesis‚Äôs financial strength.&nbsp;Notably, Genesis is owned by Silbert&#8217;s DCG. </p>



<p>Bankrupt crypto broker Genesis reportedly cut a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet after lending $2.4 billion to crumbled crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Winklevoss goes on to accuse Silbert of doing nothing to address his company‚Äôs deteriorating books despite having ‚Äútwo legitimate options‚Äù to either restructure Genesis‚Äôs lending structure or fill the $1.2 billion hole left by 3AC‚Äôs crash.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>At that point in time, the Genesis loan book was approximately $8 billion, which means that the $1.2 billion loss from 3AC would account for roughly 15% of the loan book‚Äôs assets. A restructuring then could have addressed this shortfall to achieve a full recovery of assets for all lenders &#8211; including Earn users &#8211; in a short amount of time and give them direct access to liquidity. But Barry chose not to do this. He also chose not to fill the $1.2 billion hole. Instead, he pretended to.</p></blockquote>



<p>In addition to allegations of coordinated accounting fraud within Silbert‚Äôs mammoth company, Winklevoss also accused former Genesis CEO Michael Moro of making ‚Äúfalse and misleading‚Äù statements. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/genesis-moro-steps-down-staff-cuts-3ac/">Moro</a> claimed that DCG ‚Äúassumed certain liabilities of Genesis related to 3AC‚Äù on July 6, 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCG agreed to a $1.1 billion promissory note with Genesis supposedly meant to stabilize the crypto broker. However, Winklevoss called the deal a ‚Äúgimmick‚Äù that failed to address the company‚Äôs liquidity crunch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Gemini President Sees No Path Forward With Silbert Leading DCG</h2>



<p>Winklevoss opined that DCG requires new management for the benefit of all involved parties. In Tuesday‚Äôs open letter, Gemini‚Äôs President <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/10/billionaire-cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-removal-of-lying-barry-silbert-ceo-of-flailing-crypto-conglomerate-dcg/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/01/10/billionaire-cameron-winklevoss-calls-for-removal-of-lying-barry-silbert-ceo-of-flailing-crypto-conglomerate-dcg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requested</a> that the DCG board immediately remove Barry Silbert as CEO.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DCB‚Äôs board has five members per information available on Crunchbase. The board members include Jim Robinson, Lawrence Lenihan, Matt Haris, Glenn Hutchins, and Rocky Motwani. </p>



<p>The group called Cameron&#8217;s letter a &#8220;desperate and unconstructive publicity stunt from&#8221; in a Twitter reply on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The letter came as the second public move from Winklevoss in a bid to push DCG into action and seemingly expose Sibert‚Äôs unwillingness to ‚Äúfind a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable. Gemini‚Äôs Co-Founder had previously called on Silbert in an open letter on January 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coinbase announced that it will be downsizing its workforce by around 20% or 950 employees, as part of a restructuring effort set to be completed by the end of Q2 2023</p>



<p>According to the company, the decision to restructure is a response to &#8220;ongoing market conditions impacting the crypto economy,&#8221; as stated in a filing with the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000003/coin-20230110.htm" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000167978823000003/coin-20230110.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </a></p>



<p>&#8220;While it is always painful to part ways with our fellow colleagues, there was no way to reduce our expenses significantly enough, without considering changes to headcount,‚Äù Armstrong said on a memo.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry,‚Äù he said, adding there‚Äôs likely more ‚Äúshoes to drop.‚Äù in an interview to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/coinbase-to-slash-20percent-of-workforce-in-second-major-round-of-job-cuts.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/coinbase-to-slash-20percent-of-workforce-in-second-major-round-of-job-cuts.html" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe may not have seen the last of it ‚Äî there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to make sure that they‚Äôre following the rule&#8221;</p>



<p> ‚ÄúLong term that‚Äôs a good thing. But short term, there‚Äôs still a lot of market fear.‚Äù </p>



<p>The company anticipates that the restructuring process will cost between $149 million and $163 million, including cash charges of $58 million-$68 million related to employee severance. </p>



<p>This downsizing follows a similar round of job <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/">cuts </a>made last year when the crypto market was in a bear phase. CEO Brian Armstrong explained that the company had grown too quickly during the bull market, leading to the need to reduce expenses in order to increase the company&#8217;s chances of success in any market scenario. </p>



<p>&#8220;One of the crazy parts about our industry is that in any given year we might be growing 300-500% or -50%. It makes it incredibly challenging to plan and culturally to absorb so many people during up periods.‚Äù &#8211; CEO Armstrong previously stated on his Official Twitter Account.</p>



<p>In addition to job cuts, Coinbase will also be discontinuing several projects with a &#8220;lower probability of success.&#8221; </p>



<p>According to CoinDesk, nearly 27,000 jobs have been lost across the crypto industry since April 2020.</p>



<p>The cryptocurrency market has been significantly impacted in recent months due to the fall of one of the industry&#8217;s major players, FTX. The incident has led to increased pressure and scrutiny on the sector, with some individuals, such as FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, being referred to as &#8220;unscrupulous actors&#8221; in the industry.</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Shares Increased 6% After the Announcement.</strong></h2>



<p>Shares of Coinbase saw a 6% increase in value after the company announced the job cuts.</p>



<p>While the move will result in a significant reduction in staff, it is expected to also bring cost savings for the company. Investors appear to be taking the news positively, with the stock seeing a significant boost in value following the announcement. </p>



<p>It should be noted that this kind of downsizing is not uncommon in crypto, where volatility is high, and the industry is constantly evolving. A few crypto companies have already announced layoffs, such as Crypto.Com, Gemini, Celsius, and others.</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Nishad Singh met with U.S. federal prosecutors to discuss a cooperation deal last week, Bloomberg reported.</li><li>The ex-chief coder at FTX was the latest and third member of Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s &#8216;inner circle&#8217; to engage investigators over a possible plea deal.</li><li>FTX co-founder Gary Wang and former CEO of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison admitted to fraud and other criminal charges in later December 2022.</li></ul>



<p>Another SBF lieutenant looks to jump off the sunken FTX ship as prosecutors prepare for a mammoth criminal trial against the disgraced crypto tycoon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The former FTX lead engineer, Nishad Singh, met with federal prosecutors from the South District of New York (SDNY) to discuss the crash of the crypto exchange and Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs political donations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-10/third-bankman-fried-associate-nishad-singh-met-with-prosecutors?leadSource=uverify%20wall" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, SDNY investigators conducted a proffer session with Singh sometime last week. Proffer sessions are used by prosecutors to assess the information a potential witness might provide. These talks are commonly held under the umbrella of limited immunity, although proffer sessions are not a surefire method for securing cooperation deals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Citing sources familiar with the matter, details on Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs donations to political candidates were reportedly discussed by Singh and U.S. federal prosecutors. Indeed, Singh‚Äôs testimony could prove key in proving or discrediting charges of campaign finance violations filed about the fallen FTX founder SBF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from the Federal Election Commission showed that Bankman-Fried donated at least $42 million to bipartisan candidates. Complaints and charges lodged by U.S. prosecutors alleged that customer funds might have been used to finance these political donations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FTX Inner Circle Flip On Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>



<p>Singh became the third member of Bankman-Fried‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúinner circle‚Äù to meet with U.S. Attorneys. In late December 2022, ex-CEO of Alameda Research Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud as part of a plea deal. FTX Co-Founder Gary Wang was also cooperating with prosecutors, per <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2022/12/21/ftx-alameda-gary-wang-and-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud/" rel="noopener">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel Friedberg, a former chief regulatory officer of the crippled crypto exchange, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-lawyer-prosecutor-sam-bankman-fried/">shared</a> inside information on SBF‚Äôs crypto empire in November. Brett Harrison who served as president of FTX U.S. until September 2022, also promised to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/former-ftx-us-president-teases-insider/">disclose</a> insider info ‚Äúin time‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried‚Äôs trial is scheduled for October 2023. Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-conspiracy-fraud/">indicted</a> SBF on eight criminal charges including fraud and money laundering.¬† In response, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all eight charges. </p>

<ul><li>Hong Kong remains undeterred in its ambition to establish itself as a crypto hub, despite the prolonged bear market.&nbsp;</li><li>The local government is inviting technology and crypto startups to set up their international headquarters in the island city.</li><li>The regulatory agencies are currently involved with multiple pilot projects, including tokenized green bonds for institutional investors.&nbsp;</li><li>Hong Kong recently set up a licensing system for virtual asset service providers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The ongoing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nft-marketplace-superrare-downsizes-30-of-staff-due-to-extended-crypto-winter/">crypto winter</a> seems to have had little impact on the Hong Kong government‚Äôs ambitions to establish the region as a crypto hub. Unlike neighboring countries including Singapore, which have moved to limit their exposure to the volatile crypto industry, Hong Kong has ramped up its efforts to attract talent and enterprises from this space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Hong Kong to issue tokenized green bonds</strong></h2>



<p>While speaking at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cyberport.hk/files/63bbe1bc906dc198207375/20230109%20Hong%20Kong%20Web3%20Innovator%20Summit%20&amp;%20Web3%20Hub@Cyberport%20Inauguration%20Ceremony.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cyberport</a>, a state-sponsored tech incubator, Financial Secretary Paul Chan revealed that the local regulatory agencies and the government are currently involved in several pilot projects in the crypto space. This includes tokenized green bonds that will be issued by the government for subscription by institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>‚ÄúHong Kong is at the golden starting point for financial developments in respect of Web3 and virtual assets. Our thinking is to put in place appropriate and proportionate supervision to unleash the potential of Web3..‚Äù Secretary Chan stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The secretary also revealed that the government is in active communication with multiple companies and start-ups in the crypto space. These companies have been invited to set up their international headquarters in Hong Kong. The listing of the companies on the local stock exchange is also on the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joseph Chan, the Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1683088-20230109.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a>&nbsp;the need to develop the required technology for virtual currency, virtual asset exchange, metaverse exploration, and innovative applications in which securities issuance and trade finance can be conducted through tokenization.</p>



<p>Just last month, the government of Hong Kong concluded the legislative process of setting up a licensing system for virtual asset service providers. Under this system, proper safeguards have been put into place to prevent money laundering and terror financing activities, while enhancing consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. CFTC has filed manipulation charges against Avraham Eisenberg.</li><li>In October 2022, Eisenberg exploited Mango Markets to the tune of $110 million.&nbsp;</li><li>The exploiter was arrested last month and is facing criminal charges filed by the US Department of Justice.&nbsp;</li><li>Eisenberg has maintained that his actions were legal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S Commodities and Futures Trading Commission has filed charges against Avraham Eisenberg, the man responsible for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mango-markets-avraham-eisenberg-arrested/">exploiting</a> Mango Markets in October 2022. The self-proclaimed game theorist was arrested last month in Puerto Rico for his role in the exploit that led to $110 million being drained from the decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exploit had left Mango Markets facing liquidity issues. Within days of the attack, the DEX had negotiated a settlement with Eisenberg, as per which he returned $67 million worth of stolen tokens. He walked away with nearly $47 million.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>CFTC alleges manipulation of swaps on Mango Markets</strong></h2>



<p>Per the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66707334/1/unknown-case-title/" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> made by the CFTC, Avraham Eisenberg allegedly violated federal commodities law by deploying a ‚Äúmanipulative and deceptive scheme‚Äù to artificially inflate the price of the MNGO token through swaps, and subsequently manipulate the swap contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Mango Markets exploiter is currently in custody and facing criminal charges from the U.S. Department of Justice, precisely one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation. Eisenberg has maintained that his actions were legal, going as far as calling the exploit a ‚Äúhighly profitable trading strategy‚Äù.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.</p>&mdash; Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326199682265088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg‚Äôs public acknowledgment of his role in the exploit has been cited as an admission of the crime by the CFTC in the court filing. This includes his <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread</a> that addressed the exploit. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Contrary to his purported belief that his actions were legal, in fact, they constituted blatant manipulation of spot prices and swaps‚Äù </p><cite>the CFTC alleged.&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>The CFTC&#8217;s decision to file separate charges in a matter involving  swaps on decentralized exchanges is being viewed as a power play for jurisdiction by some in the crypto community. The agency has been going back and forth with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the matter of oversight of the crypto industry. </p>
