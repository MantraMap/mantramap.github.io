The astonishing consequence is that the vast majority of people, nutritionists, and doctors today think that animal fat is harmful, while grains are healthy, necessary, and safe!”</p></blockquote><p>In other words, even though a meat-centered diet is superior to a grain-centered one, the government and its quasi-private partners succeeded in persuading millions of people into opting for the latter.</p><p>Ammous raises the topic of dietary guidelines as just one example of how a fiat standard distorts an industry, but there’s another lesson in this story that Bitcoiners have to grapple with: </p><p><em>Even if your product is the best on the market, governments (and other entities) are capable of spreading narratives that persuade citizens to choose an inferior alternative. </em></p><p>If it happened with food, it could happen with money. </p><h2>A CBDC Punch-Counterpunch</h2><p>On July 10, 2023, Karin Strohecker published an article in Reuters titled, “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/twenty-four-central-banks-will-have-digital-currencies-by-2030-bis-survey-2023-07-10/">Twenty-Four Central Banks Will Have Digital Currencies By 2030, Survey Shows</a>.” Apparently, a couple dozen central banks have been making “great” progress in their development of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Strohecker wrote that these central banks have been “working on digital versions of their currencies for retail use to <em>avoid leaving digital payments to the private sector </em>(emphasis added) amid an accelerating decline of cash.”</p><p>This purported motivation behind CBDCs has been brewing for a while — in August 2022, the European Central Bank (ECB) released a report called “<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2693%7E8d4e580438.en.pdf">Towards The Holy Grail Of Cross-Border Payments</a>.” In it, the authors compared the merits and demerits of various technological implementations of a cross-border payment solution that might be “immediate, cheap, universal and settled in a secure settlement medium.” Of the candidates they considered, they concluded that “Bitcoin is least credible” and that “the interlinking of domestic instant payment systems and future CBDCs, both with a competitive FX conversion layer” are the two most credible solutions.</p><p>While the ECB left out any remark about the risks that CBDCs pose to citizens’ privacy and sovereignty, River Financial responded with a <a href="https://blog.river.com/bitcoin-vs-the-156-trillion-global-payments-industry/">report</a> of its own. Spearheaded by River’s Sam Wouters, this report <em>does </em>explain the gaping hole in the ECB’s argument for CBDCs, as well as the technological barriers that Bitcoin ought to overcome if it’s going to be adopted worldwide.</p><p>Readers can review the technical and quantitative arguments of both ECB and River Financial for themselves — my purpose in bringing up this punch-counterpunch is that the battle between freedom-money and tyranny-money is <em>not </em>one that we will win by default, and that it’s as much a battle for hearts and minds as it is for product superiority. Much like the propaganda campaign that persuaded people to switch from healthier diets to those that the government preferred, central banks are levying their best words, videos and other marketing techniques to convince people that CBDCs are superior to Bitcoin.</p><p>And, in the end, their victory is possible.</p><h2>Understanding The Education Process</h2><p><em>We</em> know that Bitcoin solves humanity’s many monetary problems far better than CBDCs do. <em>We </em>recognize the havoc that rampant inflation wreaks on nations. <em>We </em>understand that lacking a store of value is the cause of so many anti-civilizational behaviors. But that’s not enough. If others don’t understand the fiat origins of these problems, they don’t stand a chance of appreciating Bitcoin as their solution. Whether or not central banks recognize the importance of this knowledge in the battle over the future of money, they’re certainly taking every opportunity they can to spread ideas that push Bitcoin to the outskirts and earn CBDCs widespread acceptability. </p><p>“Bitcoin bad, CBDCs good,” the people think. And that’s all central banks need, the inferiority of their product be damned.</p><p>As Wouters rightly pointed out in his report:</p><blockquote><p>“Great strides have been made in education, but if Bitcoiners who are less experienced in education want to accelerate adoption, they would benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the education process to take ownership of it and become more effective. This starts by understanding the gap between their perspective and knowledge and that of the recipient… (S)ome people inside the Bitcoin space are not aware enough of how difficult it is for the average person to go through this journey.”</p></blockquote><p>As much as Wouters heroically explains the “how,” “what,” and “why” of the technological improvements that will help Bitcoin achieve widespread adoption, none of these holds a candle to people's&nbsp;<em>ideas </em>about money. Even if Bitcoin eventually becomes as easy to use as credit cards or cash, the masses could still reject it in favor of CBDCs for purely-ideological reasons. Grain will have defeated meat once again.</p><p>This is no reason to despair. Bitcoin isn’t inevitable, no. But victory is <em>possible</em>, and its fate is largely determined on the ideological battlefield. The gap between our deepest explanation of monetary economics and most people's views on the subject is vast. The same goes for the problems that fiat money continues to cause, the dangers of CBDCs, and how and why Bitcoin is a panacea for most of our money problems. </p><p>The educational effort before us is enormous, but, in the face of the enemy’s propaganda, necessary. And it’s <em>thrilling</em> — billions of people are about to learn about the greatest civilizational battle they hadn’t even known was occurring right under their noses. </p><p>Our war is an ideological one. Bitcoin doesn’t have to suffer the same fate as meat — and the industrial sludge that is CBDCs can perish in the sewers of history. We have persuading to do.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Logan Chipkin.

And that because of MicroStrategy’s large BTC holding, they “see MSTR as an attractive vehicle for investors looking to gain Bitcoin exposure.”</p><p>Significant near term catalysts for the price of Bitcoin to rise include the approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF by the SEC, development of the Lightning Network, potential FASB / GAAP accounting changes with respect to Bitcoin holdings, and the upcoming bitcoin halving in less than a year, according to the investment bank.</p><p>The report is bullish on the potential approval of a spot Bitcoin, joining many other firms in saying it’s a matter of “when” rather than “whether” one will eventually get approved by the SEC. TD Cowen’s Washington policy expert Jaret Seiberg wrote in a report earlier this month stating “we view approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF as inevitable.”</p><p>TD Cowen wrote “Bitcoin could ultimately represent a superior store of value relative to all other forms of money, whether fiat, metal -based, or digital, we believe.” The report describes Bitcoin’s properties of durability, portability, fungibility, verifiable, divisibility, and scarcity, establishing history, and censorship resistance as reasoning for this.</p><p>Bitcoin is relatively new, only being around since 2009. Despite this small amount of established history in comparison to gold or the dollar, TD Cowen believes that Bitcoin “has weathered enough trials in the market to suggest a high likelihood it will not vanish as a valued asset any time soon.” They predict that the asset will only grow stronger due to the lindy effect, meaning the longer Bitcoin can stay in existence, the more confidence society will have in it that it will continue to exist.</p><p>If Bitcoin is to take over and exceed the $17 trillion gold stocks market, it would put the price of BTC at around $800,000, in 2023 dollar terms of purchasing power, the report says.</p><p>As more adoption of Bitcoin happens and demand increases, TD Cowen predicts, in the short term, an upside scenario where the price of BTC appreciates 127% to around just above it's all time high at $70,000. But if regulators continue cracking down on the asset class, they predict a downside scenario of another crash back to $15,000.</p><p>Despite what many big firms have negatively reported on Bitcoin mining and its energy consumption, TD Cowen stated that “Bitcoin mining is in our opinion one of the most efficient, cleanest industrial uses of electricity and is improving its energy efficiency at a faster rate than most other industries.” The investment bank detailed that “simple economics – rather than government dictate – are driving bitcoin miners to the lowest -cost sources of energy.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4NzgwODE5OTI5MjQ1MDM1/single-bitcoin.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sazmining Establishes Sustainable Bitcoin Mining Facility In Paraguay]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sazmining powers sustainable Bitcoin mining in Paraguay with renewable energy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sazmining-establishes-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-facility-in-paraguay</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sazmining-establishes-sustainable-bitcoin-mining-facility-in-paraguay</guid><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sazmining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Paraguay]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Nik Hoffman]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 17:34:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM0OTMwNTU2MjMy/bitcoin-green-mining.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.sazmining.com/">Sazmining</a>, a hosted Bitcoin mining provider committed to 100% renewable energy, has set its sights on South America with the establishment of a new facility in Paraguay.

It’s usually mandated by governments, but this isn’t always the case. The currencies we use for everyday transactions in the modern era are all examples of fiat money, such as the U.S. dollar (USD), the euro (EUR), the pound (GBP) or the Chinese Yuan (CNY).</p><p>The term “fiat” is a Latin word that means “by decree” or “let it be done,” representing an arbitrary order that reflects the issuance of money as a government enactment. Fiat is one <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-money#:~:text=Money%20assumes%20various%20forms%2C%20spanning,are%20distributed%20by%20the%20government.">form of money</a>, along with representative and commodity money. While fiat money comes in various forms — physical banknotes, coins or digital units — representative money merely “represents” an intent to pay, like a cheque. Commodity money has an intrinsic value derived from the commodity it is made of; for example, precious metals, food and even cigarettes.</p><h3>How Fiat Money Works</h3><p>The currency itself has no intrinsic value but derives its worth from trust in the government that issues it; it is not representative of another asset like gold, silver or any other financial instrument.</p><p><strong>Government Decree</strong>: Fiat money is declared by the government to be the official currency of a country and is typically designated as legal tender. This means that banks and financial institutions must adjust their systems to allow the currency to be accepted as a form of payment for goods, services and debts within a given country. There are some exceptions to this rule, with <a href="https://www.cashmatters.org/blog/brief-history-scotlands-legal-tender">Scotland being the prime example</a>.</p><p><strong>Legal Status</strong>: Whereby the new money is given the status of legal tender, meaning it must be accepted as payment within the country. Laws and regulations are established to ensure the proper functioning of fiat money. These regulations cover issues such as counterfeiting, fraud and the overall stability of the financial system.</p><p><strong>Acceptance and Trust</strong>: The value of fiat money is based on the belief and trust that it can be exchanged for goods and services and the illusion that it will retain its value over time. The general acceptance of fiat money by the public and its use in everyday transactions are crucial for its functioning. Should the majority recognize the power of compounding inflation, they may begin to lose confidence in the government’s money. </p><p><strong>Central Bank Control</strong>: Central banks are responsible for maintaining the stability and integrity of the currency. They control and monitor the supply of base money and adjust it based on economic conditions and monetary policy goals. By managing the money supply, central banks aim to maintain price stability and promote economic growth.</p><p>Central banks have the authority to influence the value of fiat money through monetary policy tools. They do so by adjusting interest rates, adjusting lending conditions and through new money creation.</p><p>In extreme circumstances, central banks need to issue money to ensure that there is an adequate flow of coins and notes to allow the economy to function properly. In addition to this, cash, which in reality represents a small part of the total amount of money circulating in an economy, a second layer of money issued by commercial banks is injected into the economy in the form of bank deposits that are available at any moment. </p><p>When the government creates new money and increases the money supply, inflationary pressure arises, which is a typical state of fiat systems. Although rare, extreme conditions known as “hyperinflation” may also emerge, resulting in the currency losing value or becoming worthless.</p><h2>How is Fiat Money Created? </h2><p>Governments and central banks have several methods for creating new money and inflating the current supply. The most common methods employed are:</p><p><strong>Fractional Reserve Banking</strong>: Commercial banks are required to maintain only a fraction of the deposits they receive as reserves. This reserve requirement enables banks to create new money by lending out a portion of the deposits. For example, if the reserve requirement is 10%, a bank can lend out 90% of the deposited amount. Once the loaned out money becomes deposits for other banks which, in turn, hold back 10% and lend out the other 81%; new money is created. </p><p><strong>Open Market Operations</strong>: Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve in the United States, can create money through open market operations. They purchase securities, such as government bonds, from banks and financial institutions. When the central bank buys these bonds, it pays for them by crediting the accounts of the sellers with new money. As a result, the money supply increases.</p><p><strong>Quantitative Easing (QE)</strong>: Quantitative Easing and Open Market Operations are technically the same thing. The difference being that QE began in 2008 and is much larger in scale than regular OMOs and have specific macroeconomic targets to do with growth, activity and lending. </p><p>QE is therefore typically used in times of economic crisis or when interest rates are already low. In this approach, the central bank creates new money electronically and uses it to purchase government bonds or other financial assets from the market.</p><p>Direct Government Spending: Governments can also release new money by simply spending it into the economy. When the government spends on public projects, infrastructure or social programs, it effectively injects new money into circulation.</p><h2>Characteristics Of Fiat Money</h2><p>In such a context, three main characteristics are recognized as specific to fiat money, and they are the following:</p><ul><li>Lack of intrinsic value because it is not backed by a commodity or any other type of financial instrument.</li></ul><ul><li>Establishment by government decree, and the government also controls the currency supply.</li></ul><ul><li>Trust and confidence as the basis of value. Individuals and businesses must trust that fiat money maintains its value and acceptability as a medium of exchange.</li></ul><h3>Historical Context and Evolution</h3><h4>7th Century — China</h4><p>The Chinese Song dynasty was the first to issue paper money, the Jiaozi, around the 10th century C.E., although the very first banknote-type instrument was used in the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty (618-907). During this era, merchants would issue some form of receipt of deposit to wholesalers to avoid using the heavy bulk of copper coinage in large commercial transactions.</p><p>During the Yuan dynasty in the 13th century, paper currency started being used as a predominant medium of exchange, as was also mentioned by Marco Polo in “The Travels of Marco Polo.” </p><h4>17th Century — New France</h4><p>In the Canadian colony of New France, the official beaver pelt started to be replaced as a medium of exchange by French coins in the 17th century. These coins soon became scarce as France reduced its circulation in the colonies. When local authorities began having a severe shortage of money, they had to become creative to pay military expedition soldiers, who had to be remunerated to avoid the risks of mutiny.</p><p>Playing cards started being used as paper money to represent gold and silver. They became widely accepted by merchants in the colonies until they were recognized as an official medium of exchange. People did not redeem them and instead used them for payments while gold and silver were hoarded. Therefore gold and silver were valued for their store of value properties while playing cards utility centered around convenience and risk minimization, an example of the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/what-is-nakamoto-greshams-law#:~:text=Only%20once%20their%20basic%20needs,sophisticated%20needs%20in%20the%20future.">Nakamoto-Gresham’s Law</a> in action. When rapid inflation occurred due to the high costs of the Seven Years’ War, paper money lost nearly all its value in an event that could be considered the first-ever recorded hyperinflation.</p><h4>18th Century — France</h4><p>During the French Revolution, facing incumbent national bankruptcy, the Constituent Assembly issued a paper currency called “assignats,” backed by the value of the properties confiscated from the crown and the Catholic Church. </p><p>By 1790, assignats were declared legal tender and went through phases of new issuance with the idea that they would be burned at the same rate that the lands securing them were sold. Lower denominations were produced in large numbers in order to ensure wide circulation. However, while such measures were meant to stimulate the economy, they also increased inflationary pressures and led the assignats to continuously lose value. </p><p>By 1793, the political situation had precipitated with the outbreak of the war and the fall of the monarchy. The Law of Maximum — that had set price limits and punished price gouging to ensure continuous food supply to Paris — was lifted which caused assignats to lose almost all value (hyperinflate) in the following months. </p><p>In the aftermath Napoleon opposed the implementation of any other form of fiat currency and the assignats became memorabilia.</p><h4>18th to 20th century</h4><p>The transition from commodity to fiat money could be established over these two centuries. WWI, the interwar period and WWII marked profound turbulence and economic crisis worldwide, with many countries facing high debt levels and widespread unemployment. During World War I, the British government issued war bonds to finance its war efforts. </p><p>These were essentially loans taken from the public, with the promise of repayment with interest after the war. Such <a href="https://bankunderground.co.uk/2017/08/08/your-country-needs-funds-the-extraordinary-story-of-britains-early-efforts-to-finance-the-first-world-war/">war bonds were only one-third subscribed</a>, which led to the creation of “unbacked” money. Many other nations followed suit and applied the same measures to finance their own war efforts.</p><p>The Bretton Woods monetary system agreed upon in 1944 was established to provide stability in international financial transactions and promote economic growth. The U.S. dollar was denominated as the global reserve currency and linked other major currencies to the dollar through fixed exchange rates. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were also founded to facilitate international monetary cooperation and provide financial assistance to member countries.</p><p>In 1971, U.S. President Richard Nixon announced a series of economic measures that became known as the Nixon shock. The most impactful of these measures was the cancellation of the direct convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold, which effectively ended the Bretton Woods system. </p><p>The Nixon shock marked a shift towards a floating exchange rate system, where currencies fluctuate freely based on supply and demand. It had significant implications for global currency markets, the international monetary system and the price of all goods and services. (Some of these distortions can be viewed on the website <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">wtfhappenedin1971.com</a>.)</p><h3>The Transition From The Gold Standard To Fiat Money</h3><p>The gold standard was the monetary system prior to WWI, where a country’s currency was backed by gold. Governments held significant gold reserves to back their currencies, and individuals could exchange their paper money for gold at a fixed rate. This system provided stability and confidence in the currency’s value, as it was directly linked to a tangible asset.</p><p>From the start of WWI there was gradually a transition from the gold standard to fiat money, where currencies were no longer backed by a specific quantity of gold but instead derived their value from government regulation and public trust.</p><p>Various factors led to the shift in the monetary system, including the need for a more flexible monetary policy to address economic challenges effectively. The gold standard limited governments’ ability to control the money supply, interest rates and exchange rates, as they were tied to fixed gold convertibility. Furthermore, the initially decentralized commodity was difficult to transport, store and secure, so it became centralized by goldsmiths and later banks, leaving its fate subject to the whims of governments. </p><p>By the late 20th century, most countries had fully adopted fiat monetary systems. Governments and central banks took responsibility for managing the money supply, setting interest rates and attempting to stabilize their respective economies, although a long-term economic security could never be guaranteed. </p><h2>Fiat Money In The Global Economy</h2><h3>The Role Of Central Banks</h3><p>In the global fiat monetary system, the role of central banks is crucial in the implementation of monetary policy. They use various tools — such as setting interest rates — to influence economic conditions, stabilize prices and promote economic growth. </p><p>They are generally responsible for issuing and managing the national currency, regulating the money supply, ensuring the availability of an adequate quantity of currency and maintaining its integrity and stability. However, through manipulating rates and the money supply, central banks have profound influences on people and business, making it hard to plan for the future.</p><p>Central banks often have the authority to supervise and regulate commercial banks and other financial institutions within their jurisdiction. They set prudential regulations, conduct bank examinations and oversee the stability and safety of the banking system to help maintain financial stability and protect depositors and consumers.</p><p>They also act as lenders of last resort to provide liquidity and emergency funding to banks and financial institutions that may face financial distress or liquidity shortages. </p><h3>Impact On International Trade And Exchange Rates</h3><p>As a national currency, the fiat dollar significantly impacts international trade and exchange rates, being the most widely accepted medium of exchange that facilitates the buying and selling of goods and services between countries. Its ease of use simplifies transactions and promotes economic integration across borders.</p><p>Furthermore, exchange rates reflect the value of one currency relative to another and are influenced by a range of factors, including interest rates, inflation rates, economic conditions and market forces. Changes in exchange rates impact the competitiveness of exports and imports, influencing trade flows and the balance of payments.</p><h3>Fiat Money And Economic Crises</h3><p>Fiat money systems are susceptible to economic crises due to excessive money creation, poor fiscal management or financial market imbalances. Unsustainable policies can lead to inflation, currency devaluation and asset bubbles, resulting in economic downturns and crises. </p><p>To face such consequences, central banks take measures such as lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply to stimulate economic growth during a downturn. While these measures can boost economic activity and asset prices, they can also lead to speculative bubbles and unsustainable expansion. When these bubbles burst, they can trigger recessions and sometimes depressions. </p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-hyperinflation">Hyperinflations</a> are rare, but they have occurred in some cases of fiscal mismanagement, political instability or severe economic disruptions — notable examples include Weimar Germany in the 1920s, Zimbabwe in the 2000s and more recently, Venezuela. Hyperinflation is a fiat phenomenon that occurs when prices increase by 50% within one month. </p><p>Throughout history, it has occurred “only” 65 times, according to the Hanke-Krus research; however, it should not be underestimated as its consequences have been catastrophic and have destroyed countries’ economies and societies in the past.</p><h2>Properties Of Fiat Money</h2><p>Fiat money is excellent for everyday transactions, but it’s a poor store of value compared to commodity money like gold. Whether fiat is better than gold is subjective, and in some respects, it is. However, it has introduced its drawbacks as it scores poorly against critical properties such as scarcity, which many would argue is a fatal flaw.</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>Pros Of Fiat Money</h3><p>The implementation of fiat money has produced some advantages, especially in relation to gold, as highlighted here: </p><ul><li>Ease of use: Fiat money is more practical for everyday transactions due to its portability, divisibility and broader acceptance. It is convenient for a range of economic activities, from small purchases to large commercial transactions.</li><li>Lower costs and risks: It eliminates the costs and risks associated with storing and securing physical commodities like gold. It reduces the need for acquiring and safeguarding large gold reserves.</li></ul><h4>Pros for Governments</h4><ul><li>Greater flexibility in monetary policy: Governments and central banks can adjust the money supply, interest rates and exchange rates to respond to economic conditions and promote stability. This flexibility enables them to mitigate economic downturns, control inflation and manage currency fluctuations, which are notable features of the fiat system.</li><li>Prevention of gold drain: Government measures to safeguard their gold reserves and prevent the outflow of gold from the country become unnecessary. Maintaining an adequate supply of gold was crucial for the currency’s stability under the gold standard. </li><li>Sovereign control: Fiat money offers governments and central banks greater flexibility in managing monetary policy to address economic challenges and promote stability. They can adjust interest rates, control the money supply and handle exchange rates to respond to economic conditions and promote stability. </li></ul><h3>Cons Of Fiat Money</h3><p>Even though fiat money has widespread drawbacks, it became the predominant form of money globally primarily due to advantages in terms of flexibility, convenience and adaptability to complex economic systems. However, maintaining effective monetary governance and ensuring trust and confidence in the currency are critical to mitigate the potential disadvantages associated with fiat money.</p><ol><li>Inflationary and hyperinflationary risks: Fiat money systems are vulnerable to inflationary pressures and have been the cause of all hyperinflations in history. The prices of goods and services are forever increasing in fiat systems, but it’s due to the value of currency units decreasing. </li><li>Lack or loss of intrinsic value: Unlike commodity-based money like gold, fiat money does not have inherent or intrinsic value. Its value is derived solely from the trust and confidence placed in the issuing government and the stability of the monetary system. This reliance on trust can make fiat money susceptible to loss of confidence during economic or political uncertainty.</li><li>Centralized control, government dependence and manipulation: Fiat money systems are subject to centralized control by governments and central banks. Allowing flexibility in monetary policy opens the way for manipulation and mismanagement. Poor policy decisions, political interference and lack of transparency can lead to misallocation of resources, currency devaluation and financial instability. Centralized entities are also inclined to use censorship and confiscation.</li><li>Counterparty risk: Fiat money relies on the credibility and stability of the issuing government. In cases where governments face economic or political challenges, there is a risk of default or loss of confidence in the currency. This can lead to currency devaluation, capital departure or even currency crises.</li><li>Potential for abuse and corruption: Systems can be susceptible to abuse and corruption, mainly when there is a lack of transparency and accountability in monetary management. Unscrupulous practices, such as money laundering, illicit transactions or political manipulation of the money supply, can undermine the currency’s integrity and erode public trust. Such approaches may produce the Cantillon effect, where changes in an economy’s money supply cause the redistribution of purchasing power among people, altering the relative prices of goods and services which results in the misallocation of scarce resources.</li></ol><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/fiat-money-has-broken-the-world">How Fiat Money Broke The World</a></p><h2>The End Game</h2><h3>Limitations Of Fiat In The Modern Age</h3><p>It could be argued that fiat once served a purpose as gold failed to meet the postwar world’s demands. Similarly, current conditions indicate that we are reaching another inflection point, whereby fiat is no longer equipped for the digital age. </p><p>Even though fiat has digitized financial transactions, the reliance on digital platforms and systems introduces cybersecurity risks. Hackers and cybercriminals tend to target digital infrastructure and government databases, attempting to breach security measures, steal sensitive information or carry out fraudulent activities. These risks threaten the integrity of digital fiat money systems and the trust placed in them. </p><p>Privacy constitutes another concern. Online fiat money transactions leave a digital trail, raising apprehension about privacy and surveillance. Collecting and using personal financial data can produce privacy risks and potentially misuse sensitive information. </p><p>Artificial Intelligence and bots present yet another challenge, which could be solved by introducing private keys and microtransaction fees. Without addressing such challenges, the fiat system will be left behind with new online publishing monetization opportunities that are moving beyond the traditional advertising model.</p><p>Furthermore, fiat cannot sustain the extreme efficiency that code-driven digital currencies can provide, including quick settlement. Centralized systems will always rely on intermediaries to approve transactions that must go through different layers of authorizations before being confirmed, sometimes taking days or weeks to resolve. Bitcoin transactions can take as little as 10 minutes to become irreversible.</p><h3>The Rise Of Bitcoin</h3><p>Besides its transaction finality, bitcoin offers several advantages over fiat in the digital age. Decentralization, SHA-256 encryption and the proof-of-work consensus mechanism combine to create an immutable ledger. Its limited supply makes it inflation-proof, the perfect store of value and medium of exchange, as it appreciates sufficiently to be adopted as a unit of account.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Bitcoin is smart money, programmable, not confiscatable and has all the properties that make it the ideal asset to save and an excellent medium of exchange for merchants who want quick settlements.</p><p>Moreover, being a digital currency, bitcoin possesses an optimal capability to leverage the efficiency of AI for tasks like fraud detection and risk assessments within its services. It encompasses the advantageous characteristics of gold, such as its limited supply, while also embodying the divisible and portable nature of fiat currency. Furthermore, it introduces novel properties tailored to suit the requirements of the digital era.</p><p>In the coming years the transition from fiat money to bitcoin will represent the next evolution of money. The two monetary systems will co-exist for the time necessary for the world’s population to adapt to the best money humanity has ever experienced. In the meantime, we will likely continue to spend our national currencies and store bitcoin, as bitcoin has the necessary properties to store value through time. This will continue until the value of Bitcoin far exceeds the value of national currencies, upon which time merchants will refuse to accept the inferior money. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>How Does Fiat Money Differ From Commodity Money?</h3><p>Fiat money is based on trust in the government; commodity money is backed by a physical asset like gold.</p><h3>What Currencies Are Not Fiat?</h3><p>Currently, all currencies being used by governments are fiat currencies. El Salvador is the exception, as it has implemented a dual currency system of bitcoin and fiat. </p><h3>What Factors Can Affect The Value Of Fiat Money?</h3><p>Some examples include a lack of trust in the government that issues currency, uncontrolled money printing, unsustainable monetary policies set up by central banks and political (in)stability.</p><p>How Do Central Banks Regulate The Value Of Fiat Money?</p><p>Through interest rate adjustments, open market operations like buying or selling government securities (bonds) in the open market and reserve requirements for banks. Capital controls to manage currency volatility, maintain stability or prevent excessive inflows or outflows of funds could disrupt the domestic economy and impact the value of fiat money.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NjU3NDYzNTU1ODI3MzI4/fiat-money-feature-image-w_text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjU3NDI1OTc0OTk0NTYw/currency-properties.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5NjU3NDQzNjkxNjAzMDQ3/unnamed.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Human Rights Foundation Announces 20 BTC Bounty Challenge For Bitcoin Development]]></title><description><![CDATA[The HRF Bitcoin Bounty Challenge, with a 20 BTC total reward pool, has officially launched, with a focus on transactional privacy and Bitcoin self-sovereignty development.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-announces-20-btc-bounty-challenge-for-bitcoin-development</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/human-rights-foundation-announces-20-btc-bounty-challenge-for-bitcoin-development</guid><category><![CDATA[bitcoin development]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[BTC]]></category><category><![CDATA[human rights foundation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Mark Goodwin]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NjYzNDMzMDIzNDk3ODU2/hrf-logomark_1000x1000.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>In what is perhaps the most articulate and thorough Bitcoin grant offering to date, the <a href="https://hrf.org/">Human Rights Foundation</a> (HRF) has announced a 20 BTC set of bounty challenges in support of open-source Bitcoin developers building tools and services that increase the functionality of Bitcoin. These selections, inspired by the HRF’s research and work with activists across the world, were carefully chosen to perpetuate usability and increase privacy applications within Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, ecash and Nostr. </p><p>The challenges will run through the end of 2024, with any unclaimed bounties being converted back into the HRF’s Bitcoin Development Fund. The bounties themselves have a clear privacy, censorship-resistance, and self-sovereignty focus, bringing much needed attention towards some of the greater problems Bitcoin faces today. </p><p>The first bounty is a 2 BTC reward to port the Bitcoin UI Kit to the open-source Penpot project from its current Figma file format. This kit is a large set of design components for builders to use when developing Bitcoin projects. In its current format, its use is limited to those operating proprietary software, and the HRF aims to sponsor the “replication of the Bitcoin UI Kit on Penpot,” actualizing free access and self-hosted instances. </p><p>The second bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a serverless implementation of a payjoin protocol. The bounty specifically calls for a “production-ready version 2 payjoin protocol which may send and receive Payjoin transactions without requiring a sender or recipient to operate a public server.” The Serverless Payjoin bounty asks for use of BIP-21 unified bitcoin URIs, and to remain independent from a trusted third party (hence serverless) which “could expose user privacy in a non-trivial way.” </p><p>The third bounty is another 2 BTC reward for the creation of a Nostr client implementation of end to end encrypted group chats which is incapable of leaking metadata to potentially malicious third parties. In order to be eligible, the group chat must enable three or more users to communicate, with no ability for outside adversaries to gather the content of the messages, nor the identity or frequency of the users messaging. </p><p>The fourth bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a mobile Bitcoin wallet capable of receiving and sending Silent Payments without the use of a client-side full node. The wallet must be open-source and multi-platform, with a backend that is interoperable with other mobile wallets. The bounty asks for compliance with the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458">Silent Payments BIP</a>, written by&nbsp;Ruben Somsen and&nbsp;Josie Bake.</p><p>The fifth bounty, a 2 BTC reward for Human Readable Offers, calls for a bolt 12 offer generator to be integrated into a mobile wallet. Ideally, a bolt 12 offer could be communicated from a phone screen to a human without the use of copy and paste or a QR code scan, similar to how a Bitcoin or Lightning address is displayed.</p><p>The sixth bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a Lightning address generator within a mobile wallet that is self-custodial and accessible with just a smart phone. This implementation “should not require the user to set up their own web server.” </p><p>The seventh bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a mobile integration of border wallet functionality into a current Bitcoin wallet. The idea of a border wallet is to allow users to generate and practice memorizing their seed phrase for moments of cross-jurisdictional movement. </p><p>The eighth bounty, a 2 BTC reward for easy multisig functionality, is aiming to bring coordinated 2-of-3 multi-signature usability and generation within a mobile wallet at the tap of a button. The bounty also mentions the mobile wallet must remain self-custodial, complete with an open-source method to recover funds beyond the multisig application itself. </p><p>The ninth bounty is a 2 BTC reward for a self-custodial wallet implementation powered by<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/852.pdf"> FROST</a>, or flexible round-optimal Schnorr threshold signatures. This dynamic multisig protocol must allow for modification of the signer set without transferring the funds to a different address. </p><p>The tenth and final bounty is a 2 BTC reward for the ecash protocol, Cashu. This bounty, unlike the others, is split up into four 0.5 BTC bounties, with specific requirements for further applications of this open-source Chaumian ecash system. Bounty A calls for an iOS Cashu app, while Bounty B calls for an Android Cashu app, both requiring a fully functioning, open-source wallet with the capability to support multiple mints, use seed phrase backups for fund recovery, as well as send and receive ecash over Nostr. Bounty C aims to bring to life an open-source Cashu web widget capable of enabling anonymous payments for paywalled content, capable of interacting with a user’s bitcoin address. The final bounty, Bounty D, is a half bitcoin reward for actualizing Cashu-TS backup restore, Cashu-TS being a popular Cashu wallet library for application development. Users must be able to restore balances across various implementations of Cashu in order to provide security of users via a seed phrase back up scheme akin to how most users back up their bitcoin wallet.</p><p>The HRF stated that this is an "initial set” of 10 bitcoin challenges, and more bounties may be added as time goes on. The team or individual developer who “fully solves” any of the Bitcoin bounty challenges will be eligible to receive the 2 BTC bounty. All eligible submissions will be discussed among external industry experts in order to select the submission best meeting the requirements of their challenge. </p><p>Individuals and parties interested in participating are asked to contact <a href="mailto:bounty@hrf.org">bounty@hrf.org</a> with any question, and more details about the bounties can be found <a href="http://www.hrfbounties.org">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NjYzNDMzMDIzNDk3ODU2/hrf-logomark_1000x1000.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Institutional Bitcoin Products Will Drive Demand Ahead Of The Next Halving]]></title><description><![CDATA[As financial firms look to offer bitcoin products ahead of the upcoming halving, they are poised to capitalize on increasing demand.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/institutional-bitcoin-products-price-impact-ahead-of-halving</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/institutional-bitcoin-products-price-impact-ahead-of-halving</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[ETF]]></category><category><![CDATA[Halving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Deutsche Bank]]></category><category><![CDATA[Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Institutional Adoption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blackrock]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Marc Taverner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMzUxMjcwOTg2MTY0MTMx/big-bank.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Marc Taverner, CEO of XEROF, a digital-asset-focused financial services provider.</em></p><p>At long last, we’re entering the era of bitcoin financial products. After <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/bitcoin-2021-elusive-bitcoin-etf">several attempts at regulatory approval from numerous financial firms</a>, players like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">BlackRock may finally get their U.S. bitcoin ETF approved</a>, while global firms like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/deutsche-bank-applies-for-digital-asset-license-in-germany-as-tradfi-pushes-further-into-crypto/">Deutsche Bank are seeking their own crypto licenses</a>. </p><p>These institutional movers could be looking to hold bitcoin on their balance sheets ahead of the next halving. But make no mistake: I believe their larger play is to develop financial products for accredited investors and their “normal” customers to access bitcoin. </p><p>It’s important to note here that I said “financial products.” They are unlikely to pursue these licenses and approvals only to make it possible for their customers to buy bitcoin directly. This is for several reasons, all of which I hear regularly in my work as a licensed digital asset provider in Switzerland. Here’s why these large banks, investment firms, family offices, etc., won’t just “buy bitcoin.”</p><h2>Why Financial Firms Won’t Buy Bitcoin For Their Balance Sheets</h2><p>First, most customers don’t know how to open or manage their own bitcoin wallets. By “customers,” we’re not just referring to retail customers, but also to sophisticated money managers and institutions. Wallets are still an unforgiving and complex element of bitcoin management. Offering direct bitcoin purchases at scale requires infrastructure and education that these institutions are behind in cultivating. Not to mention that they would need to compete with the established dominance and captive market of companies like Coinbase.</p><p>Second, financial firms won’t be investing in bitcoin directly because holding the asset itself securely (unless you have a dedicated bitcoin security team) is hard to manage. And that is before they consider how to manage it for thousands or millions of customers. Holding direct bitcoin in wallets makes their institution a target for hackers, criminals or internal bad actors. I have seen an influx of consultancies helping these institutions create their own highly-secure cold storage processes and procedures. However, like the bank heist movies tell us, no system is completely immune to infiltration.</p><p>Third, buying bitcoin could reflect a “loss” of assets under management (AUM). If these institutions were to help their family offices or wealth managers directly buy bitcoin, that is no longer an asset they “manage.” This amount of AUM is a critical metric for banks, investment managers and other institutions. In contrast, by creating products, they would remain in management control.</p><p>The fourth reason relates to fee structure. Financial products bring convenience and also make it easier for the institution creating the product to make money. The next wave of bitcoin investors won’t be actively trading (so, there won’t be exchange fees), they’ll be buying and HODLing alongside their larger portfolio. How can you make your fees if bitcoin doesn’t move accounts? By charging a percentage fee of AUM.</p><p>Fifth, and perhaps most importantly: The upcoming halving will slice the supply of bitcoin itself, which based on the past, will be outmatched by demand. The current price of bitcoin, approximately $29,000 at the time of writing, has not yet built in the effects of the halving, but I’m sure it will and I fully expect the price to rise above $100,000 after the halving. And at that point, demand will increase. </p><h2>How The Next Halving Changes Things</h2><p>Investors and institutions wishing to capitalize on this opportunity will see lower bitcoin liquidity, 50% to be exact, which will increase competition for access to this limited resource. They will do what they’ve done in years past: look to invest in privately-held and publicly-listed Bitcoin miners or use a Bitcoin financial vehicle. </p><p>When I worked at European bitcoin miner Bitfury, we saw this influx of interest every four years as the halving drove up demand and prices and watched it wane as the price steadied itself to match demand. </p><p>But this coming halving, only the fourth ever, will be different. If any ETF manages to be approved by then, it will join the ranks of other bitcoin financial products (like Europe’s ETPs and active-managed certificates), which will see their star power rise alongside bitcoin demand. </p><p>I’d like to note that the Bitcoin halvings have always represented economic opportunity. Twelve months after the first halving, the price of bitcoin had <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/bitcoin-halving-how-does-the-halving-cycle-work-and-why-does-it-matter#:~:text=On%20Nov.,to%20%242%2C550%20by%20July%202017.">increased by over 9,000%</a> when rewards dropped from 50 to 25. Similar surges in price were seen following the second and third halvings as well. Still, without corresponding, easy and low-friction avenues to access bitcoin (besides buying bitcoin or investing in miners), the price didn’t fully reflect its increasing scarcity. Now, with greater awareness and easier/lower friction methods to access bitcoin, I believe it will.</p><p>So, why celebrate these entrants if they’re just adding layers of complexity and their pricing structure to what is already a stupendous asset? Because it’s great for the bitcoin price. More Bitcoin financial products mean more people (including people with a lot of money) can confidently access bitcoin. </p><p>The rise of bitcoin and its sister products is a significant victory. After years of persistence, we have convinced even the most skeptical that a lack of bitcoin reflects a weaker portfolio and an even weaker understanding of digital wealth.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Marc Taverner.

As a result, real estate has become so valuable because it serves the world as the primary asset to store value and protect wealth from resulting inflation. <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the">Around 67% of global wealth</a> <a href="https://www.onceinaspecies.com/p/bitcoins-full-potential-valuation?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share">(with some estimates putting the figure at $330 trillion)</a> is stored in real estate. </p><p>In the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live in it or use it for production.

In addition, <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2019/december/primer-negative-interest-rates">from about 2008 to 2022, there has been a low to negative interest rate policy around the world</a>, which has prompted investors to withdraw their savings from the bank and invest them. </p><p>But even more recently, macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds have exposed the weakness of real estate as a physical store of value and demonstrated the benefits of bitcoin as a digital store of value.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Physical Vs. Digital Stores Of Value</h2><p>Some of the benefits of using bitcoin as a store of value became evident in Ukraine last year. After the escalation of the Ukrainian-Russian conflict on <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20230214-february-24-2022-the-day-russia-invaded-ukraine">February 24, 2022</a>, some Ukrainians<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html"> turned to Bitcoin to protect their wealth</a> as they fled their homes. Real estate, on the other hand, would have had to be left behind. In German, real estate translates to “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=german+word+for+real+estate&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS997US997&amp;oq=german+word+for+real+estate&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160j33i671l5.2422j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">immobilie</a>,” which literally means “to be immobile.” Owning real estate creates a local dependency that can pose a problem in a world of ever-increasing conflict and radicalization. </p><p>What do you do when war breaks out? You can't take real estate with you. This may sound like a dystopia to some, but if you are serious about long-term wealth management, you should consider the worst-case scenario. The fear of a third world war, in whatever form, is not at all illogical. Who would have thought that there would be war in Europe as we see today? Perhaps we are already in the middle of World War III. Real estate is not only difficult to move or liquidate in times of crisis, it is also expensive to maintain, easy to destroy, tax and confiscate. I will go into more detail about that in a moment.</p><p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, is relatively easy and cheap to maintain. You don’t have to worry about daily maintenance, rent or repairs in the way you do with real estate and can self-custody your bitcoin.</p><p>Bitcoin is a digital commodity, one does not have to worry that it will be destroyed in the event of war. It is digital information. <a href="https://twitter.com/DocumentingBTC/status/1650152272670728196">Bitcoin is more powerful than the top-500 supercomputers in the world combined</a>. The internet is at greater risk of collapsing than the Bitcoin network and our bank accounts are at greater risk of being hacked than Bitcoin, which is <a href="https://twitter.com/epodrulz/status/1655542080456871938?s=20">more secure than any other digital infrastructure</a> that has ever existed due to its decentralization.</p><h3>Taxation </h3><p>Totalitarian states use taxation to oppress minorities, dissidents and ethnic groups. “<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judensteuer">Judensteuer</a>” or “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenverm%C3%B6gensabgabe">Judenvermögensabgabe</a>,” for example, refers to various taxes or anti-Semitic levies to which Jews were subjected in Nazi Germany. These were used by the German state to deprive Jews of their livelihoods. In addition, <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-failing-banks-paved-hitlers-path-power-financial-crisis-and-right-wing-extremism">Germany had financial problems in the 1930s due to the high reparations that had to be paid to France after losing the first world war</a>. The wealth of German Jews was relatively easy prey for improving the German state budget. </p><p>When states face bankruptcy, they often begin to arbitrarily tax citizens. Tangible assets such as real estate are particularly easy to tax due to their physical natures. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is difficult to tax, due to its digital nature. Thus, it is hard for totalitarian states to steal bitcoin. Given the ever-present possibility of totalitarianism, conflict and the fatal consequences that these can have on our personal freedoms and prosperity, it is important to keep a significant portion of one's wealth in a sound and mobile digital asset such as bitcoin, rather than tangible assets like real estate that are costly to maintain, and easy to destroy, tax and confiscate. </p><h3>The Risk Of Confiscation</h3><p>I still remember very well the stories of the older Jews that I heard during the breaks in synagogue during my childhood in Hamburg, Germany — the horrors of the Holocaust and the constant fear of property confiscation and the associated inability to organize an escape or start a new life abroad. I remember one elderly gentleman in particular who proudly told me that he had diamonds in his molars in case he had to fly out of Germany again. These stories shaped me a lot and allowed me to understand the value of bitcoin.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The fate of the Jews in Nazi Germany is a painful history lesson that teaches us the importance of property rights and the need to store wealth in a digital asset like bitcoin that is difficult to confiscate and easy to move or liquidate in times of crisis. Unfortunately, the repressions against Jews were not isolated cases in history. Property confiscation happens all the time. <a href="https://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1497&amp;context=ilr">Many lost their property in Cuba when Fidel Castro took over</a>, as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">Michael Saylor likes to point out</a>.</p><p>“Seizing companies and seizing buildings is easy,” <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/microstrategy-ceo-michael-saylor-interview-the-predator-prey-dynamics-of-bitcoin">Saylor has said</a>. “It’s easy to nationalize an oil company. It’s easy to seize all the gold. It’s very difficult to seize passwords in people’s heads.”</p><p>In contrast, bitcoin is property that truly belongs to you. When stored in cold storage (offline), bitcoin are the holder’s alone and are not at risk of confiscation by third parties. In addition, little can stop you from selling or taking bitcoin with you. You are not dependent on lengthy, bureaucratic processes as with real estate transfers. In case you need to relocate, you just need to memorize 12 or 24 words, the backup (seed phrase) for your bitcoin wallet. You could escape a war zone, restore your bitcoin wallet with the backup and have access to your wealth again. This is truly revolutionary and a value proposition that will result in exponential demand for bitcoin and subsequent price increases due to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-happens-bitcoin-after-21-million-mined/">bitcoin's fixed supply cap of 21,000,000</a>.<br></p><p>When demand increases and the supply remains near constant, as is the case with bitcoin, the price must increase, mathematically speaking. There is also the fact that there is not only a limited supply of bitcoin, but that there will be less bitcoin over time because as, for example, passwords are forgotten or people who own bitcoin are no longer able to access or transfer it for various reasons. Due to unpredictable technological advances, it could be possible to crack certain wallets in the future. However, not all bitcoin that are “lost” will be found.</p><p>Bitcoin serves as an excellent hedge against the threat of war, destruction, taxation and confiscation. It is easily portable, noncustodial, censorship resistant, divisible, durable and easy to move or liquidate in times of crisis. It is the ideal store of value. </p><h2>Bitcoin Is Digital Real Estate</h2><p>Bitcoin offers easy access to property, the ability to store value and build wealth — functions traditionally fulfilled by real estate. However, bitcoin fulfills these functions much better. Given bitcoin’s vastly superior properties as a store of value, it has the potential to absorb a significant portion of the monetary premium that real estate carries as a store of value today. Until now, bitcoin has largely been understood as an alternative to gold (<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/gold/marketcap/#:~:text=Estimated%20Market%20Cap%3A%20%2413.011%20T,world's%20above%20ground%20gold%20reserves.">which has a market cap of $12.9 trillion</a>) due to its limited supply and excellent monetary properties. However, it is a direct competitor to the world's most used store of value, real estate, an asset with a market cap of $330 trillion. </p><p>If we assume that bitcoin will absorb 10% to 15% of the real estate market cap over the next few decades, it has the potential to become a $30 trillion to $50 trillion asset. That would mean $1.5 million to $2.3 million per bitcoin if the bitcoin supply were at its theoretical maximum of 21 million. </p><p>Nobody can predict the future, but this calculation should clarify what opportunities Bitcoin presents. It therefore makes sense for a real estate investor to get involved with Bitcoin at an early stage. It is well known that those who adopt new technologies first will benefit the most. </p><p>I've been a Bitcoiner for over 10 years. In 2012, during my philosophy studies, I heard about Bitcoin for the first time. In 2016, I started working full time in the real estate industry with a focus on project development, renovation and real estate management in a family office. For a long time I thought that real estate and Bitcoin didn't have much in common. However, this is not the case.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrR95PFYDFQ">Saylor began speaking publicly about the Bitcoin strategies his company MicroStrategy is pursuing in late 2020</a>, I realized that I too need to think about how we can bring Bitcoin into our real estate business. It quickly became clear to me that bitcoin, as a store of value, is in competition with real estate, which is used as such. So, I came to the conclusion that real estate investors whose business is the acquisition and construction of physical property are destined to hold bitcoin, since it is digital property. This statement may surprise you, but who would have thought in 1995 that <a href="https://www.indigo9digital.com/blog/4-secrets-to-walmarts-ecommerce-sucess#:~:text=Walmart%20is%20now%20the%20second,eCommerce%20performance%20then%20read%20on.">many retail stores would eventually also have a digital business in the form of a website or e-commerce store</a>? Of course, e-commerce websites and retail stores are more alike than bitcoin and real estate are, but it's the best comparison to show the need for real estate investors to get involved with Bitcoin</p><p>In addition, bitcoin's price potential is significantly higher than that of real estate, which has already completed its adoption cycle as a store of value. As deflationary money, bitcoin can also support real estate developers in their core work of project development and maintenance, which are cost intensive. Construction cost and utilities increase with inflation. Bitcoin can help protect capital from inflation and thus position project developers for the future. Furthermore, the real estate industry is currently being plagued by geopolitical and macroeconomic issues. This is likely to increase in the future. Bitcoin offers a serious solution to build capital reserves outside of the turbulence of the existing financial system.</p><p>Consequently, for any real estate investor who is a rational market participant, the following questions should be asked: How can I accumulate as much bitcoin as possible as quickly as possible while it is still relatively cheap? And how can I add a Bitcoin strategy to my core business? </p><h2>Bitcoin Strategies For Real Estate Investors</h2><p>Based on my personal experience, I will outline four strategies for real estate investors to accumulate bitcoin. Which strategy you follow depends on your conviction, the size of the real estate portfolio you own, your experience and your risk tolerance. I will also explain how a Bitcoin strategy can potentially support real estate investors in their core businesses of property acquisition, construction and management.</p><h3>One: Use Some Of The Profits From Your Business To Buy Bitcoin</h3><p>Bitcoin's advantages over real estate in its function as a store of value should not distract from the profitable business of real estate development. I'm not asking you to stop developing real estate, I'm asking you to add a Bitcoin strategy. If you're running a successful real estate development business, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to stop overnight and focus all of your attention on Bitcoin, especially due to the high debt burden that real estate development brings with it and which must be paid back. Rental income from completed properties is necessary to pay down debt over time.<br><br>Bitcoin is a near-perfect store of value, but it does not generate income to pay off debts, for example. Speculating on bitcoin’s price increases to pay off debt incurred to build or purchase a property carries a lot of risk, because bitcoin is volatile and therefore not suitable for planning monthly interest payments. However, you can use part of your profits that you make from the real estate business to accumulate bitcoin. </p><p>How much is up to you, but 10% to 25% seems reasonable to participate in Bitcoin's exponential growth without impacting a core business. You would still have more than enough capital to continue your existing real estate business and meet all of your obligations, but also to buy bitcoin with enough capital to properly position yourself for the digitization of property. Many retail companies missed the leap into e-commerce and surely suffered significant business losses as a result. Real estate investors unwilling to delve into digital property (bitcoin) will face a similar fate. </p><h3>Two: Use Rental Income To Buy Bitcoin And Build Reserves</h3><p>If you bought real estate with the vision of holding it for the long term and living off of the cash flow, you can buy bitcoin with the rental income from your real estate. On top of that, bitcoin is the perfect money to build maintenance reserves as it is disinflationary (meaning there will be less supply over time). </p><p>If the supply of a money remains almost constant or decreases and the demand increases over time, the price of the money increases. Demand for bitcoin will increase over time due to its exceptionally good monetary properties. This means that bitcoin gives you increased purchasing power in the long term, which can be used for maintenance and modernization measures, which are important in order to maintain the value of a property. </p><p>Given the high levels of monetary inflation in fiat currencies, simply holding the rental income in a bank account is not a sufficient strategy. Inflation will melt the value of your cash flow. In addition, regulation and ESG requirements will increasingly force property owners to “modernize” in the future, which is likely to continuously increase property maintenance costs over time. Bitcoin gives you the opportunity to prepare for this.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Bitcoin maintenance reserves are a long-term treasury management strategy for real estate investors, outside of the uncertainty of the inflationary fiat system. </em><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/14-nervewracking-photos-from-high-atop-old-school-nyc-skyscrapers-photo-gallery-gothamist--586101339024351608/"><em>Source</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>You can use various bitcoin-only service providers to buy bitcoin using rental income. In Europe, there are companies like <a href="https://relai.app/">Relai</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinreserve.com/">Bitcoin Reserve</a>, for example. In the U.S., you can use <a href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/">Swan Bitcoin</a> and in Canada, <a href="https://www.bullbitcoin.com/">Bull Bitcoin</a>. I have personally had positive experiences with Relai. I have not used the other companies mentioned, but have heard good feedback from others. </p><p>However, you need to build and manage your bitcoin treasury<em> </em>with care. Bitcoin is very volatile. It's important to only convert part of your rental income into bitcoin (perhaps 5% to 20%) so that there are always enough liquid reserves to be able to service ongoing maintenance costs and outstanding debts. </p><p>Bitcoin maintenance reserves are a long-term treasury management strategy outside of the current uncertainty of the traditional banking system. I'm fed up with the behavior of most banks. Their services and opinions change with central bank interest rates (which change arbitrarily). </p><p>Building a bitcoin treasury protects against bad decisions by central banks and gives real estate investors the opportunity to become more independent. When stored in cold storage, those bitcoin are the holder’s alone and are not at risk of default due to the actions of third parties, including banks and exchanges, or rising monetary inflation and arbitrary central bank decisions. </p><p>I want to point out that you have to act sensibly and not take unnecessary risks. Bitcoin speculation can “break your neck.” You likely must be able to wait five to 10 years before using bitcoin reserves in order to benefit from bitcoin's long-term price appreciation. </p><p>It is also of importance to note whether a property is privately owned or owned through a company, as this can have tax implications for owning and selling bitcoin. Discussing this in detail is beyond the scope of this article. You can talk to a tax advisor you trust or actively seek one who is knowledgeable about bitcoin and its tax implications. </p><p>If you decide to get started with Bitcoin, start slowly and increase your commitment over time as you gain confidence. In the beginning, the whole process can be overwhelming. Don't let that discourage you.</p><h3>Three: Sell Real Estate To Buy Bitcoin</h3><p>If you own multiple properties and have already paid off a significant portion of the debt you incurred to purchase or build those properties and understand that bitcoin is a better store of value, which means it will generate higher returns than real estate in the future, it can make sense to sell real estate to buy bitcoin. This must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>For example, I work for a relatively-young real estate company. The completed properties are still highly indebted. It would be too risky to trade the security that the company has from the proceeds of a completed property to pay off its debt for bitcoin's volatile price appreciation.<br></p><p>However, if you are in a position where your real estate is not highly indebted, this strategy allows you to use bitcoin as a diversifier to protect part of your wealth from the threat of war, destruction, taxation or confiscation by a totalitarian government and participate in bitcoin’s exponential price appreciation, which will most likely outperform any real estate investment over time.</p><p>Based on my observations of Saylor and how he managed to make <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/">MicroStrategy the company with the largest bitcoin reserves in the world</a> in the shortest amount of time, there's a much more viable strategy I've found for enabling real estate investors to buy bitcoin at scale. Namely, taking on debt against real estate as collateral to buy bitcoin.</p><h3>Four: Leverage The Value Of Real Estate Into Bitcoin </h3><p>Software intelligence firm MicroStrategy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsftdrp5w8Y">famously borrowed to buy bitcoin</a>. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/27/microstrategy-pays-off-silvergate-loan-buys-more-bitcoin/">The firm uses its business income </a>to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/03/27/microstrategy-pays-off-silvergate-loan-buys-more-bitcoin/">pay off the debt while holding bitcoin for the long term</a>, participating in bitcoin's exponential appreciation in value over time. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/28/michael-saylors-microstrategy-now-holds-over-46b-worth-of-bitcoin/">The company now holds over 150,000 bitcoin</a>. </p><p>Real estate investors are experts at raising outside capital, usually for the purchase and development of new properties. Using existing real estate to incur debt and buy bitcoin may be an even bigger business opportunity though, as the value of bitcoin is likely to grow significantly faster than real estate over the long term. Thus, a higher return may be achieved. Fully-rented properties are the perfect collateral for borrowing to buy bitcoin, as the rent generates cash flow. Therefore, bitcoin never has to be sold to pay off debts. Instead, the rental income can be used to do so. Since the loan is repaid with the rental income, bitcoin's volatility is secondary. </p><p>Anyone who is uncomfortable going into debt to buy bitcoin can use a small part of their real estate portfolio (2% to 5%) for such a project. So, the risk is relatively low, but you still participate in the upside potential of bitcoin. By now, the Bitcoin network is so strong that the risk of not buying bitcoin is greater than the risk of buying bitcoin, <a href="https://rockstarinnercircle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Why-Every-Fixed-Income-Investor-Needs-To-Consider-Bitcoin-As-Portfolio-Insurance.pdf">as Greg Foss so often points out</a>.</p><p>By taking on debt, you also don't jeopardize your core business if Bitcoin should fail (for whatever reason), since you can pay off the debt over time with rental income. As long as there is enough rental income to meet existing obligations, including the interest on an initial construction loan and the provision for any costs that may arise (maintenance, renovation, legal, taxes, etc.), you are not taking on any unnecessary additional risk.</p><p>The more comfortable you feel, the higher the debt ratio can be. It's entirely up to the individual. <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/speculative-attack/">As Pierre Richard explained in his 2014 article “Speculative Attack,”</a> borrowing to buy bitcoin is a phenomenal business opportunity. If there is enough cash flow to pay off operating debt (plus maintenance costs in the case of real estate) and bitcoin's value is rising faster than interest rates, which I think is likely to be the case for decades to come, then it is a no-brainer, possibly the greatest business opportunity of our lives.</p><p>While this is the most viable strategy for accumulating bitcoin with real estate you own, it is also the most difficult. Due to the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, in my personal experience, banks are currently very reluctant to lend, specifically for buying an asset like bitcoin, which they likely don't understand. But it's worth telling banks you work with about the idea, as bull markets may see them willing to accept real estate as collateral for loans to buy bitcoin. </p><h4>Liquidity </h4><p>Sensibly using real estate as collateral to borrow and buy bitcoin may solve another problem: liquidity. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/every-real-estate-investor-should-own-bitcoin">Real estate is an illiquid and immovable asset</a>. Using immovable liquidity in income-generating real estate to buy bitcoin can be a good option to protect wealth from destruction or confiscation, should one need to relocate. </p><h4>Creditworthiness </h4><p>Finally, real estate development depends heavily on the ability to build creditworthiness. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-pristine-collateral">Bitcoin is pristine collateral for lending</a> and will potentially help to build creditworthiness over time. Due to the limited supply of bitcoin, an increase in adoption is accompanied by an increase in price. For a real estate developer, this means that the more bitcoin you own, the more collateral there is to build credit and fund real estate construction in the future.</p><h4>Bitcoin-Denominated Cash Flow</h4><p>Bitcoin mining could be considered a bitcoin-denominated revenue stream, similar to real estate rental income (as pointed out by <a href="https://twitter.com/DrBitcoinMD">Dr. Bitcoin</a> in a recent conversation we had). This should, in the long term, attract real estate investors to Bitcoin mining as it reflects the realities of the real estate business. However, it is beyond the scope of this article to go into detail about this.</p><h2>Bitcoin And Real Estate Go Hand In Hand</h2><p>In summary, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/why-bitcoin-is-digital-real-estate">the characteristics of bitcoin reflect many of real estate’s value propositions</a>, on top of offering more fundamentally-secure custody, easier maintenance, a fixed supply cap and, most importantly, the ability to liquidate or take your wealth with you if necessary. Bitcoin is the ideal store of value: secure, digital, difficult to confiscate or tax and virtually impossible to destroy.</p><p>Real estate also has its advantages, namely cash flow and the possibility of calculated leverage. Which is why it is so particularly interesting for bitcoin accumulation.<br></p><p>Bitcoin and real estate go hand in hand. One is an illiquid but physical income-generating asset and the other is a highly liquid, digital asset. You can sell real estate to buy bitcoin if you think it's a good deal. If one chooses to keep a property, the rental income can be used to accumulate bitcoin, which in my opinion is great money for building long-term maintenance reserves. </p><p>We're living in a transitional period, so it's great to take advantage of real estate investment incentive structures while also considering bitcoin's asymmetric risk-reward potential. From my experience, real estate is the perfect collateral to borrow to buy bitcoin as the rental income can be used to pay off the debt. Whichever bitcoin strategy you choose, as a real estate investor you should decide how you want to take advantage of the opportunities that real estate offers in combination with Bitcoin. It may be a long time before the wealthy start parking their net worths into bitcoin instead of real estate. However, in my view, this is a great opportunity to get involved with bitcoin to position yourself in this early phase of the digitization of property. </p><p>Bitcoin's benefits as a store of value are not meant to dismiss the real estate development business. I'm not asking you to stop developing real estate, I'm asking you to add a Bitcoin strategy and, by doing so, to help build a financial system where access to property, the ability to store value and build wealth are accessible to everyone. Monetary inflation has made real estate so expensive that <a href="https://anytimeestimate.com/research/housing-prices-vs-inflation/">it is unaffordable to many</a> and with that, the ability to build wealth is out of reach.  As digital real estate, bitcoin will create a financial system that will be far more accessible than it is today. This will enable greater productivity and efficiency in the global economy. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

Even within the U.K., <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2023/06/22/im-in-90000-of-student-debt-and-yet-im-set-to-graduate-without-a-degree-18998327/">tales of students leaving with £90,000</a> (about $115,000) of debt are not uncommon, which raises the question of the value that can be realized by a university degree when offset by this considerable cost. </p><p>To help manage the scale of this expenditure, it is now common for students to have part-, if not full-time, jobs, with recent figures showing this is the case for the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-65964375">majority of students</a> in the U.K. The same article also stated that the time some students spend on university work suffers as a result of the time they dedicate to paid employment. </p><p>As a university educator, this situation causes me great personal discomfort, with students taking on debt to get university educations that they cannot spend sufficient time on or truly benefit from, unable to develop the critical thinking skills that university graduates are prized for. This creates a quandary for budding university students: whether their time and money is better spent on university educations, developing practical skills or simply buying bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-will-make-you-rich-not-attending-a-university">as suggested by Bitcoin Magazine’s Nik Hoffman</a>.</p><p>University education has seen further difficulties in recent years. In addition to the costs of pursuing higher education, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the line between in-person and online education increasingly blurred. Attendance and engagement has long been <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tl.20287">an issue in universities</a>, and I can admit to having issues with those myself, where late nights made getting to a 9:00 a.m. lecture or staying for the second hour’s seminar beyond my constitution. Add the new option of “catching up” with lecture recordings or extensive material online, and the draw to attend in person can fall even further. </p><h2>Potential Solutions For Higher Education</h2><p>How to address this is becoming an increasingly-pressing issue for higher education, with institutions exploring options such as the earning of <a href="https://www.usg.edu/teaching-and-learning-excellence/assets/facultydevelopment/documents/ebook/NeilRigole.pdf">“digital badges”</a> for completing activities or attending sessions and <a href="https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-017-0984-2">progress tests</a> during modules to link engagement from earlier in those modules to final grades. Each of these options, while having potential to increase engagement, involve considerable costs to set up, and then can add additional duties on staff to administer and record the outcomes for each student. Unfortunately, keeping tasks sufficiently simple to quickly administer and record may lead to them becoming mundane, which in turn may not actually promote the engagement they aim for. </p><p>The problem is even more apparent on modules that require independent learning, such as dissertation modules that can act as a capstone of university learning, where the module material relates to relatively-generic research skills, which are then applied and developed as the student completes a project of their own choice. In comparison to a more traditionally-organized module, in which students gradually cover content for an essay or exam at the end of a semester, students need to do a lot of learning right at the beginning, in order to choose a relevant topic and be able to plan and design a project that, quite simply, cannot be left until a week before submission. While weight-bearing proposals and staged deadlines can be introduced to ensure earlier engagement with material, at times, they do not appear to promote sufficient engagement, with feedback from students continuing to take the form of “I wish I’d started work earlier.”</p><p>An alternate approach to promote engagement on modules has been to provide cash prizes for the best work. Unfortunately, given the disconnect between starting the project and receiving the prize, students who engaged well in the past are likely to be those who engage in these projects as well, whether there is a prize or not. For those students who are generally less engaged, they are also more likely to view such a prize as unachievable when comparing themselves against their peers, and therefore refuse to change how they approach their work. </p><p>The question is then raised about whether there could be a form of financial incentive, but one that is combined with promoting good working practices early in the module. Some form of “treasure hunt,” that requires students to cover the available material online, combined with attending sessions in person to complete the challenge and win a prize. Fortunately, Bitcoin fixes this.</p><h2>Engaging Students Early</h2><p>The solution now seems so simple, I’m annoyed that I was unable to see it before. But then again, isn’t this how many Bitcoiners feel as they look back on the first times they were introduced to Bitcoin? </p><p>The question is, what impact could embedding a bitcoin wallet seed phrase within module material have on early engagement in a module? The logic appears strong; by introducing the challenge at the beginning of the module, and then locating a 12- or 24-word seed phrase within specific material across the early parts of the module, engagement would theoretically be promoted. If students want to have a chance of opening the wallet, they would have to attend specific sessions and review critical material online.</p><p>By staging when particular material (with specific words) was available to students, there would be a reduced risk of students scanning through all of the material on the first day, while also providing slower starters with the ability to catch up, e.g., if only “x” number of words were available initially. In comparison to some forms of session engagement and progress testing, apart from embedding the seed phrase within material and the cost of the bitcoin itself, the costs associated with this approach are low. </p><p>By also keeping the volume of information about the prize provided to students relatively low (covering “value,” “bitcoin wallet” and “seed phrase”), the impact on the material that needs covering in the module is minimal. The potential benefits of this approach is that students will have to explore what these terms refer to, if they haven’t already come across them. The approach also <em>requires</em> the winner, and even those who complete the task but are unable to withdraw funds, to download a wallet, restore it from a seed phrase and then complete a transaction by sending the bitcoin to a wallet for which they control the private keys. The eventual winner will not simply know what Bitcoin is, but will have demonstrated they can use the technology.</p><h2>A Subtle Approach To Introducing ‘The B Word’</h2><p>In comparison to specific attempts to convince others of Bitcoin’s value, whether presenting them with the problem that Bitcoin fixes (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/an-orange-pill-for-bitcoiners">thank you, Austin Herbert</a>) or identifying those who can spread the word best (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/share-bitcoin-with-your-barber-or-stylist">thank you, Hector Alvero</a>), “orange pilling” would not be the direct aim of such a university program. Having said that, in a strange way, this approach would leverage the network of the lecturer, and could introduce the topic of Bitcoin to anywhere from 50 to 500 students in a given module. Hopefully, students trust the information they receive from their lecturers, with potential one-to-one follow ups providing opportunities for them to ask questions and develop their understandings. </p><p>To bring this Bitcoin experiment back to the world of academia, it is worth at least acknowledging how it may relate to learning theories. The well-established model proposed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00138871.pdf">John Briggs</a>, known as “constructive alignment,” suggests that it is not about the students or how the material is presented, but instead about the work the student does that determines what they learn. </p><p>The aim of embedding a bitcoin seed phrase into course material is meant to promote student engagement with material earlier, so they are able to formulate projects while still leaving time to complete them. The indirect orange pilling takes place as students become aware of Bitcoin, learn how they interact with the network and maybe, just maybe, begin their journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. </p><p>If students want to win the bounty, they will have to engage with the material, keeping an eye out for seed words, with every student starting from the same point, hopefully motivating them to engage sufficiently to have the chance of winning the prize. Even those who do not win the prize will hopefully have engaged more than they would have otherwise (a positive for university education). </p><p>The disappointing scenario would be if no one engages in the treasure hunt, but unlike giving a prize to someone who would have done the work anyway, this situation would at least mean the bitcoin would remain in the original wallet. A final scenario that could be seen as a risk would be if a student falls deep down the rabbit hole and ultimately neglects their research project. However, I may struggle to find a Bitcoiner who would view that as a completely-negative outcome.</p><p>Orange pilling people who are yet to understand Bitcoin is required on a massive scale, if adoption is to reach a critical mass. “Number go up” (NGU) technology is undoubtedly a great marketing tool, which may explain a level of interest that my own students had in “crypto” in 2021, that was simply not present in 2022, but NGU just does not encapsulate the richness of the subject. While embedding a seed phrase to promote student engagement earlier in a module is not an explicit, deliberate, enthusiastic or passionate orange-pilling move, it does promote interaction with and learning about the protocol for financial gain (winning the bounty). As <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-buy-bitcoin-until-you-learn-more">Tim Niemeyer</a> wrote, learning about Bitcoin should be the first step before considering whether or not to buy the asset.</p><p>From the perspective of an educator, a secondary aim is to get the students interested in and talking about the module. From the perspective of a Bitcoiner, the aim is that, if nothing else, the next time someone mentioned Bitcoin, the students would have personal experience to draw from that has not been influenced by wider media or news reports about the latest scam. From both perspectives, providing final-year students, ready to progress into the wider business world, with more knowledge about such an important innovation as Bitcoin is a worthwhile activity.</p><p>Providing newly-recruited graduates (tasked with infusing new ideas and viewpoints into established businesses) such an informed opinion could help a business on a path toward embracing Bitcoin into their operations. A student may be able to say, “I once had a lecturer who put 200,000 sats in a wallet for us to claim” when dollar-sat parity has been reached. Alternatively (and maybe a little more realistically), they may say, “I paid off my student loan with bitcoin, and my first sats came from a Bitcoin-obsessed lecturer.” </p><p>I’d be happy if they said either.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rupert Matthews.

Countries such as Turkey, Lebanon, Nigeria and Argentina are already seeing bitcoin reach, or start to approximate, new all-time price highs, signaling a shift in wealth preservation and financial sovereignty. The thrust behind this trend is multifold, encompassing inflationary pressures, the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and the unique attributes of bitcoin.</p><p>A quick Google search for bitcoin against so-called “weaker” currencies in emerging markets, over a five-year time horizon, paints a clear picture.</p><section><figure>

    </figure><div><em>View the 4 images of this gallery on the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-bitcoin-adoption-is-growing-against-weak-currencies">original article</a></em></div></section><p>I have shared these observations before in a <a href="https://twitter.com/BenCaselin/status/1674378556590235649?s=20">Twitter thread</a> and discussions on Elon Musk’s platform have been lively on the subject. Some folks understandably see this as bullish and exciting, but it’s important to realize that such extreme price action essentially stems from deep-seated currency failures and often involves anxious suffering for people on the ground. Others point out that these flailing currencies aren’t really a benchmark for anything substantial, but such thinking only betrays hubris. It’s good to remind ourselves that <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2015/09/28/04/53/sp020416">some 85% of the world’s population lives in the emerging markets</a> — far from peripheral, the reality in these countries <em>is</em> the dominant experience and constitutes the mainstream. </p><h2>Understanding 'Weaker' Currencies</h2><p>To comprehend the Bitcoin phenomenon in these emerging markets, we must first understand the concept of "weaker" currencies. These are national currencies often characterized by high volatility, recurring devaluations and significant inflation rates. Such susceptibility is generally rooted in unstable domestic fiscal policies, including excessive government borrowing and overproduction of the money supply. However, the consequences of such monetary policy aren't contained within national borders; they ripple across the global socio-economic landscape, including in the form of migration and exacerbating inequalities. </p><p>Inflation erodes the value of money, diminishing purchasing power and fostering economic uncertainty. When combined with external factors such as the implications of the U.S. dollar's status as the global reserve currency, the impact is even more profound. Despite increasingly-loud objections from across the world, with ideas of a “BRICS currency” <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/06/25/dollar-reserve-currency-brics-brazil-russia-india-china-south-africa/">floating around</a>, the U.S. dollar is still the world's primary reserve currency and holds significant sway over global economic stability.</p><p>The greenback’s dominance means that many emerging markets are inherently linked to the U.S. economy. When the U.S. changes its interest rates, engages in quantitative easing or when Jerome Powell initiates another rate hike, the ripple effects are felt far and wide. Emerging markets may experience outflows of capital, instability and increased borrowing costs, intensifying economic challenges on the ground.</p><h2>A Digital Lifeline</h2><p>Amid these complexities, bitcoin has gained significant momentum. The reasons? It offers an escape hatch from economic volatility and a new way to store value. The case of Venezuela, where bitcoin adoption has been making headlines for years now, offers a vivid illustration. Hyperinflation has rendered the Venezuelan bolivar <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/venezuelas-bolivar-depreciates-20-per-dollar-prices-rise-2023-01-19/">virtually worthless</a>, pushing its citizens toward <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/11/11/venezuelas-bitcoin-story-puts-it-in-a-category-of-one/">bitcoin</a> as well as <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/latin-america-cryptocurrency-geography-report-2022-preview/">USD-pegged stablecoins</a> for everyday transactions and wealth preservation.</p><p>However, the value of bitcoin extends beyond its role as an inflation hedge. Its permissionless and peer-to-peer nature is also a game changer. Bitcoin is decentralized and requires no intermediary for transactions, making it accessible to anyone, anywhere, at any time. This characteristic is particularly appealing in regions where banking services are limited or non-existent, fostering financial inclusion.</p><p>For migrant workers sending remittances back home, bitcoin — using the Lightning Network — can make the process faster, cheaper and more efficient. It bypasses traditional banking systems and remittance service providers, which often charge exorbitant fees and are plagued by slow transaction times. The use of bitcoin for remittances can stimulate economic activity in these emerging markets, contributing to its growth and development.</p><h2>Beyond Speculation: A Tool For Financial Empowerment And Stability</h2><p>The rising acceptance of bitcoin in emerging economies serves as a testament to its potential to transform weak-currency environments and create more resilient, people-centered financial ecosystems. These trends point to an interesting paradox: While developed economies grapple with the question of Bitcoin's role, in part driven by a speculative bias born from the luxury of excess capital, people in emerging markets are already embracing its potential to redefine their economic landscapes, precisely for the reason it was created in the first place.</p><p>Nonetheless, the journey of Bitcoin in these emerging markets is just beginning. Challenges remain, including those around regulatory uncertainties, digital literacy and technological infrastructure. But, if anything, the surge of bitcoin in these economies signifies that when faced with adversity, the innovation pioneered by Bitcoin has the potential to chart new pathways to prosperity.</p><p>In essence, Bitcoin's rising influence in emerging economies underlines its versatility, not just as a speculative asset, but as a tool for financial empowerment and stability. The interplay between inflation, the U.S. dollar's global dominance and Bitcoin's attributes paints a compelling narrative of how the global economy's future may be reshaped by the digital currency revolution.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Ben Caselin.

Almost everyone who is doing the work to understand Bitcoin will eventually run into the cold, hard fact that, at its core, Bitcoin is about freedom. To those who have enjoyed individual liberties for their entire lives, the concept of freedom may be watered down or underappreciated. For those who live without it, freedom and individual liberty become pursuits of great importance. </p><p>Many people who are diving into Bitcoin will find themselves at a crossroads, having to choose between the speculative “get-rich-quick” mania of some crypto subcultures and the self-sovereign, owner-and-builder mentality that Bitcoin offers. </p><p><a href="https://www.amandacavaleri.com/">Amanda Cavaleri</a> embodies the latter. Humble, empathetic and generous with her knowledge, Cavaleri spends her time furthering the cause of authentic Bitcoiners. She’ll tell you that when she first heard about Bitcoin, it did not initially grab her attention. Thankfully, Cavaleri eventually latched onto what Bitcoin offers and has significantly contributed to the Bitcoin space since. </p><p>With a background in artificial intelligence, higher education and policy, Cavaleri has what it takes to move the ball forward when it comes to Bitcoin education. She is the board chair of the <a href="https://bitcointodaycoalition.org/">Bitcoin Today Coalition</a>, board member for the sustainable bitcoin mining company <a href="https://www.cleanspark.com/">CleanSpark</a> and co-author of “<a href="https://satoshistore.io/products/signed-version-of-bitcoin-and-the-american-dream-from-jimmy-song-english-version">Bitcoin And The American Dream</a>.” Cavaleri also hosts the annual <a href="https://www.apres.tech/bitcoin-ski-summit-2023">Bitcoin Ski Summit</a> in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in order to create a thought-provoking space for Bitcoiners to philosophize and have greater impact in their respective areas of expertise. </p><p>One of the many talents that Cavaleri brings to the Bitcoin space is her authenticity and empathy. She openly talks about her past and how everything is layered in life. Her work is truly special and it was an honor to discuss these topics with her.</p><p><strong>How did you first learn about Bitcoin and what <em>specifically</em> drew you to it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I first heard about Bitcoin from another entrepreneur in a shared office space in 2010. With very little life experience, I didn’t understand or appreciate the need for a peer-to-peer network and first understood it as something akin to loyalty points. It wasn’t part of my journey to understand right away and I didn’t buy in right away. Fortunately, the idea of the Bitcoin network never left me and I was gifted incredible interactions over the years. </p><p>During my entrepreneurial journey, I became obsessed with the notion of preserving and transferring wisdom across generations. Because we no longer live in multigenerational homes and ages are segregated by school, work and post-work, we aren’t naturally transferring lessons and traditions as we did when our species was more agrarian. An African proverb compares the death of an elder to a library burning to the ground. Each time someone dies, so does their unique insight and experience. </p><p>Wisdom is our most wasted natural resource — the lack of preservation and daily interaction with it deepens humanity’s historical doom loop of control, corruption and war. Mass reduction of time between generations has prevented younger generations from gaining a macro, long-term perspective. It is very possible that this disconnect between the ages is a substantial contributor to the increase in suicide rates of younger generations and other mental health issues. </p><p>The idea of wisdom as a keystone to humanity’s evolution, especially as algorithms deepen beliefs, haunted me. Bridging the generations and leveraging technology to preserve and share wisdom is a path worth building. The piece that was missing was a wise network and value transfer system. A solution needs to be able to have an unalterable ledger (preserve the content), be decentralized (one entity can’t control narratives) and have a mechanism to transfer value in a way that promotes freedom and equality (a system beyond fiat). There was no way to authentically leverage technology to preserve and share insights from humanity — until Bitcoin. </p><p>This realization is how I came to believe both the Bitcoin network and bitcoin the commodity are essential to the evolution of humanity so that we may build upon insight, not have to relearn lessons. Bitcoin is that wise technology and bitcoin is that wise representation of value. I started going to meetups and learning more about the technology. My path there was anything but direct, and like many, I had to see the underbelly of crypto to come to these realizations. </p><p>For me it was important to see the good, bad and ugly before I could be sure the solution already exists and it has been in my orb for 13 years. This slow learner is grateful that Bitcoin didn’t give up on her, which is why I decided to work on the parts of Bitcoin that I could be most useful: mining and policy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is your opinion on Bitcoin culture? What would you say should be the first step in making Bitcoin culture (in the United States) more inclusive?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Bitcoin culture is in the angsty, middle-schooler phase. Many of us are divergent thinkers and have been gaslit by centralized entities to believe we are wrong. While we have every right to be angry, it is time to heal and not use the tools of shame, fear and guilt that these systems have used against many of us to justify our behavior. Most people I know from Bitcoin are brilliant, kind, courageous humans. These are the humans I want to fight alongside. </p><p>Bitcoin Twitter is not real. It’s an algorithm that feeds off of drama and negativity. Most of us aren’t clickbait-angry, post-algorithmic, manipulating attention seekers. Spend time on Nostr and see what we are really like. We’re philosophical, macro-oriented and generally bullish on humanity. Sometimes we’re even funny and fun. </p><p>While it is extremely important that we have faced and overcome our own pain, it is even more important that we show compassion to those who are pawns in broken systems. It is this breadth of experience and strength in personal growth that will allow us to build a future worthy of future generations. </p><p>I love seeing people go in and work on the one variable we can each control: ourselves. I’ve seen a lot of that in a physical and environmental sense as we become more connected to our food, many have ditched alcohol, we spend time in nature, etc. I look forward to more digging into the less tangible aspects of healing — emotional, spiritual, etc. </p><p>The longer in, the deeper the rabbit hole gets. For me, Satoshi’s anonymity is extremely humbling. We are fortunate to be part of something bigger than ourselves.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How do you typically respond to those who are dismissive of Bitcoin, especially those in your circle of friends/influence?</strong></p><p>Arguing is low-vibe energy (for me). Largely, we get enough negativity in media, so I try to listen more than respond. Sometimes people just need to be heard and if they feel they’ve made up their mind at this point, there’s no point in debating until they’re ready again. We’re all on our journeys and for me the patient, hopeful Bitcoin teachers won me over. </p><p>One example I use often is of a bitcoin circular economy I visited in the mountains of Peru outside of Cusco. Motiv, a nonprofit working in South America, helped women artisans of all ages sell traditional scarves and accessories to earn an income, many for the first time. Because there is no banking option, bitcoin was the easiest form of payment to accept. Not only did these women prefer that I pay them in bitcoin, but they told me how much bitcoin changed their lives. They then showed me by taking me to a local store to buy groceries for the week with bitcoin they just earned from my purchase and to their childrens’ school (where the teachers are paid in bitcoin). This technology has brought resources and hope to an impoverished rural town. </p><p>I want people to feel the optimism I feel with Bitcoin. That’s what I focus on — stories of hope that show how it is used throughout the world. Some call this approach positive attraction, which seems much more effective to me than fear, greed, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In your opinion, why is it important to close the gender gap in Bitcoin interest and adoption?</strong></p><p>There are marketing reports indicating that millennial females will be the number-one adoption demographic over the next couple of years. It would be nice to welcome them warmly. That’s what I will keep doing because that’s what worked for me. Keep focusing on education, humility and patience. Treat others as if they are a family member because in a way we are a growing Bitcoin fam. We’re fortunate to have this layer of truth to guide our interactions. </p><p>The most important thing we can each do is go in. No one is going to do that work for you. It is scary — it is worth it. The inner proof of work by a majority of us will elevate what we build in the future. Now is the time to clean up so we can be strong, compassionate, visionary leaders during the chaos of the bull. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Becca Bratcher.

I’ve come to realize that many people don’t really understand the problems they are experiencing. And, because of this conundrum, the questions they ask me when seeking assistance may not yield an answer that actually solves those problems. I’ve come to realize that a large part of my job has become uncovering the actual problems, so that I can fix them at their roots. </p><p>Therein lies a common thread I’ve found with “orange pilling” and teaching people about Bitcoin. Much like the soldier who approaches me, asking a question that doesn’t quite make sense, your friends and family may be asking you strange questions as well — without a real understanding of what problems Bitcoin is trying to solve. </p><p>As stewards of the Bitcoin space and de facto ambassadors to our circles of acquaintance, I see the Bitcoiners’ role as similar to that of a customer service professional. People don’t understand the monetary system, let alone the problems they face within.

For some, January 3 has become <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/proof-of-keys-a-critical-test-for-bitcoin">“Proof Of Keys Day”</a> to promote the importance of holding one’s own private keys, as opposed to trusting them with a cryptocurrency exchange or other third party. Other Bitcoin holidays commemorate the first bitcoin transaction (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-pizza-day-a-day-of-celebration">“Bitcoin Pizza Day”</a>), the sovereignty of community consensus and the resolution to the “Blocksize Wars” (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/industry-events/celebrating-the-history-and-spirit-of-bitcoin-independence-day">“Bitcoin “Independence Day”</a>) and the day Nakamoto publicly released the white paper conceptualizing Bitcoin (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/trammell-on-satoshi-bitcoin-white-paper-day">“Bitcoin White Paper Day”</a>). </p><p>Coincidentally, this last one falls on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/31/martin-luther-shook-the-world-500-years-ago-but-did-he-nail-anything-to-a-church-door/">the same day Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the door of the Wittenberg Church in Germany</a>, ultimately upending many of the Catholic Church’s most cherished traditions, which had barely changed in 1,500 years. </p><p>Bizarre as it may sound, if a group of self-proclaimed wizards get their way, the Bitcoin “religion” will soon recognize another holiday to mark another day of significance in the history of Bitcoin, at least in their eyes. In a Twitter Spaces, I have heard <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer">Udi Wertheimer</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl">Eric Wall</a>, two proponents of Bitcoin Ordinals who refer to themselves as “Taproot wizards,” discuss promoting January 24 as Bitcoin “JPEG Day” to commemorate the day on which a user on the <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/">Bitcoin Talk</a> forum, who went by the name of “Sabunir,” <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25">attempted to sell a JPEG in 2010 with technical support from none other than Nakamoto themself</a> (<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-man-behind-bitcoin-pizza-day-is-more-than-a-meme-hes-a-mining-pioneer">nearly five months before the infamous pizza purchase</a>).</p><p>It might not be a stretch to view Wertheimer and Wall — along with <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/02/23/casey-rodarmor-why-i-developed-the-ordinals-bitcoin-nft-project-coindesk/">Casey Rodarmor</a>, who developed Ordinas, and someone who goes by the pseudonym <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata">Domo</a>, who <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-ordinals-surpass-inscription-as-casey-rodarmor-steps-down">developed the BRC-20 token standard</a> — as the Bitcoin community’s equivalent to Martin Luther. These four “heretics” managed to make the Bitcoin network an environment for transacting non-fungible tokens (NFTs), resulting in many hardcore Bitcoiners (often dubbed “maximalists” or “maxis” for short) blowing a gasket on Twitter. </p><h2>The Religion Of Bitcoin</h2><p>I’m certainly not the first person to analogize Bitcoin’s most fervent enthusiasts with religious evangelists. <a href="https://www.michaellewiswrites.com/#top">Michael Lewis</a>, the author of books such as “Liar's Poker,” “Moneyball” and “The Big Short” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KWuS_wOUnY&amp;t=1671s">used this comparison on stage at Bitcoin 2023</a>. Describing the process of interviewing Bitcoin enthusiasts for his upcoming book about FTX’s disgraced founder and CEO Sam Bankman Fried, Lewis said:</p><p>“The feeling I have is that you can say something wrong. When I was (writing) “The Blind Side,” my main characters were evangelical Christians, but they were suspicious of me because they sensed I didn’t share their belief structure… It isn’t that I’m in or out when it comes to Bitcoin, it’s just that I haven’t thought much about it, honestly. I’ve interviewed — I don’t know — 200 people, and quite a few of them were like, ‘What are you gonna say about Bitcoin?’… It’s interesting, it’s like a religious thing.”</p><p>This “religious thing” has always irked me, and here’s why: the maximalists who collectively created their own bizarre Bitcoin religion have anointed themselves guardians of it and continuously attempt to apply litmus tests to other Bitcoin enthusiasts for no particularly good reason other than to bolster their “street cred” as more hardcore and extremist than the next guy (I would say “guy or gal,” but maxis are overwhelmingly male). </p><p>On Twitter, you’ll recognize them from their “laser-eyed” avatars in which they’ve digitally replaced their own eyes with fluorescent, red ones to clearly and proudly mark themselves as a part of the religion. Maxis are a disproportionately-loud vocal minority on “Bitcoin Twitter” that seems to enjoy, above all else, trolling and ridiculing anyone they deem as inadequately faithful to their conspiratorial rhetoric on subjects ranging from vaccinations and sunscreen to seed oils, anti-gun legislation and corporate ESG mandates. You see, in the upside-down world of the laser-eyed, being toxic is a virtue. Being toxic is somehow, for them, the way to win over hearts and minds. </p><p>To be fair, maxis aren’t a homogenous group, but they tend to share a common view that Bitcoin is the solution to many of the world’s problems and tend to subscribe to political doctrines of Libertarianism and Austrian economics, and tend to hate what they view as hopelessly- corrupted institutions like the World Health Organization and World Economic Forum. This part, I kind of like. On the shared-beliefs continuum with Bitcoiners, I generally lean their way. I, too, subscribe to most Austrian economic principles, have many Libertarian leanings, and am increasingly skeptical of the mainstream media. And, most importantly, I believe Bitcoin has the potential to be the soundest money ever created. </p><p>However, the part I hate is that maxis overwhelmingly subscribe to conspiratorial rhetoric on just about anything you can imagine, many of which are non-monetary in nature and all of which are complete non sequiturs when it comes to Bitcoin. I’m certain that most maxis would argue that all of these things are somehow related to the “fiat system” they wish to overturn in order to set the stage for a new world in which Bitcoin reigns supreme (“<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">The Bitcoin Standard</a>,” as author and laser-eyed saint Saifedean Ammous, describes it). </p><p>I would argue, though, that these are issues that the average person knows little or cares little about and that focusing on them is maddeningly counterproductive in terms of spreading Bitcoin’s adoption. If the world is ever to convert to said bitcoin standard, widespread adoption on orders of magnitude greater than where they stand today is needed — and stupid litmus tests are a massive turnoff, at worst, and massive distraction, at best, to all but the most extreme among us. </p><h2>An Ossified Base Layer</h2><p>The parallels between Bitcoiners and religion go beyond just the dogmatic in-group mentality of maxis. Bitcoin’s “base layer” code, for example, is akin in many ways to scripture. While <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">many proposals</a> have been made over the years to change it, only a relative handful of significant ones have ever been approved. Indeed, The Ten Commandments are only slightly less likely to be altered than the software code that runs the Bitcoin network — a feature, not a bug, in the view of many Bitcoiners.</p><p>The process adhered to by Bitcoin’s core developers to change the code is cumbersome by design, requiring anyone proposing a change to write a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that aims to achieve some kind of community consensus to enact the changes. The ossified nature of Bitcoin’s base layer is a testament to Bitcoin’s decentralization in the eyes of most maxis — something that sets it apart from more centralized blockchains, like Ethereum, which have a much lower threshold for implementing changes. Changes in the functionality of Bitcoin’s “Layer 1” will always be controversial; however, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/short-bitcoin-taproot-explainer">Taproot</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit">SegWit</a> upgrades, designed to make the Bitcoin protocol more secure and efficient, were adopted by the Bitcoin community with relative ease and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/why-bitcoin-taproot-activation-is-exciting">Taproot was activated in November 2021</a>. </p><p>Herein lies the irony. Had those who determined the Bitcoin network’s governance known at the time that these upgrades would enable Rodarmor to create Ordinals and inscriptions, it seems unlikely in retrospect that the changes would have been accepted with such relative ease. The church fundamentalists got beat at their own game, and many of them (<a href="https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-community-reacts-to-former-hedge-fund-manager-greg-foss-criticism-of-ordinals/">including Greg Foss</a>, a podcaster and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/greg-foss">Bitcoin Magazine contributor</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/FossGregfoss">more than 130,000 Twitter followers</a>) have been on the warpath ever since. </p><p>The majority of Bitcoin miners love Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens, because they have <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">led to increased transaction fees</a>, while many maxis are adamantly against them, because they view NFTs as a distraction from what they see as Bitcoin’s core function as a much-improved way of sending, receiving and storing value. The network was designed as a monetary settlement and transaction platform, not for the tokenization of digital art or real-world assets (<a href="https://blog.chain.link/tokenized-real-world-assets/">RWAs</a>), the laser-eyed say. JPEG Day, then, might as well be called “Scam Day” as far as they’re concerned. </p><h2>A Battle For The Soul Of Bitcoin</h2><p>While the story of inscriptions and Ordinals is still being written, the reality that JPEG “art collections” and other ordinal use cases may be here to stay has resulted in another internal culture war reminiscent of Bitcoin’s “<a href="https://www.bitrawr.com/bitcoin-block-size-debate-explained">Blocksize Wars</a>” from 2015 to 2017. Only, rather than “small-blockers” versus “large blockers,” the Ordinals have pitted maximalists against NFT creators and enthusiasts. </p><p>The rising tension ultimately came to a head at Bitcoin 2023<em> </em>during a perfectly-timed onstage event dubbed by the conference organizers as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdYsQ2DWt5M">The Great Ordinals Debate</a>.” Dressed as wizards (and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhE5LVWgNzA">flossing</a>” as they arrived on stage), Wertheimer and Wall displayed their mastery as hype artists while debating<a href="https://twitter.com/TheBlueMatt"> Matt Corallo</a> (notably, an anti-toxic maximalist) of Block and Spiral and someone who concealed his face with sunglasses, a bandana over his nose and mouth and a camouflage<a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/uasf/"> UASF</a> hat (signaling himself as a “small-blocker”) who goes by the name <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_trollz">Shinobi</a>. It was like some kind of quirky, nerd version of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), as if Don King had somehow infiltrated an episode of “The Big Bang Theory”<em> </em>and convinced Sheldon Cooper and Howard Wolowitz to get in the ring. </p><p>I watched from the audience, marveling at the spectacle of the heretic wizards out-trolling the laser-eyes who had been extolling the virtues of toxicity to the detriment of a thing I’d grown to love as they debated Ordinals and battled hilariously for the soul of Bitcoin. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Nathan Cryder.

This tool aims to empower banks and credit unions of all sizes to facilitate instantaneous money transfers for their customers. The Federal Reserve claims that FedNow transactions can be executed 24/7, 365 days a year.</p><p>To start, 35 banks and credit unions, alongside the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service, are among those already equipped to handle payments through the FedNow Service. Furthermore, a lineup of 16 service providers are poised to offer payment processing support for banks and credit unions.</p><p>"The Federal Reserve built the FedNow Service to help make everyday payments over the coming years faster and more convenient," said Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. "Over time, as more banks choose to use this new tool, the benefits to individuals and businesses will include enabling a person to immediately receive a paycheck, or a company to instantly access funds when an invoice is paid."</p><p>When asked if the FedNow service is attempting to replace cash, and if it was a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not, the Federal Reserve&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/is-fednow-replacing-cash-is-it-a-central-bank-digital-currency.htm">stated</a> "No. The FedNow Service is not related to a digital currency. The FedNow Service is a payment service the Federal Reserve is making available for banks and credit unions to transfer funds for their customers. It is like other Federal Reserve payment services, such as Fedwire and FedACH. The FedNow Service is neither a form of currency nor a step toward eliminating any form of payment, including cash."</p><p>A comprehensive list of early adopters already equipped with instant payment capabilities can be found in an attached&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/other20230720a1.pdf">document</a>.

And these are certainly some of the reasons that many companies in the digital asset ecosystem — including <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/miami">Blockchain.com</a>, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/okcoin-opens-miami-office-becomes-first-ever-crypto-sponsor-of-floridas-largest-hackathon-301361739.html">Okcoin</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/borderless-capital">Borderless Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blocktower-capital-moves-headquarters-to-miami-301333189.html">BlockTower Capital</a> — have moved out of such traditional tech regions as California, New York and the Pacific Northwest, for the friendlier sunshine and incentives of Florida.  </p><p>But there’s another reason digital asset firms are looking to Florida: the Sunshine State’s reliable energy grids and its increasing leadership in sustainable energy, from solar energy to biomass electricity to nuclear energy. This is because one of the building blocks for some of the most popular forms of digital assets, particularly bitcoin, is proof-of-work mining, which can be an energy-intensive process, and Florida can fuel the innovation that Bitcoin requires. </p><p>Proof of work was first introduced <a href="https://www.kraken.com/learn/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake">in the early 1990s as a means to reduce email spam</a>. The idea was to require computers to perform a small amount of work before sending an email in order to verify the message’s authenticity and deter spam. This work would be minimal for someone sending one-off emails, but it requires a lot of computing power and resources for users sending mass spam emails. The thought is that, if there is a significant cost associated with sending millions of emails, it will deter spammers.</p><p>Proof of work is a necessary part of adding new blocks to the Bitcoin blockchain and the energy consumption required at Bitcoin mining data centers to validate blocks is crucial to ensure the security of the blockchain. It also ensures that block production remains decentralized. There is no inherent advantage for those who may have started mining Bitcoin earlier, as the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-everything-you-need-to-know/">difficulty adjustment</a> ensures that Bitcoin miners who started 10 years ago still compete on equal footing with a new miner that joins today.</p><h2>Is Bitcoin Mining Harmful To The Environment?</h2><p>It’s estimated that Bitcoin mining <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci">uses 140 terawatt-hours (TWh) of power per year</a> and consumes <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/comparisons">about 0.22% of global energy</a>. There are some, particularly within the executive branch, calling for extensive limitations on mining, if not a total ban, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf">suggesting that the large energy use is harmful to the environment</a>. This is short-sighted and wrong. Eliminating all Bitcoin mining will not put a meaningful dent in carbon emissions, and it could actually slow progress in transitioning this country to more renewable energy. </p><p>Simply put, Bitcoin mining can be an asset for energy development and modernizing our energy infrastructure. <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/mining_map">At the start of 2021</a>, over 50% of the Bitcoin network’s computing power, otherwise known as its hash rate, was located in China and 13% was in the United States. By July 2021, China had <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/latest-china-ban-impacting-bitcoin">banned Bitcoin mining</a>, and the United States’ share of the network’s hash rate <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci/mining_map">grew to 35%</a>. Today, Bitcoin mining in the United States continues to grow, predominantly in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-07/america-s-bitcoin-btc-miners-have-georgia-on-their-minds?cmpid=BBD020822_cryptoe-georgia-on-their-minds">states with regulatory-friendly environments and excess renewable power</a>. <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/2022.01.18-BMC-Q4-2021.pdf">In 2021</a>, the efficiency of Bitcoin mining globally improved by 53%, and the percentage of the industry primarily powered by sustainable power improved from 37% to 59%. </p><h2>How Is Bitcoin Mining Modernizing Energy Resources?</h2><p>Transitioning to greener energy sources requires significant investments in new energy technology. Proof-of-work miners serve as reliable base customers who provide consistent demand and revenue for utilities to build out clean energy infrastructure. An added benefit: They can power down to redeploy critical use of power elsewhere, almost instantly, something other high-demand industries simply cannot do. </p><p>For example, on occasions when customer demand spikes, Bitcoin miners can work cooperatively with utilities to curtail their demand. The power being used by proof-of-work miners flows back to the grid, giving retail consumers extra capacity in mere minutes with no adverse effects. No other industry that uses similar levels of energy — including other data centers, cloud service providers and manufacturing facilities — has the ability to do this.</p><p>An example of a state embracing these opportunities is Texas, where the electrical grid is operated by the Electric Reliability Council Of Texas, or ERCOT. </p><p>“Bitcoin miners have provided a valuable additional tool for ERCOT’s operators during tight supply conditions: a flexible load that can shut down so that needed electricity can flow to our most vulnerable customers,” <a href="https://texasblockchaincouncil.org/dontmesswithtexasinnovation">said Brad Jones</a>, ERCOT’s former CEO.</p><p>It’s also important to note that, even as Bitcoin mining has increased productivity over the past few years, the Bitcoin Mining Council has estimated that the global mining industry’s sustainable electricity mix is <a href="https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/q4-bitcoin-mining-council-survey-confirms-sustainable-power-mix-and-technological-efficiency/">58.5% and growing</a>, making it one of the most sustainable industries in the world. This sustainability impact will only continue to grow over time as Bitcoin miners form partnerships with energy providers, utilities, communities and other groups to develop new energy capacities. </p><p>Florida is on the leading edge of the energy revolution. Our state’s solar industry is now <a href="https://www.chooseenergy.com/solar-energy/best-and-worst-ranked-states-for-solar-industry-growth/">in the top five in the nation</a>, and our biomass electrical and nuclear energy industries continue to expand to meet consumer and business needs. Rather than studying the successes of Florida’s free market approach, the Biden administration, once again, is attempting to legislate through <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">regulation and taxation</a>. The executive branch, through offices like the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/">White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Agencies</a>, and its subordinate agencies, such as the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), are preparing to levy the heavy hand of the federal government in the name of “climate.” </p><p>Not only do many of these regulators lack the statutory authority to engage in environmental policymaking, but they are also ignoring the tremendous advancements the private industry has made and continues to make. Instead of stifling growth through burdensome regulation, we should let the market do what it does best: innovate. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Byron Donalds and Perianne Boring.

Kennedy Jr. outlined specific Bitcoin-focused policies that he would enact as president, including gradually backing the U.S. dollar with bitcoin and making bitcoin profits exempt from capital gains taxes.</p><p>“My plan would be to start very, very small, perhaps 1% of issued T-bills would be backed by hard currency, by gold, silver platinum or bitcoin,” Kennedy said, describing his vision for returning to a hard currency standard in the U.S. </p><p>He added that, depending on the outcome of that initial step, he would increase that allocation annually.</p><p>This potential policy reimagines the financial system, pointing to a future where bitcoin's absolute scarcity and sound monetary principles reinforce the U.S. dollar’s eroding position as the world reserve currency.</p><p>"Backing dollars and U.S. debt obligations with hard assets could help restore strength back to the dollar, rein in inflation and usher in a new era of American financial stability, peace and prosperity," he declared.</p><p>In addition, Kennedy announced his administration “will exempt the conversion of bitcoin to the U.S. dollar from capital gains taxes.”</p><p>"The benefits include facilitating innovation and spurring investment, ensuring citizen privacy, incentivizing ventures to grow their business and tech jobs in the United States rather than in Singapore, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal,” he added. “Non-taxable events are unreportable and that means it will be more difficult for governments to weaponize currency against free speech, which as many of you know, is one of my principal objectives."</p><p>During his announcement, Kennedy reiterated the slew of commitments he made to foster Bitcoin adoption <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/robert-kennedy-jr-debuts-campaign-at-bitcoin-2023">during a speech at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in May</a>, which included “defending the right of self custody of bitcoin,” upholding “the right to run a node at home” and defending “industry-neutral regulation of energy.”</p><p>Kennedy framed his commitments to Bitcoin as integral to the ideals of his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his own vision for governing a free and equitable country.</p><p>“My uncle, President Kennedy, when he was in office, understood the importance of hard currency and the dangers of having pure fiat currency with no other option,” Kennedy said. “He understood the relationship between fiat currency and war, fiat currency and … very, very destructive environmental projects and also these giant aggregations of wealth and the unbalance, the disparities in wealth that are the ultimate yield of every fiat currency.”</p><p>Reflecting on the history of fiat currencies, Kennedy didn’t mince words, citing the frequent use of unbacked paper currency to fund wars without the need for specific government taxation or citizens’ approval. </p><p>"Fiat currency was invented to fund wars,” he said. “I like base currencies because they make it more difficult, you have to go to the public. You can't just print money to fund the war and tax the public through the hidden tax of inflation. You actually have to go to the public and say, ‘Here's what this war is going to cost.’”</p><p>He emphasized his regulatory outlook that “bitcoin is not a security and should not be regulated as one” and his commitment to “put an end to the current policies of the Biden administration that are invited by Choke Point 2.0 to punish banks that are dealing with bitcoin.”</p><p>Reflecting on the broader implications of these policies, Kennedy alluded to the financial circumstances that currently face the United States. A steady <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN">growth rate of 6.5% in national debt over the past decade</a> makes the case for forward-looking and comprehensive fiscal strategies from the highest office. Against this backdrop, Kennedy’s proposal for the U.S. Treasury to acquire assets such as bitcoin and precious metals is an approach that’s meant to offer an insurance policy against the country’s mounting debt.</p><p>Kennedy’s steadfast conviction in Bitcoin signals a coming political paradigm shift, where bitcoin is seen not just as an asset, but as a prudent policy tool to ensure the nation's fiscal longevity and an opportunity to attract intellectual capital to U.S. shores.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5NDc5NjEyOTg2NjMxNTgy/5120x2880.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[A BlackRock ETF Would Supercharge The Bitcoin Mining Industry]]></title><description><![CDATA[If approved, a BlackRock bitcoin ETF would be a massive bet on the Bitcoin mining industry and supercharge sector investment.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-etf-would-supercharge-bitcoin-mining</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blackrock-etf-would-supercharge-bitcoin-mining</guid><category><![CDATA[ETF]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Blackrock]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Bitcoin mining]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Phil Harvey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzMzUxMjcwOTg2MTYzNzc5/mining-pick-axe.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Phil Harvey, the CEO of cryptocurrency mining consultancy Sabre56.</em></p><p>Launching the first unequivocally positive news cycle for the Bitcoin space since <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">the collapse of FTX</a>, BlackRock recently decided to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/49963916-572b-4591-8bb6-7efd06ec0961">file for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF)</a>. Within a few days, <a href="https://decrypt.co/145566/wisdomtree-invesco-follow-blackrock-with-spot-bitcoin-etf-applications">two additional behemoth money managers joined BlackRock</a> as Invesco reactivated its application for a spot BTC ETF and ETF-specialist WisdomTree submitted its third application for a BTC ETF to the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC).</p><p>As of this writing, nobody can say if the proposed vehicles will be approved by the SEC, which has recently made headlines for its heavy-handed pursuit of crypto’s most prominent exchanges in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-102">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-101">Binance</a>. We will know soon enough.</p><p>What is more pertinent at this point is a review of the underlying trend: Institutional money is slowly working its way into the bitcoin economy. In the realm of bitcoin trading, high-profile investors’ commitments to date have been shaky and driven by the boom-and-bust cycle typical for nascent industries — and certainly a defining trait of the bitcoin economy so far. </p><p>BlackRock’s potential spot BTC ETF could be a real bridge to mass adoption. Some voices have declared it offers the best chances of approval yet, not just because of the applicant’s prestige but also thanks to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/16/blackrock-may-have-found-way-to-get-sec-approval-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">proposed surveillance-sharing agreement</a> that seems to be key in the SEC’s eyes. But regardless of the fate of this proposal in particular, an examination of Bitcoin infrastructure being built today provides an unambiguously bullish picture of institutional money’s bet on the industry. </p><p>For instance, one of the world’s most active and successful venture capital funds, Andreesen Horowitz (a16Z), has doubled down and announced its first-ever <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/andreessen-horowitz-open-its-first-international-office-london-2023-06-12/">international office, to be opened in London</a>, to largely focus on the development of the crypto economy.</p><p>However, institutional investors’ hunt for growth opportunities is nowhere as pronounced as it is in Bitcoin’s fundamental infrastructure: mining. Champions of the mining industry are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microbt-brings-asic-manufacturing-to-america-in-partnership-with-riot-platforms">signing deals and building at a breakneck pace</a>, while their competition gets fiercer and the <a href="https://decrypt.co/147890/bitcoin-hash-rate-hits-new-all-time-high-stagnating-prices">network hash rate continues to hit all-time highs</a>. </p><h2>Betting Beyond Bitcoin</h2><p>Being less shiny and exciting than the asset trading counterpart it underpins, reporting about investment in the mining space can be muted. However, it is my experience that big name investors, large utilities and even government entities in the U.S. and worldwide are cleverly assessing opportunities and employing considerable financial resources to shape the market. And this is for good reason: the data centers that host Bitcoin miners are equipped to do a range of high-performance computing in the future and the value proposition of this in the advent of AI is clear as day.</p><p>BlackRock’s move is not just a bet on Bitcoin, but on the world’s most secure and energy-efficient computing network as a way to produce consensus and certify truth in the 21st century, irrespective of the asset manager’s intentions. As such, refraining from any prognosis as to the application’s outcome, it’s fair to ask what a hypothetical bitcoin ETF would mean for the mining industry.</p><p>Firstly, it would mean that every institutional money manager with such an ETF would be a custodian of sorts. They would have to build their own custodial infrastructure — an interesting test of the industry’s existing standards, and “adoption” in its own right, which will be accompanied by growth.</p><p>Secondly, mass adoption due to enhanced accessibility — in conjunction with the upcoming halving event in 2024 — would be a strong indicator for a hype cycle with prices running wild. While these bull runs, caused by hype and FOMO, are smoke and mirrors in large part, they will channel funds to the industry and benefit serious players who have worked during the hard times to reap the rewards.</p><p>Finally, and most importantly, institutional investors would have a vested interest in sustaining, funding and upgrading the existing blockchain infrastructure which verifies Bitcoin transactions and guarantees the network’s security. While this is already happening, including by household utilities and energy providers who benefit from miners’ load shedding capabilities, a spot BTC ETF would, with high probability, supercharge sector investment and validate the industry’s efforts so far.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Phil Harvey.

In the latter, Bitcoin enthusiasts gather to discuss current events in the Bitcoin space and offer beginner-friendly workshops. In our travels, my husband Scott and I have attended many of both types of meetings.</p><p>Yet, recently, we found ourselves at a meetup that turned the typical rulebook on its head. Allow me to take you on a journey through that evening and perhaps inspire your own Bitcoin groups to do something similar.</p><h2>‘This Is Going To Be Different!’</h2><p>When Scott and I pulled up to a meetup venue in Winchester, Virginia, we were greeted by two little girls giggling at the door. They pointed at us, waved, and then scampered back inside. Scott and I smiled and thought, "This is going to be different!"</p><p>Walking in a few moments later, we were again greeted by something unusual. There was a cacophony of drum beats and loud notes banged out on a small grand piano at the front of the room, opposite the entryway. The same two girls who waved at us at the door enthusiastically announced, "We’re doing a concert!" </p><p>The two of them laughed and wiggled in their seats, heads bobbing from side to side in time with their own music.</p><p>The event organizer, <a href="https://twitter.com/garyKrause_">Gary Krause </a>of the <a href="https://shenandoahbitcoin.club/">Shenandoah Bitcoin Club</a>, walked toward us, holding out his hand, welcoming us to the meetup that night.</p><p>He explained that several families had RSVP’d for family game night and, despite the rain, he hoped we would get a good turnout. While we chatted and waited for the guests to arrive, one of the 5-year-old girls grabbed both of my hands and pulled me to the front of the room where she danced and pirouetted on tiptoes with her hands held high above her head, forming an arc. </p><p>"Come on, follow me! You can do it!" her little voice encouraged me. The other little girl banged on the piano as the impromptu accompanist.</p><p>The first family to arrive came with a baby and a 3-year-old. The baby was immediately whisked away from mama’s arms by a family friend who cooed and bounced the baby while the adults greeted each other. The baby’s older brother approached the little girls who had stopped performing by now and the three of them shared an instant understanding of a secret game and darted away.</p><p>One by one, more families came. More kids. More noise. More laughter. And we hadn’t even started playing games yet!</p><h2>‘I Wish These Were Real Bitcoins!’</h2><p>When pizzas had been delivered and we were all seated, I looked around and realized there were more children than adults at this Bitcoin meetup. Their ages ranged the full spectrum of childhood: from wide-eyed 1-year-old to mature 17-year-old.</p><p>We set up two game tables. I wasn’t sure how it would work, with some of the kids being so young. At my table, the kids' ages ranged from 5 to 9. I explained how to play “<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-to-introduce-bitcoin-to-gen-z">HODL UP</a>” the best way I could to such a young audience. Thankfully, there were two parents standing by to help explain the game to their kids. The youngest ones didn’t last long. Very quickly, they grew tired of listening to the rules and asked to be excused. My table was left with two adults and three kids from ages 7 to 9. At Scott’s table, the kids were aged 13 and up.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>The game began, and the kids quickly grasped the concepts. After just a few hands, they knew that getting their bitcoin into cold storage was the only way to protect their earnings. They played good naturedly and reacted with exuberant exclamations and disappointments when they won or lost their bitcoin. </p><p>The boy who sat next to me repeatedly said, "I wish these were real bitcoins!" pointing to the tokens piled on his wallet card. Isn't that what every Bitcoiner hopes to hear from their kids: that they want to HODL some real bitcoin?!</p><figure>

        <figcaption><em>Source: author</em></figcaption>
    </figure><p>At the other table, where the older kids were playing with several adults, the wins and losses evoked even louder responses! Their game lasted longer, as each player was intent on winning and took their time evaluating strategies.</p><p>When both games ended, all the kids dispersed. The older kids pulled out their phones, the younger kids left the table to run around the room and the baby had been passed to yet another doting family friend who was lying on the floor, holding the baby above her head in a Superman pose.</p><p>The adults, who learned the game mechanics and strategies from the first game, were engaged in a new game, determined to HODL even more bitcoin in their second attempt.</p><p>Taking in the scene around me, it felt as though I had stepped into a heartwarming Hallmark movie. What made this evening truly extraordinary was the inclusivity. Families stayed together, chaotic as it was. The children weren't asked to sit quietly or sent to another room. Bitcoin, in all its complexity, was demystified through a simple game in the most natural, family-friendly setting. There were no stern lectures about how bad our fiat system is, how the government is printing money or how bitcoin has a volatile dollar-exchange rate.</p><p>A simple yet crucial takeaway for everyone that night was to secure their bitcoin in cold storage. No lectures, just a fun-filled evening where even the youngest of players learned the most critical of lessons.</p><h2>Bitcoin Is For Everyone</h2><p>Returning from Virginia, Scott and I hosted a family fun event at the park with our Bitcoin meetup, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/kentuckiana-bitcoin-club/">Kentuckiana Bitcoin Club</a>. Instead of having our meeting at a pub, restaurant or office, we chose to have it at a local park where there is a playground and a volleyball court. While the setting made it a bit challenging to hear a wonderful Zoom presentation about <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bolt12-lnurl-and-bitcoin-lightning">Bolt 12</a>, it was great for the families of Bitcoiners to meet. The children dashed back and forth from the playground to the table where the adults were sitting, and that was fine. Kids learn through osmosis. Our job is always just to plant the seeds. Who knows how the seeds will be watered and how long it will take for them to germinate? We just know that our job is to plant seeds, especially with kids.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5MzM0NjY5MTE0NjgxMjk0/outdoor-bitcoin-meetup.jpg" height="349" width="620">

    </figure><p>So, what’s the takeaway here? How can your Bitcoin meetup involve your families? Instead of the meetup taking daddy/mommy away for a few hours every week or month, what if the whole family were involved? What if the spouses met each other and the kids played together?</p><p>I’m not suggesting that all Bitcoin meetings involve the whole family. There is certainly a place for technical debates and current event discussions, but perhaps every once in a while (once a quarter or twice a year), the families can come together. After all, Bitcoin is for everyone. We ought to scatter and plant seeds far and wide, beginning in our own homes, with our own families.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Tali Lindberg.

As of today, users can now deposit and withdraw Bitcoin (BTC) using the Lightning Network on the Binance platform.</p><p>The integration of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network marks a significant milestone for Binance, as it aims to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions. By leveraging the Lightning Network, Binance aims to address the scalability challenges associated with the Bitcoin network, allowing users to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions. Previously, Binance has experienced issues in high fee environments, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419622764720128?s=20">most recently highlighted</a> when Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">inscriptions caused a surge in fees</a>. </p><p>With the Lightning Network integration, Binance users can now take advantage of the Lightning Network's off-chain payment channels to send and receive bitcoin transactions with reduced fees and faster settlement times.

The grant opens up opportunities for campaigns that promote and bolster Bitcoin schools and communities worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>Mick Morucci, CEO of Geyser, emphasized the importance of Bitcoin for underserved populations, stating, "These are the people that would most benefit from bitcoin, which can act as a shield. These are also those that are least aware of bitcoin." The grant seeks to amplify the efforts of Bitcoin communities that are emerging across the globe, offering knowledge, education and tools to promote participation in the Bitcoin movement.</p><p>To fund the grant, Geyser has raised 1 BTC, thanks to generous donors and a partnership with Blink. The organization aims to distribute the proceeds to numerous projects that demonstrate impact, need and proof of work. Applications for the grant are currently open and will be accepted until mid-August. A board will evaluate the projects and select the most deserving recipients.</p><p>Geyser Grants stands apart from typical Bitcoin grants, which primarily focus on core developers. The organization aims to recognize and reward all Bitcoin creators for their contributions. Geyser Grants has already made a significant impact, contributing 2.2 BTC to over 100 projects centered around Bitcoin education, creative endeavors, and community building.</p><p>The grants serve multiple purposes, including promoting Bitcoin awareness, encouraging contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem, recognizing important work in the space, empowering creators globally and fostering the growth of the Bitcoin creator ecosystem.

After all, shouldn't we aim to convince everyone about the benefits of Bitcoin? Well, the truth is, we can't. And that's okay.</p><p>In our world, it's easy to live within a filter bubble, surrounded by like-minded plebs who reinforce our beliefs. But when we attempt to market Bitcoin to the masses, we quickly realize that not everyone shares our enthusiasm. The resounding chorus of "no" can be disheartening, and there are many examples of people claiming to “give up” on orange-pilling normies. </p><p>That's not the way forward. We just need to resist the temptation to use the same message on the ocean of regular people who we want to bring to our side.</p><h2>Finding Our Swimming Pool</h2><p>Instead, we need to find our swimming pool, a smaller audience that gives us the chance to make a real impact. It's unrealistic to expect every person to embrace Bitcoin, even with the most compelling pitch. By accepting this reality, we can laser-focus our efforts on those who are open to change and receptive to the message.</p><p>An example of someone who has understood this is Hermann Vivier from <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>. He is laser-focused on building a circular economy in a very specific place: the township of JCC Camp in South Africa — and knows everything about the people in that community: their pain, beliefs, needs, doubts — and educates his local community about Bitcoin based on this information.</p><p>Vivier knows certain things that we might value will not be seen in the same regard among his community members, so he adopts their language, sprinkles it in with Bitcoin truth and makes the case for Bitcoin in a way that only they can truly understand. </p><p>To me, that is the spirit of respect. We must acknowledge that Bitcoin is not for everyone. This doesn't mean we are excluding or dismissing individuals; it's about recognizing that our offering is tailored to different, specific groups.</p><p>By saying, "It's not for you," we show respect for everyone’s time, beliefs and desires. We can proudly declare, "This for you. Not for the other folks, but for you."</p><p>To create something meaningful for the people who are willing to listen and study Bitcoin, we must embrace the freedom to ignore the critics who will never understand it. Our focus should be on polishing our stories for those who truly need to hear it, and want to hear it. </p><p>Success lies in changing the lives of the people who trust us, the ones who have connected with our vision. What others outside our target audience think becomes completely irrelevant!</p><p>Because there's one thing about normies that applies everywhere: They truly struggle to articulate their desires explicitly. But they do know what they want. As Bitcoiners, we understand this <em>too well</em>, but the complexity of our knowledge often makes it challenging to express in a way that resonates with them. </p><p>Simplifying our message and accepting that Bitcoin is not for everyone allows us to focus on those who are ready to listen.</p><p>Like Neil Woodfine just <a href="https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/1673381676808912914">wrote</a>: </p><p>“Every minute spent ‘spreading the word’ or ‘promoting awareness’ would be better spent coding, designing, PMing, documenting, selling, or marketing a product.”</p><h2>Standing For Something</h2><p>In conclusion, Bitcoiners have the opportunity to stand for something. Rather than claiming "Bitcoin is for everyone," we should start by identifying an audience worth serving. </p><p>By understanding their needs, wants and dreams, we can build something tailored for them. This requires sometimes going to extremes to make a solid point, finding our edge and standing for something specific, rather than trying to cater to everyone. </p><p>In doing so, we can create powerful narratives that resonate and drive meaningful adoption.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Fernando Nikolic.

    </figure><blockquote><p>"Those things which I am saying now may be obscure, yet they will be made clearer in their proper place."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/nicolaus_copernicus_238365">Nicolaus Copernicus</a></p></blockquote><p>In the annals of history, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicholas Copernicus</a> is celebrated as the groundbreaking astronomer who toppled the geocentric view and unveiled the heliocentric model, placing the sun at the center of our solar system. However, there is a lesser-known facet of Copernicus' genius that remains shrouded in obscurity: his profound contributions to monetary thought. </p><p>While his astronomical achievements have captivated generations, his insights into the nature of money and its effects on economies have largely been overlooked.</p><p>As the medieval era drew to a close, marked by transformative inventions like the Gutenberg printing press and the disruptive force of gunpowder, Copernicus's groundbreaking work challenged not only the prevailing astronomical beliefs but also the accepted notions of money. </p><p>The emergence of the printing press ushered in an era of unprecedented knowledge dissemination, gradually eroding the information monopoly of the Catholic Church. Concurrently, the widespread adoption of gunpowder rendered knights and their armor powerless, signifying the decline of the feudal system. Amid this backdrop of change, Copernicus emerged as a visionary, his mathematical calculations eventually proving that the Earth was not the center of the universe.</p><p>While we may look back on our geocentric ancestors and marvel at their supposed ignorance, we must acknowledge that most of us are quite incapable of proving the heliocentrism ourselves. We generally accept the current belief. If that is true, mustn't there be obvious things we could be missing today? What if our assumptions about money, the lifeblood of economies, are flawed as well and the study of economics is still in its infantile stage? Perhaps, just as Copernicus shattered the prevailing astronomical narrative, we are on the cusp of an intellectual revolution that will expose the shortcomings of contemporary monetary belief.</p><p>It is here, amid these profound reflections, that Copernicus' hidden expertise in monetary matters resurfaces. Unbeknownst to many, this visionary mind not only revolutionized our understanding of the heavens but also made lasting contributions to the field of monetary thought.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Copernicus the Monetary Scientist</h2><p>Born in 1473, Copernicus was a citizen of Prussia (now part of modern-day Poland) and lived most of his life in Frombork, where the polymath was employed in the royal court as an accountant and advisor on monetary reform after King Sigismund I <a href="https://mises.org/library/copernicus-and-quantity-theory-money">requested him to look at the nation’s depreciating currency</a>. </p><p>His first monetary contribution was to <a href="https://mises.org/library/copernicus-and-quantity-theory-money">strengthen a theory</a> we now know as <a href="https://youtu.be/0Q4o-beKoFw?t=2936">Gresham’s law</a>. The law describes that when there are two currencies in circulation, and the government decrees a fixed exchange rate, the bad money drives out the dearer. In such a scenario, it is profitable to exchange the debased coin and hoard the harder one. In 1526, his findings were bundled into a booklet titled “<a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Monetae_cudendae_ratio">Monetae Cudendae Ratio</a>” — the “Monetary Minting Ratio.” Copernicus opened his treatise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Hayekian</a> style, emphasizing the surreptitious nature of monetary degradation:</p><blockquote><p>​​"Although there are innumerable plagues by which kingdoms, principalities, and republics tend to decline, yet these four (in my judgment) are the most powerful: discord, mortality, the barrenness of the land, and cheapness of money. The first three are so evident that no one knows that it is so, but the fourth, as regards money, is considered by a few and only by the most earnest, because it did not happen all at once, but gradually, in a kind of secret way. It overthrew republics by reason... Therefore, money is like a measure of some common estimation. It is necessary, however, that what should be a measure should always be firm and maintain a state of order. Otherwise, it is necessary to confuse the organization of the republic, and to defraud the buyers and sellers in many ways, as if the cubit does not hold a certain weight."</p></blockquote><p>In a pressing tone, he argued for a repair of currency, to destroy the old and bring full-weighted silver coins back into circulation. Prussia had just suffered a war and subsequent currency debasement. The amount of copper in the coin increased at the expense of the precious metal and finally reduced the money to pathetic puce pennies. Since a fixed exchange rate was in force, it became more profitable to melt down the coin and extract the silver. </p><p>In the end, Prussia's currency became worthless, leaving the inhabitants unable to trade abroad since nobody would accept the tangled money. The good money was gone. Hoarded, melted and exported — a Gresham's law by example. Though this mechanic was previously known to other civilizations, Copernicus was the first European to properly pen it down. Unfortunately for Prussia, the king didn't heed his advice.</p><h2>The Quantity Theory Of Money</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a>, the American economist of the Austrian school, even claimed that the Polish polymath theorized an early version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money">quantity theory of money</a> (QTM). Rothbard summarized Copernicus’ thoughts in “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4715175961">Economic Thought Before Adam Smith Vol. 1</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>"The causal chain began with debasement, which raised the quantity of the money supply, which in turn raised prices. The supply of money is the major determinant of prices. We in our sluggishness do not realize that the dearness of everything is the result of the cheapness of money. For prices increase and decrease according to the condition of the money."</p></blockquote><p>While contemporary man is still monetarily illiterate, Copernius, half a millennium ago, already elegantly theorized a linear relationship between the supply of money and market prices. Somehow we take our unit of account to be fixed in supply, and never conclude that higher prices are the result of currency depreciation. Like the geocentric paradigm, it's hard to detach from this immersive and slanted point of view.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Today, QTM is quantitatively defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money#Fisher's_equation_of_exchange">Fisher's formula</a>. Here, the money supply (M) times the average velocity (V), equals the sum of all transactions in the economy (q) times their respective price (p). Given that spending behavior remains stable (V) and goods and services production remains level, we conclude that an increase in the money supply varies directly with all prices in the economy.</p><p>Subsequently, let's highlight that price (p) is a vector of all prices which individually respond differently to inflation, but on average increase linearly with the money supply. For example, a digital service might decline during monetary expansion through technological deflation, while scarce real estate appreciates. This is a point not lost on Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy and the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, as shown when he <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1391174076983615491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1391174076983615491%7Ctwgr%5E3ea330d4498733800638c89282063506ce3231db%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fsaylor%2Fstatus%2F1391174076983615491image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07">responded in a tweet</a> to Keynesian Paul Krugman in May 2021 on monetary expansion:</p><blockquote><p>"Inflation is a vector. A scalar index can be biased by choosing certain items. Your index assumes human beings don't need food, energy, or home ownership, nor desire assets such as property, equity, bonds, or commodities. It's obvious much of the inflation has been in assets.”</p></blockquote><h2>End Of An Age</h2><p>Copernicus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#Heliocentrism">basically finished “De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium"<em> </em>in 1532</a>, but only published his heliocentric thesis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium">on his deathbed in 1543</a> fearing the church’s scorn. The seed had been sown, but the theory took flight a century later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">following the arrival of the spyglass</a>. Galileo Galilei was an early telescope adopter who produced the first anomalous celestial observations that could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">only be explained by embracing Copernicus' paradigm</a>.</p><p>Rejection is easy in the absence of appliances that falsify the current model. Heliocentrism remained merely an abstract idea prior to telescopy. But then, what about Copernicus' monetary findings? Did we simply lack the tools to turn this view into reality? </p><p>With Bitcoin still in its early days, it appears that Copernicus is still way ahead of Keynesian economists and could be considered a Bitcoiner avant la lettre. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is a digital telescope for anyone willing to peer deeply into the economic machine. We may now all observe what the polymaths of yesteryear had been saying all along — that a sound economy revolves around sound money. And though it may be designed by humans, Bitcoin shines bright as the natural center we've all been searching for. For this time might be that proper place, where simple monetary laws will refuse to remain obscure anymore.</p><blockquote><p>"At rest, however, in the middle of everything is the sun."<br></p><p>–<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/nicolaus_copernicus_238392#:~:text=Nicolaus%20Copernicus%20Quotes&amp;text=Please%20enable%20Javascript-,At%20rest%2C%20however%2C%20in%20the%20middle,of%20everything%20is%20the%20sun.">Copernicus</a>, “De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium”</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoin Graffiti.

To gain a deeper understanding of people’s beliefs and values, and ultimately how these will inform their outlook on Bitcoin, it is crucial to consider their social views as well. This is where a political compass comes into play, serving as a valuable tool for analysis.</p><h2>What Is A Political Compass?</h2><p>The political compass is a graphical representation of political ideologies that helps categorize individuals or groups based on their views on two main axes: economic policy (left-right) and social policy (authoritarian-libertarian). It provides a more nuanced understanding of political ideologies beyond the traditional left-right spectrum.</p><p>You can easily take the political compass test <a href="https://politicalcompass.org/">at this link</a>.</p><figure>

        <figcaption><a href="https://politicalcompass.org/">Source</a></figcaption>
    </figure><p>The political compass allows for a more comprehensive understanding of political ideologies by incorporating both economic and social dimensions. It recognizes that political views cannot be easily reduced to a simple left-right spectrum and acknowledges the varying degrees of government intervention and social control that different ideologies advocate for.</p><p>The left-right axis reflects a spectrum of economic policy preferences. On the left side, you find ideologies that generally advocate for greater government intervention in the economy and more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. These ideologies may support policies such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs and government regulation of industries. They often prioritize social justice and reducing inequality.</p><p>On the right side, you find ideologies that favor less government intervention in the economy and emphasize individual freedom and free markets. These ideologies tend to support lower taxes, limited government regulation and free trade. They believe that economic prosperity is best achieved through minimal government interference and individual initiative.</p><p>The authoritarian-libertarian axis represents social policy preferences and the degree of government control over personal freedoms. Authoritarian ideologies advocate for a strong central authority that exercises control over various aspects of society. They may support strict law enforcement, censorship and limitations on individual rights in the name of maintaining social order and stability.</p><p>Libertarian ideologies, on the other hand, emphasize individual liberty and limited government intrusion into personal matters. They prioritize individual rights, civil liberties and freedom of choice. They advocate for a smaller role of government and believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions without unnecessary interference.</p><h2>How Different Political Views Inform Understanding Of Bitcoin</h2><p>By assessing someone’s position on the political compass, we can gain insight into their overall political outlook and where they stand on key issues related to economics and personal freedoms. This also affects how we understand Bitcoin based on the perspective of each spectrum. Let’s analyze them one by one.</p><h3>Left-Authoritarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>People with a left-authoritarian-leaning outlook prefer strong state authority and control over society. It represents a belief system where the government plays a significant role in both the economy and social affairs.</p><p>Left-authoritarians typically advocate for greater wealth redistribution, social welfare programs and government regulation of industries to address issues of inequality and social justice. They believe that a strong central authority is necessary to ensure economic equality and protect the rights of marginalized groups. Left-authoritarians may support progressive taxation, labor rights and government intervention in markets to promote economic stability and reduce disparities.</p><p>When it comes to social policy, they favor strict regulations and laws to maintain social order and advance their vision of a more equitable society. They often prioritize collective well-being over individual liberties and may endorse policies such as censorship, limitations on free speech and restrictions on personal freedoms in the interest of promoting social cohesion and harmony.</p><p>Left-authoritarian-leaning Bitcoin enthusiasts advocate for increased regulations surrounding Bitcoin. They harbor a skeptical view of Bitcoin, appreciating its technological advancements while expressing concerns about its potential impact on government taxation. Furthermore, they express worries about the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin. They also despise that Bitcoin can be used for criminal and terrorist activities. These individuals find Bitcoin Maximalists frustrating and urge them to adopt a more inclusive approach and align with the popular narrative.</p><h3>Right-Authoritarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>Right-authoritarians generally support free-market capitalism and limited government intervention in the economy. They advocate for policies such as lower taxes, deregulation and protection of private property rights. They believe that economic freedom and individual initiative are key to prosperity and societal well-being. Right-authoritarians often emphasize the importance of law and order, national security and maintaining traditional social hierarchies</p><p>In terms of social policy, right-authoritarians prioritize traditional values and cultural norms. They tend to oppose social changes that challenge traditional family structures, religious institutions or national identity.</p><p>A right-authoritarian Bitcoiner sees Bitcoin as a byproduct of a free market. They appreciate the technological advancements and capital gains that come with bitcoin. That’s why these individuals advocate for bitcoin as a personal savings or reserve.</p><p>They also acknowledge the potential for bitcoin to be used in money laundering and, therefore, handle bitcoin with caution, making efforts to comply with regulations such as paying capital gains taxes and adhering to know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for Bitcoin. For Muslim Bitcoiners within the right-authoritarian spectrum, there could be genuine concerns regarding whether Bitcoin is considered halal or haram.</p><p>Even though they do not entirely agree with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these Bitcoiners see CBDCs as an inevitable move and believe it can be helpful in providing financial access to more people.</p><h3>Left-Libertarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>Left-libertarians generally advocate for significant economic and social reforms to address inequalities and promote a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. Left-libertarians believe that economic power should be decentralized and shared among individuals rather than concentrated in the hands of a few.</p><p>They advocate for the removal of laws and regulations that restrict individual choices and behaviors, as long as they do not harm others. They support issues such as human rights, freedom of speech and the right to privacy. Left-libertarians are critical of state control and interventions that infringe upon individual liberties.</p><p>A left-libertarian Bitcoiner sees Bitcoin as a tool to grant financial freedom to marginalized individuals. They are profoundly moved by stories showcasing how Bitcoin has been utilized by dissidents and even in war zones. They consistently remind us of the cases of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-should-stand-up-for-my-brother-julian-assange">Julian Assange </a>and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-from-prison">Ross Ulbricht</a>, or quote George Orwell’s “1984” or “Animal Farm” books, using these examples to highlight why Bitcoin is necessary in the first place.</p><p>Left-libertarians prioritize utmost privacy, fearing that the State may eventually strip it away. They actively seek ways to obtain the most private form of bitcoin, and if they engage in mining, it is primarily to acquire bitcoin in a KYC-free way. They also pushed Bitcoin to be accepted as a global payment so that more people can be included in the economy.</p><p>Moreover, they hold a deep disdain for CBDCs and perceive them as a tool for State control over individuals. They express significant concerns about the potential correlation between CBDCs and social credit scores, similar to the system implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System">China</a>. Left-libertarians regard this as a serious threat to personal freedoms and are vigilant in voicing their apprehensions about the encroachment of State power.</p><p>In summary, the left-libertarian Bitcoiner advocates for using Bitcoin as a means to grant financial autonomy, strongly emphasizes privacy rights, resists CBDCs and remains wary of State overreach and potential surveillance systems.</p><h3>Right-Libertarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>Right-libertarians advocate for minimal government interference in the economy, promoting free-market capitalism and laissez-faire principles. They believe that voluntary transactions and individual self interest are the most efficient means to allocate resources and promote economic growth. Right-libertarians argue for reduced regulations, lower taxes and limited government spending, viewing these policies as catalysts for entrepreneurship, innovation and prosperity.</p><p><br>In terms of social policy, right-libertarians prioritize individual rights and freedoms, advocating for the protection of civil liberties, free speech and personal privacy. They generally oppose government intervention in matters such as drug use, consensual adult activities and non-violent behaviors. Right-libertarians value personal responsibility and self-determination, arguing that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices as long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others.</p><p>A right-libertarian Bitcoiner is enthusiastic about delving into Austrian economics literature. They firmly believe that Bitcoin represents the ultimate form of private property, immune to State interference. Many right-libertarians cherish their independence and prefer to be left alone. They enjoy weightlifting, follow a carnivorous diet and advocate for traditional family values.</p><p>These individuals are captivated by Bitcoin and eagerly explore various Lightning Network applications, always on the lookout for the latest innovations in the Bitcoin space. Some of them actively participate in trading or even establish their own Bitcoin-related businesses as alternative avenues to acquire more bitcoin.</p><p>Typically, these individuals prioritize their freedom of speech and are unafraid to express their views. They maintain a strong focus on investing in bitcoin with a long-term mindset, hoping that one day, their bitcoin holdings will generate wealth for their families.</p><p>They also despise CBDCs and surveillance cameras because they can be used as tools to strip away freedoms. Right-libertarians perceive CBDCs as a threat to the economy, as they bear the potential for hyperinflation and state control.</p><h3>Centrist Bitcoiners</h3><p>But what if your views lean neither left nor right? This would make you a “centrist.” Centrism is characterized by a moderate and pragmatic approach to politics, seeking to find a balance between competing interests and perspectives.</p><p>Centrists often emphasize the importance of practical solutions and compromise. They believe in considering a range of viewpoints, weighing evidence and making decisions based on what they perceive as the most effective and reasonable courses of action. Centrists typically reject extreme or rigid ideological positions, preferring a more flexible and nuanced approach. They are inclined to support policies that are based on evidence, effectiveness and the overall well-being of society.</p><p>A centrist Bitcoiner, whether positioned on the y axis (authoritarian-libertarian) or the x axis of the political compass, takes a pragmatic approach to Bitcoin. They do not discount the fact that accumulating bitcoin can be a means to personal enrichment and is also important for personal freedom. However, they also recognize the importance of the fiat system as it undergirds the currencies that people currently use.</p><p>Sometimes, other Bitcoiners perceive centrist Bitcoiners as opportunistic or confusing because they tend to navigate both sides of the spectrum. They may express skepticism towards cryptocurrencies on one occasion while being supportive of them on another. Similarly, they might hold both anti-government and pro-government regulation views. For centrists, their stance depends on the specific context of each situation. These Bitcoiners always try to appease extreme opinions from different spectrums and sometimes enjoy playing the devil’s advocate.</p><h2>Respect For Nuance</h2><p>It is foolish to label Bitcoiners solely as “libertards” or “maxis” because, based on this breakdown, there are nuanced differences among them all. </p><p>There are no right or wrong views, and no group holds superiority over others. This analysis serves to illustrate that everyone possesses unique perspectives, and this diversity will always be a dynamic characteristic of the world, particularly within the Bitcoin space.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dea Rezkitha.

These new financial instruments would allow institutional and retail investors to access exposure to bitcoin's price without having to purchase actual bitcoin.</p><p>On the surface, this would be a major win for Bitcoin adoption because it will become easier for financial advisors, previously hesitant or unable to enter this market, to assist clients with a form of bitcoin allocation.</p><p>Banks and other traditional financial players will also use the spot ETF to increase their exposures, which may increase bitcoin's exchange rate with the dollar. For families and individuals, however, shares of a bitcoin product through spot ETFs are not a substitute for holding bitcoin in self custody.</p><p>Ultimately, Bitcoin ETF products still exist within the traditional financial system and do not offer complete protection from market, government or compliance risk. As such, market forces can affect the ETF issuers, and governments can enact and enforce regulations <a href="https://fee.org/articles/money-the-great-gold-robbery/">by decree</a> that devalue or debase the consumer's assets.</p><p>In contrast, holding real bitcoin allows individuals to access a <a href="https://coinbits.app/blog/is-bitcoin-a-bearer-asset#:~:text=In%20practice%2C%20bitcoin%20functions%20like,the%20first%20of%20its%20kind.">digital bearer asset</a> outside of control of governments and traditional financial institutions. Though it introduces new risks associated with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/weighing-the-options-of-bitcoin-private-key-management">private key management</a>, every diversified portfolio should have a real bitcoin allocation, regardless of any additional allocation to a bitcoin ETF. </p><p>As investors seek to diversify to spread risk and protect themselves from geopolitical and market shocks, there is no substitute for bitcoin in self custody. </p><h2>Advice Outside Of The Financial System</h2><p>For years, financial advisors have dutifully allocated clients' wealth across a variety of traditional financial assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, insurance). In aggregate, they have performed reasonably well. Vanguard analysts <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/IARCQAA.pdf">have calculated</a> that advisors can increase the value of client portfolios by up to 3% by simply ensuring that they follow best practices, rather than trying to chase returns. Advisors benefit from a <a href="https://money.usnews.com/financial-advisors/articles/financial-advisor-fees-and-costs#:~:text=An%20AUM%20fee%20of%201,of%20the%20year%20will%20change.">typical 1% annual fee</a> on assets under management (AUM).</p><p>Yet good financial advisors are more than outsourced portfolio allocators who recommend the right "blend" of assets to match a client's goals and risk profile. They work with clients to ensure protection from a wide range of outcomes and ensure wealth preservation through retirement and for future generations.</p><p>Some advisors ignore the reality that allocations entirely within the traditional financial system are exposed to risk stemming from the <a href="https://mises.org/library/austrian-theory-trade-cycle-and-other-essays">"boom and bust"</a> financial market cycle. As a result, sometimes clients must risk being unable to retire or change jobs until the market picks up again, placing them at a significant lifestyle setback.</p><p>Proper diversification requires liquid assets outside of the traditional financial system. For generations, the best asset for doing so <a href="https://coinbits.app/blog/which-is-better-gold-or-bitcoin">was physical gold</a>. In 2009, however, Satoshi Nakamoto released the next-best bearer asset, bitcoin, and with it a novel system with a <a href="https://coinbits.app/blog/how-many-bitcoins-are-there">credibly fixed monetary policy</a>. Now, anyone can use bitcoin to free up liquidity during a crisis.</p><h2>A Spot ETF Vs. Real Bitcoin</h2><p>The potential spot bitcoin ETF would provide benefits, such as exposure to bitcoin's price movements, some diversification from traditional financial markets and ease of purchase. Despite these advantages, it falters in <a href="https://mises.org/library/origin-money-and-its-value">saleability</a>, a key feature of a diversified portfolio.</p><p>Bitcoin operates on a monetary network that runs 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. Individuals and institutions can use it to instantly transfer value without third-party approval. They can also sell bitcoin for fiat currencies at any time via centralized exchanges or peer to peer.</p><p>In contrast, individuals and institutions can only exchange shares of a spot bitcoin ETF for fiat liquidity when financial markets are open, which, for retail investors, is 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, excluding holidays. Exchanges can also halt trading at will or because they receive <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions.htm">a regulatory order</a>, further limiting the saleability of ETF shares. </p><p>In another scenario, if a government attempts to restrict the acquisition of bitcoin, it might be able to seize the asset manager's bitcoin or order it to liquidate the ETF. Holding real bitcoin yourself by managing your own private keys offers exit ability from a system with strong capital controls, rather than suffering the consequences of an unpredictable future.</p><h2>Essential Protection, Meaningful Diversification</h2><p>Owning shares of a bitcoin product is not equivalent to directly holding bitcoin. Spot bitcoin ETFs would remain tethered to the conventional financial system. This has some mild advantages, but ultimately this limits the ability of bitcoin to be used as a shield against the risk inherent in the traditional financial system.</p><p>Including actual bitcoin is essential to a diversified portfolio, even if that portfolio already has a spot bitcoin ETF position.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by David Waugh.

The long-awaited debut of the European spot bitcoin ETF comes after a significant delay, which has only intensified the anticipation surrounding its arrival. Coinciding with this news, the United States is also experiencing a surge of interest in a similar product, kicking off with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">filing by BlackRock</a> for an American spot bitcoin ETF.</p><p>Jacobi Asset Management is responsible for the ETF listing, which was actually approved in 2021. Due to market conditions in 2022, the ETF was delayed — although there’s no official launch date yet, the development comes at an opportune time. </p><p>The ETF is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly owning the underlying asset, albeit at the costs of properties only offered by self-custody. By offering a regulated and easily accessible investment vehicle, the spot bitcoin ETF has the potential to attract a broader range of institutional investors.</p><p>The delay in launching the European spot bitcoin ETF had only heightened market expectations. Investors have been eagerly awaiting a regulatory green light that would enable them to tap into the Bitcoin market with the convenience and security of an ETF structure. Now, with the imminent arrival of Europe's first spot Bitcoin ETF, many believe that it could herald a new era for bitcoin in the region.</p><p>Simultaneously, the United States has witnessed a surge of interest in a spot bitcoin ETF following <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">BlackRock's recent filing</a>. As one of the world's largest asset management firms, BlackRock's entry signals a significant shift in sentiment towards bitcoin. Indeed, several other similarly large firms <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fidelity-refiles-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-joining-peer-institutions">filed spot bitcoin ETFs afterwards</a>.</p><p>The filing indicates that even established traditional financial institutions are recognizing the growing demand for regulated exposure to bitcoin. If approved, a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. could potentially provide a significant boost to the market, attracting institutional investors and further bringing bitcoin mainstream.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNTY1MTQ0NDExNjEyODM1/ac-btc.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark Announces Completion Of Georgia Expansion, Surpasses 8 EH/s]]></title><description><![CDATA[With this expansion complete, CleanSpark has reached the halfway point of its year-end goal of reaching 16 EH/s.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-completion-of-georgia-expansion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-completion-of-georgia-expansion</guid><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 18:43:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyNjg3OTY1/bitcoin-mining.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>CleanSpark Inc. has announced the completion of phase two of its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-50-megawatt-bitcoin-mining-expansion">mining campus expansion in Washington, Georgia</a>.

According to the <a href="https://blog.mutinywallet.com/p/144ff55a-aebc-4cc8-88ef-a933b91a96d1/">release announcement</a>, the wallet aims to solve the onboarding challenge for Bitcoin users worldwide by providing accessibility regardless of location or device. The announcement described the wallet’s mission of catering to the five billion global internet users with web browser access by offering complete control of funds and eliminating the need for identity verification. Additionally, the wallet is aimed at introducing unique features that have been restricted by stringent App Store requirements in other Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>The first highlighted feature of Mutiny Wallet is its integration of Lightning, a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Bitcoin. The wallet leverages Block's <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorsey-spiral-presents-the-lightning-dev-kit">Lightning Development Kit</a> (LDK) project, allowing developers to customize various aspects of the Lightning stack. To facilitate user liquidity management, Mutiny Wallet has partnered with Voltage and their Flow 2.0 product, enabling new users to receive their first Lightning payment within seconds of opening the application.</p><p>Furthermore, Mutiny Wallet has introduced separate balances for Lightning channel funds and on-chain spending, aiming for unified balances in the future. The wallet also emphasizes the importance of backups and introduces encrypted and remote storage for restoring Lightning-related data. Users are encouraged to provide feedback during the open beta phase, as the announcement said the team is dedicated to addressing bugs and swiftly implementing new features.</p><p>Mutiny Wallet also provides support for Nostr Wallet Connections, a tipping feature for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/nostr">Nostr</a>, a protocol enabling decentralized social media. In addition, Mutiny also intends to introduce subscriptions, offering a pull-based subscription feature built on Nostr Wallet Connect. They offer an example of this in their own subscription, Mutiny+. While Mutiny+ currently provides limited perks according to the announcement, additional paid-only features are planned for the future.</p><p>Despite the wallet's progress, some caution is advised due to potential issues, such as payment reliability and force-closes on Lightning channels. The team acknowledged the complexity of Lightning and urged users to avoid loading large sums of funds during the beta phase. </p><p>Mutiny Wallet extended its gratitude to the contributors who have aided in its development, including individuals who provided design, frontend and translation support, as well as the teams behind BDK and LDK for their core technology. Users are encouraged to <a href="https://app.mutinywallet.com">test the wallet</a> and provide feedback to help shape its future development and enhance its usability.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwNDI3MzM2NzA3OTQxNjI1/flag-freedom-nation-adventure-innovation.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[No, Bitcoin Ordinals Do Not Inscribe Data Onto Sats]]></title><description><![CDATA[Whether Ordinal inscriptions are good or bad for Bitcoin, misleading descriptions need to be called out.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/clearing-up-a-fallacy-about-bitcoin-ordinal-inscriptions</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/clearing-up-a-fallacy-about-bitcoin-ordinal-inscriptions</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Ordinals]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Inscriptions]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Bitcoms]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMTczNDY5NTEyNTc0NjIy/bitcoin-blockchain.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Bitcoms, a Bitcoin writer.</em></p><blockquote><p>“So quick bright things come to confusion”&nbsp;</p><p>–William Shakespeare, “<a href="https://booksonthewall.com/blog/william-shakespeare-quote-midsummer-nights-dream-2/#:~:text=That%2C%20in%20a%20spleen%2C%20unfolds,bright%20things%20come%20to%20confusion.%E2%80%9D">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>”</p></blockquote><p>“<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html">Inscriptions</a>” are a way of writing pieces of arbitrary information onto the Bitcoin blockchain. “<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html">Ordinals</a>” are a convention used for tracking individual sats and linking them to inscriptions. This article does not attempt to argue for or against Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions. Rather, it argues against the confusing, inaccurate and sometimes dubious ways they can be presented, marketed and sold. </p><p>It deals with a widespread fallacy which insinuates that ownership of Ordinal inscriptions is enforced and protected by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol itself (I maintain that it is not). And while this fallacy may be asserted duplicitously or innocently, it is always pernicious because it can make Ordinal inscriptions more attractive to prospective buyers. </p><p>Here is a typical example:</p><blockquote><p>“Ordinals allow a variety of data, including text, images, and video to be inscribed on a single Satoshi (the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin) and permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://docs.ordinals.market">Introduction documentation</a> for Ordinals Market</p></blockquote><p>This suggests that ownership of an inscription will be protected by the permanence and immutability of the Bitcoin timechain itself. But Bitcoin does not enforce ownership of inscriptions, because an inscription is not “inscribed on a single satoshi” on the blockchain at all. </p><p>As the “<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/">Ordinal Theory Handbook</a>,” the guide to Ordinal theory <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/">compiled by its developers</a>, points out:</p><p>“<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/faq.html">Satoshis live in outputs”</a> while “<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/guides/inscriptions.html">inscription content is included in transaction witnesses</a>.”</p><p>While both <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/mod/book/view.php?id=36308&amp;chapterid=18905">output data</a> and <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/w/witness">witness data</a> are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain following the SegWit upgrade, claiming that inscription data is inextricably linked to an "inscribed" satoshi creates a misleading notion that any such link is recognized by Bitcoin itself.</p><p>In reality, the link between an inscription and a specific satoshi is manufactured off chain by a <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html">purpose-built external indexer</a>. This pulls data from the Bitcoin blockchain and presents it according to an elegant but ultimately centralized and arbitrary system of rules called “Ordinal theory.” These rules are entirely extraneous to the Bitcoin protocol itself, and have been described by their originator as <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor/status/1623355293362171906?s=20">akin to astrology</a>. </p><h2>Spread Of The Inscription Fallacy</h2><p>But in my view, statements in many of the places where Ordinal inscriptions can be created, viewed, bought and sold, as well in media coverage, do not explain the role of the Ordinal indexer clearly enough. Thus, the idea that inscriptions are embedded “onto” or directly “into” satoshis, and that the inscription data and a corresponding sat are inextricably linked within the Bitcoin protocol without the need for an external indexer, has created a dangerous fallacy for potential investors. </p><p>Here are just a few examples of such statements:</p><blockquote><p>“Ordinal Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin.”</p><p>–<a href="https://ordinals.hiro.so">Ordinals.hiro.so</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“...Ordinals are ‘inscribed’ onto a single satoshi… Inscribing is the process of putting a piece of data onto the blockchain, where it will remain forever accessible and unchangeable.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/bytes/archive/the-bitcoin-ordinals-buzz-explained">“Coinbase Bytes” newsletter</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Each sat can be inscribed with data, such as JPGs, GIFs, PDFs and more, creating a Bitcoin Ordinal which is then held in a wallet.”</p><p>–<a href="https://support.gamma.io/hc/en-us/articles/15116277490707-What-is-an-Ordinal-">Gamma FAQ</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“What are Bitcoin Ordinals?

It simply spotlights the misleading, sometimes sloppy, and perhaps at times scammy, ways they are being presented, which wrongly implies that Bitcoin itself will enforce inscription ownership without the use of an external tool.</p><p>So, what can be done to make sure potential buyers of Ordinal inscriptions do not fall victim to this fallacy? We can keep clearing up confusion by pointing it out. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoms.

It combines two powerful tools — Macaroons, and of course, the Lightning Network.</p><p>Macaroons are special tokens used for authentication. They include permissions and can be verified using a root key. The <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402">documentation</a> states this is important for systems where we want to avoid or cannot go about looking up the validity of each token.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/lightning">Lightning</a> is a Layer 2 solution for making fast and secure bitcoin payments. L402 leverages the capabilities of Macaroons and Lightning to create a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and make payments without needing a central database.</p><p>In L402, a Macaroon includes a payment hash. To be valid, the user needs to present the Macaroon and the preimage corresponding to the payment hash in the Macaroon. The preimage is obtained by paying a Lightning Network invoice.</p><p>A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/new-developer-tools-enable-easy-lightning-and-ai-integration">newly introduced</a> software called <a href="https://github.com/lightninglabs/aperture/tree/master">Aperture</a> acts as a middleman between the user and the service's API. It forwards requests with valid L402 to the relevant API endpoint and can issue new Macaroons and Lightning invoices to new users.</p><p>L402 allows for metered APIs, where services can charge for their usage without requiring logins or passwords. The Macaroon, together with the preimage, guarantees that the payer has made the payment.</p><p>The L402 specification includes different characteristics such as the version of the Macaroon, a unique user identifier and a payment hash that links the Macaroon to the Lightning invoice. The Macaroon can also include caveats that define access to specific services, service capabilities and service constraints.</p><p>When verifying the L402, the server uses the root key to check that the Macaroon was issued by the appropriate authority and that each caveat was properly amended. The preimage is also verified against the payment hash to ensure that all outstanding invoices have been paid.</p><p>In summary, L402 is a protocol that combines Macaroons and the Lightning Network to enable charging for services and authenticating users. It allows for secure payments and authentication without relying on a central database. Aperture is a software that helps handle the process and allows services to issue Macaroons and Lightning Network invoices.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4NzU2NzcxMDYwMzI4MDE2/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[SEC Inspector General Urged To Investigate Prometheum SPBD Approval Amidst Crypto Regulatory Scrutiny]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Blockchain Association has sent a letter requesting an investigation into the seemingly non-conforming approval.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sec-inspector-general-urged-to-investigate-prometheum-spbd-approval</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sec-inspector-general-urged-to-investigate-prometheum-spbd-approval</guid><category><![CDATA[SEC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 18:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The Blockchain Association, a nonprofit organization advocating for pro-innovation policies in relation to Bitcoin, has called for an investigation into the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approval of Prometheum Ember Capital as a Special Purpose Broker Dealer (SPBD). In <a href="https://twitter.com/MTCoppel/status/1679149946556280832?s=20">a letter</a> to the Inspector General of the SEC, the association raises concerns about potential impropriety and ethical issues surrounding the approval process.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/MTCoppel/status/1679149946556280832"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The letter highlights the lack of regulatory clarity regarding how U.S. securities laws apply to digital assets and criticizes SEC Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the SEC of overt hostility towards the digital assets industry while citing enforcement actions and proposed rulemaking that have impacted the sector. The approval of Prometheum as an SPBD is seen as concerning, as other companies with what the letter describes as "legitimate business models" have faced denials or delays in obtaining similar licenses.</p><p>The letter states Prometheum's license approval comes at a time when the company has no working product or assets, raising further questions. The association questions whether Prometheum received preferential treatment or leveraged personal connections to gain an unfair advantage. They express concern that SEC Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process to impede congressional efforts towards legislation and promote what it views as a false narrative, that the law is clear regarding digital asset securities. “There's no question Prometheum is hiding something on its SEC relationship,” said Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Association. </p><p>The Blockchain Association has submitted a request to the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking documents and communications related to the matter. They urge the opening of an investigation to address these concerns and provide clarity. The outcome of the investigation will determine whether there was any impropriety or validate the inferences made by the association.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Crumbling Economic Fundamentals, The Future Of Bitcoin Adoption In Norway Is Bright]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin adoption in Norway has been slow, but the dwindling value of the nation’s currency and growing concerns about the economy might speed it up.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/economics-in-norway-paves-way-for-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/economics-in-norway-paves-way-for-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[inflation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Norway]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rune Østgård,Alexander Ellefsen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4OTI1NTg0NzQ5ODk3Njc2/20220420_btcfinal_norway_jaran_mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rune Østgård and Alexander Ellefsen, financial writers based in Norway.</em></p><p>Although we don’t have exact numbers on Bitcoin adoption globally, we do know that the global average cryptocurrency adoption rate was estimated to be at about <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6465463e9f049c5fc0df1960/">12%</a> in 2022 and that bitcoin currently has about <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/">half of the total market cap of the global cryptocurrency market</a>. Turkey (27.1%) and Argentina (23.5%) topped the 2022 adoption list, and the countries with the most inflation seem to have the highest adoption rates. </p><p>The oil-rich nation of Norway is at <a href="https://k33.com/research/reports/industry-reports/norwegian-crypto-adoption-survey-2023">8% cryptocurrency adoption,</a> which is just two-thirds of the global average. Considering that it has a rather tech-savvy population, this is surprisingly low. The following factors might provide some explanation:</p><ul><li><a href="https://no.tradingeconomics.com/norway/inflation-cpi">The official consumer price index (CPI) numbers</a> have been modest compared with most other countries.</li><li>Norwegian politicians demonstrate a negative attitude toward cryptocurrencies, and as analyst <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-around-the-world-norway/">Jaran Mellerud at Luxor</a> reports, the government wants to “smoke” out miners.</li><li>According to the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/governance/trust-in-government/">Organisation For Economic Co-Operation And Development (OECD)</a>, six out of 10 Norwegians “trust” their government, which is 50% more than the average OECD country. </li></ul><p>But a significant weakening of the Norwegian krone (NOK) may begin to incentivize more people and businesses to join the Bitcoin economy. </p><p>The NOK’s value has <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/sdXJbefN/?symbol=SAXO%3ANOKUSD">depreciated slowly but steadily since the financial crisis</a>, and the “frog boiling” effect might be the reason why there has been so little focus on it. This has <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDNOK/">changed in the last few months, as the depreciation has gained momentum</a>. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=USD&amp;To=NOK">it takes 10.7 NOK to buy $1,</a> up from <a href="https://freecurrencyrates.com/en/exchange-rate-history/USD-NOK/2008/cbr">4.9 NOK in 2008</a>. At its worst this year, the NOK had depreciated 10% against the USD, and even performed worse than the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NOKTRY/">Turkish lira</a> and <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/poorest-countries-in-europe">one of the poorest European country’s currency</a>, the <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=MDL&amp;To=NOK">Moldovan lei</a>. It probably helped very little that Norway’s minister of finance, in the beginning of June, told the people that “<a href="https://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/vedum-om-kronesjokket-den-norske-kronen-er-en-god-valuta/15779549/">the Norwegian krone is a good currency</a>.”</p><p>Economists scratch their heads as they are at pains to explain why the NOK is so unpopular, but judging from media coverage, people and companies are becoming increasingly wary. </p><h2>What Is Wrong In Norway?</h2><p>A loose monetary policy is probably one of the reasons why the NOK has performed so badly. The small country might be able to export large quantities of oil, but it’s in no position to export inflation. In the period of 2002 to 2022 the money supply (NOK M2) increased by an average per year at roughly 7%. This is on par with the USD, but it’s 16% faster than the euro, which had an average growth of 5.9% per year. While many factors affect the exchange rate, nothing good can come from letting the printing press run at high speed.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>A lower exchange rate makes imports more costly, fuels CPI numbers and gives the central bank an excuse to continue to raise interest rates. Norwegian citizens therefore are now hit with a triple whammy: high interest rates, high domestic price inflation and sharply increased costs for the thousands of sun-deprived Norwegians who are used to traveling abroad for their vacations. When the mainstream media covers the weak NOK, the standard theme is that budgets dictate that <a href="https://www.nhoreiseliv.no/tall-og-fakta/nyhet/2023/trenden-med-norgesferie-fortsetter/">people must stay within the borders when they go on summer holiday this year</a>.</p><p>Corporations that have a relatively-high share of their costs in foreign currency while their income mainly is in NOK have a particularly tough time. Home builders, who find themselves in this category due to increased reliance on imported materials, are hit hard. The weak currency eats up their profits, while the steep interest rate hikes have caused the market for <a href="https://www.boligprodusentene.no/artikkelarkiv/pressemelding/">sales of new homes to plummet</a>. Adjusted for population growth, sales are now at the same levels as when the market bottomed out during the great financial crisis.</p><p>If you also consider that:</p><ul><li>The government continues to raise taxes although Norway already <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-highlights-brochure.pdf">has a high tax rate </a>and a public sector that consumes about two-thirds of GDP (<a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/91bdfca9231d45408e8107a703fee790/en-gb/pdfs/stm202020210014000engpdfs.pdf">66% in the pandemic year of 2020</a> and 61% in 2022)</li><li>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly">record number of super-rich people are abandoning Norway for low-tax countries</a></li><li>Norwegians now top the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm">OECD’s ranking of debt to disposable income per household</a> (247%)</li></ul><p>…then the picture looks increasingly grim.</p><p>It probably doesn’t help the NOK that most of the state’s income from taxes on oil and gas is being transferred to the government’s <a href="https://www.nbim.no/en/">sovereign wealth fund</a>, which only invests its capital outside of Norway. Today, the fund makes up more than<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/norway/gdp"> two times the GDP</a>. The consequence of swapping the value of the petroleum resources in Norway for capital that is invested abroad is that the country gets an increasingly smaller capital base that the NOK can be invested in. </p><p>No wonder that the players in the foreign-exchange market and the wealthiest Norwegians worry that the NOK in the future will be reduced to nothing but a token for tax payments.</p><h2>Primed For Bitcoin</h2><p>The violent depreciation of the NOK compared to the currencies of almost all other nations and the low adoption rate of cryptocurrencies make the Norwegian case special. If the NOK falls further and Norwegians invest more into bitcoin, this might indicate that the same will happen in other advanced economies with loose monetary policies.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Norwegian citizens and corporations begin to line up for a consultation with Dr. Bitcoin. Considering that there is no other remedy in sight, we believe that economic incentives will beat the citizens’ exaggerated trust in the government.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rune Østgård and Alexander Ellefsen.

The legal action stemmed from the Fed's inexplicable delay in approving Custodia's application for a "Master Account," a process that typically takes 5-7 days but had been pending for over two years. This extended delay, eventually turning into a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/orders20230127a.htm">denial on January 27, 2023</a>, raised concerns about potential biases favoring incumbent banks over disruptive newcomers like Custodia. The outcome of this lawsuit could have profound implications for the future of banking regulations and reshape the entire industry.</p><p>Custodia's disruptive approach aims to revolutionize the banking model by positioning itself as the least risky bank in the U.S., which would make it highly attractive to investors. It does this through its charter as a SPDI bank, or special purpose depository institution. These SPDI banks “are fully-reserved banks that receive deposits and conduct other activity incidental to the business of banking, including custody, asset servicing, fiduciary asset management and related activities,” according to the <a href="https://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/banks-and-trust-companies/special-purpose-depository-institutions">official website</a>. In other words, their business model is to make money from banking services and take far less risk than any other bank in the world. The key aspect of Custodia's strategy involves completely eliminating the controversial practice of fractional reserve lending, a move that no other bank in the United States has undertaken. If Americans had any idea what kind of risk they take by depositing money into a fractional reserve bank, they would likely revolt. </p><p>SPDI banks’ commitment to eliminating fractional reserve lending would likely strike a chord with institutions seeking to mitigate risks and hedge their investments. Additionally, a bank like Custodia could leverage Wyoming's pioneering regulatory framework for digital assets, providing customers with a system that ensures safety and security without resorting to rehypothecation or over-leveraging. This distinctive offering sets banks like Custodia apart from traditional banks and positions it as a trusted partner for institutional investors.</p><p>The lawsuit filed by Custodia against the Federal Reserve marks a historic milestone. As the case proceeds to the discovery phase, previously undisclosed internal emails and documents within the Fed are expected to come to light. This transparency could unveil any potential advantages afforded to incumbent banks and shed light on the fairness of the approval process. Custodia will also likely have the opportunity to conduct interviews under oath with prominent Fed officials, including Jay Powell and Kansas City Fed Governor Esther George. Such testimonies could reveal further insights into the approval process for <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/moonstone-bank-the-washington-state-bank-with-ties-to-ftx-will-wind-down-crypto-operations/">Moonstone Bank</a>, in which FTX/Alameda invested, raising questions about proper handling and fairness.</p><p>While the outcome of the lawsuit remains uncertain, a favorable ruling for Custodia could result in a substantial influx of institutional capital into Wyoming. The state's digital asset regulatory framework, coupled with Custodia's disruptive business model, offers clarity and priority for digital assets, attracting institutional investors seeking reliable and innovative banking solutions. The potential impact of Custodia's success extends beyond the banking industry, potentially triggering significant price movements in Bitcoin and influencing future banking regulations. As the case progresses and the court demands an administrative record from the Federal Reserve, the urgency and significance of this lawsuit are expected to become more apparent within the U.S. courts.</p><p>In her <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/march-2023-newsletter/">March 2023 newsletter</a>, Lyn Alden bluntly puts it, "From a depositor perspective, banks are essentially highly-leveraged bond funds with payment services attached, and we naively trust them with our hard-earned savings." Where would you rather keep your money, in a "highly-leveraged bond fund," or with Custodia? </p><p>If the answer to that question isn't clear, it's time for a wakeup call.</p><p>The philosophy is simple: instead of the famous “Don’t be evil,” mantra, the regulations at SPDI banks make it so that “You can't be evil." Unlike traditional banks, an SPDI bank like Custodia would prioritize the security and well-being of its customers.</p><p>This case may serve as a reckoning, and could become a watershed event that extends far beyond bitcoin, exposing the overreach of the Federal Reserve on our money and the profound unfairness of our banking systems. Technological advancements have brought these issues to the forefront, demanding action.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New Phoenix Lightning Wallet Beta Reimagines The Self-Custodial Experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Calling itself a third-generation self-custodial Lightning wallet, Phoenix’s new update sports significant updates.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/new-phoenix-lightning-wallet-beta-reimagines-the-self-custodial-experience</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/new-phoenix-lightning-wallet-beta-reimagines-the-self-custodial-experience</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Self Custody]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 17:01:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/">Phoenix</a>, a Lightning wallet developed by Acinq, has undergone significant <a href="https://acinq.co/blog/phoenix-splicing-update">improvements</a> with the introduction of splicing technology, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly experience. Unlike previous versions, which created multiple channels and incurred unpredictable fees, the new Phoenix manages a single dynamic channel, eliminating the need for scattered liquidity and splitting issues.</p><p>With splicing, users can now resize channels, adding or removing funds without adding future risk. The previous 1% fee on inbound liquidity has been replaced by the mining fee for the underlying on-chain transaction. The announcement emphasized the significance of splicing, stating, "We believe that the efficiency gains brought by splicing are so phenomenal that all wallets will eventually implement it."</p><p>The updated version of Phoenix also addresses user concerns regarding unexpected channel creation fees. Users are now notified in advance when an incoming Lightning payment will incur a channel management fee, allowing for fine control over fee management. Additionally, the fee for sending Lightning payments is now fixed at 0.4%, ensuring transparency and aligning incentives between users and the wallet provider, “to find the best (reliable, affordable) route within the fee budget.”</p><p>One notable feature of the new Phoenix is trustless swaps. Instead of relying on swap services, which often lack flexibility, Phoenix enables users to make on-chain transactions directly from their channel. Users have the freedom to set their own feerate and even adjust the fee later for faster confirmation.</p><p>While splicing offers remarkable benefits, it should be noted that external swap services still hold advantages in certain transactions. These services cut the link between off-chain and on-chain, maintaining the channel size and adding inbound liquidity.</p><p>The new Phoenix wallet marks a significant milestone in the development of self-custodial wallets. Its enhanced features, such as splicing, improved predictability and trustless swaps, showcase the continuous innovation in the Lightning Network ecosystem. The announcement noted that users can look forward to advancements like blinded paths for better privacy, BOLT 12/Offers for static Lightning invoices and Taproot for cheaper channel management and enhanced on-chain privacy.</p><p>The beta version of the new Phoenix is currently available for Android users, with an ETA for iOS release expected in the coming weeks. Interested users can apply for the beta by emailing phoenix@acinq.co.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unchained Announces New Signature Private Client Service]]></title><description><![CDATA[Members of the new service will receive special benefits, support and features akin to traditional premium banking services.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-new-signature-private-client-service</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-new-signature-private-client-service</guid><category><![CDATA[financial services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Custody]]></category><category><![CDATA[multi-signature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unchained capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 15:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained</a>, a Bitcoin custodial services company, has announced the launch of its private client service with collaborative custody. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new platform called “Unchained Signature” is a “membership-based service that helps high-net-worth individuals, institutions and corporations invest in and manage their bitcoin.”</p><p>The company compares the experience to that of premium banking services, but with the added twist of multi-signature custodial models that Unchained is known for. “The fact that clients hold their own bitcoin keys, even when they get a loan with their bitcoin used as collateral, is an assurance that Unchained is not able to singularly move or rehypothecate client funds, as many now-defunct crypto firms did prior to their collapse,” the press release stated.</p><p>Dedicated account management features described include private trade execution, multi-million dollar loans and retirement and estate planning — plus technical support, even to the extent that advisors will travel in-person for assistance during emergencies. In addition, Signature clients will receive early access to Unchained’s latest products as well as exclusive access to networking events. </p><p>“As the best performing asset of the last decade, bitcoin continues to draw in new high-net-worth individuals and institutions, many of whom have previously shied away from crypto due to technical barriers and third-party risks,” said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained, as he described the company’s opportunity. “Unchained Signature exists to help these investors buy, secure, and grow their bitcoin with as much technical and logistical assistance as they need — all without compromising security.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[As Zimbabwe’s Fiat Currency Crashes Again, Bitcoin Adoption Is Poised To Last]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recent efforts from Zimbabwe’s reserve bank to bolster its local currency signal the return of rampant inflation and the need for Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/with-return-of-zimbabwe-inflation-bitcoin-adoption-will-stick</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/with-return-of-zimbabwe-inflation-bitcoin-adoption-will-stick</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cbdcs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Africa]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gold]]></category><category><![CDATA[Zimbabwe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[hyperinflation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Usd]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thabo P.

Ncube, a Bitcoiner who lived through Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation in 2008.</em></p><p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the fiat custodian and lender of last resort in the country, recently “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-06/zimbabwe-liberalizes-foreign-exchange-market-as-it-hikes-rates#xj4y7vzkg">liberalized</a>” its much-vaunted <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/index.php/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-auction">foreign exchange auction trading system</a> in hopes of selling foreign currencies at market-determined exchange rates through regulated banks.</p><p>Zimbabwe <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/z/zwd-zimbabwe-dollar.asp#:~:text=ZWD%20in%20April.-,The%20Multiple%20Currency%20System,South%20African%20rand%20(ZAR).">uses a multi-currency system</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/zimbabwe-announces-new-measures-aid-ailing-local-currency-2023-05-30/">with 80% of its economy being dollarized</a>, according to economists. The black-market rate for the U.S. dollar (USD) has recently been<a href="https://www.newzimbabwe.com/black-market-exchange-rate-breaches-zwl2-000-mark-prices-soar/"> twice as high or even higher</a> than the official rate backed by the RBZ.</p><p>In January 2023, the local Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) was trading at about <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/Foreign_Exchange_Auction/2023/AUCTION_RESULTS_-_10-01-23_pdf.pdf">ZWL$705 to $1</a>, but on June 7, 2023, just after the bank’s pivot, the official price was about <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/Foreign_Exchange_Auction/2023/June/WHOLESALE_AUCTION_RESULTS_FOR_PUBLICATION_-07.06.2023.pdf">ZWL$4,868 to $1</a>. Just a day earlier, the black-market rate was reported to be around <a href="https://twitter.com/BitiTendai/status/1666113606813990912">ZWL$7,000 to $1</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, the month-over-month inflation rate in Zimbabwe was measured at <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/local-news/article/200012114/inflation-spikes-in-may">15.7% in May 2023</a>, while the annualized inflation was <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/local-news/article/200012114/inflation-spikes-in-may">estimated to have reached 75.6%</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/">Professor Steve Hanke</a> of John Hopkins University recently measured Zimbabwe’s annual inflation rate at <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1674137842392485907">1,298%, the highest in the world</a>. </p><p>I believe that these painful developments, and many others, have opened the door for Bitcoin adoption in Zimbabwe, and that no person and no institution will be able to stop it.</p><h2>In The Wake Of Financial Crisis</h2><p>For most Zimbabweans, 2023 must feel like déjà vu all over again. </p><p>In 2008, at the apex of another financial crisis, Zimbabweans lost their savings when inflation hit world-record levels (<a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2009/5/cj29n2-8.pdf">79.6 billion percent)</a> and many, including myself, had to carry bundles of money just to buy food essentials in long queues. </p><p>The country stabilized to a certain extent, a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe_Government_of_National_Unity_of_2009#:~:text=The%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity,Mutambara%20as%20Deputy%20Prime%20Ministers.">Government of National Unity</a>” was formed between the ruling party and the leading opposition party after a disputed and violent election. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-06/usd-use-dethrones-zwl-for-second-time#:~:text=The%20Zimbabwean%20dollar%20was%20abolished,to%20revive%20the%20stagnating%20economy.">nation fully adopted the USD</a> and it was minted as the only legal tender. Public or private sector employees who had worked for 30 years and sometimes more lost their savings as the whole economic infrastructure collapsed. </p><p>The value of trillions of ZWL just vaporized and left many in despair. To this day, many Zimbabweans prefer keeping their money at home, affectionately known as “mattress banking,” because the financial institutions, government bureaucrats and politicians let them down. Who can blame them? </p><p>But many miles away, as Zimbabweans were still getting to understand their new normal, <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/the-history-of-bitcoin#:~:text=Bitcoin%20was%20the%20first%20cryptocurrency,identity%20has%20never%20been%20verified.">Satoshi Nakamoto was pioneering Bitcoin</a>. This wouldn't just be a revolutionary way of transacting and storing value, but in the future, could be a way for normal Zimbabweans to avoid the painful memories of 2008 and many more failures of government and fiat currencies. </p><h2>Continued Crises</h2><p>Since 2016, another crisis has been looming on the horizon. </p><p>The RBZ <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/publications/press/press-statement-on-the-introduction-of-bond-notes.pdf">introduced “bond notes” and “coins”</a> to help with change when transacting. Only USD notes were available on the market and coins were hard to come by. Experts warned this was the resurrection of the ZWL, but the RBZ <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/bond-note-introduction-to-ease-cash-shortages/">denied that and defended itself</a> — the current governor, John Mangudya, <a href="https://zimfact.org/has-mangudya-reneged-on-his-bond-note-promise/">even promised to resign if this scheme didn’t work</a>.<br></p><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_bond_notes#:~:text=Zimbabwean%20bond%20notes%20are%20a,equally%20against%20the%20U.S.%20dollar">Despite evidence that it is not working</a>, Mangudya <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-zimbabwe-mangudya-idUKKCN1N64TA">was given another term</a> and the <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1652851/zimbabwe-dollar-is-back-but-economists-are-unsure-it-will-work">ZWL was fully resurrected by June 2019</a>. Zimbabweans once again lost their savings as the government legislated that the ZWL was equal to the USD in their bank accounts. The black market for foreign exchange was resuscitated and people began paying a premium for USD notes outside of the normal financial sector. Zimbabweans had been lied to once again by people who professed to having their best interests at heart. </p><p>But they had learned their lesson and, by early 2018, bitcoin in Zimbabwe was <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/2017/11/28/bitcoin-soars-in-zim-reaches-record-high-of-17-875/">trading at a premium</a>, at one point reaching a price of $17,875 while across the world the price was closer to $10,000. People were looking for ways to store their hard-earned money in value and bitcoin was proving to be a viable solution. </p><p>But in May 2018, <a href="https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/zimbabwe/">bitcoin was effectively banned in the country</a> as all financial institutions were instructed to stop transactions linked to Bitcoin. This nearly totally killed the local Bitcoin community and sent many people to seek unorthodox ways to acquire BTC.</p><p>In June 2022, the RBZ <a href="https://www.africa-press.net/zimbabwe/all-news/reserve-bank-of-zimbabwe-introduces-gold-coins">introduced gold coins as a store of value</a>. By May 2023, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/9/zimbabwes-new-gold-backed-digital-currency-all-you-need-to-know">it was also introducing gold-backed digital currency</a>. This was clearly an indication that the local currency was racing to the bottom again. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ReserveBankZIM/status/1656963536197758976">Over 90% of the tokens and gold were bought using ZWL</a> and <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/press/2023/May/Gold-Backed_Digital_Tokens_Prospectus_-_4_May_2023_1.pdf">they could be vested after a certain period in USD</a>. This seemed like a good way for the elites to store the depreciating currency in gold while the rest of the populace watched the ZWL crash every week. </p><p>Tentatively, it seemed like the gap between the demand and supply of the USD on the market keeps on widening and the apex bank's methods of shouldering the local fiat currency keeps on failing. People don’t trust its methods, and rightfully so. Unfortunately, with governments controlling the fiat money supply, these kinds of problems will persist, small and large. </p><p>As a result, Zimbabwe could be heading toward another dark period. Recently, the price of a loaf of bread <a href="https://twitter.com/daddyhope/status/1667129941698269187?t=5YMW99BXAwSL-NqIvrYgmw&amp;s=19">changed twice in less than a day</a>, from ZWL$10,000 to ZWL$12,200. </p><p>To make things worse, some banks<a href="https://twitter.com/baba_nyenyedzi/status/1667023790725898241?s=1"> have published statements limiting the usage of Nostro accounts</a>, instituting panic across the board and <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2023/06/zim-banks-limiting-nostro-account-usage-deactivating-nostros-for-international-use-for-example/">setting up a possible bank run</a>. Nostro accounts are the Zimbabwean versions of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nostroaccount.asp">foreign currency accounts</a>, which have become needed as the government and private employers have taken to paying employees portions of their salaries in USD, along with the highly-inflationary ZWL. Now, it seems like the government payments are not backed by real cash on hand. </p><h2>A Way To Preserve Value</h2><p>Against the backdrop of all this, Bitcoin is emerging again as a valid way to preserve value. </p><p>Via VPNs, which can be used to access exchanges blocked in the country; no-KYC or KYC-light exchanges all over the world; and peer-to-peer networks through WhatsApp and Telegram, Zimbabweans are finding ways to access Bitcoin. Bitcoin provides security, absolute scarcity, a commitment to accountability via a public ledger and, more than anything else for those in Zimbabwe, a store of value. Bitcoin puts control of an individual’s destiny in their own hands and that’s just perfect for a lot of Zimbabweans, who won’t have to rely on politicians and bureaucrats for their economical survival. More than anything. Bitcoin is independence, freedom and individual sovereignty.</p><p>Bitcoin represents more than sound money in Zimbabwe, and no political government can ever match its standards and safety. And this time, the RBZ won’t be able to stop Bitcoin, as the people have figured out ways to exist in the safety of Bitcoin outside of the regulated financial corridors. Bitcoin is now!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thabo P. Ncube.

The Digital Disclosure Survey conducted by Broadridge Financial Solutions sheds light on the fact that key metrics such as tokenomics and network performance are often overlooked by investors. This finding raises questions about the extent to which investors understand the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin and its underlying technology.</p><p>As the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin serves as both a decentralized network and a digital asset. Network performance, one of the metrics commonly disregarded by investors, is crucial for assessing the health and functionality of the Bitcoin network. But only 28% of participants considered it important, putting it outside of the top five factors. Understanding how the network operates, how resilient it is to change and to disruption and the different projects currently being built on Bitcoin are vital pieces of information for any investor in the market. </p><p>Moreover, the study's findings regarding investors' preference for traditional finance metrics highlight a potential gap in their understanding of Bitcoin as an asset. Tokenomics, the economic aspects of a coin, play a significant role in determining its value and future supply. Despite this, only 16% of respondents indicated that tokenomics was a factor that they considered. By overlooking the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-supply">rock-solid tokenomics</a> that serve as a foundation for bitcoin, investors may miss crucial insights into the potential long-term sustainability and growth prospects of bitcoin.</p><p>The survey's results also have implications for Bitcoin's transparency and trustworthiness as an asset. Rob Krugman, Chief Digital Officer at Broadridge, emphasized the importance of transparency for market survival and growth. Enhancing disclosure practices and providing standardized, easily accessible metrics for tracking bitcoin's performance can foster trust among investors, and help lead to approval for developments like a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">spot Bitcoin ETF.</a> </p><p>Furthermore, the study's revelation that 65% of investors view their crypto holdings as long-term investments aligns with the popular perception of bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin's limited supply and decentralized nature have attracted long-term investors seeking an alternative to traditional fiat currencies and store-of-value assets like gold.</p><p>Overall, the Digital Disclosure Survey underscored the need for investors involved with Bitcoin, to consider a broader range of metrics that specifically apply to cryptocurrencies. By recognizing the significance of network performance, tokenomics and other crypto-specific factors, investors can make more informed decisions regarding the viability and attractiveness of bitcoin both as a network and as an asset.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Austrian Bitcoin Broker Coinfinity Integrates Lightning Network]]></title><description><![CDATA[Coinfinity now offers customers access to the Lightning network, enabling faster and cost-effective transactions in the EU.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/austrian-bitcoin-broker-coinfinity-integrates-lightning-network</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/austrian-bitcoin-broker-coinfinity-integrates-lightning-network</guid><category><![CDATA[Austria]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eu]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 18:57:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQyMTg0NjEw/img_6220.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Coinfinity, an Austrian bitcoin broker, has recently integrated the Lightning Network into its services, allowing customers to make bitcoin purchases with reduced transaction fees and quicker processing times.</p><p>Thomas Burgstaller, Chief Growth Officer at Coinfinity, highlighted the significance of this integration, stating, "Being this early to market is an important innovation step for us at Coinfinity, and Lightning itself is an essential foundation for the global adoption of Bitcoin as a usable monetary system."</p><figure>

According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new offering from <a href="https://luxor.tech/derivatives">Luxor's Derivatives Desk</a> includes six-month duration contracts and daily settlement rates, providing market participants with extended contract periods and swift access to liquidity. The press release stated that the addition of these features enhances hedging efficiency and reduces the cost of capital in the Bitcoin mining derivatives space.</p><p>Matt Williams, Luxor's Head of Derivatives, expressed his enthusiasm for the innovative pricing model, stating, "This innovative pricing model takes Hashprice contracts to the next level." He emphasized that the integration of daily settlement rates makes their offerings more attractive to traditional finance investors, expanding the reach of Luxor's Hashprice Marketplace beyond the mining sector. Williams added, "This development underlines Luxor's vision of transforming hashrate into a viable asset class."</p><p>The press release described how as more participants join the Luxor Derivative Desk, the increased liquidity is expected to improve the cost of capital for miners. This update comes at an opportune time, with miners approaching the 2024 Bitcoin halving, which will result in a 50% reduction in the BTC value of block subsidies. Luxor's six-month Hashprice contracts could assist miners in planning long-term hedging strategies to navigate the impending volatility.</p><p>Luxor CEO and co-founder, Nick Hansen, commended the upgrade, affirming the company's commitment to financial innovation in the Bitcoin mining sector.

But it’s also a piece of software that deliberately takes away the power of insiders — no matter if those insiders are large miners or bitcoin whales. </p><p>What we’ve seen in the larger cryptocurrency space over the past few years has been a perversion of those ideas and principles. The fact that the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) is (finally) waking up to those shenanigans is something that was to be expected. </p><h2>When Profit Trumped Common Sense</h2><p>The pursuit of exponential profits with very little upfront investment of time, brain power or capital has not just helped crypto-token Ponzi schemes take off. It has allowed rent seekers like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/luna-foundation-sold-80000-bitcoin-amid-ust-crash">Luna</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a> and countless “Web3” projects to be perceived as “innovations” instead of just pure cash grabs.</p><p>While it’s a venture capitalist’s (VC’s) job to put bets on what he or she believes will make money and shape the future of technology, the sheer audacity with which the crypto-Ponzi industry’s insiders pushed their agendas in recent years has been unbelievable. We have read the stories of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/coinbase-ex-manager-sentenced-2-years-prison-us-insider-trading-case-2023-05-09/">former Coinbase manager sentenced to two years in prison</a> for front-running its users, and we know that Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the largest VC firms in the space, <a href="https://protos.com/the-crypto-bets-of-a16z-crumble-early-investors-still-profit/">has shilled Ponzi schemes like Helium</a>.</p><p>The marketing approach a16z has had for its projects was <a href="https://protos.com/the-crypto-bets-of-a16z-crumble-early-investors-still-profit/">summed up by Cory Klippsten</a>: </p><p>“Most Bitcoiners that promote Bitcoin are just buying and holding as much as possible — and people who love it the most are the people who never sell. It’s kind of the exact opposite of what you see with the likes of a16z: full-frontal assault, marketing through all their channels, executing massive pumps after they bought a bunch of cheap Solana from the centralized team that controls it in the spring of 2021. They ⏤ and all their VC friends ⏤ were selling the top in late 2021, while claiming to the world that they were HODLing.”</p><h2>‘Crypto’ Was Always A Cash Grab Disguised As Tech Innovation</h2><p>Everyone who learns more about Bitcoin will soon realize that it isn’t perfect. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war">block size debate</a> is, luckily, behind us, but full mempools and new things like the Ordinals protocol show that scalability is still a thing to be fully figured out. I believe that the Lightning Network, as well as similar solutions, offer a viable path toward secure, fast and affordable transactions, but we are not fully there yet.</p><p>Trying to improve the Bitcoin network is a noble cause, and if you feel that it can be done, giving it a try on your own is a legitimate thing to do. But the Bitcoin spinoffs we have seen over the years all failed, in terms of adoption, brand value and price. We know that ICOs in 2017 were largely cash grabs among retail investors, with little to no real innovation or market proof up until now. Hollow buzzwords like “blockchain” soon vanished, just to be replaced by an even vaguer concept of “Web3” in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic. </p><h2>Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes</h2><p>Today, there are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/863917/number-crypto-coins-tokens/">thousands of crypto tokens out there</a>, with a vast number of them created from the beginning as blatant Ponzi schemes without any long-term vision other than to benefit a small group of insiders. Honestly, I would have preferred to let the market decide their fate, and not regulators. But the reality is that the U.S. is now cracking down on them after the SEC failed miserably when it came to stopping people like former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><p>SEC boss Gary Gensler recently made clear that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/28/bitcoin-is-the-only-coin-the-sec-chair-will-call-a-commodity">bitcoin is a commodity</a> and, therefore, doesn’t fall in the domain of his agency. And now, in the SEC’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/05/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lawsuit against Binance</a>, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Gensler appears to be preparing to crack down on the crypto Ponzis, as it includes severe accusations against the company itself and also states that a range of crypto projects should be defined as securities. Those include big names, like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC).</p><p>I don’t want to cheer for the SEC or any other regulator, because we all know that in the U.S., we barely managed to dodge a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">30% energy tax on Bitcoin mining</a>. And the powerful people who don’t want Bitcoin to win will find other angles through which to attack it. But at the same time, Bitcoiners had warned about FTX, Terra Luna and other shady crypto projects from day one. I’m sorry for every person who burned their fingers and lost money by trusting those criminals, but it’s also understandable that Bitcoiners are rightfully celebrating this “told you so” moment.</p><h2>The Crypto-Securities Discussion Is Also Coming To Europe</h2><p>Love it or hate it, the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-market-in-crypto-assets-6751039">Market In Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> is the first comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in a major economic zone. Unless you think the free market should take care of scams and bad actors (which would be a fair point), you probably see MiCA as a step in the right direction. At least it’s a different approach than the “burn it all down” vibes we are getting from the Democratic Party, the SEC and other actors in the U.S. </p><p>But MiCA is the starting point rather than the end when it comes to trying to tame the “crypto Wild West” in Europe. A few days after signing MiCA into law in May 2023, a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/IPOL_STU(2023)740083">study published by non-other than the European Parliament</a> came to the conclusion that MiCA needs to take further steps to really work. In fact, the study came to a similar conclusion as what we already see unfolding in the U.S.: It advises that lawmakers should take a closer look at things like DeFi, staking and NFTs. And, most importantly: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/01/treat-crypto-as-securities-by-default-european-parliament-study-says/">All crypto assets should be treated as securities by default</a>.</p><p>I think that, no matter what will happen in terms of regulation, it’s important to remember what makes Bitcoin unique and why we are here in the first place: It’s an asset you can really own, living on a network no one can shut down or control. This is it. As Adam Back recently said, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-antifragile-regulatory-pressures-blockstream-120120211.html">Bitcoin is “antifragile” to regulatory pressures</a>. And we can already see that this is the key difference between random crypto projects and Bitcoin.</p><h2>Bitcoin Only And Non Custodial Are The Way Forward</h2><p>Again: I’m not cheering for more regulation. I believe in the free market, and I think that with or without laws, bad actors will be flushed out eventually. On the other hand, I feel for everyone who gets scammed and loses money in shameless crypto scams. So, I also understand why some guardrails are needed, especially when bad faith actors are disguising themselves as “tech innovators.”</p><p>Companies that focus on Bitcoin and offer real, non-custodial BTC will thrive. Players who offer countless, shady Ponzi tokens to their (newbie) users will not only face regulatory scrutiny, but also lose the trust of their customers when tokens that were once promoted as “the next big things” start heading to zero amid harsher regulation.</p><p>Now, more than a decade after Satoshi Nakamoto invented true digital scarcity, the Bitcoin network stands stronger than ever as the one true cryptocurrency. An asset that can’t be diluted, can’t be easily changed and that doesn’t have a small group of founding insiders who dictate the rules. I don’t know what the future holds for Bitcoin, but I know that a lot of the things that Bitcoiners like me have been repeating about “crypto” and why Bitcoin is different rings true today more than ever.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Julian Liniger.

Bitcoin is among the greatest wonders of the late-modern world, so Greg Foss is understandably very passionate about it. So passionate in fact, that he dropped <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTea_/status/1660822173257199617?s=20">11 f-bombs in 31 seconds</a> out of concern for its future (and this despite the fact that he’s Canadian!). </p><p>Why is such a stalwart Bitcoin proponent so concerned? Because <a href="https://twitter.com/TaprootWizards/status/1660434627125817347?s=20">two guys in cheap wizard costumes</a> did a cringey Fortnite dance? Surely the stakes must be higher.</p><p>According to some, there is a battle underway for the future and soul of Bitcoin. According to others, we’ve just gained a fun, nerdy and innocuous way to play with Bitcoin that makes it even funner and nerdier, though no less revolutionary. </p><p>Ordinals, inscriptions and the BRC-20 protocol are the bone(s) of contention. Ordinals <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-ordinals-an-overview-of-bitcoin-nfts">allow individual sats to be identified</a>; inscriptions <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/guides/inscriptions.html">allow objects like text, images and data files to be written onto them</a>; and BRC-20 <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/brc-20-explained-how-tokens-on-bitcoin-work-and-why-they-are-controversial/">allows second-order tokens to be minted directly onto them</a>, like an Ethereum-lite. In effect, they introduce storage as a new use case for the Bitcoin blockchain in addition to its existing and principal use as a ledger for currency transactions. These features are affecting <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">block sizes, transaction fees and validation times</a>, so they’re not inconsequential. </p><p>The bone of contention is what they mean for Bitcoin’s future. Are they pathological, like a tumor? Do they offer a competitive advantage, like chlorophyll and claws? Or are they just harmless and benign, like male nipples or that little dangly thing at the top of your throat?</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Ordinal <s>ABCs</s> One, Two, Threes</h2><p>Of the recent developments in Bitcoin listed above, Ordinals came first. Casey Rodarmor, the guy who “invented” Ordinals (this time around), <a href="https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki#user-content-Motivation">sought to devise</a> “stable identifiers that may be used by Bitcoin applications.” In other words, he wanted to index sats by giving each one a serial number that would survive across time and UTXOs.</p><p>Of course, giving each sat a unique identifier means that they are no longer <em>perfectly </em>fungible because they are no longer strictly identical, when applying the Ordinal convention. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification">the Library Of Congress Classification (LCC) system</a> for books in research libraries or URLs for web pages, Ordinals make each sat unique and retrievable. Identifiability affects fungibility without eliminating it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Inscriptions are the second controversial, recent development in the world of Bitcoin. <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html">The “Ordinal Theory Handbook”</a> gives a marvelously succinct definition of inscriptions, helpfully relating them to Ordinals:</p><blockquote><p>“Inscriptions inscribe sats with arbitrary content, creating bitcoin-native digital artifacts, more commonly known as NFTs… These inscribed sats can then be transferred using bitcoin transactions, sent to bitcoin addresses, and held in bitcoin UTXOs. These transactions, addresses, and UTXOs are normal bitcoin transactions, addresses, and UTXOS in all respects, with the exception that in order to send individual sats, transactions must control the order and value of inputs and outputs according to ordinal theory.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, Bitcoiners are far too sophisticated to get suckered into all that <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/seth-greene-recovers-lost-nft-1234733180/">Bored Ape nonsense</a>. If we were to copyright cartoons on our blockchain, we’d do <a href="https://www.taprootwizards.com/collection">wizards</a> instead of apes. I mean, apes? C’mon.</p><p>Whatever. Think of inscriptions like blockchain tattoos. Some people are going to love them, others are going to disdain them. The world (and the witness data of a transaction) is big enough for both. </p><p>The third recent development in Bitcoin is <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata/status/1633658974686855168?s=20">the BRC-20 protocol</a>, which lets people <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/644951761f54331a2616ba16/">mint and distribute tokens</a> according to predefined parameters. These tokens are written as inscriptions onto sats marked with Ordinals, which brings us full circle. These three features allow users to create digital artifacts/NFTs and to use the Bitcoin blockchain to distribute and trade them.</p><p>So, how’s it going? Not surprisingly, some people are attracted to particular numbers, like one, seven or 69,420, so some sats are coveted because Ordinals have made them “<a href="https://medium.com/@johnnytdong/what-are-rare-sats-5fc9c8ac890e">rare</a>” (although, if you think about it, each Ordinal number is unique, so each one is exactly as rare as the others). </p><p>There is also a market for BRC-20 tokens, many of which are just second-order bitcoin. For example, the <a href="https://www.brc-20.io/">$OG$ token</a> and the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/piza-brc-20/">$PIZA token</a> both have a supply of 21 million (just like bitcoin) and, at one point, had market caps of around $10 million.</p><p>The upshot is that:</p><ol><li>Sats are now uniquely identifiable according to a new convention</li><li>People can add data to sats</li><li>Token-minting algorithms are a kind of inscription data, so people can mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain</li></ol><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s important to note that, while Ordinals, inscriptions and BRC-20 are recent developments in how Bitcoin works and how we use it, they’re not really “innovations” because they’re not really new. Something like Ordinals was proposed under the name BitDNS <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.0"><em>back in 2010</em></a>. Using OP_RETURN to store strings of data on UTXOs <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals/">goes back nearly a decade</a>. And minting second-order “tokens” on an underlying blockchain is basically the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/">idea behind Ethereum</a>, which isn’t really new.

Though some love them, as the transaction fees of recent months attest, others are bemused or annoyed. Even the guy who invented BRC-20 <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata/status/1633828036943704068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1633828036943704068%7Ctwgr%5E34a7857f0440af46b74f5d075c2ae2cd0124be7b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fordinals-good-or-bad-for-bitcoin-supporters-and-opposers-raise-voice">has said</a>, “These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.” </p><p>OK, but “worthless” isn’t a synonym for “evil.” Some people think tattoos and Big Macs are worthless, other people love them. So, what’s the big deal?</p><p>Opposition to Bitcoin’s new features usually stems from the suppositions that: </p><ol><li>Ordinals and inscriptions make bitcoin less like money </li><li>They make transactions more expensive</li></ol><p>Let’s deal with the last point first. Thanks in part to Ordinals, the number of transactions in the mempool has increased by about <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mempool-size">two orders of magnitude</a>, and the data in the backlog has increased about 150 times. </p><p>The effects are ambivalent. On the one hand, more data per transaction increases the storage and computing burdens for node operators, for which they receive no compensation. Not great. </p><p>On the other hand, more data to compute means higher fees for miners. In fact, the average on-chain transaction fee reached <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">$30.91</a> recently. High <em>on-chain </em>transaction fees are not evil. In fact, high fees are a good thing. They incentivize miners, which attracts miners and spurs them to invest, which keeps <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/">the hash rate</a> high and makes Bitcoin more secure. That’s about as evil as a St. Bernard carrying a cask of brandy.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Moreover, high on-chain fees merely reinforce the different use cases between on-chain bitcoin and sats on the Lightning Network. On-chain payments have arguably never been well suited for quick microtransactions because they treat small and large transactions pretty much the same. By contrast, Lightning fees are proportional to the transaction amount. If you’re paying two-, or three- or 10 times the price of your beer or pizza in transaction fees for an on-chain payment when you could be paying one one-thousandth of it on Lightning, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p>If on-chain fees are inhibiting you from paying with bitcoin, then you should probably take advantage of Lightning’s proportional fees. If Lightning fees are inhibiting you from paying with bitcoin, then you should probably take advantage of the one-size-fits-all, on-chain fees.</p><h2>What This Means For Bitcoin: Money-ness</h2><p>As for whether bitcoin is still money in a world of ordinals, there are a couple of ways to answer that question. First, we could comb through various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">definitions</a> of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-money/">what</a> <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/24-1-what-is-money/">money</a> is, come up with the ultimate list of criteria and use it to evaluate the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">all subsequent protocols</a>. Aristotle would be proud, but the answer would be unnecessarily theoretical and abstract. </p><p>Alternatively, we could actually observe what people are doing out there in the world. However sensible this new use case is, people like inscriptions and are willing to pay for them. </p><ul><li>Whom are they paying? Miners. </li><li>How are they paying? Transaction fees.</li><li>What are miners doing with the transaction fees? Reinvesting some to cover the costs of mining more bitcoin.</li><li>Where does that bitcoin go? From the miners out into the world, where it circulates.</li></ul><p>And there we have it: payment and circulation. People pay miners, miners pay people, they’re using bitcoin, ergo bitcoin is money. We’ve found the essence of currency without a dictionary (sorry Aristotle).</p><p>In other words, bitcoin is still money, but the Bitcoin blockchain can <em>also</em> be used for storage. Note the Boolean operator: (money <em>and</em> storage) <em>not</em> (money <em>or</em> storage). Indeed, adding new, sensible use cases might be a prerequisite for any currency from this point forward. The question is merely, what counts as “sensible”? But time — and the market — will tell.</p><h2>Good, Bad Or Benign?</h2><p>So, let us return to the original question: Are Ordinals, inscriptions and BRC-20 good or bad for Bitcoin? Or are they just a new feature of the world that we’ll adapt to without much consequence? </p><p>Well, these functions weren’t at the top of my personal list of priorities. I can’t say that <a href="https://www.taprootwizards.com/">Taproot Wizards</a> or “Ordinal tokens” are really making the world a better place. </p><p>But I don’t fear these developments either. They raise fees, and higher fees have beneficial side effects for the blockchain. What’s good for Bitcoin is good for the world, whether it’s intentional or not.</p><p>And they reinforce the case for Lightning as a low-fee means to use bitcoin as money for smallish, everyday purchases and transfers. Generally, what’s good for Lightning is good for Bitcoin, which is good for the world. Wizards GIFs and subsidiary tokens can’t really do much harm, so I’m just gonna stay cool, stack sats and continue making Lightning as good as it can be.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Roy Sheinfeld.

It can be viewed as a catalyst for personal growth and spiritual transformation, offering individuals a unique path toward self discovery and enlightenment.</p><p>In this essay, I will explore how Bitcoin can serve as a tool for this type of self transformation and become a catalyst for a profound journey of spiritual growth.</p><h2>Embracing Financial Sovereignty</h2><p>Bitcoin's core principle lies in decentralization and the elimination of intermediaries, offering individuals full control over their financial assets.</p><p>By embracing Bitcoin, we embark on a journey of financial sovereignty, freeing ourselves from the restrictions imposed by traditional financial systems. This newfound autonomy allows us to transcend limiting beliefs and societal expectations regarding money, enabling us to reevaluate our relationship with wealth and abundance.</p><p>As we develop a sense of self reliance and take responsibility for our financial well-being, we open the doors to self empowerment and spiritual growth.</p><p>Furthermore, financial sovereignty through Bitcoin encourages us to question the existing economic paradigm, in which financial institutions and governments exert significant control over our monetary transactions. As we challenge this centralized authority, we develop a deeper understanding of the importance of individual freedom and the potential for positive change through decentralized systems.</p><p>This realization extends beyond financial matters, encouraging us to question other aspects of our lives that may be governed by external authorities, fostering a sense of empowerment and self determination.</p><h2>Fostering Trust And Collaboration</h2><p>Bitcoin's underlying technology, its blockchain, relies on a network of participants who collectively validate and verify transactions. This decentralized approach fosters trust and collaboration, as each participant contributes to the overall security and integrity of the network.</p><p>Through engagement with the Bitcoin community, we develop a sense of interconnectedness, recognizing the importance of collaboration, transparency and consensus.</p><p>This realization extends beyond the realm of finance, teaching us valuable lessons about trust, cooperation and the power of collective action in our personal lives and relationships.</p><p>The Bitcoin community, consisting of developers, miners, investors and enthusiasts, demonstrates the power of collaboration and shared goals. It encourages individuals to work together towards common objectives, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. By actively participating in this community, we learn to embrace diversity, respect differing opinions and harness the power of collective intelligence.</p><p>These values extend beyond Bitcoin and can shape our interactions with others, helping us build stronger relationships and fostering a sense of harmony within our social circles.</p><h2>Cultivating Patience And Emotional Resilience</h2><p>Bitcoin's volatile nature tests our emotional resilience and challenges our capacity for patience.</p><p>The market's ups and downs teach us invaluable lessons in perseverance, discipline and emotional control. Investing in bitcoin necessitates a long-term perspective and the ability to weather temporary setbacks without succumbing to fear or panic.</p><p>By cultivating these qualities, we foster a deeper sense of equanimity, learning to detach ourselves from outcomes and embracing the journey rather than fixating solely on the destination. This shift in mindset lays a strong foundation for spiritual growth, as we develop the ability to navigate life's uncertainties with grace and composure.</p><p>And the lessons learned from bitcoin's volatility extend beyond financial markets.</p><p>They teach us to approach life's challenges with a calm and composed demeanor, recognizing that setbacks are temporary and part of a larger journey. Cultivating patience allows us to embrace the process of personal growth and transformation, understanding that true change takes time.</p><p>By embracing this patient mindset, we become more attuned to the present moment, finding joy and contentment in the journey itself rather than fixating solely on the end goal. This mindfulness fosters a deeper sense of self awareness and spiritual connection, enhancing our overall well-being</p><h2>Exploring New Paradigms Of Value</h2><p>Bitcoin challenges our conventional notions of value and offers an opportunity to explore alternative systems of wealth.</p><p>Its limited supply and decentralized nature detach it from the control of central authorities, prompting us to question the established notions of money and the pursuit of material possessions.</p><p>As we delve into the world of Bitcoin, we encounter a diverse community of individuals who value knowledge, innovation and personal growth over superficial indicators of success.</p><p>This exposure broadens our horizons, encouraging us to redefine our own measures of value and prioritize the pursuit of experiences, relationships and personal development.</p><p>Bitcoin's emergence as a store of value introduces us to the concept of "digital scarcity," which highlights the importance of intellectual and technological advancements. This shift in perspective prompts us to reevaluate our own talents, skills and knowledge, recognizing that they hold intrinsic value beyond material possessions.</p><p>By prioritizing personal growth and the pursuit of meaningful experiences, we align ourselves with a more holistic and fulfilling understanding of wealth.</p><p>This new paradigm allows us to embrace a purpose-driven life, in which our actions and contributions to society hold greater significance than mere accumulation of wealth.</p><h2>Practicing Mindfulness And Gratitude</h2><p>Engaging with Bitcoin provides an invitation to cultivate mindfulness and gratitude in our lives.</p><p>As we witness the transformative power of this technology, we become more aware of the present moment and the opportunities it holds. By practicing gratitude for the innovations and possibilities Bitcoin presents, we shift our focus from scarcity to abundance, attracting more positive experiences into our lives.</p><p>This newfound mindfulness expands our consciousness and deepens our spiritual connection, as we learn to appreciate the interconnectedness of all things and the limitless potential of the universe. Bitcoin's disruptive nature encourages us to challenge the status quo and approach life with a sense of curiosity and wonder. It prompts us to question the existing financial systems, societal structures and our own belief systems.</p><p>By cultivating a mindful and grateful attitude, we remain open to new possibilities, embrace change and foster a sense of awe for the transformative potential that lies within us and the world around us.</p><p>This mindset allows us to tap into our inner wisdom, explore our true purpose and cultivate a deeper sense of spiritual growth.</p><h2>A Catalyst For Individual Evolution</h2><p>Bitcoin's impact extends far beyond the realm of finance. By embracing this digital currency, we embark on a transformative journey of self discovery, personal growth and spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>Through the cultivation of financial sovereignty, trust, emotional resilience and alternative paradigms of value, Bitcoin serves as a catalyst for our individual evolution.</p><p>As we practice mindfulness and gratitude, we become more attuned to the interconnectedness of the world and the vast opportunities for growth and expansion.</p><p>Bitcoin, when approached with an open mind and a willingness to learn, can be a powerful tool for self transformation, guiding us towards a life of greater authenticity, abundance and spiritual fulfillment.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Heliand.

These tools leverage the Lightning Network and bitcoin to seamlessly integrate with LLMs. They are built on the L402 protocol, a Lightning native authentication mechanism and Langchain, a library that simplifies working with AI agents by incorporating external data for advanced functionality.</p><p>One of the tools included in the release is LangChainBitcoin, which enables Langchain agents to interact directly with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. It includes features such as LLM Agent Bitcoin Tools, which utilize OpenAI GPT function calls to enable developers to create agents capable of holding a bitcoin balance, sending/receiving bitcoin on Lightning and driving with a LND node. Another tool, the L402 HTTP API Traversal, is a Python wrapper for a LangChain LLM chain (APIChain) that allows agents to access L402 payment-metered APIs seamlessly.</p><p>Aperture, a drop-in reverse proxy server, is also part of the release. It implements the L402 protocol and transforms any API into a pay-per-use resource gated via L402 functionality on the Lightning Network. The latest version of Aperture now supports Lightning Node Connect protocol, enabling compatibility with various Lightning Nodes, such as Voltage, Umbrel, Start9, Raspiblitz and BTCPayServer.</p><p>The L402 protocol, introduced in 2020, is a standard for payment-metered APIs designed to utilize the existing HTTP 402 Payment Required status response code. It combines bitcoin and the Lightning Network to enable global micropayments for paid APIs. The protocol allows for authenticating and charging per use of internet-native services, addressing challenges faced by the AI developer community, such as the high cost of GPU training and limited accessibility to advanced LLM models.</p><p>By providing these developer tools, the creators aim to build more accessible AI infrastructure for both humans and AI agents. They are particularly excited about the AI4ALL hackathon, taking place this month, where developers can leverage these tools to unleash their creativity and innovation. The Lightning and AI communities are encouraged to explore the potential of these new tools and contribute to the development of the machine-payable web powered by Lightning.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin As The World’s First Over-Unity Power Generator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a sense, Bitcoin achieves over-unity power generation by storing energy and creating additional value over time.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/converting-energy-to-stored-value-bitcoin-is-over-unity</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/converting-energy-to-stored-value-bitcoin-is-over-unity</guid><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kevin Melody]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMzg0NjM5NzQwOTQ2MDc3/20220916_better-five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique-energy-consumers---jaran-mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Kevin Melody, a node runner and real estate professional.</em></p><p>An “over-unity” power generator (similar to the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion">perpetual-motion machine</a>) is a hypothetical device that produces more energy than is required to run it. Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics">According to this law</a>, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant. This principle is derived from empirical observations and has been validated through numerous experiments and theoretical frameworks. </p><p>In practical terms, this means that energy can neither be created "out of nothing" nor spontaneously disappear. It exists in various forms, such as mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and nuclear energy. These forms can be converted into one another, but the total amount of energy remains constant throughout the process. </p><p>However, it's important to note that the law of conservation of energy applies to closed or isolated systems where no external energy sources or sinks are involved. In open systems, such as those interacting with their surroundings, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/cellular-energy/a/the-laws-of-thermodynamics#:~:text=An%20open%20system%20can%20exchange,with%20its%20surroundings%2C%20not%20matter.">energy can be exchanged with the environment</a>, leading to changes in the system's total energy. </p><p>For proponents, the trick behind the concept of an over-unity power generator is that it does not, in reality, break the law of conservation of energy. On the surface, it appears to be a closed system (i.e., one that powers itself and keeps itself running as well as producing excess energy). But many of whom believe such an invention is possible do not claim that the device creates energy out of nothing. They claim that, once the device is started, it is able to draw energy from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">unproven source</a> and then use that energy to run itself forever as well as provide excess energy to be applied to some other useful purpose. </p><p>There have been many devices created that claim to be able to tap this “free energy” source, but to date, none of these devices has been empirically proven to work. However, there is a persistent notion that many of them do indeed work and that they are deliberately suppressed and withheld from the public. </p><h2>Are Over-Unity Devices Real?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_suppression_conspiracy_theory">Conspiracy theories surrounding the suppression of over-unity devices</a> suggest that powerful entities, such as governments, corporations and energy conglomerates, actively prevent the development and dissemination of such technologies due to economic interests, desire to retain power and control, national security concerns, patent and legal issues and other related reasons. </p><p>If the conspiracy theories are true, then these technologies are able to be suppressed because they rely upon third parties for protection. For example, inventors typically file for patents, presuming that patent law enforced by governments will enable them to monetize their inventions without fear of theft or exploitation by bad actors. </p><p>However, governments are made up of people, and people are subject to bribery, extortion, coercion and their own personal biases, as well as many other influences. The common denominator is trust. If you have to trust a third party, you are subject to the honesty, integrity, ability and resources of that party.</p><h2>Enter Bitcoin, A Unique Energy User </h2><p>Enter Bitcoin: the first technological discovery in human history specifically designed to resist and disincentivize violence.</p><p>The Bitcoin network has survived primarily because the only way to attack it is to turn it against itself. But the Bitcoin network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)">antifragile</a>: the harder it is attacked, the stronger it becomes and that includes attacks against itself! The only practical way to defeat it is via a 51% attack and, to date, there has never been a successful one carried out against the Bitcoin network. In fact, such an attack is so difficult and expensive that prospective attackers would benefit more by devoting the same resources to mining and spending bitcoin honestly. </p><p>As a result of this antifragility, the Bitcoin network has proven to be an extremely reliable way to convert energy to stored value. In a sense, Bitcoin is the equivalent of a battery that allows its users to retrieve nearly all of the energy provided to create/acquire it at any time in the future. In addition, due to its fixed supply of units, each unit will also capture <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2015/deflationary-technology-disruption-impact-money/">the deflationary effect of advancing technology</a>. The net result is that, in a way, users are able to take advantage of more energy in the future than what was required to create/acquire each unit at any given moment in time. </p><p>Therefore, the Bitcoin network effectively operates like an over-unity power generator by using the energy it receives from outside sources to run and protect itself as well as capturing additional outside energy over time. </p><p>Contrast this with the fiat system, which does claim to be able to break the law of conservation of energy by creating value out of thin air. But note that even the “strongest” fiat systems all require inflation to work for any period. Inflation is a euphemism for theft and all the users in such a system are participating in theft to one degree or another. The main benefactors are <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect">those in charge of creating and distributing the monetary units</a>, but everyone who uses the system is counting on receiving some value from the productive efforts of others without having to contribute to those productive efforts themselves. For their own excess production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">rational people will seek a means of saving rather than spending</a>. </p><p>Thus, <em>all</em> fiat systems eventually fail because they require energy stolen by means of fraud and coercion from actual producers and actual producers save as much of their productive efforts in more efficient systems (e.g., real estate and equities). Since no new energy is created by the system, and far less energy is put in than is taken out, the system eventually fails due to lack of energy. </p><p>This is how the Bitcoin network ultimately wins: People who produce value will see it as a better means of escaping the parasitical fiat system, thereby depriving it of energy and effectively starving it to death.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kevin Melody.

The move from the $10 trillion asset manager stoked plenty of excitement and concerns alike from bitcoin proponents, with many championing the potential for massive inflows from legacy institutional investors, while others pushed back, citing the risks that such a product structure could pose to the bitcoin market. The introduction of such a product could bolster bitcoin’s profile among traditional investors, but it’s vital to understand the potential implications.</p><p>This article delves into the BlackRock proposal, comparing it with existing bitcoin investment vehicles, assessing the potential risks and benefits and drawing parallels with the introduction of liquid investment vehicles into the gold market, which many analogize as bitcoin’s monetary predecessor. The goal is to evaluate the implications of such a product on the broader bitcoin market and institutional adoption, while keeping in mind the principles that underpin the potential of bitcoin to serve as a global neutral reserve asset and settlement layer. </p><h4>BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust Proposal: An In-Depth Examination</h4><p>BlackRock's submission of an S-1 with the SEC marks a significant development in the bitcoin investment landscape. Although not an ETF in name, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust application bears striking resemblance to an ETF in function by allowing for daily subscriptions and redemptions, distinguishing it from existing bitcoin investment vehicles like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>In contrast to the current leading bitcoin investment product, Grayscale’s GBTC, BlackRock's trust proposes an in-kind redemption feature. This means investors aren’t tied to selling their shares and creating a taxable event; instead, they can opt for withdrawing bitcoin from the trust. This circumvents the tax implications that Grayscale investors face when selling their shares for fiat and then purchasing bitcoin.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the proposed in-kind redemptions come with a big caveat: Only BlackRock’s authorized participants, essentially investment firms in good standing with BlackRock, can withdraw bitcoin from the product. This implies that the benefit of in-kind redemptions is essentially restricted to large-scale investors and institutions. </p><p>The trust is slated to adopt the <a href="https://www.onrampbitcoin.com/newsletter/blackrock-creates-bitcoin-vehicle-half-good-half-terrible">grantor trust model</a>, aligning its structure closer to the likes of gold investment trusts. This implies that owning shares of BlackRock’s trust would, for tax purposes, equate to owning the underlying asset, e.g., bitcoin.</p><p>Questions start to arise regarding potential risks with BlackRock's proposed trust structure, particularly with the possibility of rehypothecation. A common practice among traditional asset ETFs, rehypothecation involves lending out assets to market participants. If extended to the Bitcoin Trust, it could lead to a situation where investors only have a claim to bitcoin that has been lent out, a situation that could lead to investors owning paper claims to bitcoin rather than the asset itself.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposal gives BlackRock considerable latitude in case of a Bitcoin fork, allowing them to determine which Bitcoin version to back. This opens up the possibility for potential manipulation and could present risks to investors who may not align with BlackRock’s decisions.</p><h3>The Current Landscape Of Bitcoin Investment Products</h3><p>Delving into the current landscape of bitcoin investment products, let’s focus on two leading vehicles: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>First, there’s the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has long served as a primary avenue for legacy financial institutions to gain liquid exposure to bitcoin. Operating as a closed-end fund trading over the counter, GBTC saw billions of dollars flow into it over the years. The product carries a hefty 2% annual fee as a percent of net asset value and does not offer redemption back into bitcoin, thus creating a one-way street for supply. This structure was once very appealing to investors looking to exploit a seemingly automatic arbitrage trade, especially when the premium for GBTC shares reached as high as 40%, leading to a reflexive dynamic between inflows into the trust and demand for spot bitcoin.</p><p>However, this feedback loop reversed as demand for GBTC shares wavered when institutions began to attempt to unwind the arbitrage trades they had put on — meaning selling GBTC to realize the gain — which caused the premium to turn into a discount, with shares trading less than the net asset value of the bitcoin within the trust. The dislocation of GBTC from its net asset value alongside its inferior liquidity profile relative to spot bitcoin itself resulted in a market that liquidated all overleveraged participants who were using GBTC as collateral. </p><p>GBTC’s relatively high 2% annual fee has also come under scrutiny, especially as cheaper investment vehicles have emerged. As a result, GBTC shares came under immense pressure during the later months of 2021 and throughout 2022, with the discount to net asset value plummeting to almost negative 50%. </p><p>Besides GBTC, there is also BITO, which marked a significant milestone in the history of bitcoin investment products. As the first bitcoin-linked ETF available on a U.S. exchange, BITO opened the doors for investors to gain simple, indirect access to bitcoin exposure through a securitized ETF that has exposure to bitcoin futures contracts. However, as a futures ETF, BITO doesn't hold bitcoin directly. Due to the nature of futures contracts, the fund exposes investors to rollover risk, particularly when the futures curve is in contango — meaning futures prices are higher than current spot market prices — which causes their holdings to decay relative to the price of bitcoin over long periods of time. </p><p>Displayed below is the relative returns of GBTC and BITO shares against bitcoin since the launch of BITO, and since the start of 2020.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>A Closer Look At BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust: Potential Implications &amp; Risks</h3><p>Given the intricate design of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, its implications and potential risks raise serious concerns. There is an excellent post written by Allen Farrington, aptly named <a href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/trust-me-bro-fb5a25964634">Trust Me, Bro</a>, which details some of the fine print and seemingly opaque risk models that an otherwise “bullish” ETF application from BlackRock contains. Below is a summary of some of his points in this section, but Farrington’s piece is well worth a read.</p><p>From a broader perspective, BlackRock’s trust could amass a considerable amount of Bitcoin, which isn’t necessarily a problem in and of itself, but bitcoin investors should pay close attention and remain vigilant of the possible second-order effects. BlackRock could in theory “sell bitcoin” to many financial institutions in the form of its iShares ETF, which is subject to rehypothecation and opaque ownership, unlike bitcoin UTXOs which exist on a transparent and immutable ledger. </p><p>Second, in terms of monopolistic pricing, it is likely that the existence of an ETF will place significant pressure on bitcoin exchanges, where the trading costs of an ETF are a mere few basis points compared to the rates of 50 bps to 100 bps charged by many exchanges for spot purchases. This could lead to consolidation of liquidity and put price-setting into the hands of BlackRock (or another entity with the dominant ETF).</p><p>In addition to accumulating a significant share of the circulating bitcoin and having a heavy hand in setting the price, BlackRock could create a narrative around any specific bitcoin that has yet to enter or has left the perceived safety net of the trust. This may look like spreading stories of dirty coins that could have been used by criminals, terrorists, drug dealers, etc., and would have a negative impact on fungibility of the asset because it would essentially create two tiers of bitcoin.</p><p>If BlackRock paints the picture of clean bitcoin within their trust versus the dirty bitcoin outside of it, they can then turn to banks to encourage opting into the trust’s version of Bitcoin since it will be viewed as “safe” from a regulatory perspective, further consolidating the ownership of bitcoin and allowing banks to offer their clients access to “bitcoin” which will actually be paper claims to the underlying asset as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Also within the trust filing is a section that provides BlackRock an option to choose the “appropriate network” should there be a time when Bitcoin faces an adversarial change in consensus and undergoes a hard fork. The filing specifies that BlackRock’s choice may not necessarily be in line with the most valuable fork. While this is likely a simple form of due diligence, by amassing a significantly large share of bitcoin that has the backing of equally large banking institutions and is held by a large portion of retail investors looking for simple exposure to bitcoin, it’s possible that BlackRock could instigate a hard fork or side with a consensus proposal that changes the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin which make it unique and valuable in the first place.</p><p>As mentioned above, there are also redemption concerns with the way this trust is structured. Only authorized participants, meaning investment firms, can withdraw bitcoin from the trust. Average, everyday investors will not be the ones able to redeem bitcoin from the trust in the first place, and since the authorized participants have to be in good standing with the firm, it’s possible that BlackRock could refuse redemptions — even to institutional investors.</p><p>All those concerns notwithstanding, there are historical examples of the creation of ETFs, namely gold, and their impact on the market.</p><h3>The Impact of Exchange-Traded Products: The GLD Analogy</h3><p>There’s many comparisons and contrasts between gold and bitcoin as investment vehicles. This article doesn’t dig into those but rather highlights the analogy and market impacts of a gold ETF in the past. By far, the biggest question of a bitcoin BlackRock ETF is: What does it mean for the price, market cap, liquidity, adoption, demand, etc.? This is not a new bitcoin-centric startup launching an investment vehicle, but rather the largest financial institution in the world that carries weight for market adoption in the age of passive investment vehicles.</p><p>For comparison, let’s look at the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold ETF by assets under management (AUM) that started in 2004. It’s still one of the largest ETFs in the market today with $58 billion AUM. In November 2004, the <a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/historical-data/">ETF had over $1 billion in total asset value</a> in the first few days and then hit $50 billion by 2010.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Compared to many of the top ETFs in the market, GLD has been one of the best performing ETFs since its inception, only behind QQQ and Vanguard’s Growth ETF. This only accounts for looking at ETF performance since GLD’s start date as opposed to comparing similar start dates of other ETFs.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5MTcyNjkzODE4NDE5MDg3/etf-performance.png" height="287" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>GLD is just one of a few large gold ETFs on the market. Total gold ETF products are estimated to have $220 billion in AUM as of last month. In 2022, gold in tonnes held by ETFs accounted for 1.66% of estimated above ground gold supply. A much larger share of gold supply, around 15%, resides in central bank reserves heavily dominated by the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Russia, China and Switzerland. </p><p>Obviously, it’s not easy to separate the impact of a widely adopted gold ETF on gold’s price over the last two decades, but it’s clear that the ETFs, even accounting for only a small amount of gold supply, have had a significant impact on the market. The GLD ETF was a major shift in how investors could purchase gold and essentially opened up gold buying to the masses while increasing gold market volumes and overall liquidity. In a limited way, there’s already been some of that impact via the GBTC trust with all its limitations. Compared to bitcoin today, GBTC’s 3.2% of circulating supply was a primary driver of bull market mania despite locking up only a small share of bitcoin supply. </p><p>Coupled with new narratives and a bit of gold mania into 2011, the GLD ETF was a key spark for a 350% rise over 6 years. Bitcoin is on a path to go through a similar shift where a more comprehensive ETF with more regulatory clarity will offer it to the masses, both institutional money and 401K or IRA style accounts. It’s not the self-custody bitcoin this publication advocates for, but it is a significant development in the market that many will likely opt for as it’s a market need for those wanting financial exposure to bitcoin on a larger scale, without the responsibility of holding their own keys.</p><p>But what about price suppression schemes, similar to the ones that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325">big banks have historically used to tamper the price of gold</a>? Bitcoin’s design characteristics largely shield it from the type of price manipulation that traditional assets like gold have historically experienced. Unlike gold, whose physical nature makes it hard to verify, assay, secure and transport — leading to dependency on futures contracts that can be manipulated — bitcoin exists on a transparent and immutable ledger. </p><p>Furthermore, Bitcoin's digital nature and decentralized structure enable virtually cost-free and near instant settlement of transactions, which allows for manipulation and price dislocations in the futures market to be settled with ease compared to gold, which is much more costly to store and transport. Hence, the type of price suppression seen in the gold market is fundamentally challenging to replicate in the bitcoin market.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Future Of Bitcoin ETFs And The Path Forward</h3><p>After all of the Bitcoin ETF conflict and regulatory debate over the years, it’s becoming clear that BlackRock is likely a leading candidate to advance some sort of new bitcoin investment vehicle in the United States. The SEC’s delay in clarity and regulation over the years, all but seems part of a broader plan to get the market’s dominant bitcoin ETF investment option into the hands of one of America’s largest traditional finance institutions. Although other ETFs may get approved, it’s likely a winner-takes-all market or an oligopoly in terms of initial flows, competition and size of AUM.</p><p>Based on the standard procedural timelines, the best guess is that an ETF approval is on the horizon for sometime in early 2024. It’s a timely move as it will coincide in the same year as Bitcoin’s next halving. Ideally, this is the perfect time for institutional investors to get exposure to bitcoin while also playing into a gold-like-mania narrative, to drive increased market interest right before Bitcoin’s planned supply issuance schedule gets cut in half.</p><p>Although helpful for price and boosting institutional demand and access, be wary of the second- and third-order effects of this ETF. Wide adoption of BlackRock’s ETF, complete with bitcoin IOUs, will offer more paper bitcoin variants to emerge. This could lead to a small cohort of institutions having a significant impact on overall price and market liquidity because of the large size of their financial flows. Other effects may include rehypothecation, determining “clean” versus “dirty” bitcoin and influence of new institutions on future hard-fork scenarios. </p><p>In summary, this type of investment vehicle is an inevitable path for an asset that is gaining institutional adoption at the same time as the market expands with many others demanding bitcoin exposure. BlackRock is free to purchase bitcoin like anyone else. Ultimately, it’s up to the market to decide and create better bitcoin custody solutions over time that can outcompete pseudo-bitcoin ETFs and IOU-like products.</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>
