<h2>Peter Schiff&#8217;s 2023 Economic Predictions</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff shared his 2023 predictions about the U.S. economy, the dollar, and the stock market in a series of tweets Friday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The U.S. dollar index may have had a strong year, but it ended the year on a six-month low, down 10% from its November high,&#8221; he began, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>This weakness will likely continue in 2023, with the dollar having one of its worst years ever. If I&#8217;m right the inflation problem is about to get much worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff also disagreed with Wharton University&#8217;s finance professor Jeremy Siegel who shared his economic view on CNBC last week.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeremy Siegel is wrong,&#8221; Schiff contended. Siegel &#8220;thinks falling real estate prices means the inflation threat is over. That&#8217;s falling asset prices. Consumer prices will keep rising, including those associated with homeownership like rent, mortgage rates, insurance, taxes, utilities, and maintenance,&#8221; Schiff argued.</p>

<p>Regarding the stock market, Schiff predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The worst-performing sectors of the stock market in 2022 will likely repeat as the worst-performing sectors in 2023.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff has repeatedly warned about the U.S. economy and the dollar crashing. In October, he cautioned about the rising national debt that the U.S. cannot repay. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to default,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-the-us-dollar-will-crash-says-were-going-to-default/">warned</a>. &#8220;We have much more debt now than we had in 2008 … so this is going to be a much bigger crisis when the defaults start,&#8221; he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-warns-us-faces-a-massive-financial-crisis-economist-expects-much-larger-problems-than-2008-when-the-defaults-start/">described</a>. The economist also predicted that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent actions could <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-fed-action-could-lead-to-market-crashes-massive-financial-crisis-severe-recession/">lead to</a> market crashes, a massive financial crisis, and a severe recession.</p>

The company states that it is &#x201C;uniquely qualified&#x201D; for the role and plans to facilitate redemptions at net asset value (NAV) through a Regulation M filing.</strong></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valkyrie Offers to Take Over Management of Grayscale&#x2019;s Bitcoin Trust</span></h2>
<p>Grayscale&#x2019;s Bitcoin Trust (<a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/GBTC:OTCMKTS">GBTC</a>) has faced challenges in 2022, with the fund&#x2019;s discount to net asset value (NAV) reaching record levels. Over the past six months, the spread between the fund&#x2019;s value and NAV has increased by more than 35% by the end of Sept. 2022. As of Dec. 30, 2022, the discount has further widened to more than <a href="https://ycharts.com/companies/GBTC/discount_or_premium_to_nav">45%</a>. This means that the value of the bitcoin fund is currently lower than current <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> spot prices. Valkyrie wants to remedy the situation by taking over sponsorship and creating another fund.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done,&#x201D; Valkyrie <a href="https://valkyrieinvest.com/press/opportunities-around-gbtc/">wrote</a>. &#x201C;However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The fund manager said Friday it is launching the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, a venture that aims to take advantage of GBTC&#x2019;s discount to net asset value. According to Valkyrie, the team will add to its GBTC holdings, which could eventually show the &#x201C;true value of the underlying bitcoin for our investors.&#x201D; At the time of writing, the Bitcoin Trust managed by Grayscale holds approximately 643,572 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, Eric Balchunas, senior exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst for Bloomberg, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1608987649129476098?s=20&t=y46xJXsndEuEHEV-BairMw">shared his opinion</a> about Valkyrie&#x2019;s intentions. &#x201C;Valkyrie is launching the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund in an effort to become the new sponsor of GBTC (which is trading at a 50% discount) and facilitate redemptions at NAV and for a fee of 75bps,&#x201D; Balchunas tweeted. &#x201C;Long shot but speaks to growing pressure.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In the announcement, Valkyrie offered three proposals:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Facilitate orderly redemptions at net asset value (NAV) for all investors who want it through a timely Regulation M filing. This will ensure that all investors have the option to redeem their shares at a fair price, without any delays or obstacles.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Lower the fees to a more equitable level, in line with best industry practices. We propose a fee of 75 basis points, which is significantly lower than the current rate of 200 basis points.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Attempt to offer redemptions in both bitcoin and cash for investors. This will give investors greater flexibility and choice when it comes to redeeming their shares.</li>
</ul>
<p>Valkyrie&#x2019;s offer comes at a time when Grayscale&#x2019;s parent firm Digital Currency Group (DCG) has been having issues with its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital. In mid-November, Genesis&#x2019; lending arm <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-global-tradings-lending-unit-suspends-withdrawals-and-new-loan-originations/">suspended withdrawals</a> and new loan originations on the platform. It is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-genesis-owes-gemini-customers-900-million-exchange-is-attempting-to-recoup-assets/">reported</a> that Genesis owes the cryptocurrency exchange Gemini $900 million, and Gemini has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-forms-creditors-committee-with-houlihan-lokey-to-resolve-genesis-liquidity-issues/">formed a committee</a>, with financial advisor Houlihan Lokey, to recover the funds.</p>

<p>In addition, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gemini-customer-data-leak-was-advertised-for-sale-on-hacker-forums-for-30-btc-in-september/">Gemini</a> faces a potential class action lawsuit from two investors regarding the company&#x2019;s Gemini Earn program. Despite the speculation, a DCG shareholder letter from CEO Barry Silbert stated that the company will &#x201C;continue to be a leading builder of the industry.&#x201D; At the time of writing, Grayscale or DCG has not responded to Valkyrie&#x2019;s offer to become the new GBTC sponsor.</p>

Macroeconomic events will continue to shape the crypto economy and the economy as a whole. This editorial takes a look at the top three macroeconomic events to keep an eye on in 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>Examining the Top 3 Macroeconomic Events That Could Shape the Economy and Crypto Market in 2023</h2>
<p>The new year has started and the upcoming 12 months sure look gloomy in terms of the global economy. In 2022, assets such as precious metals, stocks, and cryptocurrencies were impacted by macroeconomic events, leading to volatile asset prices. Macroeconomics, is a branch of economics that studies the behavior of an economy as a whole, and it considers any event that significantly impacts the overall economy of a country or region to be a macroeconomic event. The following is a look at three different events that could impact the global economy a great deal and affect the prices of stocks, precious metals, and crypto assets.</p>
<h3><strong>The Ukraine-Russia War</strong></h3>
<p>The Ukraine-Russia War is a macroeconomic event that can affect the global economy and the world&#x2019;s assets in 2023. After Russian president Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-says-new-year-message-west-is-using-ukraine-destroy-russia-2022-12-31/">delivered</a> his New Year&#x2019;s Eve address to the nation, people believe the war will continue at his discretion. Rather than his traditional appearance in front of the Kremlin, Putin was flanked by a handful of Russian servicemen and women wearing army fatigues. The speech indicates that Putin will continue the war in Europe, despite the West&#x2019;s <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12092">actions</a> to stop Russia by imposing significant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/30/russian-oligarchs-lose-95bn-in-2022-amid-sanctions-after-ukraine-war">financial sanctions</a> on the country. Like 2022, the ongoing war in Europe will affect the world&#x2019;s assets in 2023, as the warfare and sanctions have caused energy prices to skyrocket and supply chains to break.</p>
<h3><strong>Covid-19 in China</strong></h3>
<p>Stocks, crypto assets, and precious metals have been dealing with the macroeconomic effects of Covid-19 for over three years now. According to multiple <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2022/12/31/china-covid-virus-evolution/">reports</a>, Covid-19 is allegedly raging in China and the government has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hospital-warns-tragic-battle-covid-spreads-china-rcna62902">stopped releasing</a> Covid case count numbers. Covid in China has worried global investors in 2022 and it has lapsed over into 2023. The reason for such worry would be global trade as the pandemic has caused specific supply chains to come to a grinding halt during the last few years. Covid has affected crypto prices as &#x2018;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/edward-snowden-buying-bitcoin-market-bottom/">Black Thursday</a>&#x2019; in March 2020 shows that bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped below the $4K region after the United Nations&#x2019; World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid-19 was a global pandemic.</p>
<h3><strong>Central Bank and Fed Rate Hikes</strong></h3>
<p>After suppressing benchmark bank rates before the Covid-19 pandemic and during 2020&#x2019;s major stimulus injection, central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve have raised benchmark interest rates a great deal. Whenever the Fed raised the rate, it caused massive fluctuations in <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-gold-demand-rose-at-the-fastest-pace-in-55-years-analyst-says-silver-could-outperform-gold-in-2023/">precious metal</a>, equity, and crypto markets. Interest rate hikes are macroeconomic events that have managed to shake up the world&#x2019;s lending rates a great deal. For instance, a 30-year fixed interest rate on a mortgage in the U.S. today is <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">7.9%</a>. The rate is a lot higher than the 3.815% 30-year fixed interest rate on a mortgage in the U.S. in January 2022. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-recent-fed-rate-hikes-might-go-down-in-history-as-most-damaging-ever/">Raising</a> or reducing the federal funds rate is one <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/opinion/will-2023-be-naughty-or-nice/">macroeconomic event</a> that always seems to cause market fluctuations.</p>

<p>Macroeconomic events can be positive or negative for a stock, precious metal, or crypto asset if it is expected to have an impact on the security&#x2019;s underlying foundations. The aforementioned events above may or may not affect global markets and the world&#x2019;s assets but they could also shake them to the core. 2023 may be no different in that sense as 2022 clearly shows that macroeconomic events like the war in Europe, Covid-19, and central bank rate hikes have moved all of the world&#x2019;s most popular markets including fiat currencies, commodities, securities, and crypto assets.</p>

On Jan. 1, data shows that $22.95 billion was traded in the last 24 hours, compared to double that amount, $54.78 billion, two weeks earlier. On November 8, 2022, 54 days prior, amid the FTX collapse, global cryptocurrency trade volumes were approximately $115.33 billion.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Trade Volumes End 2022 46% Lower Than the Month Prior</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency trade volumes worldwide have significantly declined since the beginning of the year. For example, on Jan. 2, 2022, one year ago, the global trade volume for the 24-hour period was approximately <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220102125645/https://www.coingecko.com/en">$70.48 billion</a>, according to archived coingecko.com statistics. Today&#x2019;s 24-hour volume worldwide is 67.43% less at <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">$22.95 billion</a>. In addition, 71.63% of all trades on Jan. 1, 2023, were paired with the cryptocurrency economy&#x2019;s stablecoins.</p>
<p>While all the stablecoins today represent <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins">$16.44 billion</a> in trade volume, tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) commands $12.45 billion, which equates to 71.63% of the aggregate on Jan. 1, 2023. Two weeks ago on Dec. 15, the global trade volume was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221215051021/https://www.coingecko.com/">$54.78 billion</a> and a good majority of those trades were in stablecoins as well. Cryptocurrency trade volumes have been declining since Jan. 2022, with monthly spikes in May, Sept., and Nov. 2022.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-566750 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly.png" alt="" width="2401" height="1260" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly-300x157.png 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly-1024x537.png 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly-768x403.png 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly-1536x806.png 1536w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly-2048x1075.png 2048w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly.png 2401w" sizes="(max-width: 2401px) 100vw, 2401px"></p>
<p>The November spike occurred amid the chaos surrounding FTX&#x2019;s insolvency, and there were significantly higher daily trade volumes at that time. Data from The Block&#x2019;s crypto exchange volume (<a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/spot/cryptocurrency-exchange-volume-monthly">legitimate index</a>) shows that Oct. 2022 had $543.67 billion in volume, while Nov. 2022 saw an increase of approximately 23.79% to $673.01 billion. Now that Dec. 2022 is over, statistics show that Dec. 2022&#x2019;s total volumes were around $357.48 billion, or 46.88% lower than the previous month.</p>

<p>The last time global cryptocurrency trade volumes were this low was two years ago in December 2020. At that time, global crypto trade volumes were 7.27% higher at $385.51 billion. Lower cryptocurrency trade volumes can have both positive and negative implications for investors.</p>
<p>On one hand, low trade volume is often seen as a sign of a lack of interest in the crypto market, which could potentially indicate lower values. On the other hand, low trade volume can sometimes be interpreted as a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency economy, as it may suggest limited selling pressure.</p>

<h2 class="article__header__heading">Caroline Ellison&#8217;s Testimony Claims FTX Boss SBF Directed Her to Co-Mingle Customer Funds Since 2019</h2>
<p>On Dec. 23, 2022, Matthew Russell Lee from the Inner City Press published the recently unsealed guilty plea transcript of Caroline Ellison, Alameda Research’s former CEO. In her statements, Ellison describes that she was the co-CEO and CEO of Alameda, and under those roles, she reported directly to the former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The ex-Alameda CEO’s testimony details that she was fully aware from 2019 to 2022, that Alameda Research had access to a special borrowing facility that allowed the company to maintain an unlimited line of credit with zero collateral. The ‘borrowing facility,’ according to Ellison, was FTX’s customer funds.</p>

<h2 class="article__header__heading">Crypto Community Asks: Where in the World Is Ex-Alameda CEO Sam Trabucco?</h2>
<p>Following FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s arrest and the statements from his co-workers Gary Wang and Caroline Ellison, the spotlight has turned on the remaining executives who were part of the team’s inner circle. Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it’s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.</p>

<p>Amid the dreary global economy, a number of market strategists and analysts believe oil will be the number one investment in 2023. While a barrel of oil is coasting along at prices between $80.12 and $85 per unit, Goldman Sachs analysts think oil will reach $110 per barrel for Brent oil, and strategists from Morgan Stanley also believe oil will reach $110 a barrel by mid-2023. The founder of Praetorian Capital recently warned a barrel of oil could jump a lot higher next year.</p>

Demand continues to increase in residential areas as well, after regional authorities abandoned a proposal to introduce higher tariffs for Russians minting digital coins at their homes.</strong></p>
<h2>Authorities in Russia Think New Energy Infrastructure, Generation Capacities in Crypto Mining Regions</h2>
<p>Russian Minister of Energy Nikolay Shulginov has recognized the increased demand for electricity from cryptocurrency miners in some parts of Siberia where the industry has been expanding. Additional generating capacities may be necessary to meet their needs, he indicated, quoted by local media and crypto news outlets.</p>
<p>Shulginov did not reveal specific plans but made it clear that Russian authorities in these regions are considering the further development of the energy networks used by mining companies and the construction of more power plants. The grids in the Republic of Khakassia and Irkutsk Oblast are currently experiencing the greatest loads, Bits.media reported.</p>

<p>“The position of the Ministry of Energy has always been based on the need to create working conditions for mining,” the government official emphasized. He also noted that electricity consumption of the population has risen as well, sometimes causing damage to the distribution networks.</p>
<p>“As for industrial mining, it is also growing, mainly in regions where the tariff is low. In these regions, we are seeing significant consumption growth, which we must take into account,” Shulginov commented in an interview with the Russia-24 TV channel and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most likely, it won’t go without the construction of generation [capacities] in the southeastern part of the unified energy system of Siberia.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Energy-Rich Irkutsk Maintains Low Electricity Rates for Crypto Miners</h2>
<p>Crypto mining has been expanding in Russia, a country with abundant low-cost energy resources and cool climate, both as a profitable business activity and as an additional source of income for many ordinary Russians minting in basements and garages. According to a study published in October, bitcoin mining revenue in Russia <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-revenue-in-russia-grew-18-times-in-4-years-before-worst-quarter/">grew</a> 18 times in four years before markets and sanctions <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sanctions-bitriver-targets-russias-crypto-mining-potential/">hit</a> it this year.</p>
<p>At-home mining has been blamed for breakdowns and blackouts in places such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irkutsk_Oblast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Irkutsk</a>, dubbed the mining capital of Russia, which offers some of the lowest electricity rates in the country. A proposal to introduce differentiated tariffs, increasing energy costs for amateur miners in order to limit consumption, was backed by the energy ministry but eventually rejected by local authorities with the exception of the region of Kemerovo.</p>
<p>In early December, Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Snikkars <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-expects-sizable-increase-in-crypto-miners-share-of-power-usage/">said</a> that the industry may see a two-fold increase in its share of Russia’s total power consumption in 2022. His department and the Bank of Russia <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-backs-crypto-mining-bill-but-insists-minted-coins-should-be-exported/">supported</a> a bill designed to regulate cryptocurrency mining but lawmakers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-parliament-postpones-adoption-of-crypto-mining-bill/">postponed</a> the adoption of the draft law for 2023.</p>

The legislation introduces rules determining how the new form of national fiat will be issued and amends a series of legal acts to facilitate its implementation.</strong></p>
<h2>Bank of Russia to Be the Sole Operator of the Digital Ruble Platform</h2>
<p>A group of Russian lawmakers, led by the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee Anatoly Aksakov, have submitted draft legislation on the digital ruble, the central bank digital currency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) minted by Russia’s monetary authority. The document suggests legislative changes meant to create the conditions for its introduction.</p>
<p>According to the explanatory notes to the bill, quoted by the crypto page of the Russian business news portal RBC, its main purpose is to develop the necessary payment infrastructure for the digital ruble. This, the sponsors believe, would provide Russian citizens, businesses, and the state with access to fast, convenient, and low-cost money transfers.</p>
<p>The proposal aims to amend several existing laws such as the law on “On the National Payment System” to which the members of Duma want to add definitions pertaining to the CBDC. The new provisions assign to the Bank of Russia the role of sole operator of the CBDC platform. They also establish the procedures for opening wallets for the digital ruble and accessing its platform.</p>

<p>An amendment to the law “On Currency Regulation and Currency Control” secures the status of the digital ruble as a currency of the Russian Federation and defines CBDCs issued by the central banks of other nations as foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Changes to the Federal Law “On Personal Data” allow Russia’s central bank to process personal information without obtaining consent and without the need to notify in advance the Russian authority responsible for protecting the rights of subjects of personal data.</p>
<p>The Central Bank of Russia presented the concept for its digital currency in October 2020 and finalized its prototype platform in December 2021. The pilot phase was initiated in January of this year. In May, the monetary authority said it plans to start tests with real transactions and customers in April 2023.</p>
<p>In June, amid mounting Western sanctions imposed over Moscow’s military invasion of Ukraine, the regulator said it’s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-accelerates-schedule-for-digital-ruble-project/">accelerating</a> the schedule for the project, aiming for <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-aims-for-full-launch-of-digital-ruble-in-2024/">full launch</a> in 2024.

<h2>Indian Central Bank on Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>India&#8217;s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), released its Financial Stability Report (FSR) for December on Thursday. The 172-page report includes discussions on crypto assets, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and decentralized finance (defi).</p>
<p>&#8220;Regulating new technology and business models after they have grown to a systemic level is challenging,&#8221; the RBI report states. &#8220;To promote responsible innovation and to mitigate financial stability risks in crypto ecosystem, it is vital for policymakers to design an appropriate policy approach.&#8221; The Indian central bank continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this context, under India&#8217;s G20 presidency, one of the priorities is to develop a framework for global regulation, including the possibility of prohibition, of unbacked crypto assets, stablecoins, and defi.</p></blockquote>
<p>The central bank named &#8220;turmoil in crypto assets market&#8221; one of &#8220;the major risks that can potentially undermine global financial stability.&#8221; The RBI also said crypto assets are highly volatile, &#8220;exhibit high correlations with equities,&#8221; and have fallen as inflation rose.</p>
<p>The report further notes that the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and subsequent crypto market sell-offs &#8220;have highlighted the inherent vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem.&#8221; It also highlights the terra/luna meltdown in May and the bankruptcy filings of several major crypto firms, including crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and crypto lender Celsius Network.</p>

<h2>G20 Members to Discuss Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Ajay Seth, India&#8217;s economic affairs secretary, said earlier this month that the G20 members aim to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/g20-countries-to-build-crypto-policy-consensus-for-better-global-regulation/">build a policy consensus</a> on crypto assets for better global regulation. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in October that crypto will be part of India&#8217;s agenda during its G20 presidency, adding that she hopes <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-to-discuss-crypto-during-g20-presidency-to-establish-tech-driven-regulatory-framework-says-finance-minister/">a technology-driven regulation framework</a> for crypto assets will be established.</p>
<p>The members of the Group of 20 (G20) are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the U.K., the U.S., and the European Union. The group represents around 85% of the world&#8217;s GDP.</p>
<p>India&#8217;s central bank, however, has repeatedly recommended banning all non-state-issued cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ether. Last week, RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das warned that cryptocurrencies will cause the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indias-central-bank-chief-cryptocurrencies-will-cause-next-financial-crisis-if-theyre-not-banned/">next financial crisis</a> if they are not banned. However, India&#8217;s finance minister said in July that both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-central-bank-rbi-favors-complete-crypto-ban-partial-ban-wont-work/">banning</a> and regulating crypto can only be effective with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-finance-minister-crypto-ban-regulation-effective-only-with-significant-international-collaboration/">significant international collaboration</a>.</p>

He warned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations will &#x201C;crush&#x201D; most other cryptocurrencies.</strong></p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Buys More Bitcoin, Warns About SEC Regulations Crushing Crypto Tokens</h2>
<p>The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, has revealed the key reason why he is investing in bitcoin. The famous author warned that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will &#x201C;crush&#x201D; most other crypto tokens with its regulations.</p>
<p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki tweeted Friday that he is investing in bitcoin. He explained that he is &#x201C;very excited&#x201D; about <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> because the cryptocurrency &#x201C;is classified as a commodity much like gold, silver, and oil.&#x201D; The Rich Dad Poor Dad author added that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has classified bitcoin as a commodity while most other crypto tokens are securities, cautioning that &#x201C;SEC regulations will crush most of them.&#x201D; He ended his tweet by stating that he is buying more bitcoin.</p>

<p>SEC Chairman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-commodity/">Gary Gensler</a> has said repeatedly that bitcoin is a commodity while <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-insists-most-crypto-tokens-are-securities-says-the-law-is-clear/">most other crypto tokens are securities</a>. The chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Rostin Behnam, has also confirmed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/">bitcoin is a commodity</a>.</p>
<p>The securities regulator said in November that its Enforcement Division remains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-enforcement-remains-focused-on-crypto-chair-gensler-says-hes-impressed-with-enforcement-results/">focused on crypto</a>. The SEC has been heavily criticized for taking an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/commissioner-sec-enforcement-centric-approach-crypto-regulation/">enforcement-centric approach</a> to regulating the crypto sector. Gensler said in May following the terra/luna collapse that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-warns-a-lot-of-crypto-tokens-will-fail-luna-ust-collapse/">a lot of crypto tokens will fail</a>.</p>

<p>The Rich Dad Poor Dad author has been recommending investors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-last-chance-to-buy-gold-and-silver-at-low-prices-says-stock-market-crash-will-send-them-higher/">buy gold, silver, and bitcoin</a> for quite some time. Kiyosaki previously said he is a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-a-bitcoin-investor-when-btc-hits-new-bottom-i-get-excited/">bitcoin investor</a>, not a trader, so he gets excited when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> hits a new bottom.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, he predicted that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-expects-bitcoin-investors-to-get-richer-when-fed-pivots-prints-trillions-of-dollars/">bitcoin investors will get richer</a> when the Federal Reserve pivots and prints trillions of &#x201C;fake&#x201D; dollars. Following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, Kiyosaki said he is still <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-im-still-bullish-on-bitcoin-crypto-cannot-be-blamed-for-ftx-collapse/">bullish on bitcoin</a>, emphasizing that crypto cannot be blamed for the FTX meltdown. In September, the renowned author urged investors to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-urges-investors-to-get-into-crypto-now-before-biggest-economic-crash-in-world-history/">get into crypto now</a>, before the biggest market crash strikes.</p>
<p>Kiyosaki also made other dire predictions, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-predicts-us-dollar-will-crash-by-january-suggests-buying-bitcoin/">U.S. dollar crashing</a>, the Fed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-fed-rate-hikes-will-destroy-us-economy-says-invest-in-real-money-bitcoin/">destroying the U.S. economy</a> with its rate hikes, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-hyperinflation-depression-are-here/">hyperinflation</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dads-robert-kiyosaki-warns-inflation-may-lead-to-greater-depression/">a Greater Depression</a>, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-robert-kiyosaki-warns-about-world-war-iii/">World War III</a>.</p>

Two FTX-owned crypto exchanges, FTX Japan and Liquid, are developing a system to allow withdrawals by mid-February.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX&#8217;s Japanese Customers Can Withdraw Funds Soon</h2>
<p>Two FTX-owned cryptocurrency exchanges in Japan — FTX Japan and Liquid — jointly announced Thursday that their users will be able to withdraw funds by mid-February. The two crypto exchanges announced:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the assets entrusted to us by our customers at FTX Japan and Liquid Japan, we are proceeding with system development so that withdrawals will be possible from the Liquid Japan website.</p></blockquote>
<p>To withdraw funds, FTX Japan&#8217;s customers will need to open an account with Liquid and transfer their assets to the Liquid platform. The exchanges plan to allow withdrawals by mid-February, according to the joint announcement.</p>
<p>Japanese exchange Liquid was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-japanese-crypto-market-acquisition-regulated-crypto-exchange/">acquired</a> by FTX earlier this year. The deal included Quoine Corp., one of the first crypto exchanges to successfully register in 2017 with Japan&#8217;s top financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency (FSA).</p>

<p>The acquisition followed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-liquid-hacked-loses-millions-in-various-currencies/">a major hack</a> where about $90 million worth of cryptocurrencies were stolen from the Liquid platform. FTX then provided Liquid with $120 million of debt financing at that time.</p>
<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 11. However, FTX Japan said on Dec. 1 that it had confirmed with lawyers for the FTX group that &#8220;Japanese customer cash and cryptocurrency should not be part of FTX Japan’s estate given how these assets are held and property interests under Japanese law.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November, the FSA <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-regulator-slaps-ftx-japan-with-business-suspension-order/">issued three orders</a> against FTX Japan: a business suspension order, an order to hold assets domestically, and a business improvement order. The orders followed the exchange abruptly halting customer withdrawals. The following day, FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed for bankruptcy</a> in the U.S. The exchange and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) have been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-securities-watchdog-charges-sam-bankman-fried-with-fraud-over-ftx-collapse/">charged</a> by the U.S. government and regulators with multiple counts of fraud.</p>
