<p>This has resulted in a significant increase in the median trading volume across the top three decentralized exchanges (DEX) in the past 48 hours, as investors try to find a safe haven.</p>



<p>According to aggregated data from CoinGecko, Uniswap V3 (Ethereum), Uniswap V3 (Arbitrum) and Pancakeswap V3 (BSC) — which account for 53% of the total DEX trading volume in the last 24 hours — saw an increase of more than $792 million between June 5 and June 7. This represents an increase of 444% in median trading volume across the top three DEXs.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the trading volume on Curve, a DEX that allows for the trading of stablecoins, spiked by 328%. Trading activity on Curve is currently focused on trading the U.S. Dollar-pegged stablecoins USD Coin and Tether.</p>



<p>It is important to note that trading volumes on DEXs briefly surpassed those of Coinbase during May&#8217;s memecoin frenzy. The sudden surge in trading activity was largely driven by investors rushing to purchase tokens such as Pepe (PEPE) and Turbo (TURBO) through Uniswap and other decentralized protocols, as the memecoins were not listed on major centralized exchanges.</p>



<p>As DEX volumes surged, net outflows on Binance reached a staggering $778M. It is worth noting that current net outflows are still much lower than the exchange&#8217;s total reserve. Binance maintained a stablecoin balance of more than $8 billion.</p>

<p>This market frenzy is taking place against the backdrop of a swathe of legal action against crypto exchanges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). On June 6, the SEC sued Coinbase alleging that it offered unregistered securities and acted as an unregistered securities broker among other charges. A day earlier, the SEC sued Binance, <a href="http://binance.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance.US</a> and Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) under similar allegations. The SEC alleged that Binance failed to register as a securities exchange and was therefore illegally operating in the U.S.. According to the charges, Zhao was sued as a &#8220;controlling person.&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The SEC filed an emergency motion to freeze assets of Binance&#8217;s US subsidiary and repatriate cash and cryptocurrency assets held on the Binance platform.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance has responded, stating that the platform remains fully operational and that user assets are safe and secure.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The SEC alleges that two foreign entities, Sigma Chain and Merit Peak, served as conduits for billions of dollars of customer money improperly commingled with Binance’s funds. This has led to concerns about the safety and security of the platform&#8217;s users and the future of Binance’s US operations. The regulator argues that the emergency order is necessary to prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants’ years of violative conduct and disregard for US laws.</p>



<p>On Monday, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, alleging that the exchange and Zhao had defrauded investors, improperly commingled funds, and operated as an unregistered broker, dealer, and clearing house. The lawsuit and the emergency motion have raised concerns about regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency world.</p>

<p>The order would also compel Zhao to show cause why a preliminary injunction against him and his two holding companies should not be entered. The restraining order would prevent all three entities from destroying evidence.</p>



<p>Binance has responded to the motion, stating that the platform remains fully operational and that user assets are safe and secure. However, the allegations and the emergency motion have caused unease among investors and raised concerns about the future of Binance’s operations in the US.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed lawsuits against these two leading cryptocurrency exchanges over the past few days, alleging that they traded unregistered securities. </p>



<p>Regarding Coinbase, the SEC alleges that the US exchange has offered and sold securities without registering its offers and sales. The assets that Coinbase makes available include crypto asset securities, and the SEC alleges that the following tokens are securities: SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Binance was accused of mishandling customer funds and lied to regulators and investors about its operations, saying that two Binance-linked tokens, BNB and BUSD, were securities the firm improperly offered and sold. The regulator also claimed that Binance and its US affiliate weren’t independent of each other and improperly functioned as an exchange, broker-dealer, and clearing agency without registering.</p>

<p>As a result, Robinhood&#8217;s legal chief, Dan Gallagher, has testified before the House Agriculture Committee that the brokerage is actively reviewing the regulator&#8217;s analysis to determine what actions to take.</p>



<p>Although Robinhood offers access to 18 different crypto assets, compared to Coinbase&#8217;s hundreds, some of the tokens offered by Robinhood, including SOL, ADA, and MATIC, are among those deemed unregistered securities by the SEC based on the lawsuits this week. This development has raised concerns about the future of these tokens and other crypto assets Robinhood offers.</p>



<p>Given the regulatory scrutiny, Robinhood is now taking a fresh look at its cryptocurrency offerings and considering its next steps. The brokerage is &#8220;actively reviewing&#8221; the regulator&#8217;s analysis &#8220;to determine what, if any, actions to take,&#8221; according to Gallagher. The SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase mark a significant crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry, and Robinhood&#8217;s response will be closely watched.</p>

<li><em>The Luxembourg Competition Authority has launched a market investigation into blockchain technology.</em></li>



<li><em>The research might be the first of its type investigating the economics of Web3.</em></li>



<li><em>This research will look at where and how emerging blockchain-based enterprises compete with current Web2 companies, as well as possible Web3 initiatives.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg&#8217;s Competition Authority is <a href="https://concurrence.public.lu/fr/actualites/2023/06-06-blockchain.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conducting</a> market research to better understand the link between products and services based on blockchain technology (Web3 projects) and existing digital companies (Web2 companies).</strong></h5>

<p>The government of the European Union member, which despite its tiny size, is an important financial center, has said that the technology behind crypto is critical to digital and environmental change.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Luxembourg government has identified blockchain technology as a key element in the green and digital transition of the economy,&#8221; the Autorité de la concurrence said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Blockchain is a technology that allows for the storage and transmission of data without the need for a central authority. It is a distributed database in which information given by users and connections within the database are validated and sorted into blocks, establishing a chain.</p>



<p>Competition market studies gather information about how a given market functions from enterprises involved in the area and may serve as the foundation for additional enforcement proceedings for antitrust violations such as abuse of a dominant position.</p>



<p>The Luxembourg Competition Council is undertaking market research to better understand the relationships between Web3-based goods and services and incumbent digital enterprises.</p>

<p>Given the complexities of this industry, the French Competition Authority enlisted the assistance of Professor Thibault Schrepel, Associate Professor of Law at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (ALTI) and Faculty Affiliate at Stanford University&#8217;s Center for Legal Informatics (CodeX), as an external expert to contribute to market research.</p>



<p>Thibault Schrepel is a renowned worldwide expert on blockchain competition regulations and cryptoeconomics, and the author of &#8220;Blockchain + Antitrust: The Decentralization Formula&#8221; and, most recently, &#8220;The Complex Relationship Between Web2 Companies and Web3 Projects&#8221;.</p>



<p>In the following weeks, the Autorité de la concurrence will contact different Luxembourg and European companies in the industry in partnership with Professor Schrepel.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>CFTC Chair Rostin Behnam is asking for tougher measures, which he mentioned two years ago.</em></li>



<li><em>Behnam also expressed support for the recent SEC actions.</em></li>



<li><em>He argued that Bitcoin is a commodity and is not controlled by the United States.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chair Rostin Behnam <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opabehnam36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highlighted</a> to the House Agriculture Committee the need for congressional action to address the lack of federal regulation of the digital asset market.</strong></h5>

<p>After the SEC&#8217;s legal moves against Binance and Coinbase, the House Agricultural Committee met on Tuesday morning. The conference, which included two-panel discussions, was meant to address crypto spot market regulation.</p>



<p>Behnam&#8217;s speech focused on crypto token categorization, the present enforcement trend, and the need for regulatory clarification. This week, the SEC made a point of designating more than ten token securities in its Binance and Coinbase claims.</p>



<p>Behnam&#8217;s remarks were mostly focused on the categorization of crypto tokens, the prevalent tendency of regulating via enforcement, and the critical need for regulatory clarity. Importantly, in its recent litigation against Binance and Coinbase, the SEC classed over ten tokens as securities.</p>



<p>During his questioning of Behnam, South Dakota Republican Dusty Johnson expressed suspicion, saying:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“There are some who argue ‘the SEC’s got this.&#8217;”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Yet, Johnson raised an important point: Does the SEC have complete control over digital assets?</p>



<p>Behnam stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“This is not a zero-sum game. For anything that the CFTC might get in legislative or legal authority, I’m not taking it from someone else. There is a regulatory vacuum, there is a gap in regulation over digital commodity assets.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Behnam contended that the SEC should have authority over assets labeled as securities. He did, however, underline that the biggest coin, Bitcoin, is a commodity as ruled by a US court, and it is uncontrolled under US law.</p>



<p>Behnam has also underlined the necessity for clear crypto rules, which he addressed two years ago.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Since my Senate confirmation hearing almost two years ago, I have consistently highlighted the need for Congressional action to address the lack of federal regulation over the digital commodity market. I have been clear in testimony before Congress as well as in other public statements that bringing this volatile market out of the shadows and into the regulatory fold would protect customers, ensure market resilience and stability, and prevent contagion to the traditional financial system.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The CFTC has requested a 10% increase in the yearly budget, from $365 million to $411.14 million, although the agency has long battled for additional money with little success from Congress. Legislation that would pave the road for digital assets to become commodities would also give the CFTC greater ability to regulate them directly than it already has.</p>

<p>The failures of FTX, Celsius, Voyager, and Terra-Luna last year heightened the urgency felt by regulators and policymakers to raise guardrail assets in case the market developed to a scale that may damage the rest of the US and worldwide financial sectors.</p>



<p>To that end, Glenn Thompson, and Patrick McHenry, Chairs of the House Agricultural and Financial Services Committees, proposed new legislation last week.</p>



<p>If approved, the proposal would give the CFTC new jurisdiction and require the SEC and CFTC to design a more clear roadmap for digital assets to become commodities.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Haun Ventures, a cryptocurrency investment company, sponsored the $10 million seed round for Web3 game studio Argus.</em></li>



<li><em>Robot Ventures, Anagram, and Dispersion Capital also participated in the financing.</em></li>



<li><em>Argus is also introducing the World Engine, a blockchain-gaming SDK that will let developers construct their own Web3 game environments.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Argus Labs, a cryptocurrency game company, has secured $10 million in initial investment headed by Haun Ventures, with Robot Ventures, Anagram, Dispersion Capital, and Alchemy also investing.</strong></h5>

<p>Meanwhile, Argus introduced the World Engine, a new blockchain-based software development kit aimed to assist other developers in creating and customizing interoperable gaming worlds.</p>

<p>World Engine will allow game creators to build their own specialized layer-2 blockchain networks on Ethereum using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). Developers may modify their chains and specify precisely how long their game will be &#8220;on-chain.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs validate zk-Rollup transactions, a cryptographic breakthrough that enables multiple transactions to be performed concurrently to help scale networks and provide transaction privacy.</p>



<p>Scott Sunarto, Argus Labs&#8217; CEO and founder, is just 22 years old. Nevertheless, unlike most people in their early twenties, he suddenly has access to a $10 million pot. With the fresh funds, Argus Labs intends to launch World Engine before focusing on a game that it is creating and hopes to release later this year.</p>



<p>Sunarto, who previously designed the game Dark Forest as a teenager, said in a blog post published today that although online games were born from the internet, they are walled, blocked off from the tremendous possibilities of a linked world. According to today&#8217;s statement, he sees World Engine as a solution.</p>

<p>Katie Haun, a former Andreessen Horowitz general partner, launched Haun Ventures, which secured $1.5 billion for two crypto investment funds in early 2022, most of which has yet to be deployed.</p>



<p>Haun&#8217;s newest investment is in Argus, as the freshly founded business continues to distribute $1.5 billion across crypto startups despite regulatory uncertainties in the US and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/192594-binance-vs-sec-lawsuit-market-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SEC&#8217;s recent targeting on the main exchanges</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>PoW seems to be out of the SEC&#8217;s radar in the lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance.</em></li>



<li><em>Gary Gensler pointed out that both platforms allow traders to exchange hundreds of tokens, and the agency only has to show that one token is an unregistered security.</em></li>



<li><em>Gensler argues that aside from Bitcoin, all tokens are not considered.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It seems that Proof of Work (PoW) tokens have not been on the radar of the leading US agency. DCG founder Barry Silbert stated that PoW tokens (such as BTC, LTC, XMR, ETC, ZEC, etc.) are not <a href="https://twitter.com/BarrySilbert/status/1666068367759884289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">included</a> in any US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit.</strong></h5>

<p>Earlier, the US Securities and Exchange Commission sued Coinbase, the biggest US cryptocurrency exchange, for violating US securities rules by acting as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agency.</p>



<p>The complaint follows a similar action brought by the government on Monday against Binance, the world&#8217;s biggest cryptocurrency exchange.</p>



<p>The SEC identified stocks in suing Binance as SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI. The SEC classified SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO tokens as securities in its lawsuit against Coinbase.</p>



<p>In an interview with <em><a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkStreet/status/1666077164498763777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNBC</a></em>, Gensler said that it is up to individuals to decide what they want to invest in. Nonetheless, he claims that the law requires service providers to appropriately disclose their goods and services.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Without that proper disclosure, the public can’t answer the question as to whether it’s just, as you say, counterfeiting, or it’s a scam, or something else.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Gensler, without sufficient disclosures, investors are &#8220;just chasing after something,&#8221; which is exacerbated in a sector riddled with &#8220;hype, and hucksters and fraudsters.&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked about the SEC&#8217;s prospects of succeeding in its lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance, Gensler pointed out that both platforms provide hundreds of tokens to trade, and the agency only has to establish one token an unregistered securities.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“All we have to show is that one of them is a security and that they should be properly registering and having rulebooks against fraud, manipulation as an exchange, broker, and alike… And we’re very confident in this.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Proof of Work (often abbreviated as PoW) is a consensus algorithm used to prevent 51% attacks or double-spending. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are using PoW consensus to confirm transactions and produce new blocks added to the chain. With PoW, miners compete to complete transactions on the network in exchange for rewards for their speed and accuracy.</p>

<p>Originally, Gary Gensler said that Bitcoin is not a security but rather a commodity regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He also asserted that everything but Bitcoin is a security, which has enormous ramifications for how cryptocurrencies and digital assets are regulated in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The SEC&#8217;s attempt to regulate Coinbase is unlikely to succeed due to the company&#8217;s strong regulatory compliance and public status.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The SEC&#8217;s recent move to go after Coinbase has caused concern within the crypto community as it is seen as an attempt to regulate the industry. However, many experts believe that the SEC&#8217;s effort to regulate Coinbase will not succeed. </strong></h5>

<p>As stated by the Helius CEO, Coinbase is the most regulatory-compliant firm in the crypto industry and has created thousands of jobs. Its regulatory compliance is one of its strongest selling points and has been a major reason for its success. The company is also a public company, which makes it more difficult for the SEC to regulate it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SEC is going after Coinbase<br><br>the most regulatory compliant firm in ALL of crypto, a PUBLIC company, which has created thousands of jobs<br><br>I know everyone is worried, but Coinbase Legal is world-class and Brian is a killer<br><br>the SEC made a mistake, they won&#39;t win against Coinbase</p>&mdash; lightspeed mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1666083736885276675?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 6, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Additionally, Coinbase has been preparing for this kind of regulatory scrutiny for years, adding world-class legal, policy, and regulatory talent to its team. This talent has been instrumental in helping Coinbase navigate the complex regulatory landscape of the crypto industry. The company&#8217;s legal team is considered world-class, and its CEO, Brian Armstrong, is known for being a killer in the industry.</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s attempt to slow down the crypto industry is nothing new, as similar attempts have been made in the past against other industries such as automobiles, radio, and telecom. Despite the SEC&#8217;s efforts, the crypto industry is a global movement with an insane amount of talent working on this technology in countries such as Japan, Singapore, Dubai, India, Turkey, and parts of Europe. The SEC&#8217;s actions may hurt the USA&#8217;s ability to compete in the global crypto market, but they will not stop the progress of the industry.</p>

<p>It is believed that lobbyists and politicians directed the SEC to slow down the crypto industry to pave the way for CBDC. This is the oldest trick in the book that has been pulled against various industries in the past. While the road ahead may not be easy, Coinbase and other members of the crypto community must put aside their differences and advocate for the future of the industry they believe in. The crypto industry has the potential to revolutionize the financial system, and it is up to industry leaders to work together to ensure its success.</p>
