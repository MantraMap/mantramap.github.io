			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">In a new global ad campaign, OKX appears to take a shot at Coinbase's earlier message, suggesting that the financial system needs more than just an update. OKX's campaign advocates for a complete rewrite of the system, while the crypto exchange's rival, Coinbase, had previously called for an update. The ad appears to highlight the difference in vision between the two crypto firms.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">OKX's 60-second video campaign, launched on May 9, tackles the issue of the centralized financial system's "broken ways." Although the video doesn't directly mention Coinbase, its tagline, "the system doesn't need an update; it needs a rewrite," could be interpreted as a subtle dig at the rival exchange. This comes just two months after Coinbase's campaign, "It's time to update the system," which emphasized the need for improvements within the traditional financial system.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In collaboration with BBDO New York, OKX's creative agency of record, the campaihgn aims to expand the company's existing Web3 user base and its growing ecosystem. This includes the OKX Wallet, decentralized exchange (DEX), NFT Marketplace, Web3 Earn, and more. The campaign is being distributed globally via digital, print, and out-of-home formats.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Coinbase's earlier campaign pointed out that American financial institutions, despite being an essential part of the traditional finance system, still rely on outdated technology to serve their customers. Coinbase argued that cryptocurrency could provide the solution to this problem. In a tweet from March 8, 2023, Coinbase stated:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"American financial institutions are an essential part of the traditional finance system, but they rely on outdated technology invented before the internet that isn't serving them or their customers. Crypto can help."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">OKX's campaign, however, seems to go beyond Coinbase's suggestion for an update, emphasizing the decentralized nature of Web3. OKX argues that consumers should no longer need to be involved with centralized players at all.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Haider Rafique, chief marketing officer of OKX, shared his thoughts on the matter in a statement:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"There are two camps of thoughts. One side suggests we update existing systems to create a better world. The other believes we need a system rewrite. Our new campaign is a nod to those who believe we need to re-write the system into Web3.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The campaign follows last year's "What is OKX" global initiative, which introduced the new OKX brand to global audiences alongside Manchester City F.C. manager Pep Guardiola, Formula 1 driver Daniel Ricciardo, and Olympic medalist Scotty James.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We envision a world where we all have more control, mobility and various ways to trade our assets. A world where software allows us to be our own bank, to be interoperable and to trade without any intermediaries. We are here to contribute to building this future," Rafique shares.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The contrasting visions between OKX and Coinbase, as evidenced by their ad campaigns, highlight the ongoing debate in the crypto industry about the best way forward. While some argue for updating the existing finanncial system, others like OKX believe in a more radical approach of rewriting the system entirely, embracing the decentralized nature of Web3.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance has announced plans to support Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions on its NFT marketplace later this month. This move marks Binance's entry into the rapidly growing Bitcoin-based parallel NFT market.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The update to Binance's NFT marketplace will be rolled out in the coming weeks, allowing users to buy and trade Ordinals inscriptions using their Binance accounts. In March, the NFT marketplace expanded its range of supported networks by adding select NFT collections from Polygon to the platform.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's Head of Product, Mayur Kamat, sees the prepared listing to be a significant development. Kamat commented:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"Bitcoin is the OG of crypto. We believe things are just getting started here and can't wait to see what the future holds in this space."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Several inscriptions marketplaces have emerged as a result of Ordinals' initial surge in popularity, including Ordswap, Ordinals Market, and Ordinals Wallet. Magic Eden, the largest Solana NFT marketplace, was the first among established platforms to enter the Ordinals market, launching an inscriptions marketplace in March.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's NFT marketplace announcement comes just days after the exchange temporarily paused Bitcoin withdrawals due to network congestion, while its competitors remained fully operational. The pause occurred when Bitcoin transaction fees were at a high, and the network's mempool&mdash;where transactions wait to be verified&mdash;was heavily backlogged.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Many in crypto Twitter (CT) believe that transactions related to BRC-20 tokens were contributing to the network congestion. BRC-20 tokens, which are built and traded using Ordinals, use text-based inscriptions instead of image-based ones, just like Bitcoin NFTs. Currently, Binance's Bitcoin NFT marketplace does not support BRC-20 tokens.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In recent weeks, image-based inscriptions have been eclipsed by Bitcoin-based tokens and text-based inscriptions. On Sunday, 99.7% of inscriptions made through Ordinals were text-based, according to a Dune dashboard. Simultaneously, 65% of all Bitcoin transactions were related to BRC-20 tokens, as reported by another Dune dashboard.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The excitement surrounding BRC-20 tokens intensified on Monday as Ordi, the first BRC-20 token launched as an experiment in March, was listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Crypto.com and Gate.io. Binance's support for Ordinals inscriptions signals its commitment to staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The addition of Ordinals inscriptions to Binance's NFT marketplace represents a significant milestone in the expansion of digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain. As we dive deeper into the world of Ordinals and the underlying technology, it's important to understand how this development will impact Binance users and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain are often referred to as "digital artifacts," and they represent a different approach to NFTs compared to the more familiar Ethereum-based NFTs. Ordinals are created by inscribing satoshis, the atomic units of a Bitcoin, with digital artifacts or machine-readable language. This process aligns with the immutable nature of the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Bitcoin Ordinals project, initiated by Casey Rodarmor, a former blockchain developer at Chaincode Labs for Bitcoin Core, offers a new perspective on the concept of NFTs. The project documentation states, "Digital artifacts are permissionless. An NFT which cannot be sold without paying a royalty is not permissionless, and thus not a digital artifact." This distinction highlights the unique characteristics of Ordinals as opposed to traditional NFTs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As Binance adds support for Ordinals inscriptions to its NFT marketplace, users will have access to a new type of digital asset that is more closely tied to the Bitcoin blockchain. Unlike Ethereum-based NFTs, which often rely on off-chain data from the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), Bitcoin Ordinals do not require off-chain connections. This development represents a significant technical advancement within the digital asset space, addressing a previously unresolved (or, to some extent, unrealized) challenge in the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The process of creating Ordinals inscriptions involves inscribing satoshis with arbitrary content, resulting in bitcoin-native digital artifacts without the need for a sidechain or separate token. These inscribed satoshis can be transferred using bitcoin transactions, sent to bitcoin addresses, and held in bitcoin UTXOs. The transactions, addresses, and UTXOs are treated as normal bitcoin entities, with the exception that transactions must control the order and value of inputs and outputs according to ordinal theory.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Binance's decision to support Ordinals inscriptions on its NFT marketplace is a testament to the growing interest and excitement surrounding this new form of digital asset. As Yuga Labs, the creator of the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT collection, said, "Stepping into the Ordinals Discord a month ago felt like getting a glimpse of the 2017-era Ethereum NFT ecosystem. It&rsquo;s the type of energy and excitement we love."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">With the addition of Ordinals inscriptions to Binance's NFT marketplace, users can expect a more diverse range of digital assets available for trading and collecting. The integration of this innovative Bitcoin-based technology also signals the exchange's commitment to staying at the forefront of the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. The support for Bitcoin Ordinals could be a harbinger of even more groundbreaking developments in the space.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Bittrex Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday. The filing comes after the exchange suspended its US operations. </p>
<p>Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex Inc filed for bankruptcy on May 8, just weeks after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused it of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker-deal, and clearinghouse.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Bittrex Inc, which ceased its operations in the US on April 30 due to regulatory concerns, said its bankruptcy filing would not affect Bittrex Global, which serves customers outside the US.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy petition filed in a Delaware court indicates Bittrex&rsquo;s assets and liabilities were between $500 million and $1 billion, with over 100,000 creditors.</p>

Bittrex&rsquo;s Woes
<p>Bittrex announced on March 31 that it would suspend its operations in the US, claiming that it was not &ldquo;economically viable&rdquo; to continue doing business there.</p>
<p>The exchange said its offshore operations, Bittrex Global, which serves traders in Europe, Canada, and South America, would remain unaffected.</p>

<p>The SEC further alleges that from 2017 to 2022, the exchange earned over $1.3 billion in revenue from transaction fees from investors while offering its services without the necessary registration from the agency.</p>
<p>Bittrex&rsquo;s counsel, David Maria, said the exchange attempted to comply with the agency&rsquo;s rules but could not do so unless it essentially ceased all its revenue-producing services in the US.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Bittrex Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday. The filing comes after the exchange suspended its US operations. </p>
<p>Seattle-based cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex Inc filed for bankruptcy on May 8, just weeks after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused it of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker-deal, and clearinghouse.</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Bittrex Inc, which ceased its operations in the US on April 30 due to regulatory concerns, said its bankruptcy filing would not affect Bittrex Global, which serves customers outside the US.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy petition filed in a Delaware court indicates Bittrex&rsquo;s assets and liabilities were between $500 million and $1 billion, with over 100,000 creditors.</p>
<p>Reuters further reports that the exchange still holds assets of some of its US customers that did not withdraw funds before the April 30 deadline. Bittrex assured its customers that the funds were &ldquo;safe and secure.&rdquo;</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Web 3 certification platform Wakweli partners with Blockchain Lawyers Group (BLG).&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The partnership aims to boost legal expertise in the Web 3 industry.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Wakweli also announced its new initiative to offer token grants to developers.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wakweli, a decentralized NFT certification protocol, announced its partnership with the Blockchain Lawyers Group (BLG) aiming to extend the solid legal expertise in the Web 3 ecosystem. In addition, the partnership will also see the BLG group conduct deeper protocol refinements for Wakweli&rsquo;s proof-of-democracy (PoD) consensus algorithm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wakweli is an NFT certification protocol that aims to improve trust in the decentralized ecosystem by issuing certificates of authenticity for NFTs and other tokenized assets to combat fraud in the growing web3 ecosystem. The Blockchain Lawyers Group consists of a global network of legal professionals and experts experienced in Web 3 and blockchain matters. The group of lawyers offers easy access to competent and qualified legal advice through an NFT membership model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership between Wakweli and BLG aims to foster stronger relationships and extend legal knowledge to Web 3 users. As part of the collaboration, BLG lawyers will take part in the validation of the very first certificates offered on Wakweli, helping boost trust in the whole decentralized certification process. Apart from upholding the market integrity of the NFTs and tokenized assets, the partnership also brings Wakweli to the Web 3 map, setting it as a benchmark of trust for the decentralized ecosystem.</p>

<p>"We are excited to partner with such an innovative company as Wakweli, which is trying to solve a preeminent issue in the NFT space,&rdquo; said Blockchain Lawyers Group Founder and Member Miguel Dinis Lucas. &ldquo;We are confident that our collaboration will bring new levels of innovation and user-friendliness to the market."</p>

<p>The statement from the Wakweli team labels the latest partnership &ldquo;significant&rdquo; as the platform pushes for more competent and qualified legal advice in the blockchain and crypto ecosystem. Additionally, it bonds well with its certification protocol and ensures Wakweli users get easy access to legal advice for businesses, digital assets, and protocols they have in the Web 3 ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the $1.1 million Wakweli seed funding round in 2022, the company has taken massive strides in pushing for more development in the decentralized industry. The protocol launched its website, whitepaper, roadmap and Alpha release in the course of the past year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the statement released today, Wakweli announced a new funding initiative that calls on Web 3 developers to apply for token grants from its on-chain treasury. It plans to launch a special foundation later this year to manage the initiative.</p>

<p class="s10">Unraveling the Factors Behind Uniswap (UNI) Market Volatility: A Closer Look at the Challenges and Competition</p>
<p class="s7">Uniswap (UNI) has recently experienced significant fluctuations in its value, prompting investors to explore alternative investment options. Since its inception, Uniswap (UNI) has gained prominence for enabling the trading of Ethereum-based tokens. However, the price of Uniswap(UNI) has plummeted from a notable $44 to a humble $6.32, in spite of a recent 11% increase. </p>
<p class="s7">This drop in Uniswap (UNI) value has raised concerns among investors regarding its prospects for long-term returns and its ability to recover its previous standing in the market. Additionally, Uniswap faces increasing competition from emerging decentralized exchange platforms and the ever-evolving crypto landscape. </p>
<p class="s7">Consequently, many investors are turning to alternative investments that display more appealing growth prospects. While optimism for Uniswap (UNI) remains, its ability to attract investor interest and compete with other emerging contenders in the constantly changing crypto landscape is uncertain.</p>
<p class="s10">Arbitrum (ARB): Promising Potential but Disappointing Delivery - The Quest for More Innovative Alternatives</p>
<p class="s7">Arbitrum (ARB) has garnered significant attention within the decentralized finance ecosystem for its potential to enhance the scalability and efficiency of Ethereum-based decentralized applications. However, despite its high potential, Arbitrum (ARB) has struggled to deliver on its promises, leaving investors searching for better alternatives such as Yachtify (YCHT).</p>
<p class="s7">Concerns over the centralization of Arbitrum (ARB) validators have emerged among investors and users, leading to questions about its security and decentralization. Moreover, Arbitrum(ARB) faces tough competition from other layer 2 scaling solutions and faster layer 1 platforms that offer better scalability and efficiency.</p>
<p class="s7">As the search for more innovative and reliable alternatives continues, platforms like Yachtify(YCHT) have risen to prominence. Yachtify offers a unique investment opportunity by granting investors access to the exclusive yacht market through fractional ownership, paving the way for lucrative investments and portfolio diversification. By prioritizing technological advancements, a secure foundation, and dynamic growth potential, Yachtify (YCHT) offers a refreshing outlook on the decentralized finance market, making it a smarter investment option for those seeking long-term returns.</p>
<p class="s7">While Arbitrum (ARB) has high potential, its disappointing delivery and concerns over centralization have left investors searching for better alternatives. Yachtify (YCHT) represents an innovative and reliable alternative that prioritizes technological advancements and dynamic growth potential, making it a smarter investment choice in today's decentralized finance ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With growing inflationary fears and worries about the fundamental health of the banking sector, digital assets have never been more appealing. On-chain data shows hundreds of thousands of fresh wallets being created by new users, and analysts believe that The Sandbox (SAND), Chiliz(CHZ), and Collateral Network (COLT) will be the biggest gainers in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) and easy pick with first mover advantageAnalysts stated that Collateral Network (COLT) was an easy pick given its first mover advantage in real-world asset narrative. The protocol leads a new standard in the DeFi lending space, being the first to integrate real-world assets. Asset owners can leverage institutional-level liquidity on Collateral Network (COLT) and unlock capital from their assets. Collateral Network (COLT) uses 100% asset-backed NFTs to achieve this and powers new liquidity options for owners worldwide. Collateral Network (COLT) delivers much-needed updates to the asset-backed lending industry famously held back by bureaucracy and allows permissionless access to its services. Functioning as a multi-sided platform, borrowers unlock liquidity, lenders earn passive income on stable assets, and it opens the path for millions, perhaps billions of dollars, to be onboarded into DeFi. Analysts have forecast a 3,500% surge in the coming weeks. With plans to launch on various major centralized exchanges featured in the protocol&rsquo;s roadmap, several analysts further predicted 100X for early presale participants. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Is The Sandbox (SAND) a good investment?The Sandbox (SAND) is a metaverse open economy allowing users to interact digitally and own their gaming experience through holding NFTs. The Sandbox (SAND) is one of the big three metaverse land brokers, and all land purchases require The Sandbox (SAND) native token, giving it a great source of buy pressure. Analysts expect The Sandbox (SAND) to trade between $1.07 and $1.27 in 2023, citing increased curiosity in the metaverse. The Sandbox (SAND) underwent a brutal period in 2022 as metaverse funding dried up, but with bolstered market sentiment, funding slowly returns to The Sandbox (SAND) and other metaverse projects. The Sandbox (SAND) has also recently worked on integrating new NFT projects into its metaverse, such as CyberKongz. The ability to use an NFT as an avatar naturally gives more people a reason to visit The Sandbox (SAND) and could drive significant growth in 2023. </p>
<p>How much could Chiliz (CHZ) be worth?Chiliz (CHZ) blends blockchain and sports. It gives fans a more direct role in club governance and allows sports teams to monetize their supporter base more effectively. Fans purchase Chiliz(CHZ) tokens and exchange them for club-specific tokens on the Socios platform. Chiliz (CHZ) remains the most significant sports and entertainment crypto project and recently launched its own layer one blockchain. Analysts expect Chiliz (CHZ) could trade between $0.22 and $0.28 by the end of the year, listing the massive partnerships Chiliz (CHZ) has secured to validate their bullish predictions. The most recent partnership Chiliz (CHZ) engaged in was with Sony Pictures for the launch of Spider-Man, and with this caliber of partnership, Chiliz (CHZ) could take off in 2023.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Investing early in a growth-bound project is considered the most profitable investment strategy. Market bulls usually follow this strategy, and have done it again with Tradecurve. Soon after the presale of Tradecurve was launched, investors started to accumulate a large number of TCRV tokens. It is projected to rise 50x during the presale phase, and 100x upon launch. On the contrary, Decentraland (MANA) and Uniswap (UNI) have lost their growth momentum.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s9">Uniswap (UNI) Crosses $1.5 Trillion In Trading Volume</p>
<p class="s6">The decentralized crypto exchange, Uniswap (UNI), has crossed a major milestone by trading volume. According to the latest data, Uniswap (UNI) has officially passed $1.5 trillion in trading volume. The Uniswap (UNI) exchange has witnessed a cumulative trading volume increase of $500 billion since April 2022. According to experts, Uniswap&rsquo;s (UNI) developmental measures taken in the past few months have been the primary reason behind the increased trading volume of the exchange. Recently, Uniswap (UNI) successfully secured approval from Apple&rsquo;s App Store for its iOS mobile app, which can increase its trade volume further. Meanwhile, the price of Uniswap (UNI) has increased by 3% in the past week. Currently, Uniswap (UNI) is changing hands at $5.61.</p>
<p class="s9">Decentraland (MANA) Falls Vertically</p>
<p class="s6">Amid the fizzling hype around the metaverse-based cryptocurrencies, Decentraland (MANA) has been pushing forward with new initiatives to increase its market presence. However, the price movement of Decentraland (MANA) has not followed the projects&rsquo; development. The market value of Decentraland (MANA) has plunged by 7% in the past month. Consequently, Decentraland (MANA) is currently trading at $0.56. The much-anticipated 2023 Metaverse Fashion Week of Decentraland (MANA) failed to attract users, due to the declining popularity of the project. Now, in the latest event, Decentraland (MANA) has partnered with Fidelity International to build an education-based metaverse. However, investors are worried whether Decentraland (MANA) will ever be able to regain its market, as the user count on the platform is continuously declining.</p>
<p></p>
<p class="s9">Tradecurve (TCRV) Shows The Best Growth Potential</p>
<p class="s6">There are many exchanges that allow the trade of cryptocurrencies, while others facilitate the trading of traditional instruments like equities, bonds, ETFs, Options, commodities, and more. However, there was an absence of a platform that enabled trading of all asset classes under a single hood, until the launch of Tradecurve.io </p>
<p class="s6">It is a Web3 trading exchange that allows the trading of a wide range of assets, without FIAT payments. Notably, the cryptocurrency market size was expected to showcase a CAGR of 12.8% from 2021 to 2030. Besides, a survey has indicated that 71% of top global investors expect the trading of equities to grow in 2023. Hence, Tradecurve has massive growth potential, and bulls are buoyed by this. &nbsp; </p>
<p class="s6">On this platform, traders can open an account using an email ID, and begin trading without any KYC process. Moreover, its users hold their keys, and control their assets. The platform also protects users&rsquo; privacy through DeFi capabilities, unlike platforms like Binance, which has mandated the completion of KYC before trading. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="s6">Tradecurve's presale phase is live, and currently in its first stage. TCRV tokens are currently available at $0.01, and only 40% of the total 1.8 billion tokens will be supplied during the presale phase.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/05/monero-xrm-and-stellar-xmr-slow-down-while-sparklo-sprk-leaps-ahead</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">Across the traditional financial space, many centralized banks have begun to collapse and to get close. The distrust in centralized, traditional industries, as a result, has been lowering on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="s5">Many investors and traders are turning towards cryptocurrencies as alternatives.</p>
<p class="s5">Today, we will be going over the performance of Monero (XRM) and Stellar (XMR) and see why they have stagnated in value while presale-stage projects such as Sparklo have managed to get ahead with their momentum.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPARKLO TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK) To Make Precious Metals Easily Accessible</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is being developed as an alternative investment platform that will enable anyone the opportunity to make investments in and begin trading precious metals.</p>
<p class="s5">On top of the platform, every time an investor aim to make an investment in the asset class, a non-fungible token (NFT) gets minted. Then, this NFT is fractionalized. Investors have the opportunity to either buy a fraction of it or buy the entire NFT. If an investor buys an entire NFT that represents a gold bar, for example, they can get the real-world asset delivered to them at any location.</p>
<p class="s5">The platform has already been audited by InterFi Network, and the liquidity will also be locked for 100 years. At the level one presale stage, the SPRK token trades at a value of just $0.017. Analysts have predicted that its value can increase by 4,000% throughout the span of the upcoming few months, and savvy investors know that the most significant gains can be made by getting into it early.</p>
<p class="s9">Monero (XRM) Sees a Decrease of 3.2%</p>
<p class="s5">Monero (XRM) made an announcement where they celebrated their ninth birthday. This makes Monero (XRM) one of the oldest blockchain-based projects out there that is relevant to this day. Additionally, we saw the MoneroKon 2023 preliminary schedule go live.</p>
<p class="s5">As for the value of the Monero (XRM) cryptocurrency, on May 2, 2023, it traded at $154.51. In the last 30 days, Monero (XRM) saw a drop of just 1.5%, and in the last 14 days, this decrease has been at 3.2%. As such, it is clear why some investors might be interested in diversifying away from Monero (XRM).</p>
<p class="s9">Stellar (XMR) Enters Red Zone With A Drop of 14.7%</p>
<p class="s5">The team behind Stellar (XMR) took to Twitter to announce that the Stellar Community Fund is in Round 15 and is accepting submissions up until May 14. Moreover, the team also noted that Stellar (XMR) Questers, a new quest, went live, which teaches community members the power of "Muxed Account IDs."</p>
<p class="s5">As for the value of the Stellar (XMR) cryptocurrency, on May 2, 2023, it traded at $0.092464.</p>
<p class="s5">In the last 30 days, Stellar (XMR) saw a decrease in its value by 14.7%, and in the last 14 days, its overall decrease was at 11.2%. It is clear why Stellar (XMR) wants to diversify.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s4">With over 22,900 coin and token options for investors and traders to pick from, it can be difficult to distinguish blockchain-based projects that are primed for success from others that might fail.</p>
<p class="s4">Based on analytical data, price predictions, and the overall performance of the market, NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Optimism (OP), StableXSwap (STAX), and Uwerx might just be the best four cryptocurrencies to consider in 2023. Uwerx has stood out due to the success of its presale, and today, we will go over why this has been the case.</p>
<p class="s8">The Value Behind NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Optimism (OP) and StableXSwap (STAX)</p>
<p class="s4">Based on the price prediction made for the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) coin, its value can climb to a maximum of $2.93 by Q4, 2023.</p>
<p class="s4">As for its value in Q3 of 2025, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) coin can climb to $6.34. This price prediction indicates a bullish outlook for the NEAR Protocol (NEAR) coin.</p>
<p class="s4">Then there is the Optimism (OP) token, trading at $2.56 as of March 15, 2023. Price predictions were also made for the future of the Optimism (OP) token, where they showcase that by the end of Q4 2023, its maximum value will equal $3.68. As for Its performance by the end of 2025, the Optimism (OP) token can climb to $7.43.</p>
<p class="s4">The StableXSwap (STAX) token also has growth potential, trading at $0.243181 as of March 15, 2023. Analysts familiar with the StableXSwap (STAX) token have predicted that by the end of Q4 2023, it can climb to $0.43.</p>
<p class="s4">As for its future in 2025, by the end of the year, the StableXSwap (STAX) token can reach a value of $0.88.</p>
<p class="s4">It is clear that NEAR Protocol (NEAR), Optimism (OP), and StableXSwap (STAX) are all solid options for traders and investors, but there is an altcoin that can climb in value much further based on the success of its current presale, and that token is WERX.</p>
<p class="s8">Uwerx (WERX): A Stands Out Freelance Platform</p>
<p class="s4">Remote work models are increasing in popularity and appeal, and the freelancer space has grown exponentially over the past few years.</p>
<p class="s4">&ldquo;Freelancers now represent 46.5% of the global workforce&rdquo;, reported Freelance Informer.</p>
<p class="s4">Companies have also begun to realize the advantages, and some of the biggest names on a global scale are beginning to adopt the freelance model.</p>
<p class="s4">Centralized freelancer platforms, however, have issued, such as delays in payments, lack of transparency, and high fees at an average of 20%.</p>
<p class="s4">Based on the Polygon Network, Uwerx is a platform that aims to make it quicker and cheaper for freelancers and companies to connect and work together toward realizing specific projects and tasks. </p>
<p class="s4">Uwerx is being developed as a decentralized platform that establishes a trustless alternative that only charges a 1% fee and provides far more value and features than any centralized platform.</p>
<p class="s4">Being built on top of a blockchain, it enables immutable records, smart contract support, and access to a distributed ledger that records everything transparently.</p>
<p class="s4">With built-in collaboration tools, personalized matching. With a built-in system for resolving disputes and transparent pricing, Uwerx can become a major player in the freelancer and Web3 space.</p>
<p class="s8">The True Value Of The Uwerx (WERX) Presale and its Future</p>
<p class="s4">At the start of the Presale, the WERX token, the native cryptocurrency behind the Uwerx project, is offered at a value of $0.012. The liquidity will be locked for 25 years once the presale ends. As for the platform's security, Uwerx was audited by InterFi Network and SolidProof ahead of the presale.</p>
<p class="s4">Investors and traders who want to take up the opportunity and get engaged in the early stages of a project that we believe will become a dominant force in the Web3 space can do so by visiting the links below. </p>
<p class="s4">Another price increase is due soon, and so is the Alpha version of the platform - we think now is the best time to invest, follow the links below to find out more!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States' cryptocurrency companies are resorting more and more to the tactic of transporting their operations overseas, seeking out places with a friendlier regulatory stance towards cryptocurrency companies in general.</p>
SEC forces crypto companies' hand
<p>This phenomenon has been on the rise due to increasing pressure and criticism from sources such as the SEC, whose chairman Gary Gensler appears to have made it his mission to eradicate crypto from US shores.</p>
<p>In light of this, many crypto companies have begun scrutinising nations that have easier regulations when it comes to crypto trading, leading to a surge in relocation campaigns over recent years.</p>
Exchanges gone or leaving
<p>Major exchanges such as Binance, Kraken and Bitfinex have already shifted their locations over to countries with more lenient regulatory policies. Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume, has offices and staff located in many countries, probably in order to be able to survive full-on government attacks.</p>
<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s regulatory and legal duel with the SEC are well documented. CEO Brian Armstrong has recently had talks in the UK over a possible move, and UAE is also being considered as a strategic hub.&nbsp;</p>
Ripple expands in MENA
<p>Another crypto company currently fighting a highly public battle with the SEC is Ripple. The company has 20% of its customers based in the MENA region, and according to CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Dubai is emerging as a key financial hub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ripple is expanding in Dubai. With 20 percent of our customers based in MENA and clear regulatory regimes being developed, it&rsquo;s no surprise that Dubai is emerging as a key global financial hub,&rdquo;</p>
Which nations will ultimately host crypto?
<p>The trend of US crypto companies relocating overseas continues even though some say that it raises possible concerns about potential risks for traders and investors alike.</p>
<p>Regardless, US-based crypto firms continue their search for friendlier jurisdictions beyond America's shores - which could result in more competition among selected nations eager to host new digital technology companies with their attendant benefits.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There are always fresh problems and possibilities in the crypto market for investors and developers. Many businesses are learning to swim in this increasingly murky industry as they strive to meet the needs of an ever-expanding customer base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, some of these companies have seen widespread adoption and success in the crypto market by facilitating trading, staking, and lending, among other activities. These platforms have succeeded, whereas others have failed by catering to their users' needs with an intuitive interface, lightning-fast transaction processing, and friendly support staff. Notably, successful crypto marketing has been one of the main factors for a project's success, especially when working in sync with the product team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the United States, high-income earners are disproportionately represented among crypto investors. Those making $100,000 annually comprise 25 percent of crypto owners but only 15 percent of the general public. This shows how proper crypto investment can skyrocket an investor.</p>
<p>In this piece, we'll look at some of the leading crypto firms that have managed to thrive despite their many challenges. These companies are at the top of their game because they've developed groundbreaking products and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top Companies Uncovered By Our Compass</p>
<p>CoinPayments holds a prominent position as the leading and foremost cryptocurrency payment processor worldwide. With a user base exceeding one million and over 120,000 registered merchants hailing from more than 190 countries, CoinPayments stands out as one of the most widely-used multi-crypto payment platforms accessible on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its inception in 2013, CoinPayments has established a comprehensive crypto payment gateway solution that empowers merchants to accept more than 100 cryptocurrencies and hold over 2,000+ altcoins on a single platform.</p>
<p>Secondly, Contractus is a blockchain-based service that facilitates secure and encrypted one-click processing of contract signatures, cutting costs and accelerating the process. It operates on the highly scalable and rapidly expanding Solana blockchain, making it reliable and efficient. Contractus ensures instant execution of contracts, with no third-party intermediaries involved, and guarantees term fulfillment for all parties at a low fee of just 0.5% per transaction. It encrypts all client contract details and sensitive data, supports payment in various cryptocurrencies, and operates through an easy-to-use mobile application.</p>
<p>With integrated Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme and multi-signature approach, Contractus offers a secure and automated system for contract signing. It also provides third-party validation of contract results, ensuring work payment only after validation. These features make Contractus an efficient, cost-effective, and reliable platform for contract signing and execution, especially for transactions involving considerable sums. Principally, the company has a free-of-charge rate called Holder mode - when a client holds a 10.000 CTUS token and more or pays in Contractus tokens.</p>
<p>Also, at the forefront of Metaverse innovation, ALTAVA Group offers a one-of-a-kind platform that allows leading brands to connect their offline and online experiences via blockchain technology. ALTAVA's NFT prowess is on full display with its BAGC Collection, a golf-themed offshoot of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), licensed from Elite Apes, The Sandbox, and Animoca Brands. The platform also operates the Second Skin NFT Collection, which is expertly integrated with WOY, the company's proprietary Metaverse, available on both the App Store and Play Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALTAVA's got some big names backing it, like Hyundai, LG, Spartan, and Animoca Brands. Notably, the platform has seen over 300% year-over-year revenue growth. Despite that, TAVA's token price is way too low compared to its accomplishments. This year's expected to bridge all gaps for TAVA and ALTAVA as more people catch on to what this project is all about.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>With the Shanghai upgrade in the rearview mirror,&nbsp; Ethereum staking numbers have reported a sharp increase, outpacing ETH withdrawals by $189 Million.</p>
<p>The numbers show that since the completion of the upgrade allowing stakers to withdraw their ETH, most users are eager to begin ETH staking.</p>
ETH Staking Sees Considerable Growth
<p>Ethereum completed the Shapella upgrade on the 12th of April. Following the completion of the upgrade, Ethereum has seen 2.32 million ETH deposited, while 2.28 million ETH has been withdrawn. This means there is a positive net flow of around 32,000 ETH. In just the past 24 hours, investors have deposited 192,000 ETH while withdrawing only 29,000 ETH. This also marks the first time since Shapella that the cumulative amount of staked ETH has exceeded the total ETH withdrawn.</p>
<p>Additionally, there is also a significant uptick in the ETH burning rate. Over the past seven days, the network has seen 61,000 ETH burnt. This high burn rate can be primarily attributed to Uniswap, contributing to almost half of the ETH being burnt. ETH is the largest decentralized exchange by trading volume currently in operation. All of the data suggests that users are extremely bullish when it comes to staking with Ethereum. Analysts believe this is a good development for ETH. ETH being locked up for staking means there would be less ETH in the open market.</p>
Centralized Exchanges Drive Staking Withdrawals
<p>Looking at the breakdown of withdrawals, it is abundantly clear that centralized exchanges such as Binance, Conbase, and Kraken and driving them. According to data from Nansen, these exchanges are responsible for over 50% of withdrawals, totaling around 1.2 million ETH. In fact, Kraken alone has withdrawn about 609,410 ETH, while Binance and Coinbase have collectively withdrawn 624,650 ETH.</p>
<p>Other centralized exchanges that have made sizable ETH withdrawals include Gate.io, Huobi, and Gemini. Gate.io has withdrawn 36,560 ETH, while Huobi has removed 53,040 ETH. Meanwhile, Gemini has withdrawn 24,200 ETH. Even bankrupt crypto lender Celcius has withdrawn 6000 ETH. The data has also shown that Kraken staking customers in the United States have been almost completely removed from the staking system. This is because of regulatory action against Kraken by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Kraken eventually settled with the SEC after paying a $30 million fine and shuttering its staking operations in the United States in February.</p>
<p>Several entities are still waiting to withdraw their staked funds. Out of these, Coinbase is the largest, with around 55,000 ETH waiting to be withdrawn.</p>
Liquid Staking Protocols Make Significant Gains
<p>On the other hand, liquid staking protocols have made significant gains, with their total value locked (TVL) rising to over $16 billion. According to Nansen data, liquid staking protocols are responsible for most of the staked ETH. This category is dominated by Lido Finance, with its TVL rising by over 10% in the past month and going above the $12 billion mark. However, Lido&rsquo;s growth rate is relatively tame compared to the growth of other protocols, such as Rocketpool and Frax Ether. Rocketpool has reported a growth of nearly 28%, while Frax Ether has reported an increase of almost 44%. This sees their TVL rise to $1.55 billion and $345 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Liquid staling refers to users depositing their ETH into a protocol which then stakes it on the users&rsquo; behalf. In return, the user receives a token representing their staked positions. In the case of Lido, the token is stETH. According to Nansen, Lido&rsquo;s staked ETH takes up 79% of the total market. Next in line is Coinbase, with 15%.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) pioneer MakerDAO has announced the launch of its lending and borrowing protocol, Spark.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new protocol&rsquo;s initial iteration will function as a lending platform and allow users to lend and borrow ETH, DAI, stETH, and sDAI.&nbsp;</p>
Spark Protocol Launched&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO announced the launch of the Spark Protocol on its official Twitter handle. The new protocol is specifically designed for the DAI stablecoin and gives users and holders access to competitive interest rates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Announcing the Spark Protocol launch Starting May 9, 2023, Spark Protocol will be available to all DeFi users. An end-user, DAI-centered DeFi product deployed on Ethereum with supply and borrow features for ETH, stETH, DAI, and sDAI.&rdquo;</p>

<p>MakerDAO has also announced the Spark Protocol&rsquo;s first product, Spark Lend. The new protocol is also linked to Maker&rsquo;s D3M (Direct Deposit DAI Module). The Direct Deposit DAI Module is a system that enables secure interaction between the Maker ecosystem and third-party lending pools. As a result of the link between Spark Protocol and the Direct Deposit DAI Module, users can borrow the DAI stablecoin at competitive rates at an initial annual rate of 1.11%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its announcement regarding the launch of the Spark Protocol, Maker briefly touched upon the connection between the protocol and the Direct Deposit DAI Module, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This direct wholesale credit line in DAI injects and automatically balances fresh DAI liquidity into Spark Lend and enables its users to access the best rates in the market.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Spark Protocol promises to significantly improve MakerDAO&rsquo;s DAI lending capability, increase overall liquidity, provide more liquidity options, and allow users to access improved rates and a yield-bearing version of DAI.&nbsp;</p>
MakerDAO&rsquo;s Focus On Stability&nbsp;
<p>Spark Protocol&rsquo;s Spark Lend product also introduces a tokenized version of the DAI stablecoin, which is deposited in the DAI Savings Rate (DSR). The tokenized version is called sDAI. However, the yields are quite low at the moment, with DAI deposits getting only 1.1%. It also utilizes a Peg Stability Module that helps to connect the liquidity infrastructure and offers instant swapping of DAI and sDAI for USDC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While current yields may be low, decentralized finance users have become wary of protocols offering risky, high, and often unsustainable yields. As a result, Maker has focused on providing stability, liquidity, and significantly lower risk.&nbsp;</p>
The Endgame Plan&nbsp;
<p>Spark Protocol has been launched as part of MakerDAO&rsquo;s Endgame plan. Under this plan, Maker has proposed making the DAI stablecoin a free-floating asset collateralized by real-world assets (RWA). Under the new plan, DAI will continue to remain pegged to the dollar for three years. Simultaneously, Maker also plans to accumulate as much Ethereum (ETH) as possible in an effort to increase the ratio of decentralized collateral backing the DAI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DAI is the fourth-largest stablecoin in the crypto space and has a circulating supply of $4.7 billion. It has a market share of around 3.6%, making it the industry&rsquo;s largest decentralized stablecoin. Meanwhile, MakerDAO&rsquo;s native MKR token is trading at around $670, a drop of just over 1%.&nbsp;</p>
MakerDAO&rsquo;s New Constitution&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO also recently proposed a new constitution to formalize governance processes and safeguard against any potential threat from malicious entities that could attempt to take over the protocol. In an effort to ensure the security of the Maker Protocol and safeguard user funds from potential threats and failures thanks to human or institutional decisions, the new constitution uses &ldquo;alignment engineering&rdquo; to solidify the core commitments of the community. The new document creates several categories of participants. Each category of participants has different powers and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DAI is the fourth-largest stablecoin in the crypto space and has a circulating supply of $4.7 billion. It has a market share of around 3.6%, making it the industry&rsquo;s largest decentralized stablecoin. Meanwhile, MakerDAO&rsquo;s native MKR token is trading at around $670, a drop of just over 1%.&nbsp;</p>
MakerDAO&rsquo;s New Constitution&nbsp;
<p>MakerDAO also recently proposed a new constitution to formalize governance processes and safeguard against any potential threat from malicious entities that could attempt to take over the protocol. In an effort to ensure the security of the Maker Protocol and safeguard user funds from potential threats and failures thanks to human or institutional decisions, the new constitution uses &ldquo;alignment engineering&rdquo; to solidify the core commitments of the community. The new document creates several categories of participants. Each category of participants has different powers and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Sports Illustrated&rsquo;s ticketing affiliate, SI Tickets, launched its new &ldquo;Box Office&rdquo; platform, a self-service ticketing service based on the Polygon blockchain. </p>
<p>Sports Illustrated Tickets (SI Tickets) announced the launch of Box Office, a new non-fungible token (NFT) ticketing platform built on the Polygon blockchain, an Ethereum scaling solution. Sports Illustrated&rsquo;s marketplace developed Box Office in partnership with Ethereum software firm ConsenSys. SI Tickets is a division of the Sports Illustrated magazine and media brand.</p>

</p>
<p>According to the announcement:</p>

<p>Box Office is the first global platform to combine a complete NFT ticket solution for events of any size with visibility and adjacency to traditional, non-NFT tickets alongside the biggest in sports, concert and theatre on the SI Tickets marketplace.</p>

<p>Box Office delivers a seamless &ldquo;experience giving owners, organisers and host the ability to create, manage and promote a fully scalable, paid, or free ticketed live sporting event, performance or function fuelled by the Sports Illustrated Tickets platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>SI Tickets CEO, David Lane, said this new marketplace aims to &ldquo;disrupt the primary ticket market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lane added:</p>

<p>Blockchain is the future of ticketing, and now owners, promoters, hosts and attendees have access to an advanced ticketing experience that transforms the antiquated barcode into engaging and collectable content.</p>

<p>Box Office caters to the biggest events in sports and music but welcomes ticket listings from smaller ticket issuers that typically appear on ticketing sites like Eventbrite or DICE. Lane commented on this, saying:</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re not here to compete against Ticketmaster, SeatGeek, or AXS. We&rsquo;re going after the self-service event market. We&rsquo;re trying to create the first mass-market adoption of NFT ticketing so that everyone from a 15-year-old to a 90-year-old can buy their first NFT ticket without having to go through a crypto tutorial on blockchain, or have to get a wallet and understand any aspects of it.</p>

<p>Box Office NFT tickets will confer a host of benefits to its holder. In addition to granting entry, event organisers can equip tickets with photo and video content, collectables, personalised messages, promotional offers and loyalty rewards. Tickets can be found inside the SI Tickets app.</p>
