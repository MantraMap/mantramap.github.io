<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Aave tests Linea mainnet deployment for potential collaboration and expansion.</em></li>



<li><em>Benefits for Aave include access to a large user base and enhanced user experience through ConsenSys&#8217; product suite.</em></li>



<li><em>Collaboration aims to drive Aave&#8217;s growth, increase adoption, and strengthen its position in the DeFi market.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a significant development for the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, Aave, a prominent lending protocol, has put forth a <a href="https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-v3-deployment-on-linea-mainnet/14010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a> to establish a formal line of communication regarding a potential deployment on the Linea mainnet.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1024x573.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="573" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1024x573.png" alt="Aave Wants To Launch V3 On Linea For Mainnet Deployment" class="wp-image-203060" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1024x573.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-300x168.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-768x430.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1536x859.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-750x419.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033-1140x638.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1033.png 1788w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Aave Wants To Launch V3 On Linea For Mainnet Deployment 1"></a></figure></div>


<p>The proposal aims to gather community feedback and insights as Aave explores the possibility of an &#8220;MVP&#8221; (Minimum Viable Product) mainnet deployment following a successful testnet deployment on Linea.</p>



<p>The collaboration between Aave and Linea, a scalable Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum&#8217;s zkEVM technology incubated by ConsenSys, holds immense potential for both projects. Linea, with over 5 years of internal cryptography advancement and 20 months of dedicated research and development, aims to extend Ethereum&#8217;s capabilities while prioritizing user experience and on-chain resources. It has forged strong relationships with industry leaders such as MetaMask, Infura, and Truffle, enabling seamless integration and accessibility.</p>



<p>The motivation behind the protocol&#8217;s exploration of a mainnet deployment on Linea stems from Linea&#8217;s ability to leverage the distribution channels created by ConsenSys&#8217; product suite. By tapping into MetaMask&#8217;s extensive community of 30+ million monthly active users, Linea offers Aave v3 a unique opportunity to reach a broader audience and enhance user convenience. The proposed integration encompasses various product offerings, including on/off ramps, MetaBridge, MetaMask Swaps, the Portfolio dApp, and the MetaMask SDK, providing numerous avenues for incorporating the protocol.</p>



<p>Several key benefits await the protocol with a potential mainnet deployment on Linea. Firstly, the establishment of <a href="https://coincu.com/201480-aave-dao-to-launch-gho-on-through-v3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aave v3</a> markets and the integration of GHO (Aave&#8217;s governance token) on Linea would open up a vast and well-established user base of over 30 million users across the ConsenSys product suite. This strategic alignment would facilitate smoother distribution and adoption of the protocol&#8217;s markets and $GHO, ultimately contributing to the protocol&#8217;s growth and visibility. Furthermore, Aave would have the distinction of being a Linea launch partner, gaining access to ConsenSys&#8217; extensive marketing initiatives, partner highlights, and increased presence throughout the year.</p>

<p>To ensure transparency and community involvement, the Linea team is actively exploring options for incentives, such as contributions to Aave&#8217;s Safety module and sequencer rebates for the protocol. While specific details are yet to be finalized, the Linea community can expect updates on these incentives as the proposal develops further in the coming weeks.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this proposal is not final and will be updated as technical implementation strategies and recommendations become available. The protocol intends to develop the proposal transparently, allowing for insights and recommendations gained from ongoing testnet deployments to shape the final plan. While no fixed timeline has been announced, the team anticipates progressing discussions to subsequent stages of governance by mid-to-late August.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1034.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="690" height="382" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1034.png" alt="Aave Wants To Launch V3 On Linea For Mainnet Deployment" class="wp-image-203061" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1034.png 690w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1034-300x166.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 690px) 100vw, 690px" title="Aave Wants To Launch V3 On Linea For Mainnet Deployment 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the Aave community and Linea collaborate on this exciting initiative, the proposal holds immense potential for the expansion and solidification as a leading DeFi protocol. The integration with Linea&#8217;s scalable Layer 2 solution, coupled with ConsenSys&#8217; distribution channels and Linea&#8217;s commitment to decentralization, opens new avenues for growth, user engagement, and market share capture.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ark Invest sells Coinbase shares at a 52-week high.</em></li>



<li><em>Cathie Wood&#8217;s firm books profits while holding Meta Platforms and Robinhood shares.</em></li>



<li><em>Coinbase stock price surges, prompting Ark Invest to sell and focus on other investments.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a notable move, Ark Invest, the investment management firm led by prominent Bitcoin advocate Cathie Wood, has <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/23/07/33238734/cathie-wood-amasses-25-4m-worth-of-social-media-giant-meta-but-dumps-this-crypto-li" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made</a> strategic decisions regarding its holdings in Coinbase (COIN), Meta Platforms (META), and Robinhood Markets (HOOD). While Ark Invest has sold some of its Coinbase shares amid the stock&#8217;s surge to a 52-week high, the firm continues to hold shares in Meta Platforms and Robinhood.</strong></h5>

<p>According to data, Ark Invest sold 478,000 shares of Coinbase on July 14, amounting to approximately $53 million. This sale comes as Coinbase&#8217;s stock price reached a year-to-date high of $114.43. The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold 263,000 shares, the Ark Internet ETF (ARKW) sold 93,000 shares, and the Ark FinTech ETF (ARKF) sold 36,000 shares. This marks the second time this week that Ark Invest has offloaded its Coinbase holdings, having previously sold 135,000 shares on July 11.</p>

<p>Despite the recent sale, Coinbase&#8217;s stock has demonstrated substantial gains, surging 33% during the week and reaching a remarkable 213% increase year-to-date. However, on Friday, the stock closed at $105.31, experiencing a slight decline of 1.58% as investors opted to book profits. The surge in price was influenced by positive developments in the ongoing US SEC v. Ripple lawsuit, which had a positive impact on various crypto-related stocks.</p>



<p>On a different note, Ark Invest&#8217;s funds have been actively involved in other investments. The firm purchased shares of Meta Platforms and Robinhood. Notably, Ark Invest started acquiring Meta Platforms shares in June after the company announced the launch of its Twitter-like social media app called &#8220;Threads.&#8221; The ARK Innovation ETF acquired 69,793 shares of META, while the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF purchased 111,843 shares of Robinhood. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF added 12,559 shares of META and 169,116 shares of Robinhood to its portfolio.</p>



<p>The closing price of META shares on Friday stood at $308.87, representing a nearly 5% increase for the week. On the other hand, Robinhood&#8217;s stock price witnessed a 13% surge during the week, closing at $12.38 on Friday.</p>



<p>Ark previously <a href="https://coincu.com/201934-cathie-woods-ark-invest-cuts-coinbase-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced</a> its holdings in Coinbase on a day when the stock rose 9.8% following a Chicago Board Options Exchange filing, fueled speculation about the likely US approval of a Bitcoin ETF. Although remaining a significant shareholder, Wood&#8217;s fund&#8217;s reduction in holdings may convey to other investors the possibility of profiting from the share&#8217;s climb this year.</p>

<p>While <a href="https://coincu.com/198667-ark-invest-blackrock-locked-in-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ark Invest</a> has been accumulating Coinbase shares during periods of market volatility and regulatory challenges in the crypto industry, its recent decision to sell some of its holdings could signal an opportunity for investors to secure profits following the stock&#8217;s substantial rally this year. Despite regulatory scrutiny and legal battles faced by Coinbase, its stock has shown impressive growth, appreciating by over 150% year-to-date. Likewise, Ark Invest&#8217;s flagship fund has performed well, boasting a 51% gain in 2022, surpassing the gains of the Nasdaq 100 Index and the S&amp;P 500. It is worth noting that the Ark Innovation ETF experienced a significant decline of 67% in 2021.</p>



<p>Ark Invest&#8217;s investment decisions, particularly regarding <a href="https://coincu.com/203024-us-sec-coinbase-listing-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a>, Meta Platforms, and Robinhood, reflect the firm&#8217;s active management approach and its strategy to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the digital asset market. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, investors and market participants eagerly await further moves and insights from Cathie Wood and Ark Invest.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In a surprising turn of events, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection has defied concerns over the NFT market&#8217;s decline with a record-breaking sale and a surge in daily rankings.&nbsp;</strong></h5>

<p>Despite recent fears about the demise of NFTs, a remarkable transaction involving Bored Ape #1734 garnered immense attention. The NFT sold for a staggering 600 ETH, equivalent to over $1.2 million, on July 13. This significant sale has sparked hope that NFTs are making a comeback.</p>



<p>The BAYC collection experienced an impressive 8% increase in floor price, climbing up daily rankings. Just weeks ago, the collection faced a significant drop in floor prices, leading many to question the future of NFTs. However, the recent surge in price indicates a potential resurgence.</p>



<p>While the floor price surge is encouraging, the <a href="https://coincu.com/202762-bayc-announces-apefest-in-hong-kong-nov-3-5/">BAYC</a> collection has experienced a decline in volume and sales. Both indicators dropped by a substantial 91% and 92%, respectively, suggesting a more subdued market for the collection in recent times.</p>

<p>However, data from DappRadar reveals positive signs for the BAYC collection. It has emerged as a frontrunner among NFT collections based on daily metrics. The average price has surged by an impressive 80%, indicating increased value. Market capitalization has risen by nearly 5%, reflecting growing investor interest. Transaction volume has also experienced significant growth, with a rate of over 82%.</p>



<p>The recent sale of Bored Ape #1734 stands out as the highest recorded sale in the past 30 days across all NFT collections, generating anticipation for a potential positive trend in the BAYC collection and the wider NFT space.</p>



<p>As the market continues to unfold, the coming weeks will shed light on whether this record-breaking sale will ignite a sustained upward trajectory for the BAYC collection and serve as a catalyst for the revival of the NFT market as a whole.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Coinbase Listing Approval Not a Guarantee: The US SEC clarifies that approving Coinbase&#8217;s S-1 listing application does not imply regulatory compliance or serve as a &#8220;talisman&#8221; for the company&#8217;s business structure.</em></li>



<li><em>Regulatory Requirements Remain: The SEC emphasizes that the approval process does not assess specific assets or provide assurance that they won&#8217;t be considered securities in the future, highlighting the ongoing legal dispute between Coinbase and the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has emphasized that approving a company&#8217;s S-1 listing application does not serve as a &#8220;talisman&#8221; and does not determine compliance with regulatory requirements. Court documents from the SEC v. Coinbase case reveal the SEC&#8217;s argument during a recent pre-motion hearing on July 13. The SEC stated that approving Coinbase&#8217;s listing in April 2021 did not signify approval of its business structure.</p>



<p>SEC attorney Peter Mancuso clarified that granting permission for a company to go public does not imply recognition of its underlying business or structure, nor does it guarantee compliance with legal regulations. Mancuso stated, &#8220;S-1 approval cannot be the company&#8217;s entire business talisman. In fact, there is no evidence that the SEC reviewed specific assets and made a specific determination assuring Coinbase that these assets would not be considered securities in the future.&#8221;</p>

<p>Previously, the SEC had accused <a href="https://coincu.com/202704-coinbase-relisted-xrp-as-market-value-jumps/">Coinbase</a> of engaging in unregistered securities offerings since 2019. Coinbase is seeking an early dismissal of the case based on several grounds, including the argument that the SEC was informed in detail about the company&#8217;s business structure and planned activities prior to its initial public offering (IPO).</p>



<p>The SEC&#8217;s clarification highlights the distinction between listing approval and regulatory compliance. While the firm obtained approval for its listing, the SEC stresses that this approval does not guarantee the legality of the company&#8217;s underlying business structure or activities. The ongoing legal dispute between Coinbase and the SEC underlines the complexity of regulatory requirements in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>



<p>As the case unfolds, it will have implications for the regulatory landscape surrounding digital assets and could potentially shape the future regulatory approach to crypto-related companies. It emphasizes the importance for companies operating in the crypto space to proactively engage with regulatory authorities and ensure compliance with existing regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<li><em>Coinbase has suspended its staking service in California, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.</em></li>



<li><em>The action comes after these states said they would request changes to those services while proceedings against those betting services proceed.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase has officially written that, on June 6, 10 US states have initiated lawsuits related to the platform&#8217;s <a href="https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/coinbase-staking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staking</a> service.</strong></h5>

<p>The vast majority of the exchange&#8217;s customers are unaffected. Still, the exchange has requested restrictions on its retail mortgage services pending the completion of proceedings in California, New Jersey, and South America. Carolina and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Four of the states – CA, NJ, SC, and WI – have required restrictions to our retail staking services before their state proceedings are complete, even though our staking services have been available safely and transparently for years.&#8221;</p>



<p>Restricting staking will not benefit local residents. It will only limit these residents from participating in and benefiting from the crypto economy. But Coinbase will follow the orders of the states during the litigation.</p>



<p>The exchange also asserts that almost all significant blockchains today rely on staking because it is open, secure, and environmentally friendly. Americans in every state deserve the same economic and technological opportunities.</p>

<p>The SEC filed a lawsuit against Coinbase last month, classifying its staking service, as well as some of the tokens it lists as securities. That same day, securities authorities in ten states began proceedings on this crypto exchange. Since then, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US has always taken action to deny all accusations of this regulator.</p>



<p><a href="https://coincu.com/202704-coinbase-relisted-xrp-as-market-value-jumps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ripple&#8217;s</a> recent partial victory when the US Court ruled that trading its XRP token on cryptocurrency exchanges did not violate securities laws has brought good news to the crypto industry and Coinbase.</p>



<p>The event is considered to weaken the SEC&#8217;s earlier charges against two exchanges, Coinbase and Binance. The community also expects a new legal framework.</p>

<p>The Fantom Foundation is actively engaging with various sources and contacts to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Multichain incident.

<p>Over the coming weeks, the foundation will announce more activities on the Opera chain to help the community and builders move forward.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, Multichain officially <a href="https://coincu.com/202911-multichain-ceo-disappears-with-user-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the Chinese police had confiscated the computer, hardware wallet, phone, and keys of CEO Zhaojun. While the project is still being &#8220;protected&#8221; by the multi-signature encryption mechanism, the server is still running on the drug account managed by Mr. Zhaojun.</p>

<p>As a result, when this CEO was arrested, the transaction signing process could not be done, leading to the project being unable to fix the recent technical vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>The project also said that all operating funds and user assets are under the control of Mr. Zhaojun and are being placed under the control of the Chinese police.</p>



<p>The team also explained that they did not disclose Mr. Zhaojun&#8217;s arrest for several weeks because of the host country&#8217;s laws. In the early days of the rumors, the team shared the force majeure situation to announce the inability to contact the CEO.</p>



<p>Multichain was hacked with a total loss of 130 million USD, negatively affecting the DeFi ecosystem on Fantom. A lot of users on Fantom were severely affected. USDC price on Fantom is currently only $0.4. Many people began to question Multichain rug-pull itself after the crises encountered.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>BlockFi&#8217;s creditors have accused the platform&#8217;s management of ignoring risk warnings to expose FTX and Alameda Research.</em></li>



<li><em>BlockFi had about $1.2 billion in assets tied to FTX and Alameda when the company declared bankruptcy.</em></li>



<li><em>Director Zac Prince is said to have dismissed the group&#8217;s concerns about lending Alameda $217 million in August 2021.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>BlockFi&#8217;s demise stemmed from the company leaders ignoring warnings about potential risks associated with FTX and Alameda Research, as revealed in documents <a href="/Users/Admin/Downloads/bf666dfd-142a-4632-aba1-83acf09fbc4a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> on July 14.</strong></h5>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/blockfi-management-dismissed-ftx-warnings-creditors-allege" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, BlockFi&#8217;s creditor committee said in a newly published report that this crypto lender executives ignored their risk management team&#8217;s repeated warnings about not granting large loans to Alameda Research.</p>



<p>The report attributed the failure of BlockFi to the fault of CEO Zac Prince and other senior executives. The creditors&#8217; findings were published on Friday.</p>



<p>The commission said that as early as August 2021, the crypto lender had a copy of Alameda&#8217;s balance sheet showing that the company relies heavily on FTT, a digital token created by FTX. Alameda&#8217;s overreliance on FTT &#8220;has raised alarm bells at BlockFi,&#8221; but Prince ignored those concerns.</p>



<p>The report quoted Prince as saying in an email that Alameda represents &#8220;the biggest/most obvious growth opportunity we have.&#8221;</p>



<p>In addition to being accused of ignoring warning signs from FTX, the commission also stated that BlockFi&#8217;s business is &#8220;fundamentally flawed&#8221; as it needs riskier investment partners to turn a profit high for customers.</p>



<p>This means that BlockFi can only do business with a few companies, such as Alameda, that can turn a profit high enough. And just a few days ago, BlockFi released its investigative report, saying that management conducted due diligence before providing loans to FTX.</p>

<p>The failed crypto lender had approximately $1.2 billion in assets tied to FTX and Alameda Research when it filed for bankruptcy in November 2022.</p>



<p>The lending platform directly cited FTX exposure as the reason for filing for bankruptcy. FTX&#8217;s FTT token-based mortgage lending has left many companies on the hook after the token price fell from more than $25 to less than $2 amid Chapter 11 filings and reporting issues.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Binance has laid off more than 1,000 employees worldwide in recent weeks.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs, which could range from 1,500 to 3,000 employees worldwide, last until the end of the year.</em></li>



<li><em>The cause is speculated to be that the world&#8217;s leading exchange is struggling in a legal battle with the SEC.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, citing a source, due to regulatory investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory challenges, cryptocurrency exchange Binance has fired more than 1,000 people employees worldwide in recent weeks.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="536" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png" alt="Binance Has Fired Over 1,000 People In Recent Weeks: Report" class="wp-image-202998" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1024x536.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-300x157.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-768x402.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-750x393.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016-1140x597.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-1016.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Has Fired Over 1,000 People In Recent Weeks: Report 19"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to sources, more than a third of Binance employees (about 8,000 people in total before layoffs) could eventually be affected by layoffs. A spokesperson for Binance confirmed the layoffs to The Wall Street Journal but did not disclose the number.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;As we prepare for the next major bull market cycle, we clearly need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we stay agile and dynamic,&#8221;</p>
<cite>The spokesperson said.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, CNBC quoted a current Binance employee familiar with the company&#8217;s plans as saying that the layoffs will eventually lay off 1,500 to 3,000 employees worldwide and that the layoffs will continue through the end of the year. Although CEO Changpeng Zhao previously shared that the company is still recruiting</p>



<p>CNBC attributed the layoffs to the US Department of Justice&#8217;s ongoing investigation into Binance, citing current employees saying the investigation could end with a consent order or an agreement on billions of dollars worth of deals. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted, adding that the exchange is &#8220;still hiring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://coincu.com/202868-binanceus-responds-to-ripples-crazy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sued</a> Binance and Director Changpeng Zhao for allegedly operating a &#8220;scam website.&#8221; Then, a lengthy Justice Department investigation into the company was also launched into its founder and chief executive officer.</p>



<p>It can be seen that Binance has taken decisive actions against the allegations to confirm the trust with users, but more or less top exchanges are still affected by the legal battle with crypto-biased regulators.</p>

<p>This groundbreaking app empowers over 4 million Shopify merchants to implement loyalty programs using blockchain technology directly from their storefronts. Powered by the Ethereum sidechain <a href="https://coincu.com/202510-polygon-unveils-proposed-upgrade/">Polygon</a>, the Web3 Rewards Tools app offers brands the opportunity to foster stronger connections with customers through NFTs and gamified experiences.</p>



<p>With the Web3 Rewards Tools app, brands can issue token-based rewards, leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology to enhance customer engagement. Additionally, businesses can tap into existing NFT collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club or CryptoPunks, allowing them to release token-gated products and offer unique incentives to their customer base.</p>

<p>Co:Create&#8217;s application aims to onboard more brands into the web3 rewards ecosystem, enabling them to leverage the power of blockchain and NFTs to create immersive loyalty experiences for their customers. While Co:Create is an innovator in this space, it&#8217;s worth noting that other platforms have also ventured into bringing web3 rewards to Shopify. In March, Try Your Best (TYB), a community engagement platform built on the Avalanche network, launched its application on the Shopify app store. This integration provided brands with the opportunity to implement NFT-based loyalty programs seamlessly within their Shopify storefronts.</p>



<p>By integrating blockchain technology into loyalty and rewards programs, businesses can unlock new possibilities for customer engagement and loyalty. The utilization of NFTs and gamified experiences adds a layer of excitement and exclusivity, enhancing brand loyalty and customer retention.</p>



<p>Co:Create&#8217;s launch of the Web3 Rewards Tools app on Shopify, powered by Polygon, signifies a significant step forward in the adoption of blockchain-based loyalty solutions. As more brands embrace the potential of web3 rewards ecosystems, we can expect to see a transformation in customer loyalty programs, providing unique and immersive experiences for shoppers.</p>
