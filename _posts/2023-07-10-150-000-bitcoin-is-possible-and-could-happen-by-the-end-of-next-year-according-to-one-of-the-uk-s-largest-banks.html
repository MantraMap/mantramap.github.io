That's what the big brains at Standard Chartered Bank are saying. Those outside of the UK may not understand exactly who that is - this bank is massive here, with 85,000+ employees and locations across the country.<br /><br />They reckon Bitcoin's price rises, miners will be stashing away more than they're selling. Throw in all the new instructional investment coming in - and you end up with a lot of buyers fighting over a very small, and shrinking supply of BTC being sold.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in April, the same bank forecasted Bitcoin could hit $100k by 2024, thinking we were out of the dreary 'crypto winter'. But now, the bank's head of crypto research, Geoff Kendrick, says there's a chance it could go beyond that.</p><p>Why's that? Well, Kendrick explains, with every Bitcoin they mine being more valuable, miners can sell fewer of them and still keep the cash flowing in. This means less Bitcoin in the market, pushing the price even higher. Simple supply and demand. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Bitcoin's had a strong year, rocketing up 80%...</b></span><br /><br />But at the current price of $30k and change, we're till a far cry from the record $69k it hit last November.</p><p>2022 was rough, with heaps of dollars wiped off the sector as central banks got tough with interest rates and big crypto names like FTX exchange crashed and burned. But surprisingly, this year's failure of some old-school banks has actually helped crypto bounce back.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: medium;">The More Bitcoin is Worth, the Less Miners Sell to Cover Costs...</span></b></p><p>The bank thinks the predicted price hike is because Bitcoin miners, who create about 900 new Bitcoins a day globally, might soon need to sell less of their stash to cover their costs - mostly the electricity needed to power their monster network of mining rigs..</p><p>According to Kendrick, miners are currently selling most of their newly minted coins. But if the price reaches $50k, they'd probably only need to sell 20-30%. So instead 900 new bitcoins hitting the market daily, only 180 to 270 would.</p><p>"Over a year, that's like reducing the number of coins miners sell from 328,500 to somewhere between 65,700 and 98,550 - meaning about 250k less Bitcoins flooding the market each year," Kendrick explains.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: medium;">250,000 Less Bitcoins For Sale Means Buyers Will Have Convince Others to Sell - That Means Offering More Money...</span></b></p><p>And in another twist, come next spring, the total number of Bitcoins that can be mined each day is set to halve. It's part of Bitcoin's in-built design to limit the supply and keep its appeal.</p><p>But let's not forget that Bitcoin has a history of wild price guesses. Back in November 2020, a Citi analyst said Bitcoin could climb as high as $318k by the end of 2022. It ended up closing that year down about 65% at $16,500. So take all these predictions with a pinch of salt.<br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: arial;">-------</span></p><div><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: arial;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;">Author:</span><span style="box-sizing: border-box; color: red; font-weight: bolder;">&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: #666666;">Mark Pippen</span><br /></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: arial;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bolder;"><span>London Newsroom<br /></span></span></span></i><i style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: arial;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; font-size: x-small; font-weight: bolder;"><span style="color: #666666;">GlobalCryptoPress</span>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/"><span style="color: #444444;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></span></i></div><p><br /></p><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
