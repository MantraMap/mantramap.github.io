<p class="s6">With Conflux (CFX) and Immutable (IMX) currently on a downtrend, investors have their gaze fixed on the new presale on the crypto block, Sparklo. In this article, we will explain why it is a better investment than Confluc (CFX) and Immutable (IMX).</p>
<p class="s6">Conflux&rsquo;s (CFX) Recent Developments Fail to Improve its Token&rsquo;s Value </p>
<p class="s6">Conflux (CFX) is a public layer-1 blockchain designed to power decentralized applications, Web3 infrastructure, and e-commerce through its decentralized, secure, and scalable protocol.</p>
<p class="s6">Conflux (CFX), dubbed China&rsquo;s Polygon (MATIC), is the country's only regulatory-compliant blockchain. Recent developments show that the blockchain has proposed to deploy Uniswap v3 on its network alongside offshore Chinese Yuan (CNH). In addition, the network also plans to join Curve Wars with its token (CFX) bridged to the Ethereum (ETH) mainnet. This proposal happened in the wake of Binance&rsquo;s announcement that it will now support Conflux (CFX) mainnet integration.</p>
<p class="s6">These moves by Conflux (CFX) are intended to attract more investors and provide more liquidity pools, which ultimately will increase the network&rsquo;s usage, worth, and value of its token, Conflux (CFX). Nevertheless, so far, the token has been beset by a downtrend in price movement. Currently valued at $0.28, its value has decreased by over 20% in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s6">Conflux's (CFX) current price movement has made investors consider Sparklo&rsquo;s presale, which comes with hopes of an uptrend price movement.</p>
<p class="s6">Immutable&rsquo;s (IMX) Downtrend Worries Investors</p>
<p class="s6">Immutable (IMX) is the first layer-two scaling solution for non-fungible tokens on Ethereum (ETH). The blockchain was designed to be an improvement on Ethereum, thereby making it more scalable, having a better user experience, and having a zero gas fee for minting and trading NFTs.</p>
<p class="s6">Gadget-Bot, a production company rumored to be developing &ldquo;Kadairo,&rdquo; a sci-fi universe, for over a decade, is bringing the game to Web3 on Immutable (IMX), which is slated for launch sometime this year. The game&rsquo;s setting is a post-apocalyptic world with battles against powerful magic users, playable in a combination of player-vs-environment and player-vs-player, and teams of three players.</p>
<p class="s6">This recent news is exciting to gamers and ultimately aims to tap into the gaming sector. However, this news currently has little to no effect on the token&rsquo;s current price, which trades at $0.95 at the time of writing after a drawback of 15% in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s8">Sparklo&rsquo;s (SPRK): A Better Investment Than Conflux (CFX) and Immutable (IMX)</p>
<p class="s6">Sparklo presale is currently believed to have better growth potential than Immutable (IMX) and Conflux (CFX) due to its unique investment model. Sparklo is a precious metals investment platform committed to offering opportunities for investment in rare metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. Investors can invest in fractionalized NFTs backed by these precious metals and not fiat or other tokens.</p>
<p class="s6">The project has been predicted to rise in value by over 2,000% in the next year, fueling investors' enthusiasm to be early adopters. With a cheap presale price of just $0.015, Sparklo is one of the better investments of 2023.</p>
<p class="s6">Lastly, and more importantly, the team has concluded its smart contract audit with the InterFi Network, is currently working on its KYC audit, and liquidity is locked for 100 years. This guarantees investment, thereby improving investors&rsquo; commitment.</p>
<p class="s6">Poised for its bull ride, Sparklo is bound for the moon, and investors are in for all of the excitement.</p>
