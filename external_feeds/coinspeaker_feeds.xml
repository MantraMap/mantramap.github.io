										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/grovetoken-healthier-planet/">GroveToken: Digital Currency Powering Healthier Planet</a></p>
<p>Every digital currency has its basic fundamentals and one of the emerging projects in the space GroveToken is aiming at making the world greener and more sustainable. The GroveToken is designed to be a different crypto project with respect to its core investments and ecosystem focus.</p>
<p>While many blockchain protocols are solely hinged toward the benefit they have to offer their community, the GroveToken project is first considerate of the impact we make on the environment, and then a sustainable value addition to its users across the board.</p>
<p>GroveToken is championing its mission to help reduce the rate of destruction on our planet by investing in many green initiatives. Through the backing of startups directly involved in the fight against climate change to enable outfits working to achieve efficient resource allocation, the GroveToken project is redefining what is possible with blockchain innovation.</p>
<p>One of the most direct ways GroveToken is championing its ecosystem growth is in the development of solar energy solutions. According to information shared with Coinspeaker, the protocol has already launched Farming Solutions back in October 2022. The project looks to bolster its engagement in education and also turn its headquarters to a green energy showroom for its eventual campaign globally.</p>
<h2>GroveToken Products and Innovations</h2>
<p>Besides its fundamental goals to save the planet, the GroveToken protocol has a number of innovative products and services that are designed to return maximal value to all of its users.</p>
<p>One of the most important products from the startup is the GroveGold (GRVG) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/stablecoins-how-manage-operate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stablecoin</a>. As described to be firm, the GRVG is backed by actual Gold Bullion and each token is equivalent to 20 milligrams of gold which at the time of writing is valued at $1,28. The GroveGold stablecoin is so designed that holders can request for actual gold to be shipped to their location on demand.</p>
<p>The GroveCoin (GRV) Token, the livewire of the ecosystem is also an indispensable product from the team. With a total supply of 100 million GRV tokens, the GroveCoin Token serves a wide range of utilities ranging from fee payment to staking innovations amongst others. The token is secured using the QBFT-Proof of Authority and it is supported on multiple blockchain protocols including Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) and BNB Chain.</p>
<p>Besides these, the GroveToken ecosystem also has its own wallet dubbed GroveKeeper, its decentralized exchange, GroveSwap DEX, its centralized counterpart, the GroveX CEX. Other products that users of the network can benefit from include its dedicated <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/#:~:text=A%20non%2Dfungible%20token%20refers,that%20are%20not%20very%20common." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Non-Fungible Token</a> (NFT) marketplace, and the Green Oasis Program, an outlet for other green projects to receive support.</p>
<h2>The Grove Team and Roadmap</h2>
<p>While the innovations surrounding the GroveToken project are worth commending, the team bringing this to life is also worth much more commendation. The Grove team is led by its Chief Executive Officer, John Ghemrawi, an enterprise innovator with years of experience.</p>
<p>Carlo Di Clemente and Nouha Elmasri are serving as the protocol’s COO and CMO respectively. The years of experience the core management team brings to the firm has helped create a highly sustainable roadmap.</p>
<p>According to the roadmap shared with Coinspeaker, the launch of GroveX and the Grove blockchain, the release of the GRVG (GroveGold) token, and the debut of the Grove Metaverse are some of the core innovations it has outlined for the rest of the year.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/abu-dhabi-free-zone-adgm-dlt/">Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Financial Free Zone ADGM Proposes Legal Framework for DLT Markets</a></p>
<p>Abu Dhabi’s crypto and blockchain businesses are expected to grow exponentially and attract international investors, more so from the United States.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/abu-dhabi-free-zone-adgm-dlt/">Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Financial Free Zone ADGM Proposes Legal Framework for DLT Markets</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/abu-dhabi-free-zone-adgm-dlt/">Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Financial Free Zone ADGM Proposes Legal Framework for DLT Markets</a></p>
<p>The registration authority of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) has issued a consultation paper seeking feedback on its proposed new framework for distributed ledger technology (DLT) market and token issuance. The regulatory authority has set Friday, May 12 as the deadline for providing feedback on the proposed legal framework. Afterward, the regulatory agency will review the feedback and later the ADGM Board of Directors will present the final form of the legal proposal.</p>
<p>The initiative comes amid the rise of the decentralized economy both in Abu Dhabi and at the international level. With the regulatory framework having jurisdictions in the international finance center within the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the authority is keen to attract investors in the decentralized market.</p>
<p>“ADGM has received interest concerning the use of ADGM foundations for DLT purposes and the issuance of non-regulated utility tokens. However, whilst foundations are inherently well suited to DLT projects, certain features and requirements within our current foundation&#8217;s regimes impose constraints that are not desirable for DLT projects,” the proposal <a href="https://www.adgm.com/documents/legal-framework/public-consultations/2023/consultation-paper-no-3/consultation-paper-no-3-of-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<h2>Dubai as a Blockchain and Crypto Hub</h2>
<p>The United Arabs Emirates has been working towards becoming a favorable investment hub for blockchain-related companies. Earlier this year, Dubai set out plans to allow crypto companies to obtain relevant operational licenses. Under the new licensing mandate, all aspiring crypto businesses in Dubai are expected to seek the approval of the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).</p>
<p>“With bespoke rules and guidelines designed to provide clarity, assure certainty, and mitigate market risks, VARA seeks to develop a model framework for global economic sustainability within an innovation-centric environment that is truly borderless, technology agnostic, and future-focused,” the regulator noted.</p>
<p>The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority issued several orders on crypto asset advertising. In this regard, the country was keen to protect investors from exploitative businesses and at the same time provide a conducive environment for technological innovation. Furthermore, blockchain technology has been developed to upgrade the traditional financial sector and meet the growing demand for fast, secure and reliable payments. Notably, the UAE is keen to attract crypto companies from the United States that are fleeing hostile takeover by the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>. For instance, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN) in its latest quest to diversify to the global market has sought after the Dubai crypto licenses.</p>
<p>Other notable crypto investors already in the Dubai market include <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs</a>. As a result, the local authority has been able to deliver on job creation and economic expansion projects.</p>
<h2>Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>The overall winner in Abu Dhabi’s blockchain adoption is Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market which has a valuation of approximately $1.2 trillion. With the European Union already pro-crypto, other global countries are expected to enact accommodative blockchain policies. As a result, next year’s halving event which brings forth a fresh crypto bull market will encompass more mainstream markets.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/procter-gamble-fiscal-q3-2023/">Procter &#038; Gamble Sees Fiscal Q3 2023 Results Beat Earnings &#038; Revenue Expectations Despite Lower Sales Volumes</a></p>
<p>On Friday, April 21, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/procter-and-gamble/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Procter &amp; Gamble</a> (NYSE: PG) <a href="https://pginvestor.com/financial-reporting/press-releases/news-details/2023/PG-Announces-Fiscal-Year-2023-Third-Quarter-Results/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> its fiscal Q3 2023 earnings, which showed the company beat estimates. The multinational consumer goods corporation’s quarterly earnings and revenue came in better than expected, with higher prices counterbalancing lower demand for its products. Following this commendable performance, P&amp;G raised its fiscal 2023 sales guidance and revenue forecast.</p>
<p>P&amp;G’s shares were up 2% in premarket trading after the company raised the organic sales growth forecast for the fiscal year to 6%. Previously, the company had put this figure between 4% and 5%.</p>
<h2>Quarterly Report Details</h2>
<p>For fiscal Q3 2023, Procter &amp; Gamble realized a revenue haul of $20.07 billion compared to the $19.32 billion analysts expected. The latest revenue intake is a 4% increase year-over-year (YoY), with organic sales also increasing by 7% in the same period. In addition, the Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant also realized earnings per share (EPS) of $1.37 versus $1.32 EPS expected. Furthermore, Procter &amp; Gamble reported a fiscal Q3 net income of $3.4 billion which outstrips the $3.36 billion the company made a year earlier.</p>
<p>However, P&amp;G sustained a decline in sales volume due to 10% higher prices that drove buyers to seek cheaper options. This is the fourth straight quarter that P&amp;G is experiencing waning sales volumes, selling fewer goods than intended.</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble CFO Andre Schulten explained a sequential increase in sales volume from the company’s fiscal second quarter. Schulten added that quarterly volume declined 2% from 2022 after P&amp;G cut back on advertising and operations. However, the CFO pointed out a significant volume increase in P&amp;G’s largest market, the US, with China on the mend. According to Schulten, the consumer goods giant’s second-largest market is in recovery mode from the pandemic-induced lockdowns.</p>
<p>All the company’s divisions, except health and beauty units, reported waning sales for fiscal Q3 2023. Procter &amp; Gamble’s fabric and home care segment suffered the steepest drop, at 5%, as volume declined mainly in Europe.</p>
<h2>Procter &amp; Gamble Head Comments on Fiscal Q3 2023 Performance</h2>
<p>Weighing in on overall fiscal third-quarter performance, Procter &amp; Gamble Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer Jon Moeller said:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We delivered strong results in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2023 in what continues to be a very difficult cost and operating environment. Our team’s strong execution of our strategies and our progress through three quarters enable us to raise our fiscal year outlook for sales growth and cash return to shareowners and maintain our guidance range for EPS growth despite continued cost and foreign exchange headwinds.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Moeller added that P&amp;G remains committed to “integrated strategies of a focused product portfolio of daily use categories.” According to him, performance fuels brand choice here, alongside productivity, superiority, constructive disruption, and a fluid organizational structure. Moeller believes that P&amp;G can leverage the strong momentum it has built and sustained to deliver balanced growth and value creation.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/twitter-high-profile-users-blue-checks/">Twitter Stripes Many High-Profile Users of Blue Checks</a></p>
<p>Yesterday was a historic day for American multinational micro-messaging platform <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter Inc</a> as it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/twitter-blue-checks-legacy-verification-removed-rcna80539" target="_blank">striped</a> its previously verified users of their Blue check marks. While the move has been tagged by many critics as a rude and dangerous precedent to set, the removal of the Blue Checks has been lauded by proponents in one of the hottest debates in the history of the social media ecosystem.</p>
<p>The removal of the Blue Checkmarks was an encompassing one, and while political leaders were affected, popular artists and influencers were largely not left behind. Among the most shocking figures who saw their Blue Ticks removed, there are <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/bill-gates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Gates</a>, Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian, and even Pope Francis all lost their badges.</p>
<p>The Badges were earlier introduced to signal authenticity of an account and it is often conferred after strict verifications. Following the takeover of Twitter in a $44 billion acquisition deal, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/elon-musk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elon Musk</a> started sharing ideas on key restructuring that will take place on the platform. One of these was the retention of the Blue Checks for paying users only.</p>
<p>“We are removing legacy verified checkmarks,” the company said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1648764138452299778" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement on Twitter</a>. “To remain verified on Twitter, individuals can sign up for Twitter Blue.”</p>
<p>Elon Musk has reiterated that he is also paying to keep his verification badge on. According to reports on Twitter at the time the check marks were being removed, some celebrities revealed that they have not subscribed to Twitter Blue, but still retains their own checkmarks.</p>
<p>Based on Musk’s tweets, he is paying to keep the verification of many celebrities on and he named three beneficiaries including Lebron James, Stephen King, and actor William Shatner.</p>
<h2>Twitter Blue Checks Removal, Innovating for Recognition</h2>
<p>Since Elon Musk took over Twitter, he has been innovating with a lot of products and services that have been distinguishing its services apart. In the pre-Elon Musk Twitter, the verification was the same for both individuals and organizations irrespective of their delegations.</p>
<p>For the Twitter Blue subscription, only individuals retain the Blue Check while organizations that subscribed to the service will be given a yellow tick. There is also a special emblem or tick that is given to government officials and it is gray in color.</p>
<p>Twitter is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/20/technology/twitter-blue-check-marks.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reportedly</a> charging $1000 monthly for the yellow checks while it has an exemption for its top 500 advertisers Additionally, the exemption can also be extended to the top 10,000 most followed companies on its platform that has been previously verified.</p>
<p>Despite the resistance and criticisms, Elon Musk believes the removal of the Twitter Blue check will serve two distinct problems. Solve the impersonation challenges on the platform while also helping the firm to raise revenue, a complimentary move to the job cuts to lower operating expenses the firm has instituted in the past.</p>

<p>BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes examines de-dollarization and its fiscal and political implications in an article titled ‘Exit Liquidity.’  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/arthur-hayes-exit-liquidity-article/">Arthur Hayes’ Exit Liquidity Article Explores America’s Position as Global Reserve Currency Issuer</a></p>
<p>Former BitMEX CEO <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/arthur-hayes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arthur Hayes</a> recently <a href="https://cryptohayes.medium.com/exit-liquidity-3052309e6bfa" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">aired his views</a> on exit liquidity vis-à-vis the US dollar’s reserve currency status. In a Medium blog post, the American entrepreneur wrote exhaustively on whether the US dollar can be replaced as the global reserve currency. Additionally, Hayes debated whether China or any other powerful nation would be willing to and capable of replacing the US as the global reserve currency issuer.</p>
<p>In his ‘Exit Liquidity’ writeup, Arthur Hayes explored suggested signs that certain “corridors of trade are de-dollarizing” and what it portends for America.</p>
<p>According to Hayes, reserve currency status poses certain benefits but also burdens the host nation with cost implications. The BitMEX co-founder identified the main benefit as “printing currency at will to pay for real goods.” However, he maintained that such primary benefit does not see equal distribution among the host nation’s citizenry.</p>
<h2>Arthur Hayes Draws Exit Liquidity Parallels between American Haves and Haves-Not in the Face of Global De-Dollarization</h2>
<p>Hayes stressed that despite America’s vaunted wealth levels, the political and military superpower’s inequality problems rank among the worst in the developed world. Furthermore, he added that this situation is worsening even though most of America’s populace, who own little financial assets, feel the brunt of the reserve currency status. According to Hayes, global de-dollarization threatens the position of American elites who have largely benefitted from global reserve currency status. However, he also fears that the majority of Americans could become ‘exit liquidity’ to their more privileged compatriots regarding capital expropriation. In Hayes’ opinion, the American financial elite would do anything to remain influential amid de-dollarization. Therefore, such drastic measures to protect their wealth could entail transmuting potential global fiscal repercussions to less illustrious citizens.</p>
<p>Hayes’ writeup showed a series of detailed charts that support his inequality argument. For instance, one visual representation showed the US as number 1 in the latest gross income inequality Gini coefficient among G7 nations. America outranked the UK, Germany, and Canada with a much higher figure of 0.434.</p>
<h2>Hayes Touches on Asia as Potential Global Reserve Currency Successor to US</h2>
<p>Hayes suggested that many believe China can replace the US as a reserve currency issuer. However, the ex-BitMEX CEO stressed that cynics remain unconvinced due to the unappealing nature of the yuan. In a world where trades are increasingly priced in dollars, Hayes opined critics might wonder what the yuan can buy. According to him, another knock on the yuan is that China’s capital account remains closed.</p>
<p>In Hayes’ opinion, these constraints pose the question of whether China actually yearns to be the new global reserve currency issuer. Furthermore, he questioned to what extent the so-called de-dollarization can induce the desire for a new global reserve currency. Lastly, former crypto business executive Hayes wrote that crypto could be critical in shaping new international financial policies. The ex-BitMEX co-founder suggested that it remains unknown how the global reserve currency saga will play out eventually. However, he is reasonably certain that in the coming years, the world will trade in several currencies instead.

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tether-mints-one-billion-usdt-stablecoins/">Tether Mints Massive One Billion USDT Stablecoins on Ethereum Extending Its Market Dominance</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/tether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDT</a>-stablecoin issuer Tether is making yet another move to extend its dominance in the $132 billion stablecoin market. Last night, Tether announced the minting of another one-billion USD-pegged token on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a> blockchain network.</p>
<p>Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino called the minting of the new stablecoins as part of replenishing its inventory. He further added that it was &#8220;an authorized but not issued transaction, meaning that this amount will be used as inventory for the next period [of] issuance requests and chain swaps&#8221;.</p>
<p>As we know, Tether&#8217;s USDT is the most dominant stablecoin in the market currently. With a market cap of $81 billion, it is also the third-largest digital asset currently in the crypto space. Although there have been allegations in the past about Tether issuing more stablecoins than the cash reserves, they aren&#8217;t proven so far. Furthermore, Tether has also managed to swiftly handle liquidity even during tough market conditions as well as the crypto winter of 2022.</p>
<p>Tether is also among the dominant stablecoin issuer on the Ethereum blockchain network. The total amount of USDT on the Ethereum blockchain network is more than 35 billion tokens. Its closest competitor is the Circle-issued USDC coins, which are less than 30 billion tokens.</p>
<h2>Does USDT Stablecoins Issuance by Tether Indicate Any Upcoming Market Trend?</h2>
<p>Smart investors often look at stablecoin supplies to predict future market trends and momentum. Some also argue that the USDT supply is indicative of the direction of movement for the Bitcoin price, or the crypto market as a whole. Simon Cousaert, a research director at The Block, <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/227529/tether-another-billion-usdt-stablecoin-ethereum" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Generally, Tether issues new USDT when they see and anticipate higher demand for it. This indicates new cash is coming into the system — generally used to buy bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>BDC Consulting also conducted correlation tests while concluding that the supply of USDT &#8220;does feature a strong and statistically significant correlation&#8221; with the bitcoin price. &#8220;The resulting model with market entries and exits timed with the USDT supply spikes yielded an ROI [return on investment] of 229%, showing that stablecoin supply data can be used in trading,&#8221; it <a href="https://bdc.consulting/insights/cryptocurrency/a-new-study-finds-that-using-usdt" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>.</p>
<p>In another development, TrueUSD stablecoin has emerged as the most used stablecoin for trading Bitcoins on the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> crypto exchange. The dominance of the TrueUSD stablecoin in <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> trading grew after Binance scrapped zero-fee Bitcoin trading promotions on March 22, except for the Bitcoin-TrueUSD. Currently, TrueUSD contributes a 50% share of Bitcoin trading volumes on <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/nyx-nft-collection-gorjs/">NYX Professional Makeup Launches NFT Collection for GORJS</a></p>
<p>NYX Professional Makeup has released a non-fungible token (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a>) collection for the world&#8217;s first beauty DAO &#8211; <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/loreal-nyx-dao-gorjs-nfts-fkwme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GORJS</a>. Tagged “Dream Vortex”, the collection features 4,150 unique NFTs curated by a group of nine artists.</p>
<h2>NYX Professional Makeup Touches on Diversity and Inclusion with New NFT Project</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nyx-professional-makeups-gorjs-launches-dream-vortex-the-beauty-daos-first-artist-nft-collection-301802644.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>, each art considers the new era of beauty, focusing on the diversities that exist therein. That is, each NFT is unique in its interpretation that beauty exists in various forms. To this end, the collection features NFTs depicting 3D avatars with different looks.</p>
<p>Speaking about the collection, Yann Joffredo, Global Brand President of NYX Cosmetics shares the plan of the firm. He said partly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re championing our community to define the future of beauty and lead the cultural conversation around what digital makeup artistry will be in Web3, the metaverse and beyond.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, NYX may have also shaped the future of creating. Firstly, the team of nine artists, in quite an unusual manner, were paid upfront stipends to develop the pieces of art. NYX has also confirmed that they will receive royalties even on all primary and secondary sales. Lastly, all nine artists will retain full ownership of their unique avatar IP. As Joffredo claims, this move will establish a digital foundation for global creators.</p>
<h2>Metaverse Goals</h2>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the latest move by NYX Professional Makeup further reinforces its metaverse and Web 3.0 ambitions. Recall that last May, the firm made a remarkable foray into the metaverse with its first-ever virtual meta-pride parade. By December, it was announcing the “House of NYX Professional Makeup” metaverse initiative. That is not to mention its GORJS DAO.</p>
<p>For the Dream Vortex NFT project, NYX has partnered with the movers and shakers of the Web 3.0 space. It teamed up with the likes of The Sandbox, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/matic-network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a>, OpenSea, QuestN, and many more. And with these strategic partnerships, NYX will be hoping to leverage its unique utilities to advance its own Web 3.0 ambition.</p>
<p>Per the press release, interested users may mint NFT passes via the OpenSea marketplace in a drop scheduled to take place on April 27, 2023. They may then burn the pass to gain access to a unique avatar from the artists&#8217; collections.</p>

<p>Prominent German automaker Volkswagen has announced plans to roll out its ID.7 EV across three continents within the next year. </p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/volkswagen-first-ev-sedan/">Volkswagen to Launch First 100% EV Sedan and to Invest $1B in China&#8217;s EV Development</a></p>
<p>Volkswagen appears set to stake its claim in China’s electric vehicle (EV) market by launching a <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/volkswagen-id7-ev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">higher-end car.</a> The German motor vehicle manufacturer also plans to invest up to $1 billion to develop electric cars in China.</p>
<p>This week, Volkswagen made the announcement at the Shanghai auto show, revealing its new “ID.7” EV sedan would launch in China this fall. The Wolfsburg-based automaker also announced that it would roll out the ID.7 in Europe simultaneously. However, customers in North America would have to wait until next year to obtain the first all-electric Volkswagen sedan.</p>
<p>In addition to electric car development, the billion-dollar Volkswagen investment will help prop up emerging Chinese auto hub Hefei. Investment in the company’s planned business center in the Chinese city underscores overall German investment in China. According to reports, German-backed investments in the country surged approximately 61% in the first quarter year-over-year (YoY). Meanwhile, China’s Ministry of Commerce said total foreign investment in the nation increased 4.9% YoY in Q1 to 408.45 billion yuan ($59.33 billion).</p>
<p>The new Volkswagen business center will launch next year with over 2,000 employees and Marcus Hafkemeyer as CEO. The incoming chief executive currently serves as the automaker’s chief technology officer in China. In a press release, the German carmaker also said the venture will be run by a new company called “100%TechCo”.</p>
<p>Volkswagen claimed that 100%TechCo could significantly cut down product and tech development time via various measures. These include taking on local suppliers during the early stages of product development, and synergizing Volkswagen’s three Chinese-based joint ventures.</p>
<h2>Volkswagen EV World Premiere</h2>
<p>Earlier in the week, Volkswagen held the world premiere of its electric sedan to great anticipation. Volkswagen Brand Board of Management member Kai Grünitz spoke glowingly of the all-electric product, <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/world-premiere-for-the-efficiency-champion-volkswagen-id7-with-a-range-of-up-to-700-km-wltp-15735" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">saying</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The ID.7 sets new efficiency standards on the basis of the modular electric drive matrix (MEB). We are targeting a range of up to 700 kilometers in accordance with WLTP. This is made possible by very good aerodynamics and by significantly increased efficiency in the areas of the powertrain and thermal management.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, Thomas Schäfer, was equally as effusive. Providing some insight into the company’s long-term electric plans, Schäfer explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>“With the ID.7, we are taking the next step in our electric offensive. The limousine offers a high level of comfort and long ranges. By 2026, we will offer the widest electric range of all manufacturers in Europe – from the entry-level model for less than 25,000 euros up to the ID.7 as the new top model within the ID. family.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Schäfer added that “[Volkswagen’s] goal is to achieve an EV share of 80% in Europe by 2030.” In conclusion, he said that “as from 2033, Volkswagen will produce only electric vehicles in Europe”.</p>
<p>Chinese-bound ID.7 sedans will be produced locally, while European and North American market vehicles will see production in Germany. Although Volkswagen did not disclose the pricing details of the EV, it said the ID.7 is for the upper mid-size class.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/binance-launchpad-open-campus-edu/">Binance Launchpad Introduces Open Campus (EDU) Token Sale</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Launchpad has </span><a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-the-open-campus-edu-token-sale-on-binance-launchpad-1d762131ed2c434fa78044ab69d6b099" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its latest Web 3.0 project billed for listing and it is dubbed the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/ieo/open-campus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Campus</a> (EDU) token. As announced by the platform, the Open Campus token sale is the 31st project where the launchpad will be floating and it is set to follow the recording of user balances as of April 23 at 00:00 UTC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being the launchpad of the world’s largest digital currency trading platform, Binance Launchpad is </span><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/league-of-kingdoms-binance-launchpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">known to support</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highly promising digital currencies. By being tagged for listing, Binance Launchpad is setting up the projects in question up for massive embrace by the millions of users profiled on the Binance Launchpad and ecosystem as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the schedule of the listing, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> exchange will record user balances for a span of 5 days beginning on April 23 which is slated to end on April 28. As the launchpad detailed, “the final BNB holding amount for each user will be determined as the average of the five days, using the Daily Average BNB Balance calculation previously announced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The EDU token powers the Open Campus ecosystem which </span><a href="https://research.binance.com/en/projects/open-campus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">aims to promote</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> educational content through monetization.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Open Campus also has an inherent mission to offer an alternative education outlet for learners irrespective of their geographical locations. While it has often been reiterated that blockchain technology can be used to revolutionize every aspect of human existence, the Open Campus is committed to changing the approach to schooling in a way that will make it rewarding for every user of its platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">World-leading user-generated app Tiny Tap is the first adopter of the Open Campus and together, the more than 9 million users it hosts can leverage the opportunities the latter presents.</span></p>
<h2><b>Binance Launchpad EDU Sale Schedule</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the Binance Launchpad schedule for the Open Campus (EDU) token sale, there will be a total of 4 stages involved in the event. The first is the Preparation period which will feature the earlier defined period between April 23 and April 28. During this period, the user’s BNB balances are recorded and used to estimate the commitment to the EDU tokens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first stage will be succeeded by the Subscription period which will take place for 3 hours on April 28 from 6:00 UTC to 9:00 UTC. At this point, users commit all or part of their BNB tokens as estimated in the prior stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 3rd stage is the Calculation period when the amount of EDU tokens receivable are estimated. Thereafter is the token distribution stage which is slated for April 28 at 10:00 UTC. According to Binance Launchpad, the EDU tokens will be transferred to every participant’s spot wallets at the 4th stage.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/gemini-open-engineering-hub-india/">Gemini to Open Engineering Hub in India, Recruit Tech Talent</a></p>
<p>United States-based cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/gemini/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gemini</a> has revealed its <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/227457/gemini-apac-ceo-india" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">plans</a> to tap into India&#8217;s pool of tech talent with the foundation of a new engineering hub in the country. In a statement by Gemini&#8217;s international chief technology officer, Pravjit Tiwana declared that the exchange is presently in the middle of launching an engineering center in Gurgaon, India. It also claimed that this would be the exchange&#8217;s second-largest engineering hub, besides the one in the United States.</p>
<p>Tiwana will be supervising the entire project and has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of Gemini Asia Pacific along with his parallel role as the Global Chief Technology Officer.</p>
<p>Gemini, which is the crypto exchange by the Winklevoss twins disclosed the development of its global engineering and operations teams. On April 20th, Gemini said that it was opening a new office in Gurgaon, India. It is the latest American crypto firm that is making a move offshore after a crackdown on the crypto space.</p>
<p>The Gemini crypto exchange is still a US-based company for now, but the regulatory crackdown has been pushing crypto firms to relocate to more favorable countries. Recently, Coinbase, which is one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, revealed its plans to open an offshore exchange in Bermuda. The decision to not move the exchange to India is probably because the cryptocurrency regulations in the country are not imposed with clarity. However, they are taking shape. In the previous month, the finance minister of India suggested the creation of a common crypto framework for G20 countries.</p>
<p>According to Tiwana, the company is actively hiring software engineers and technical product managers to work from the Gurgaon office along with other key roles like human resources, talent acquisition, finance, and support. In another statement by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the exchange has huge plans for international growth this year in APAC. The India unit is supposedly working on a wide remit, with Gemini claiming that it will develop web and mobile user experiences, and contribute to platform compliance, data pipelines, warehousing, security, and payments.</p>
<p>The hub will also design new characteristic feature sets for Gemini <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT</a> and crypto asset marketplaces. The products and features in India will be used by more than seventy countries worldwide.</p>
<p>The development follows Gemini&#8217;s disclosure on April 12th about its pre-registration filing with the Ontario Securities Commission, which is the regulator responsible for the capital markets in Canada&#8217;s most populous region. This is one of the prerequisites for crypto exchanges looking to make business in Canada and become restricted dealers in the country.</p>
