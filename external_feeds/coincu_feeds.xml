<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Vanguard Group, managing $7.2 trillion in assets, has recently invested in Bitcoin mining companies, purchasing more stock from Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital.</em></li>



<li><em>The increased stake in the cryptocurrency industry to over half a billion dollars demonstrates a significant shift in the company&#8217;s attitude towards cryptocurrencies.</em></li>



<li><em>The growing interest from major financial institutions, including BlackRock, suggests that Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world could be set for a significant period of growth and development in the coming years.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Vanguard Group <a href="https://decrypt.co/147950/vanguard-owns-560-million-bitcoin-mining-stocks" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://decrypt.co/147950/vanguard-owns-560-million-bitcoin-mining-stocks" rel="noreferrer noopener">invests </a>in Bitcoin mining, increasing stake to over half a billion dollars, marking a significant shift in attitude towards cryptocurrencies.</strong></h5>



<p>Asset manager Vanguard Group has recently increased its investments in Bitcoin mining companies, marking a notable shift in the company&#8217;s stance towards cryptocurrencies. Vanguard Group, which manages an impressive $7.2 trillion in assets, purchased more stock from Riot Platforms and Marathon Digital, increasing its stake in the industry to over half a billion dollars. </p>



<p>According to filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Vanguard Group increased its Marathon Digital holdings by a staggering 60%, from 10.9 million shares to a whopping 17.5 million.</p>

<p>Riot Blockchain, the largest crypto miner in the United States, trades on the Nasdaq as RIOT, and its stock is currently trading for $15.72 per share. Just two years ago, Vanguard Group claimed that the long-term investment case for cryptocurrencies was &#8220;weak.&#8221; However, the recent investments demonstrate a significant shift in the company&#8217;s attitude towards cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>The growth in institutional interest in cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, is becoming increasingly evident. Last week, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager with $9.5 trillion worth of assets under management, said that Bitcoin was an &#8220;international asset.&#8221; </p>



<p>BlackRock also applied to the SEC for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund last month and is the second-largest investor in Marathon Digital, with 8.6 million shares. A number of other major fund managers have also applied for a Bitcoin ETF, which has helped to send the price of the cryptocurrency to a year-high.</p>

<p>These abnormal outflows, as recorded on Debank&#8217;s platform have raised concerns within the blockchain community. Such large-scale movements of funds to a new address have sparked speculation and questions regarding the intent behind these transactions.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin price in decline, but bulls remain active above $30,000 support zone.  </em></li>



<li><em>Short-term bullish trend line forming, with support near $30,400. </em></li>

<p>However, the bulls were again active above the $30,000 support zone, which helped to mitigate some of the concerns. Despite this, the price of BTC remained in a range and made another attempt to clear $31,000 but unfortunately failed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>Looking at the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair, we can see that the recent low was formed near $30,214, which is a considerable drop from its recent high. However, the price is now moving higher, which is a good sign for investors. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $31,020 high to the $30,214 low, indicating that there may be some bullish momentum building.</p>



<p>A short-term bullish trend line is forming with support near $30,400 on the same hourly chart. This trend line suggests that there are still some investors who are optimistic about Bitcoin&#8217;s future prospects.</p>



<p>Bitcoin price is trading above $30,200 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average, which is a positive development. However, the bulls are now facing resistance near the $30,600 level, which could make it challenging for prices to rise even further.</p>

<p>The next resistance is near the $30,700 zone, which is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $31,020 high to the $30,214 low. If the price manages to <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://bitcoin.org/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">break</a> above this resistance level, it might retest $31,000, which would be a significant milestone for investors.</p>



<p>The price must settle above $31,000, and the next major resistance is near the $31,400 level. If the price manages to break through this level, it could open the doors for a move toward the $32,000 resistance zone, which would be a strong indicator of Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential.</p>

<p>The move entails the removal of all Ethereum Punks images and the deletion of tweets referencing Ethereum Punks, including the introduction of the Ethscriptions Protocol.</p>



<p><a href="https://yuga.com/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://yuga.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuga Labs</a> has been a driving force in the non-fungible token (NFT) space. The Ethereum Punks website, which showcased a collection of unique digital art pieces inspired by CryptoPunks, gained considerable attention from the crypto community. However, it appears that Yuga Labs has decided to exert control over the use of their intellectual property.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At the request of Yuga Labs, the owner of CryptoPunks, I am taking down the Ethereum Punks website, removing all Ethereum Punks images from <a href="https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS" target="_blank">https://t.co/ZcR9HKlexS</a>, and deleting my Tweets that reference Ethereum Punks, including my Tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol.</p>&mdash; Middlemarch (@dumbnamenumbers) <a href="https://twitter.com/dumbnamenumbers/status/1678563855071363074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 11, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The request from Yuga Labs has prompted the immediate removal of the Ethereum Punks website, leaving many enthusiasts and collectors surprised and disappointed. The website had served as a platform for artists and developers to showcase their own variations and interpretations of the popular CryptoPunks characters.</p>



<p>Ethereum Punks images hosted will be taken down. This move will undoubtedly impact the community of artists and collectors who had utilized the platform to monetize and display their unique creations.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="482" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-1024x482.png" alt="image 613" class="wp-image-201548" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-1024x482.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-300x141.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-768x361.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-1536x723.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-2048x964.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-750x353.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-613-1140x537.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Yuga Labs Demands Removal of Ethereum Punks Website and Content 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>the creator of Ethereum Punks has agreed to delete all tweets referencing Ethereum Punks, including the initial tweet introducing the Ethscriptions Protocol. This decision marks a clear effort to align with Yuga Labs&#8217; request and respect their intellectual property rights.</p>



<p>The exact reasoning behind Yuga Labs&#8217; request remains undisclosed. However, it is not uncommon for companies to protect their brand and maintain control over the use of their assets, particularly in the fast-evolving and competitive world of NFTs.</p>

<p>The code contains functions that would allow a central authority to freeze funds or reduce balances within the digital currency system. While the developer acknowledges potential benefits, concerns are being raised about the extent of control that a central authority would possess over users&#8217; financial transactions.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/vinibarbosabr/status/1678511772775374850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">source code</a> for the <a href="https://coincu.com/197580-brazils-mercado-bitcoin-add-cbdc-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Digital pilot project</a>, initiated by <a href="https://coincu.com/195140-brazil-enacts-new-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brazil</a>&#8216;s top bank, was <a href="https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted</a> on GitHub on July 6. The bank <a href="https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding/blob/main/arquitetura.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emphasized</a> that the project is solely intended for a test environment and that the &#8220;presented architecture&#8221; could undergo additional changes.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-1024x406.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="406" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-1024x406.png" alt="Brazil CBDC&#039;s Source Code Reveals Controversial Control Functions" class="wp-image-201561" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-1024x406.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-300x119.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-768x304.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-750x297.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618-1140x452.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-618.png 1226w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Brazil CBDC&#039;s Source Code Reveals Controversial Control Functions 12"></a></figure></div>


<p>Pedro Magalhães, a blockchain developer and the founder of tech consulting firm Iora Labs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pemagalhaes_github-ioralabsrealdigitalsmartcontracts-activity-7082009809549484032-Beqi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> to have successfully &#8220;reverse-engineered&#8221; the open-source code of Banco Central do Brazil&#8217;s Digital Real. His analysis revealed functions within the code that enable the freezing and unfreezing of accounts, adjustment of balances, transfer of funds between addresses, and creation or burning of digital currency from specific addresses.</p>



<p>The publication of the Real Digital source code prompted a public audit, catching the attention of several developers who began analyzing the code. Through reverse engineering techniques, Magalhães discovered additional functions that allow authorized entities, such as the Central Bank, to make significant changes to the CBDC&#8217;s ledger data, directly impacting its users.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>These functions include the ability to freeze and unfreeze specific accounts, increase or decrease financial balances of frozen accounts, move digital currency coins between chosen addresses, and create or burn coins at specific addresses. Magalhães&#8217;s findings have been corroborated by other developers who have examined the Real Digital source code.</p>



<p>When questioned about the discovered functions, the Central Bank acknowledged their existence and stated that similar functionalities are already present in current systems such as SPB and Pix, subject to legal and regulatory governance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4-1024x683.jpg" alt="Brazil CBDC&#039;s Source Code Reveals Controversial Control Functions" class="wp-image-201550" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4-750x500.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/EO3HI63MRNAHZG26UQVS3OG7H4.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Brazil CBDC&#039;s Source Code Reveals Controversial Control Functions 13"></a></figure></div>


<p>While concerns have been raised within the cryptocurrency community regarding CBDCs potentially infringing on financial freedom and privacy, Magalhães offered a different perspective. He highlighted the traceability of taxes as a potential benefit, enabling the public to inspect the allocation of tax funds. Additionally, he mentioned the possibility of scrutinizing state purchases on-chain, leading to enhanced transparency in parliamentary amendments.</p>



<p>Fabio Araujo, an economist at the <a href="https://coincu.com/190038-brazils-central-bank-cbdc-institutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Central Bank of Brazil</a>, expressed that the Digital Real has the potential to address bank runs and create a safer and more reliable environment for entrepreneurial innovation.</p>



<p>The Digital Real pilot project is reportedly operating on Hyperledger Besu, a privately operated Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain. As it is not permissionless like the Bitcoin or Ethereum mainnets, users would require the central bank&#8217;s approval to become a node, as highlighted by Magalhães.</p>



<p>The unveiling of these control functions in the CBDC source code has ignited discussions about the balance between control and transparency in central bank digital currencies, raising questions about the implications for financial autonomy and privacy within the digital realm.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The giant whale sent 141,835 BNB (worth around $35 million) to Binance through 4 addresses.</em></li>



<li><em>Predictions suggest whales may be preparing to participate in the upcoming Arkham token sale (ARKM).</em></li>



<li><em>Yesterday, Binance announced that it will conduct a public Arkham (ARKM) token sale on its launch pad.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Binance announced that Arkham (ARKM) will become the 32nd project to sell tokens on its launch platform, prompting whales to enter a &#8220;predator&#8221; state.</strong></h5>



<p>Lookonchain tracking shows that 3 hours ago, a giant whale sent 141,835 BNB (worth around $35 million) to Binance via 4 deposit addresses.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Lookonchain speculates that whales may be involved in the Arkham (ARKM) token sale. Since the buy limit is 300,000 ARKM, the whale deposited BNB into 4 Binance accounts to buy more ARKM.</p>



<p>On July 10, news from the on-chain platform Arkham surprised the crypto community with the announcement that it would have its own token and open it for sale on Binance Launchpad.</p>



<p>Soon after, the official <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/introducing-the-arkham-arkm-token-sale-on-binance-launchpad-6ad1921b56fb4b369f9cf3e4449e62e2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement</a> from Binance about the detailed ARKM token sale was also given. Has a total hard cap of $2.5 million. Each user is capped at $15,000, which equates to 300,000 ARKM tokens. The total token supply for Arkham is 1 billion ARKM, of which Binance Launchpad has been allocated 50 million. This allocation represents 5% of the total supply.</p>

<p>Starting on July 11th at 00:00 UTC, Binance will initiate a six-day monitoring period to record users&#8217; BNB balances. Each user&#8217;s final BNB holdings will be calculated as the average value of their balance over the course of these six days.</p>



<p>BNB price has had a clear increase from $231 to $244 after the announcement of the launchpad for Arkham&#8217;s ARKM token. Currently BNB is trading at $247 up 6% over the past 24 hours.</p>



<p>Arkham Intelligence is a well-known on-chain data delivery platform in the cryptocurrency industry, with over 200,000 users as of June 2023. The project once raised $ 10 million for 20% of the total ARKM token supply, at a valuation of $ 150 million.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Find Satoshi Lab introduces Gas Hero, a Web3 MMO game set in a post-apocalyptic world.</em></li>



<li><em>&#8220;Shape the Legends, Share the Glory&#8221; competition launched, allowing community members to design Genesis Heroes NFTs and win creator royalties and GMT tokens.</em></li>



<li><em>Gas Hero emphasizes social interaction, refined user experience, and player involvement before the game&#8217;s release, signaling a shift in Web3 gaming.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Web3 development studio Find Satoshi Lab (FSL), renowned for creating popular projects like StepN, MOOAR NFT marketplace, and DOOAR decentralized trading platform, has <a href="https://twitter.com/GasHeroOfficial/status/1678403803375083521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> its latest creation: Gas Hero, a highly anticipated massively multiplayer online (MMO) game.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="450" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611.png" alt="StepN Creator Unveils Gas Hero, A New Web3 MMO Game" class="wp-image-201530" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611.png 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-611-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="StepN Creator Unveils Gas Hero, A New Web3 MMO Game 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>To mark the game&#8217;s upcoming release, <a href="https://coincu.com/191213-find-satoshi-lab-to-launch-ai-nft-generator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FSL</a> has launched the &#8220;Shape the Legends, Share the Glory&#8221; competition, inviting community members to design their own versions of the game&#8217;s NFTs, known as Genesis Heroes. The competition offers participants a chance to win two percent creator royalty fees and a portion of the game&#8217;s utility token, GMT.</p>



<p>In each phase of the competition, 20 winners will be selected for each codename, resulting in a total of 320 winners per phase and 960 winners overall. Prizes include Genesis Hero NFT trading royalties, GMT tokens, and a co-branded Gas Hero and FSL t-shirt. The winning designs will also be prominently featured on the official Gas Hero website.</p>



<p>This competition marks a significant shift in Web3 gaming, emphasizing the active involvement of players even before the game&#8217;s official launch.</p>



<p>While details about Gas Hero are still largely under wraps, the game&#8217;s name does not refer to the crypto industry term &#8220;gas,&#8221; which typically denotes network transaction fees. Instead, Gas Hero is set to be a strategic and socially-oriented Web3 game, immersing players in a post-apocalyptic world where they construct virtual bases and engage in battles against other players.</p>

<p>Mitali Manghani, a representative from FSL, highlighted the social aspects of the game, noting that players will be incentivized to interact with one another to gain advantages such as power, fame, and monetary rewards. FSL places great importance on refining the game&#8217;s user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) to ensure engaging and immersive gameplay.</p>



<p>Gas Hero follows the success of FSL&#8217;s previous gaming venture, <a href="https://coincu.com/181437-binance-futures-delisting-stepn-near/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">StepN</a>, which recently made waves as the first blockchain gaming app to integrate <a href="https://coincu.com/189045-stepn-incorporates-apple-pay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Pay</a>.</p>



<p>The competition spans three phases over three months, running from July 10 to October 9. The initial phase, concluding on August 8, challenges participants to submit designs for a pre-selected list of character codenames, including Ape Commander, Ascetic Monk, Combat Queen, Lone Werewolf, and more.</p>

<p>Gas Hero&#8217;s lore revolves around a dystopian future set in the year 2084, where a rogue AI triggers a nuclear strike. In response, the United Nations establishes Operation Spark, leading to the creation of the &#8220;Gas Heroes.&#8221; In the game&#8217;s science-fiction world, &#8220;gas&#8221; refers to the natural gas powering the cloning labs.</p>



<p>While Gas Hero is currently in development, the game will utilize StepN&#8217;s GMT token upon launch and will offer its own marketplace. Additionally, Gas Hero will incorporate player voting mechanisms for decentralized decision-making within the game.</p>



<p>As the Gas Hero community eagerly awaits the game&#8217;s release, the Shape the Legends, Share the Glory competition stands as a testament to FSL&#8217;s commitment to community engagement and the evolving landscape of Web3 gaming.</p>
