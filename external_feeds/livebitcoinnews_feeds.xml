										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Tamil of Pro Chain Capital fame believes <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/us-home-prices-are-poised-to-tumble-while-bitcoin-may-surge-to-50000-by-december-crypto-investor-says/ar-AA1dFoqg">that bitcoin is going</a> to reach $50K by the end of the year. He also thinks that home and real estate prices are going to come crashing down.</p>
<h2>Will Real Estate Be in a Weaker State?</h2>
<p>The latter shouldn’t be surprising to anyone. After all, Joe Biden – the present commander-in-chief – has done nothing of value since entering the White House and has instilled extremely weak economic policies and signed his name to multiple trillion-dollar spending bills that have caused America to fall to its knees repeatedly.</p>
<p>As a result, the Fed has consistently been forced to hike rates, thus causing things like real estate and cars to suddenly be inaccessible to citizens across all 50 states. When things are not affordable, the companies that produce these “things” are forced to take immediate action so they can garner the funds they need to stay afloat. One of the biggest actions, often, is lowering prices.</p>
<p>Think about it… If nobody’s buying your product, wouldn’t you first try lowering the price to see if that gets customers in the door? You can bet this is going to happen with real estate, as home sellers will need some way to contend with today’s out-of-control interest rates.</p>
<p>But while this may be the poor end of the stick, the good end – in his opinion – is that bitcoin will be on the rise, largely because many people are not viewing former investment opportunities in the same light.</p>
<p>While real estate has always been considered a solid way to become rich and stay wealthy in this country, if homes aren’t accessible or are more expensive than normal, those looking to invest will need new ways of stabilizing their money, and BTC – which has currently been on a bull run and has taken on a stronger “safe haven” status – may seem like a solid alternative. Tamil, in an interview, stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is going to crush some very interest-rate sensitive industries such as real estate. I think we&#8217;re going to see a multi-year, maybe decade-long fallout, first on commercial, and then we will eventually get to housing.</p></blockquote>
<p>For bitcoin to shoot up to $50K by the end of 2023, it would need to experience a price spike of more than 65 percent, and at this stage, it only has about four months to do so. Still, as we’ve seen in the world of bitcoin, practically anything is possible.</p>
<h2>BlackRock Could Help</h2>
<p>Tamil further commented that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/blackrock-etf-application-causes-btc-eth-to-surge/">companies like BlackRock</a> – which currently has a bitcoin spot ETF application circulating – will likely help the asset along and assist in it reaching the stated price. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is going to be a tectonic shift for the use of cryptocurrencies to go ahead and represent ownership of assets.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s believed Gen Z will make a huge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briannahonkawadestries/2023/07/10/gen-z-could-completely-change-the-bitcoin-market-heres-how/?sh=2b479ab1666d">difference in how bitcoin</a> works and operates in the coming years.</p>
<h2>Gen Z Are the Real Crypto Hounds</h2>
<p>This makes sense given the digital currency industry has been taken to largely by young people. Most of the time, it’s standard financial tools – such as stocks and precious metals – that are enjoyed by older generations, though it’s Gen Z and millennials that largely grew up during the days of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/great-recession/">Great Recession</a>. They likely saw their parents lose their jobs, their homes, their retirements, etc., and they have grown to become very non-trusting of standard banks and institutions.</p>
<p>Thus, they have turned their attention to bitcoin and the digital currency arena, and they see it as more democratic than anything that has emerged over the past several years (or even centuries). Per a new report by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the youngest adult generation presently has more than $360 billion in disposable wealth and income to its name, and they are allegedly investing in BTC and in related assets given that these arguably stand most in line with their values.</p>
<p>Autumn Domingo is the co-founder of a company called Generation Bitcoin. The idea is that Gen Z is “very supportive of one another,” and the firm gives them the chance to learn all they can about the world’s number one digital currency and use it to keep each other stable and connected. She explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are very inclusive and have a respect and a mindset that everyone is truly equal. I think that is a huge part of bitcoin’s principles… Bitcoin is about freedom. It’s about taking your future and your life into your own hands. That is something Gen Z respects and will want.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ella Hough – a project manager with the company – also threw her two cents into the mix, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is inclusive of every human on the planet.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority stated not too long ago that close to one-fifth (about 19 percent) of Gen Z members are heavily invested in crypto or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Domingo commented on this and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is exciting for teens because it&#8217;s new. Just like Gen Z uses Instagram now and isn’t excited about Facebook anymore, cryptocurrencies are like Instagram. Stocks, bonds, and other investments are like Facebook to us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hough then went on to say that young people still have a lot to learn when it comes to crypto:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gen Z often thinks you [need] to buy the whole coin. It would be nice, if this doesn’t already exist, for exchanges to perhaps list bitcoin in sats.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Making Some Fast Money</h2>
<p>Ishaana Misra – a Gen Z Bitcoin Core developer – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Typically, Gen Z has been very interested in fast ways of making money.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Changpeng Zhao – the man behind Binance, the world’s largest and most popular digital currency exchange – has announced <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/08/binance-ceo-reveals-when-huge-crypto-price-bull-run-could-hit-after-27-trillion-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-and-xrp-bombshell/?sh=1d28af63bb02">that he thinks 2025 will</a> likely be the year in which bitcoin reaches a new high and goes through a bull run like nobody has ever seen.</p>
<h2>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao on BTC&#8217;s Future</h2>
<p>This is very similar to an article that <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-bitcoin-will-reach-60k-next-year-a-new-high-in-2025-and-drop-in-2026/">recently published</a>. In that article, it was suggested (as an opinion, of course) that 2024 would be the year in which bitcoin likely hits its $60K price from 2021 again. From there (the following year), it would surge beyond what anybody thinks possible, and then it would crash in 2026.</p>
<p>That is the pattern that bitcoin has seemingly taken on every four years or so, and it’s likely Zhao himself agrees with all this sentiment given he’s offering similar takes on the trends and journeys of the bitcoin price. He is also dismissing any sort of threat that standard financial companies like BlackRock might currently pose to Binance, citing the company’s size and stamina as its two biggest components. He stated in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The year after [a] bitcoin halving is usually the bull year.</p></blockquote>
<p>2024 is currently slated to be the next halving period for bitcoin, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap. A halving is when the rewards for bitcoin miners are literally cut in half, thus making it so that fewer units are placed in circulation or given out to miners that solve the complex math equations that result in BTC being placed in circulation.</p>
<p>This causes the asset to become rarer, boosting its status a bit more in the future. Discussing how he thinks BTC will move in the coming months and years, Zhao stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I see a lot of parallels with bitcoin&#8217;s past cycles with bitcoin&#8217;s 2013, 2017, and 2021 bull markets. If you look to the past, there are clear patterns.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also stated that one of the reasons he’s not threatened by BlackRock is because he thinks what it’s trying to do with its <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/blackrock-etf-application-causes-btc-eth-to-surge/">current ETF application</a> is “hugely beneficial” to the crypto market. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anyone who’s coming into crypto that’s not in crypto today will bring additional people into crypto. Will they compete for any of the existing users with us? Yes, probably a little bit, but to be honest, look at our user base. The overlap is minimal.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The SEC is Coming!</h2>
<p>Right now, the biggest problem for Binance has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">arrived in the form</a> of a lawsuit initiated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>The financial agency is suing the exchange for allegedly violating securities laws and for potentially commingling customer funds with those of the firm, thus taking a page right out of the FTX playbook.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite a solid rally in the week prior, mid-July saw bitcoin experience <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-rally-falters-as-more-turmoil-rates-present-headwinds/ar-AA1dA2aO">something of a dip in</a> its price. It fell to about $30K even after several weeks of trading above $31,000 per unit.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Endured a Few Slips</h2>
<p>The crypto market experienced a few nasty hits, such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) being dramatically sold off. Many major collections saw their prices slouch as more and more individuals begin to question whether these assets are worth anything at all. Pixelated art has always been up in the air, but now the value is really starting to be seen as non-existent by some. Could this be the end of what was once a billion-dollar+ industry just three years ago?</p>
<p>But while bitcoin and many other assets experienced price slumps, not all the analysts out there are worried. There are several that seem to believe things are not only in good shape, but that slight corrections like these are healthy for the industry. Bendik Schei of K33 explained in a recent note:</p>
<blockquote><p>After Bitcoin’s massive 14 percent gain last week, the market took a healthy hiatus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also, the bitcoin slump could potentially be contributed to the Federal Reserve again hiking borrowing costs following private payroll data showing things being much better than initially anticipated. Wall Street is now beginning to see bitcoin and many other assets in a whole new light according to Matt Maley, the chief marketing strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. He explained in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Higher rates are having an impact. The bulls were already disappointed that bitcoin couldn’t break out after the euphoria surrounding the BlackRock ETF filing. So, this recent jump in interest rates is throwing salt on the wound of those bulls.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stephane Ouellette – chief executive of FRNT Financial Inc – also threw his two cents into the mix, commenting:</p>
<blockquote><p>Any speculators will be less incentivized to move up the risk curve as capital is generally more expensive. That said, blockchain data tells a clear story of the dominant investor profile in BTC being a long-term holder, which tend to be less sensitive generally to macro factors.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the problems right now is we have several crypto firms suing other crypto firms, thus resulting in market turmoil and shakiness. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/gemini/">Gemini</a> Trust Co., for example, is suing Digital Currency Group Inc. and its chief executive Barry Silbert, claiming the company took part in “fraud and deception” after Gemini garnered hold of several frozen funds from the company.</p>
<h2>Not Worth One&#8217;s Time or Money?</h2>
<p>Michael Rosen – chief investment officer at Angeles Investments – said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have long believed that these private cryptocurrencies fall somewhere between a delusion, a fraud, and a scam. It’s somewhere in there. So, I have no idea why anyone is involved in these things.</p></blockquote>

<li>Bitcoin cash price started a fresh decline below the $220 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below the $200 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $220 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to move down if it stays below the $200 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is declining below the $200 zone against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-below-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could extend losses if there is a close below $165.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price remained in a bearish zone below the $240 and $235 resistance levels. BCH traded below the $220 support level to move further into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>There was a clear move below the $200 zone. The bears were able to flush the price toward the $165 support. A low is formed near $164 and the price is now consolidating losses. Immediate resistance is near the $200 level. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $237 swing high to the $164 low.</p>
<p>The next key resistance is near the $220 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-bears-in-charge-below-250/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $220 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
<p>The trend line is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $237 swing high to the $164 low. Any more gains above $220 could set the pace for a move toward the $240 level. If there is a move above the $240 resistance, the price could rise toward the $250 zone.</p>
<p>If not, the price might continue lower below $170. Immediate support on the downside is near the $165 zone. The next major support is near the $162 level, below which the bears might aim for $150 or even $145.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is hoping to become next year’s democratic presidential nominee and thus beat out the present holder of that title Joe Biden.</p>
<h2>Robert Kennedy Loves Bitcoin</h2>
<p>At the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/presidential-hopeful-robert-kennedy-jr-appeared-at-this-years-miami-btc-conference/">Miami Bitcoin Conference</a> last May, Kennedy assured the crowd that he wasn’t an investor in bitcoin, though he touted all its benefits and the great technology behind it. He stated to attendees:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am not an investor, and I am not here to give investment advice.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, a little digging into his financials reveals that while he <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/rfk-jr-touted-bitcoin-but-said-he-wasnt-an-investor-financial-records-show-otherwise/ar-AA1dzryF">may not have ever invested</a> in bitcoin, his family potentially has. His financial disclosures, which were filed in late June of this year, show an account that one point, held as much as $250,000 worth of bitcoin.</p>
<p>According to Kennedy’s campaign manager, however (former democratic representative Dennis Kucinich), this investment occurred long after he gave the speech to the group in Miami, and the crypto was purchased by Cheryl Hines, the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress who’s also Kennedy’s wife. Kucinich said:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no conflict here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite never allegedly investing in bitcoin before, Kennedy has always been <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-has-big-plans-for-the-crypto-space/">there to tell the world</a> what a great tool it allegedly is. Last June, he tweeted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and the manipulation of our money supply; it points the way toward a future in which government institutions are more transparent and more democratic.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Kennedy campaign has recently mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investments were not his, but his wife&#8217;s. He is not involved in her investment decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Still, it wasn’t mentioned how long the money had been held by Hines. Virginia Canter – the chief ethics counsel for watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington – commented that while the money may indeed belong to Kennedy’s wife and not to him, this still raises serious questions and could wind up causing problems for his campaign. She mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under a traditional conflict of interest analysis, Hines&#8217; financial interests are imputed to him. I&#8217;m really concerned that he&#8217;s speaking at this conference [and] touting this investment to potential voters while the family has a history of owning bitcoin. It&#8217;s like he could do the same thing for Procter and Gamble. There&#8217;s no difference in my mind from a conflicts perspective.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BTC Held By His Family?</h2>
<p>Kennedy has a non-profit called Children’s Health Defense that also accepts bitcoin donations. Last April and May, he tweeted the following messages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this bubble invariably bursts… Cryptocurrencies, led by bitcoin, along with other crypto technologies are a major innovation engine. It is a mistake for the U.S. government to hobble the industry and drive innovation elsewhere… Bitcoin has been a lifesaver for people&#8217;s movements around the world.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s been a lot of talk about crypto tax cheats over the last few years, and according to a new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the problem <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/bitcoin-tax-evasion-t-stopped-191900450.html">doesn’t end with anti-money</a> laundering laws. The organization feels more steps are needed if things are going to come to a complete stop.</p>
<h2>The IMF Details Crypto Tax Evasion</h2>
<p>The big concern is that crypto is primarily being used by illicit players who garner money that’s not theirs (or that stems from illegal transfers or activities) to launder funds. The fiat arrives in one’s hands, and then they use a crypto mixer or similar tool to hide the profits, none of which are ever reported on their tax returns. It’s money laundering and tax evasion rolled up into one big, combinatory ball of filth and criminality.</p>
<p>The IMF report includes a disclosure saying that while this is simply an opinion, there are allegedly tens of billions of dollars out there going unreported on tax forms that support the authors’ claims. The individuals who wrote the report say they’re not there to provide policy ideas regarding what to do next. Rather, they’re there to shed light on the illicit goings-on and to guide present laws in new directions. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether crypto withers or blossoms, the tax system still needs to deal with it. The first step for governments, nonetheless, is to apply AML rules and third-party reporting requirements where they can.</p></blockquote>
<p>The paper <em>does</em> say that certain things have changed “for the better” over the past couple of years. For example, it’s estimated that a global 20 percent capital gains tax initiated in 2021 was responsible for the reporting of an additional $300 billion in crypto-related transactions.</p>
<p>Still, the IMF authors say present know your customer (KYC) tactics just aren’t doing the jobs they should be doing, and they’re not enough to put everyone on an honest path. The authors write:</p>
<blockquote><p>KYC rules might enable the authorities to know, for instance, that some individual cashed out a certain amount of cryptocurrency, but from the transactions prior to that recorded on the blockchain it will not be possible, without further information, to identify any associated capital gain or loss.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Use the Blockchain?</h2>
<p>One of the things they suggest is the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> (which supports all the world’s digital currency transactions) be directly utilized by tax authorities given how transparent it can be. The blockchain is designed to share information in real-time, thus allowing users and practically anyone from around the world to look at the information contained therein anytime they wish. The writers said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Overcoming pseudo-anonymity is the core problem that tax administrations are now trying to address. In the old days, the tax authorities’ problem was that it knew who you were, but not your income.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading fiat-to-crypto firm Ark Fi is introducing Ramp, a <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/pressreleases/23/07/ab33103238/ark-fi-launches-ramp-a-new-platform-to-buy-cryptocurrency-with-credit-or-debit-cards">secondary platform that</a> will allow customers to purchase digital assets with their credit cards.</p>
<h2>Ramp Will Make Crypto Buying Easy</h2>
<p>The whole idea of purchasing bitcoin and its altcoin cousins should be easy. One pulls out their credit card, enters the information, and done! The money should be transferred to their digital wallet for use and investment purposes. Unfortunately, there are some companies out there that make things more complicated than they need to be.</p>
<p>This is rough for many reasons, a big one being that digital currency was designed to be accessible to all. If there are individuals out there that cannot access crypto, then the network and the system has failed, and they will not be able to take advantage of the benefits available to them. Thus, they are stuck in a traditional world of finance where third parties and middlemen have more say over their money than they do.</p>
<p>The big thing about Ramp is it offers a wide array of crypto including bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Binance Coin, and others. In addition, the platform charges low fees and is compliant with all present financial regulations (so users can rest assured the SEC probably won’t come after the firm anytime soon).</p>
<p>Lastly, KYC (know your customer) protocols are not in place for most transactions, meaning the buys should be quick and painless for most, and there are no lock periods, so the money can be used right away if need be. The CEO of Ark Fi – a person simply known as “Atlas” – explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited to launch Ramp and make it easier for consumers to buy cryptocurrency. Ramp is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to get started in decentralized finance, despite the recent restrictions by some banks and centralized exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>While talking, he threw in his two cents regarding the digital currency lawsuits against both <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a>. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We believe these restrictions are misguided. Cryptocurrency is a legitimate asset class, and consumers should have the freedom to buy and sell it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the payment methods that Ramp accepts are credit and debit cards, Astro Pay, Neteller, and Skrill. It also boasts a user-friendly interface, meaning those with little to no crypto-buying experience shouldn’t find the platform too difficult to operate. The company also offers 24/7 customer service to help users with any issues they should encounter (a real clincher considering <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-lagging-customer-service-is-hurting-the-crypto-space/">how many crypto firms</a> have gotten rid of their customer service departments).</p>
<h2>A Proud Addition to the Industry</h2>
<p>Atlas concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are committed to providing consumers with a safe and easy way to buy cryptocurrency. Ramp is the perfect solution for anyone who wants to quickly get started in the crypto world.</p></blockquote>

<li>EOS price started a fresh decline from the $0.730 zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.70 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.6720 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.672 and $0.700 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>EOS price is struggling below $0.700 against the US Dollar, unlike <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-below-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. The price might attempt to recover if there is a clear move above $0.672.</em></p>
<h2>EOS Price Analysis</h2>
<p>In the past few days, EOS price saw a fresh decline from the $0.730 resistance against the US Dollar. The price traded below the $0.72 and $0.70 levels to move into a bearish zone.</p>
<p>The pair even spiked below the $0.650 support. A low is formed near $0.6140 and the price is now consolidating losses. EOS is trading well below $0.700 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/eos-price-analysis-bears-aim-for-0-65-or-lower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.642 level.</p>
<p>The 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7302 swing high to the $0.6140 low is also near $0.642. The first major resistance is near the $0.672 level.</p>
<p>There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.6720 on the 4-hour chart of the EOS/USD pair. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7302 swing high to the $0.6140 low.</p>
<p>A clear move above the $0.672 level could start a steady increase toward the $0.70 level. The next major resistance might be $0.732. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.78 level.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near $0.625. The next key support is near the $0.615 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.615 support, the price could test the $0.60 support in the near term.</p>

<p>Looking at the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/EOSUSD/">chart</a>, EOS price is now trading below the $0.700 level and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). Overall, the price could continue to decline if it stays below the $0.672 and $0.700 resistance levels.</p>
