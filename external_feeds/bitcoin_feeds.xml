<h2>Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill Slams Common BRICS Currency Idea</h2>
<p>British economist Lord Jim O&#8217;Neill shared his view on the proposed single BRICS currency in an interview with the Financial Times this week. The BRICS leaders are set to meet at the economic bloc’s 15th summit on Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg. South Africa is the host of the BRICS summit this year. However, there are mixed reports on whether the creation of a common BRICS currency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">will be discussed</a> at the summit.</p>
<p>O’Neill, a former Goldman Sachs economist, coined the acronym BRIC over 20 years ago to describe the economic potential of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. South Africa joined the group a few years later, and the acronym was changed to BRICS. O’Neill is now a senior adviser at U.K. think tank Chatham House.</p>
<p>The economist asserted that the BRICS nations had “never achieved anything since they first started meeting” eight years after he created the phrase in a 2001 research note. He believes that a common currency for the BRICS economic bloc would be unfeasible, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s just ridiculous … They’re going to create a BRICS central bank? How would you do that? It’s embarrassing, almost.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Quite what they attempt to achieve beyond powerful symbolism, I don’t know,” he opined.</p>
<p>In June, Lord O&#8217;Neill similarly <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">described</a> the idea of a single currency for the BRICS nations as “ridiculous” and “amusing.” He stressed that “China and India never agree on anything,” pointing out that the two countries “can’t even really agree on basic things like a peaceful border.”</p>
<h2>U.S. Dollar Could Lose Its Dominance, Lord O&#8217;Neill Warns</h2>
<p>The British economist also commented on the dominance of the U.S. dollar, emphasizing that the USD’s dominant position in the global financial system is not beneficial for emerging countries. He described:</p>
<blockquote><p>The dollar’s role is not ideal for the way the world has evolved. You’ve got all these economies who live on this cyclical never-ending twist of whatever the [U.S. Federal Reserve] decides to do in the interests of the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some economists have predicted that other currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, or the euro, would eventually overtake the U.S. dollar. However, O’Neill cautioned: “None of these things will ever happen until those countries want to have their currencies used by people in other parts of the world.”</p>

<p>The former Goldman economist noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s a good job for the West that China and India never agree on anything, because if they did the dominance of the dollar would be a lot more vulnerable.</p></blockquote>
<p>In June, Lord O&#8217;Neill also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-dollar-will-lose-dominant-status-china-and-india-could-play-key-role-in-currency-shift-says-economist-lord-oneill/">warned</a> that the U.S. dollar will lose its dominant status as the world’s reserve currency. He expects the Chinese yuan and possibly the Indian rupee to become “much more important currencies for the world.&#8221; He stressed: “I do think if China and India could ever strongly agree on things as the two biggest countries in the emerging world … then that would probably hasten the end of the dollar’s dominance.&#8221;</p>

On Friday, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers complained to a judge in Manhattan that the currently proposed preparation time and regime for his case is “inadequate.”</strong></p>
<h2>SBF Seeks Daily Meetings With Lawyers at Courthouse and Laptop With Internet</h2>
<p>Disgraced crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried is asking to be allowed to leave the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York, five days a week in order to meet with the members of his defense team at the federal courthouse in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The request comes just days after the 31-year-old founder and former chief executive of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">jailed</a> in the MDC based on allegations of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sam-bankman-fried-seeks-to-avoid-jail-denies-witness-tampering-in-ftx-case/">witness tampering</a> ahead of his trial scheduled to begin Oct. 2, Bloomberg and Reuters reported.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the former billionaire, who was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the U.S. about a month after FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in mid-November, had been living under house arrest at his parents’ home in California on a $250 million bond which was revoked.</p>

<p>In a letter to U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan, his lawyers described as “entirely inadequate” the conditions under which SBF is expected to prepare for his trial. They said that giving him just two days a week to review the large volume of evidence violated his right to effective counsel and pointed he has no dedicated computer or way to share materials with them online.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors had offered to load documents onto hard drives that Bankman-Fried could use on computers at the MDC. According to the government, however, it’s not feasible to load all the documents onto an internet-enabled laptop. In a letter to Kaplan, the prosecutors also insisted that SBF had been offered “extraordinary accommodations” at the Brooklyn jail.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried has been accused of misappropriating funds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> customers worth billions of U.S. dollars. He allegedly used the stolen money to finance his Alameda Research hedge fund, buy expensive property and make <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankman-fried-donated-100-million-of-ftx-money-to-politicians-prosecutors-claim/">political donations</a>. He has pleaded not guilty. Next week, he will be arraigned on an amended indictment with seven fraud and conspiracy charges.</p>

<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Holesky Set to Replace Goerli Testnet in 2023</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1692283671481573538?s=20">reported</a> by Tim Beiko, a core developer, during the Ethereum <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DyAtbK2MQG4?feature=share">Execution Layer Meeting 168</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/parithosh_j">Parithosh Jayanthi</a> shared an update on the recently launched devnet-8. Beiko mentioned that while some clients faced challenges, most have been addressed or are being fixed. Notably, Lighthouse encountered a problem due to nplex support removal – an issue they plan to resolve.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Beiko <a href="https://twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1692284398312538144?s=20">revealed</a> that Ethereum JS rectified a bug related to multiple &#8220;forkChoiceUpdated calls&#8221; during block production. Pre-launch glitches in Geth and Nethermind were identified and corrected. The Ethereum developer also stated that the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s Devops team joined forces with <a href="https://twitter.com/KurtosisTech">Kurtosis Tech</a> for pre-launch testing and anticipates utilizing it in augmenting test scenarios.</p>
<p>The developer also emphasized that Besu and Erigon have not yet participated in the devnet but plan to once their respective implementations are finalized. Alongside these discussions, Ethereum developers aim to unveil a new testnest called <a href="https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky">Holesky</a> in mid-September. Intended to foster development, an abundance of testnet coins will be introduced to the testing layer.</p>

<p>Core developers agreed to incorporate 1.6 billion Holesky testnet ether.

<h2>U.S. Judiciary Designates Tornado Cash as &#8216;Person&#8217; in OFAC Case</h2>
<p>In a legal face-off with the U.S. government, specifically the OFAC, the plaintiffs posited that Tornado Cash is simply decentralized software. On the contrary, the government viewed it as an organization facilitating cryptocurrency mixing. Central to the dispute was whether the OFAC held the power to impose sanctions on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-government-bans-ethereum-mixer-tornado-cash-platform-added-to-ofacs-sdn-list/">Tornado Cash</a>, and if such an action infringes on the plaintiffs&#8217; freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Yet, the court <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1211705/gov.uscourts.txwd.1211705.94.0.pdf">dismissed</a> the plaintiffs&#8217; stance, recognizing Tornado Cash as an entity fit for OFAC designation. The court reasoned that Tornado Cash aligns with the regulatory description of an &#8220;association,&#8221; given the collaborative efforts of its founders, developers, and its DAO governance model towards shared objectives. U.S. judge Robert Pitman declared:</p>
<blockquote><p>The record sufficiently supports OFAC’s determination that the founders, the developers, and the Tornado Cash DAO have acted jointly to promote and govern Tornado Cash and to profit from these activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Judge Pitman identified that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/github-partially-reinstates-tornado-cash-codebase-open-source-code-set-to-read-only-mode/">Tornado Cash</a> holds a vested interest in the smart contracts it establishes, which aligns with the regulatory classification of &#8220;property.&#8221; These contracts, which autonomously generate revenue as fees for Tornado Cash, represent a tangible benefit. Pitman elucidated this perspective in the court documents.</p>
<p>When it comes to First Amendment concerns, Pitman clarified that the government&#8217;s moves don&#8217;t infringe upon safeguarded speech. The designation solely curtails transactions linked to Tornado Cash&#8217;s property rights, without restricting engagement with its open-source code or other services.</p>
<p>Pitman’s judgment emphasized, “The fact that smart contracts do so without additional human intervention, like a vending machine, or that they are immutable, does not affect its status as [a] type of contract and, thus, a type of property within the meaning of the regulation.”</p>
<p>The court documents also revealed that the plaintiff&#8217;s Fifth Amendment claims were essentially set aside, given their lack of follow-through beyond the preliminary grievance, even as the government sought a summary judgment for all claims. In conclusion, judge Pitman negated the plaintiffs&#8217; request for summary judgment while endorsing the government&#8217;s counter-claim.</p>
<p>He said he firmly believed that the OFAC acted within its legal boundaries in its decision concerning Tornado Cash, ensuring no breach of the plaintiffs&#8217; constitutional privileges. The verdict concerning Tornado Cash mirrors a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/notions-of-dao-immunity-sink-as-cftc-lawsuit-declares-ooki-dao-a-person-under-the-law/">preceding lawsuit</a> involving Ooki DAO, initiated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>On June 9, 2023, the CFTC clinched a victory when the judge determined that the Ooki DAO qualifies as a “person” under the Commodity Exchange Act. “This decision should serve as a wake-up call to anyone who believes they can circumvent the law by adopting a DAO structure,” CFTC Division of Enforcement director Ian McGinley said at the time.</p>

Opensea revealed that the &#x201C;cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<h2>Opensea Pivots Away From <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> Smart Chain in Strategy Re-evaluation</h2>
<p>On August 18, 2023, Opensea <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1692598153244020776?s=20">proclaimed</a> that they would cease BSC support after incorporating multiple blockchains over recent years. This announcement coincides with Opensea&#x2019;s strategy to phase out the enforcement of NFT royalties. Concerning BSC support, Opensea stated that as the industry advances, the company needs to &#x201C;align resources with the most promising efforts.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve decided the cost to continue supporting BSC outweighs the impact,&#x201D; Opensea said. &#x201C;Starting today, you will no longer be able to create new listings for or make new offers on BSC NFTs. However, you will still be able to view, discover, and transfer BSC NFTs on our site.&#x201D;</p>

<p>In response to Opensea&#x2019;s X thread publication, some individuals <a href="https://twitter.com/CosmicRichy/status/1692629965735711179?s=20">claimed</a> they were <a href="https://twitter.com/NFTmmAAXXii/status/1692621790814892187?s=20">unaware</a> of BSC support&#x2019;s existence. Others seized this chance to voice their grievances about the royalty ruling. One individual <a href="https://twitter.com/MemeNFTOfficial/status/1692747312148176929?s=20">commented</a>, &#x201C;IDK what kind of system you guys are running over there but it&#x2019;s not that expensive to run BSC if you do it right.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Opensea concluded by asserting their continued optimism regarding a multi-chain future and shared that they recently added support for layer two (L2) blockchains <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bases-rapid-ascent-136000-daily-users-and-175-million-tvl-in-ethereums-l2-defi-space/">Base</a> and Zora. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re confident this decision will help us direct resources to keep pace with the rapid innovation in our ecosystem,&#x201D; added Opensea.</p>

<h2>Worldcoin Plummets Over 50% Since Its All-Time High</h2>
<p>According to statistics, the iris-scanning crypto project <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-opens-probe-into-worldcoin-personal-data-treatment-procedures/">Worldcoin</a>&#x2018;s native token, WLD, has increased 15% in the last 24 hours. Data from July 24 to <a href="https://archive.ph/g6SUj">August 18, 2023</a>, shows WLD has declined 29.1% against the U.S. dollar.

Worldcoin operates the fifth-largest WLD address with about 3.45 million tokens (1.93%), while the sixth-largest Worldcoin wallet belongs to the crypto exchange Okx. As of August 18, the <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/address/0xEbe80f029b1c02862B9E8a70a7e5317C06F62Cae">Okx wallet</a> holds approximately 2.13 million WLD, or 1.19% of the total supply.

Tether trades make up 96% of WLD&#x2019;s 24-hour trade volume. About $1.01 million of the $89.76 million comes from Uniswap v3 on Ethereum, and roughly $190,000 was recorded in the last day on the Optimism version of Uniswap v3, with the most traded pair being WETH.</p>

Prices recently fell lower for six straight days, however, bulls have reentered the market snapping this streak in the process. Dogecoin also rebounded today. </strong></p>
<h2>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>)</h2>
<p>Stellar (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>) rose higher on Saturday, following a recent six-day losing streak which pushed the price to a multi-month low.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>/USD climbed to an intraday peak at $0.12 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes following a low of $0.1115 the day prior.</p>
<p>The move comes as stellar continued to move away from a support point at $0.110, which was hit on Thursday.</p>

<p>This was the first time the price collided with this floor since mid-June, and comes as the relative strength index (RSI) hit its own floor at 30.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, the index has also rebounded and is now tracking at 34.84, which is marginally below a ceiling at 36.00.</p>
<p>Should it push past this point, the next likely price target will be around a ceiling of $0.1340.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, dogecoin (DOGE) was also in the green to start the weekend, as it bounced from a floor of its own.</p>
<p>After trading at a low of $0.06079 during Friday&#x2019;s session, DOGE/USD surged to a peak of $0.06385 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The jump in price came as the meme coin moved away from a support point of $0.0600, which is near a recent two-month low.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XLM" 312015  target="_blank">XLM</a>, the RSI on the dogecoin chart has bounced from a support point at the 30.00 mark, and is now tracking at 34.13.</p>
<p>The next visible point of resistance is at the 44.00 mark, and should this point be hit, DOGE will likely be near $0.06600.</p>

Market sentiment was bearish following reports that Spacex liquidated its bitcoin holdings. Ethereum remains below $1,700.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bears continued to circle bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) to start the weekend, as the cryptocurrency had its biggest one-day decline since the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to a low of $25,668.92 on Saturday, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a high of $26,598.65.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, bitcoin remains close to a two-month low, with some traders targeting a breakout below $25,000.</p>

<p>Overall, the relative strength index (RSI) is deep in bearish territory, with a current reading of 18.56.</p>
<p>Price strength hasn&#x2019;t tracked below 20.00 since January last year, which for some was the beginning of the so-called &#x201C;crypto winter&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Should there be further declines this weekend, the target will likely be a support point of $24,900.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was marginally higher on Saturday, as the price rebounded from a recent move below $1,600.</p>
<p>Following a high of $1,695.45 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD fell to a bottom of $1,644.93 to start the weekend.</p>
<p>On Thursday, ethereum dropped to a low of $1,540, which was its weakest point since March 12, when the price was trading below the $1,459 level.</p>

<p>The 10-day (red) moving average is now firmly on a downward trend, after appearing as though it was nearing an upwards cross earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As of writing, ethereum seems to have found a firm floor around the $1,660 level.</p>

Blockchain.com, Human Capital, Vy Capital, Sky9 Capital, and Jane Street Capital, among others, participated in the funding round. Zetachain will use the funds to launch its solution on mainnet and grow its app ecosystem.</strong></p>
<h2>Zetachain Raises $27 Million in Series A Funding Round</h2>
<p>Zetachain, an interoperability-focused blockchain project, has <a href="https://blog.zetachain.com/zetachain-raises-27m-for-interoperable-layer-1-blockchain-that-connects-all-chains-including-7584dc0c673" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $27 million in a Series A funding round. Blockchain.com, Human Capital, Vy Capital, Sky9 Capital, Jane Street Capital, VistaLabs, CMT Digital, Foundation Capital, Lingfeng Capital, GSR, and others participated in the round. Funds will be used to launch the mainnet of the chain and also to grow its decentralized app ecosystem.</p>
<p>Zetachain wants to tackle the isolation problem that affects blockchains, where resources are siloed and cannot be used in separate chains or applications. Zetachain states its mission is to &#8220;establish a new standard for blockchain interoperability where users can access all of their assets and data from one wallet on a single platform.&#8221;</p>
<p>This includes non-smart-contracts-enabled blockchains, like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Zetachain&#8217;s architecture allows the users to leverage these assets without using structures to bridges or wrapped tokens and the security liabilities they present.</p>

<h2>A Growing Testnet Ecosystem</h2>
<p>While Zetachain&#8217;s solutions are still in testnet stages, there are already more than 27,000 decentralized application contracts used in several applications in various fields, including decentralized finance (defi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), universal Web3 social, identity, and gaming protocols.</p>
<p>Zetachain claims that 1.7 million users have participated on its testnet, with over 13 million transactions completed. With its design approach, the company expects that fees, slippage, and complexity will be reduced for the average user to reach global audiences and introduce them to crypto. For them, solving the fragmentation problem is &#8220;critical to enabling Web3 apps and services to reach a larger audience in the hundreds of millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next step for Zetachain is to launch its product on mainnet, which still does not have a definitive launch date. However, the interoperability issue is complex, and several competitors are trying to offer their own particular solutions to this problem. In March, Layerzero Labs <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/layerzero-labs-secures-135-million-to-bolster-cross-chain-interoperability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">raised</a> $135 million in a Series A+ funding round for developing cross-chain decentralized applications.</p>

Crypto asset businesses will be required to take &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to ensure compliance with the travel rule. When the rule becomes effective, compliance with the rule is still expected even when a crypto asset business uses a third-party supplier.</strong></p>
<h2>Delays in Implementing Travel Rule</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom’s financial services industry regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has said crypto firms based in the country will soon be required to adhere to the so-called travel rule. According to the regulator, crypto firms are expected to start complying with this rule from Sept 1, 2023.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-sets-out-expectations-uk-cryptoasset-businesses-complying-travel-rule">statement released</a> on Aug. 17, the FCA suggested that its decision to enforce the requirement aligns with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)’s call for the swift implementation of the travel rule. Despite the FATF’s call, many countries have failed to implement the travel rule due to delays &#8220;in adoption and different timelines for enforcement of the Travel Rule across jurisdictions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Explaining why the UK is proceeding to implement the rule compelling crypto firms to collect, verify, and share information, the FCA said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have worked closely with industry to provide guidance on how to comply and what we reasonably expect of firms ahead of other countries following the UK’s position.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result of this step taken by the U.K., crypto asset businesses based in the country will be required to take &#8220;all reasonable steps&#8221; to comply with the rule. Compliance with the rule is still expected even when a crypto asset business uses a third-party supplier.</p>
<h2>Crypto Firms Expected to Collect and Verify Information</h2>
<p>In instances where funds are being sent to a jurisdiction without the travel rule, the FCA said crypto firms must still collect and verify the information before a transfer is made. If the funds are being transferred from a jurisdiction without the travel rule, the necessary risk-based assessments must be undertaken before deciding to avail these to the beneficiary or not, the regulator said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FCA said it has been working on a guidance to help firms comply with the travel rule. The financial services industry watchdog added that crypto asset businesses can also share their thoughts about the guidance on or before Aug. 25, 2023.</p>
