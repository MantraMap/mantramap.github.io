In addition, the finanical watchodg has charged a few other defendants related to the case, for engaging in an unregistered and fraudulent marketing of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> asset called UpToken.</p>
<h2>SEC Charges Yet Another Crypto Firm</h2>
<p>Charges that claimed Coinme&#8217;s Up Global division and Neil Bergquist &#8212; who oversaw both the companies &#8212; and deceived investors in a 2017 <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ico-initial-coin-offering/">Initial Coin Offering (ICO)</a> for an Ethereum-based UpToken, were resolved in an unambiguous settlement announced on Friday.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Can Terra’s New USTC Repeg Proposal Bring LUNC Price Back To $1?" href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-ust-repeg-proposal-price/" rel="bookmark">Can Terra’s New USTC Repeg Proposal Bring LUNC Price Back To $1?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>According to the SEC, investors were allegedly persuaded to believe that Up Global would set a hard cap of the total supply of UpToken, while Coinme would generate consistent demand for the token &#8220;to fund a Bitcoin automated teller machine&#8221; incentives program, which would thereby boost the price of the token.</p>
<p>The regulatory body believed that the assertions were deceptive due to the fact that Up Global had secretly carried out transactions that lowered Coinme&#8217;s requirement for UpToken. Moreover, according to the SEC <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2023/33-11179.pdf">report</a>, Up Global and Bergquist had lied to investors by stating that the offering had raised $10 million to $19 million when in reality they had raised far less money, roughly close to $3.65 million.</p>
<h2>SEC Imposes Hefty $4 Mn Fine</h2>
<p>Coinme and Up Global will pay a combined $3.77 million, while Bergquist will pay $150,000. However, neither party has admitted nor denied any misconduct in connection with this matter. Bergquist, the 35-year-old crypto entrepreneur, was also given a prohibition against serving as an officer or director of public enterprises for a period of three years.</p>
<p>While speaking about the new development, the SEC was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the facts and circumstances set forth below, UpToken were offered and sold as investment contracts and therefore securities under SEC [guidelines]. An UpToken investor would have had a reasonable expectation of obtaining a future profit from the rise in value of UpToken based upon Respondents’ efforts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The incident comes on the heels of rampant crypto crackdowns which many businesses operating in the country have witnessed in recent times. As of late, the financial regulator has been making a concentrated effort to address what it sees as a lack of compliance on the side of cryptocurrency platforms and the intermediaries that work with them.</p>

This comes as a part of  Mastercard&#8217;s long-standing commitment to increasing the level of trust that consumers, businesses, and governments have in the cryptocurrency industry. With this, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/mastercard/">Mastercard</a> is aiming to offer a service that makes sure transactions between users&#8217; wallets are traceable and compliant. The proposed service will first focus on facilitating transfers of crypto assets between countries.</p>
<h2>Mastercard Launches Crypto Credentials</h2>
<p>According to an official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2023/bringing-more-trust-to-blockchain-transactions/" rel="nofollow">statement</a> issued by the payments giant, Mastercard&#8217;s Crypto Credential will lay down a set of common standards and infrastructure that will help confirm trusted communications among consumers and businesses using blockchain networks.&#8221; The firm further emphasizes the fact that <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFT</a> projects require different verification requirements than those needed to transfer cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, Ethereum and Litecoin.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="PayPal’s Crypto Push: Over 60 Million Venmo Users Can Now Transfer Crypto" href="https://coingape.com/paypal-crypto-push-venmo-users-transfer-crypto/" rel="bookmark">PayPal’s Crypto Push: Over 60 Million Venmo Users Can Now Transfer Crypto</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Mastercard Crypto Credential will develop a set of common standards and architecture that will aid attest reliable interactions between consumers and organizations utilizing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain networks</a>. There are many different use cases that may be unlocked with Mastercard&#8217;s new program due to the fact that the verification demands of consumers and businesses vary greatly depending on the market and the standards that must be met.</p>
<p>While speaking about the latest development, the payments firm was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mastercard Crypto Credential will not only define verification standards and levels, but it will also provide necessary enabling technology to assist in bringing more use cases to life.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Mastercard Boosts Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p>In order to launch the service, Mastercard has formed partnerships with noteworthy crypto companies that provide <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallets</a>, including Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin, and Uphold. The companies are collaborating on an initial endeavor to establish a proper segway for transfer between the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>In the past, Mastercard has collaborated with Binance to roll out <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> debit cards in Brazil and Argentina. Despite rumors of payment processors slowing down their plans in response to a general market fall over the previous year, this new development demonstrates that interested industry giants continue to have a burgeoning interest in cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the challenge, John Deaton said he wants the SEC to “cite a single case in the 76yrs since Howey was decided that says: 1) the underlying asset used in an investment contract is itself a security; or 2) the subsequent sales of an investment contract are also securities b/c of the first sale.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey Gary, <a href="https://twitter.com/SECEnfDirector?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SECEnfDirector</a>, how about you cite a single case in the 76yrs since Howey was decided that says: 1) the underlying asset used in an investment contract is itself a security; or 2) the subsequent sales of an investment contract are also securities b/c of the first sale.</p>
<p>&mdash; John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1652003798288674817?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The debate bordering on what constitutes security and what does not has caused a lot of division between players in the digital currency ecosystem and the SEC. Thus far this year, the commission has taken its enforcement action to a lot of crypto firms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The regular </span><a href="https://coingape.com/kraken-starts-withdrawing-all-staked-ethereum-eth-amid-us-sec-pressure/"><span style="font-weight: 400">imposed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> a $32 million fine on Kraken exchange for offering staking products which it termed securities. Besides this, the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin issuer, Paxos Trust was also issued a Well Notice concerning the token and the firm has </span><a href="https://coingape.com/new-york-regulator-orders-paxos-to-stop-creating-binance-busd/"><span style="font-weight: 400">subsequently halted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> the issuance of the product.</span></p>
<h2><b>Providing Answers to Salient Questions</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Known as a very vocal advocate for crypto firms, John Deaton has gained popularity for filing Amicus Briefs in the <a href="https://coingape.com/ripple-vs-sec-xrp-lawyer-both-sides-win/">ongoing lawsuit</a> between the SEC and Ripple Labs Inc on behalf of about 75,000 XRP holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this current challenge, he called out the SEC to “cite ONE CASE in U.S. history in</span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRPHolders?src=hashtag_click"><span style="font-weight: 400"> #XRPHolders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">’ Amicus Brief,” and he noted that “the SEC could not meet the challenge because there is not a single case.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The industry has often advocated for dialogue and Coinbase has even taken the bar further by </span><a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-slaps-a-lawsuit-to-compel-the-sec-to-respond-to-rulemaking-petition/"><span style="font-weight: 400">filing a lawsuit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> on the regulator for failing to provide a clear guideline for the emerging market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Proponents of a new law believe failure to narrow the definition of the guiding rules for the market can make the United States take a back seat in comparison to other nations as far as crypto and general financial innovation is concerned. </span></p>

However, this retracement phase could present an advantageous chance to purchase some popular memecoins at a discount. Here is the top <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">meme cryptocurrency</a> with a strong bullish setup that can encourage a sustained recovery in the near future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin(DOGE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DNfq3cE0.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 10 months, the dogecoin price has been moving in a sideways strength under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. The recent bounce back from this pattern converging trendline signals the traders actively respond to this pattern and therefore will also have a significant impact on its future price </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ongoing selling pressure in the market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">DOGE price</a> is falling back to the pattern’s support to replenish the bullish momentum. If buyers manage to defend this pattern, the resulting reversal may drive the price around 50% higher to retest the overhead resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, a potential breakout from the pattern’s resistance will signal an early sign of trend reversal. Under bullish conditions, this pattern completion could lead a bull run to a $0.2 psychological barrier.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu(SHIB)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/YDR604Gi.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the daily time frame chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> shows the formation of a descending triangle. Amid the recent correction, the coin price initiated a bear cycle within this triangle after reverting to a downsloping trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, this memecoin is stuck in a narrow range spread from $0.00001186 to $0.0000097. With sustained selling the sellers may drive the price another 23.6% to revisit the $0.0000078 neckline support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this pattern signals the resumption of prevailing downfall if the prices break the lower neckline. However, the momentum indicator rising indicates the underlying pressure is rising and thus the coin also has an opportunity to breach the trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under favorable conditions Thus, a potential breakdown may surge the SHIBA inu price 80% high to hit the $0.00001815 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floki(FLOKI)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/t1ybqBOA.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past two months, the Floki can price has been walking a sideways trend within two definite levels of $0.000045 and $0.00002746. The coin price falling for the past four days consecutively and is approaching the range’s bottom support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This support level acts as a strong accumulation zone as buyers have already rebounded the prices with strong bullish momentum. Anyhow, for additional confirmation of the uptrend, the safer traders can wait for a breakout above $0.000045.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the trend-based Fibonacci extension, the breakout could lead the Floki price to 140% higher to hit $0.000086(100% FIB)</span></p>

This comes after PayPal introduced a similar feature for its customers back in 2022.</p>
<h2>PayPal Enables Crypto Transfer For Venmo</h2>
<p>According to PayPal&#8217;s most recent earnings statement, Venmo &#8212; which PayPal acquired in 2013 &#8212; completed a total of $245.3 billion in transactions involving fiat currency in 2022 alone. In order to launch the new transfer mechanism, PayPal has formed a strategic partnership with Paxos, a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> company that specializes in stablecoins.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Can Terra’s New USTC Repeg Proposal Bring LUNC Price Back To $1?" href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-ust-repeg-proposal-price/" rel="bookmark">Can Terra’s New USTC Repeg Proposal Bring LUNC Price Back To $1?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>While speaking about the new development, the firm was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Paypal&#8217;s Push For Crypto Adoption</h2>
<p>The announcement from PayPal is one of the company&#8217;s first crypto-related updates since February, when the firm reportedly halted its stablecoin project following alarming reports that Paxos &#8212; its partner in the stablecoin offering &#8212; was <a href="https://coingape.com/new-york-regulator-orders-paxos-to-stop-creating-binance-busd/">under investigation</a> by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).</p>
<p>At a time when the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/?utm_source=menubar">cryptocurrency market</a> as a whole is being challenged with increased scrutiny by U.S. regulators, the decision to extend the crypto service to millions of Venmo consumers starting next month comes at an interesting juncture. PayPal users were given permission to send supported tokens such as Bitcoin, ether, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin-cashbch/">Bitcoin Cash</a>, and Litecoin to external wallets beginning in June of the previous calendar year.</p>

Amid the increasing selling pressure, a majority of major cryptocurrencies witnessed a temporary correction in their ongoing bullish trend offering a suitable pullback opportunity to market participants. Interested traders may grab this opportunity to accumulate their favorite cryptocurrencies at discounted prices.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xrp(XRP)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/pcYAv3Oi.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent correction, the XRP price plunged to local support of $0.44, which is aligned with the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a>. A retracement up to this FIB level is considered healthy for the sustained bull run and encourages the market buyers to prolong a bullish rally</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> trades at $0.47 and tries to sustain above the $0.44 support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, the daily chart shows a downsloping trendline currently carrying the ongoing correction phase. Thus, the traders waiting for a new long opportunity should wait for the price breakout above this trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout above this trendline will accelerate the buying momentum and surge the coin price 25% higher to rechallenge the $0.585.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana(SOL)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/x/XiOaYWno.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 11th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/">Solana price</a> gave a decisive breakout above a long-coming resistance trendline reflecting an early sign for trend reversal. Furthermore, the recent correction in the market allows the coin price to retest the breached resistance as potential support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the Solana price trades at $22.34 with an intraday gain of 0.09%</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the coin price sustains above the aforementioned trendline it would indicate the market sentiment on selling on rallies shifted to buying dips. The potential recovery may surge the SOL price by 20% rise to hit $26.6 followed by $30, and $37.75.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon(MATIC)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NePshcUR.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past ten months, the MATIC price has been riding a sustained rally under the influence of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">d</a>. Using this pattern’s support trendline, the buyers are offered pullback opportunities to reaccumulate this altcoin for a prolonged bullish rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polygon/#:~:text=The%20live%20Polygon%20price%20today,MATIC%20coins%20and%20a%20max.">MATIC price</a> trades at $0.98 and revisits the dynamic support trendline. The lower price rejection candle near this trend indicates the buyers continue to defend this level which most likely triggers a fresh recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In ideal conditions, a bullish reversal support trendline may drive the asset price to the overhead trendline. Thus, with sustained buying, the MATIC price may rise 80% higher to hit the $1.8 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot(DOT)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/hv6hSvWD.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the Polkadot coin shows the formation of an inverted head and shoulder pattern. This famous reversal pattern consists of a long swing low, the head, and two narrow lows called the shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/#:~:text=DOT%20Price%20Trends%20%3A,trading%20volume%20of%20%24194%2C926%2C034%20USD.">DOT price</a> trades at the $5.86 mark and forms the right shoulder of the pattern as shown in the above. If altcoin manages to sustain above the $5.6 or $5.3 support, the buyers will likely surge the prices 10-12% higher to hit the key neckline trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout from this trendline will signal trend reversal and prepare Polkadot for a massive rally. The post-breakout rally could surge the prices 80-82% higher and hit the $10.8 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmos(ATOM)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/t/TDSnL45P.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the past ten months, the Cosmos coin price has been moving sideways in response to a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. The coin price bounced from the pattern’s support trendline at least twice indicating the traders strictly respect this pattern and may do the same for its potential rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the ATOM price traded at the $11.69 mark and has recently bounced back from the pattern’s support trendline. This bullish reversal triggers a bull cycle with the pattern and may surge the coin price by around 20% to hit the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyhow, a breakout from either of the trendlines will determine the direction of future trends. A potential breakout of the above trendline may drive the prices to a high of $25.8.</span></p>

The arrest of the developer back in August last year sparked an uproar in the crypto ecosystem and the tweet shared might imply he has finally regained his freedom.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry I was afk for a while, what did I miss? <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f440.png" alt="👀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>&mdash; Alexey Pertsev (@alex_pertsev) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_pertsev/status/1651961639388815363?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 28, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With details of his release still unclear, it was hinted that Alexey was billed to regain his freedom earlier this month, an assurance that came following a series of </span><a href="https://coingape.com/tornado-cash-developer-alexey-pertsev-jail-stay-extended-to-february-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400">failed attempts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets and Control (OFAC) banned Tornado Cash last year when it linked the mixing tool to crime rings including the notorious North Korean Lazarus Group. The OFAC sanction at the time alleged that Alexey’s invention has been used to launder as much as $7 billion worth of cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tornado Cash operates as a decentralized tool which obscures the identity of senders and receivers by mixing the deposited funds in a pool and sending it out in ways that makes it almost impossible to trace the parties involved in the transaction. Following the ban and subsequent arrest of the protocol and Alexey, the crypto ecosystem rose in solidarity and criticized the US regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most importantly, supporters of Alexey noted that sanctioning a piece of code is one thing, cracking down on the individual who created the code can legitimately </span><a href="https://coingape.com/future-of-privacy-coins-uncertain-after-tornado-cash-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400">sniff out innovation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. Riding on these and more premises, OFAC and the US government were subsequently </span><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-u-s-treasury-and-ofac-face-lawsuit-for-tornado-cash-ban/"><span style="font-weight: 400">dragged to court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<h2><b>Getting a New Lease of Life</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being incarcerated for his invention has earned Alexey a lot of nicknames in the industry with some seeing him as one of the martyrs of the disruptive financial innovation that blockchain is bringing on board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shared tweet was seeking to know what he missed and as an active developer in the industry, Alexey has a lot to catch up including the events bordering the Ethereum ecosystem following </span><a href="https://coingape.com/how-ethereum-is-performing-after-the-merge/"><span style="font-weight: 400">the Merge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the Shapella Upgrade and the more intense crackdown from regulators especially in the US.</span></p>

The agreement comes as a result of a request that <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis/">Genesis Global</a> made earlier in the week to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York to appoint a mediator to help in the terms and conditions of Genesis owner Digital Currency Group&#8217;s contribution to the debtors&#8217; reorganization plan.</p>
<h2>Genesis &amp; Creditors Enter Crucial Mediation</h2>
<p>On Friday, an attorney representing Genesis, Sean O&#8217;Neal, announced that the cryptocurrency lender has consented to a 30-day mediation procedure that will include its committee of unsecured creditors. This committee has been against the planned restructuring deal an according to O&#8217;Neal, Genesis is working towards holding two &#8220;substantive&#8221; mediation sessions before May 8th. He stated that after the mediation process is over, the final terms of the agreement would also be made public.</p>

<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-28/bankrupt-crypto-lender-genesis-creditors-agree-to-mediation" rel="nofollow">report</a> by Bloomberg, the creditor&#8217;s committee at Genesis is opposed to the company&#8217;s present proposal to restructure, and it is looking for improved terms. Philip Abelson, a lawyer who represents the creditors&#8217; committee, stated that his client&#8217;s position has not changed, &#8220;and we do not want our participation in the mediation to be misconstrued.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite this, Judge Lane, who is currently presiding over the case, highlighted the fact that both sides had agreed to mediate the dispute as &#8220;significant progress.&#8221; Lane was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obviously, folks are doing a lot of work, heavy lifting to get things moving along.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gemini&#8217;s Growing Troubles</h2>
<p>In February, the attorneys for Genesis Global Holdco issued a term sheet describing a settlement with creditors. The document shows that DCG would bear a significant portion of the burden in the reorganization of the insolvent <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> lender.</p>
<p>As reported earlier on CoinGape, initially the agreement received the backing of creditors who collectively represented more than $2 billion in claims against Genesis of which Winklevoss&#8217; Gemini Trust was also a part.</p>
<p>After the failure of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> in November of last year, Genesis&#8217; lending arm stopped withdrawals and later filed for protection under bankruptcy laws in January.</p>

This is especially true in the United States, where the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/securities-and-exchange-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> had in recent times attacked crypto businesses in the name of non-compliance. But, in reality the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;come forward and register&#8221; stance is almost impossible to follow for crypto companies, as the existing US laws are not compatible with the blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<p>Not just lawmakers and crypto traders, but several US judges had ruled against the SEC&#8217;s position on crypto companies. In recent times, the US agency received unfavorable rulings in crypto related cases including the Grayscale and Ripple XRP lawsuits. <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-lawsuits-us-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read More</a> to know about Key US SEC Crypto Lawsuit Failures Every Investor Should Know</p>
<h2>CZ Sheds Light On Hong Kong Crypto Policy Easing</h2>
<p>In what appears to be criticism directed at the US regulators, CZ shared a report about the Hong Kong central banking asking local banks to give banking services access to crypto businesses. Earlier, CoinGape reported that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) had on Thursday <a href="https://coingape.com/hong-kong-asks-banks-to-help-regulated-crypto-firms-in-doing-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> the banks to encourage banking operations with crypto companies. This is in sharp contrast to the United States banking scene, where all banks are restricted from giving banking access to crypto firms, which led to difficulty around Dollar based transactions for Binance.</p>
<p>When asked about China&#8217;s previous stance of banning crypto, CZ <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1651964285797425152?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replied</a> saying, &#8220;things change.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mining difficulty is a performance metric that is used to judge the health of the Bitcoin network. While it is most commonly used for Bitcoin, it can infact, be applied to different digital currencies using the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism. For BTC, the mining difficulty is adjusted every two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That the mining difficulty is growing is a testament to more miners entering into the network in a bid to scoop up the Bitcoin reward associated with the high capital intensive ability. The financial strain most miners experienced over the past year when the crypto winter was blowing so cold forced many to </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-mining-firm-halts-tading-amid-bankruptcy-fear/"><span style="font-weight: 400">halt some or all of their operations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some of these miners that went under are now recovering and replugging their machines back online.</span></p>
<h2><b>Dissenting Views on Mining</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite its importance in the Bitcoin ecosystem, the mining engagement remains a very polarizing subject for regulators. While many posit that mining is harmful to the environment and as such necessitates its ban, core proponents maintains that the mining activities consumes far less than the energy most other human activities consumes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clamor surrounding Bitcoin mining has pushed the advocacy toward sustainable mining through the use of renewable energy sources. Additionally, many critics are calling for the transition of Bitcoin from the PoW model to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) just like Ethereum did last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though the transition journey was arduous for the Ethereum developers, when the transition, through </span><a href="https://coingape.com/how-ethereum-is-performing-after-the-merge/"><span style="font-weight: 400">The Merge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> went live last year, it paid off seeing it cut off the energy consumption of the network by more 99.9%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bitcoin maxis have denounced the plan and while there has been no outright ban on BTC mining in the most prominent hubs for the digital currency, the use of Layer-2 protocol, such as the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-lightning-network-capacity-tops-2900-btc-twitter-can-boost-further/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Lightning Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to conduct transactions using the Bitcoin network has grown over the past few years.</span></p>

Terra, formerly a prominent blockchain that intended to compete with Ethereum (ETH) and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/stable-coins/">stablecoins</a> like USDT and USDC collapses in May 2022 which triggered a domino effect throughout the sector &#8212; thereby erasing $2 trillion worth of digital assets in the process.</p>
<h2>UST Proposal Aims For $1 Repeg</h2>
<p>Almost a year after Terra&#8217;s gruesome debacle, members of the Terra Classic community are considering resurrecting the ecosystem&#8217;s doomed terraUSD classic (USTC) stablecoin. The failed chain got renamed to Terra Classic whereas the forked version &#8212; developed in the aftermath of UST&#8217;s de-pegging event &#8212; converted into <a href="https://coingape.com/terra-2-0-coming-with-a-new-rebirth-on-may-27-but-this-time-without-ust-stablecoin/">Terra 2.0</a>.</p>

<p>Discussions on community forums that date back to March are proposing a new model that addresses the problems with the initial design by utilizing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/staking/">staking</a>, algorithmic peg divergence fees, token buybacks and unidirectional swaps. A divergence fee mechanism, as detailed by member &#8220;RedlineDrifter,&#8221; would levy a cost equal to the disparity in price between the peg and the market price of USTC. This fee may vary from 0% to 100% at a 50% deviation from the peg. Users who purchase USTC tokens would be responsible for these fees.</p>
<h2>UST Repeg Proposal Details</h2>
<p>This design eliminates the incentive to sell below the peg and increases the incentive to buy in order to guarantee the accumulation of the more valuable asset, which is USTC or tokens that back it. The protocol is said to be applied across all USTC trading pairs, both on-chain and off-chain, and the fees that are collected by the protocol are used to purchase back USTC and ensure that the peg is maintained.</p>
<p>Additionally, RedlineDrifter offered a USTC staking tool as a means of attracting funds to the token, which would, at the very least, result in an increase in the token&#8217;s price. According to the suggestion, in order to give USTC some utility while simultaneously removing it from circulating supply, a new staking mechanism should be developed for USTC with lockup durations of one month, six months, and one year with increasing incentive rates for longer lockup periods. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/ustc-incremental-repeg-buybacks-staking-swaps/50966/1">proposal</a> was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>This module is purely about taking USTC out of circulating supply in order to accelerate the incremental repeg efforts and put increased positive pressure on USTC price.</p></blockquote>
<p>As reported earlier on CoinGape, the Terra ecosystem collapsed in May of last year due to abrupt outflows from the protocol, which led UST to plummet to a few pennies within two weeks along with a 99% loss in the value of LUNA tokens. In the wake of this LUNC news, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/terra-luna-classic">price of Terra Classic</a> is currently exchanging hands at $0.0001081 with a market cap of roughly $637 million.</p>

Flitpay is <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/flitpayofficial/status/1651148110079434752" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offering</a> BONE trading with zero fees in BONE/INR pair.</p>
<p>In addition, crypto exchange <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/Cetoex/status/1651868914568278016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CetoEX</a> announced the listing of BONE token a week ago, with the listing going live on April 28. The exchange is listing BONE against USDT stablecoin.</p>
<h2>Will BONE Be Listed On Binance?</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance takes several factors when deciding to list a crypto which includes user base, development activity, and a good team. Binance is constantly reviewing and adding cryptocurrencies that can be used on the Binance platform. With BONE listing on major exchanges such as OKX, Huobi, and Crypto.com, Binance will likely follow with a BONE listing soon.</p>
<p>OKX is the second-largest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume after Binance. Binance is the top exchange and Binance will eventually list BONE token as the SHIB developers announce the Shibarium mainnet release, which is expected by the end of the year.</p>
<p>BONE price is currently trading at $1.03, down 2% in the last 24 hours. However, it is up over 8% in a week amid listing by multiple exchanges.</p>

According to latest reports, the company&#8217;s officials revealed plans to seek more tie ups with crypto businesses, in further expansion of its cryptocurrency payment card initiative. Another payments processing company, Visa, is also actively engaged with crypto firms, as the digital assets market expands to mainstream businesses.</p>

<h2>Mastercard Crypto Program Expanding</h2>
<p>According to a Reuters report, the financial services company is set to expand its crypto payment card programme with more partnerships with crypto companies. This is a welcome move for the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>, as such big partnerships come at a crucial time when regulators in the United States enforce actions against crypto businesses. The report <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/mastercard-seeks-expand-crypto-card-131445913.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGMOElDfDr2K2YlQBc6ZTxCd71rVmsYafOhTvW-Y5KEzarhFj9PFj6ZLcu8JPbAUgdk4uwVrC9Jd_-Wa8bFZCBkcHN_pQr8hV408o2AkrMYgXVAl645JgwyTUP0AloANgjDuH7ag_LxGwHDsYTrmJfnnO4qj6utt_zZ-4GqdUfZS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">quoted</a> Mastercard&#8217;s head of crypto and blockchain Raj Dhamodharan as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>We have dozens of partners around the world who offer crypto card programmes and they continue to expand. Mastercard is &#8220;really quite enthusiastic&#8221; about the underlying blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dhamodharan said ensuring safety in crypto transactions is integral to the company&#8217;s push for the card program. The payments processing company had already issued crypto based payments cards in partnership with crypto exchanges like Binance, Gemini and Nexo. Further to this, the company looks to expand the number of partnerships, which also works in favor of the crypto market&#8217;s validation. Recently, Tron founder Justin Sun <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-justin-sun-announces-huobi-visa-card-as-part-of-globalization-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the launch of Huobi Visa Card.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/06174144/XRP-transaction.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="XRP Price" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since last week, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> has been resonating between the $0.48 and $0.44 levels creating a narrow consolidation range. The daily chart showing rejection candles on both the aforementioned levels indicates uncertainty among market participants. Thus, a breakout from either of the range levels is needed to drive a sustained rally. Here’s how buyers may retake trend control to resume a bullish recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price consolidating between the $0.48 and $0.44 level can be considered a no-trading zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resistance trendline governs the ongoing correction phase in XRP</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.65 Billion, indicating an 8.85% gain.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/Ip5Ynbwv.png" alt="XRP Price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the ongoing consolidation, the XRP price shows sustainability above the $0.44 support which is also a 50% Fibonacci retracement level. In theory, a retracement to the 50% FIB is considered healthy to prolong a long bull run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the altcoin is currently struggling to surpass an immediate resistance of $0.48 and created a narrow price. Moreover, In the first two weeks of May, the XRP price and the overall crypto market may witness significant volatility due to upcoming macroeconomic events such as the decision on interest rates, the release of Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), and the inflation rate.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-cryptocurrencies-to-buy/">15 New Cryptocurrencies To Buy In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, a resistance trendline is currently carrying the ongoing correction in the XRP price. Therefore, to initiate a directional move in this coin, the prices must breach either the overhead trendline or $0.44 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The upside breakout will signal the resumption of prior recovery and push the XRP price to $0.56.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below $0.44 may prolong the current correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the current consolidation, the 4-hour <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> rising indicates buying pressure in the market is gradually increasing which bolsters an upside breakout from the aforementioned range.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-and-200-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> moving near $0.44 also accentuates the importance of this level of maintaining a bullish outlook in XRP.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.472</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.48 and $0.537</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.44 and $0.4</span></li>

A retracement to this FIB level is considered healthy and has strong underlying bullish momentum. Thus, with sustained buying the BTC price breached an immediate resistance of $29150, which prepares buyers to challenge the $30650 swing high.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index at 64% reflects a possible sentiment among market participants to prolong a bullish recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $30650 mark stands as a crucial supply zone for traders</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $21 Billion, indicating a 37% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/s/s5XxFs9r.png" alt="BTC Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> rebounded from a $27000 support on April 24th and surged 8.5% in these last five days. Amid this rally the prices also breached with a daily candle closing above $29150, offering a stepping stone for buyers to rise high.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buying pressure persists, the BTC price will rise 5% to hit the $30650 resistance. An upside breakout from the aforementioned resistance will signal the resumption of prevailing recovery which, as per the Trend-based Fibonacci extension, would likely surge the price to $32500(50% FIB).</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-upcoming-binance-listing/">15 New Cryptocurrencies In Upcoming Binance Listing For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the upcoming macroeconomic events in May’s first two weeks like the interest rate decision, the jobs report or Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP), and the Inflation rate may cause considerable volatility in the market and thus traders must remain cautious at resistance like $30650.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, any sign of recovery may encourage the formation of a bearish pattern called a double top.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Considering the Mid-April peak in RSI(73%), the current value of this indicator at 55% reflects a weakness in buying pressure which promotes price reversal.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the ongoing recovery, the 20-and-50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> may act as key support to reflect a strong recovery rally.</span></p>

Strangely, the Bitcoin 200 weekly moving average (WMA) indicator continued below the BTC price for prolonged periods in 2022, registering a behavior that was never seen before in the history of cryptocurrencies. However, currently the big whales are back to accumulating as dormant Bitcoin wallets are awakening after a decade&#8217;s time.</p>

<p>The recent surge in Bitcoin price in direct correlation with the fall in First Republic Bank stock is yet another validation of the very use case of cryptocurrencies. This comes at the back of a US regional banking crisis that shook markets in March 2023 catapulted BTC price to a near $30,000 range from around $20,000.</p>
<h2>Nic Carter: Bitcoin-Banks Correlation &#8220;Most Validating&#8221;</h2>
<p>Popular web 3.0 personality Nic Carter said the top cryptocurrency&#8217;s reaction to the banking crisis was the perfect validation of the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> in a long time. Earlier, he made news with his statements alleging the forced closure of Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank, which were friendly to the crypto industry, was actually the reason behind the banking crisis. With the latest BTC price rise over First Republic Bank stock decline, the behavior is unlike anything in 10 years, he <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1651603830314860544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The fact that bitcoin almost mechanically rallies on news of bank failures is one of the most validating phenomena I have experienced in a decade of doing this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the crypto market could price in the US Fed rate hike news ahead of the crucial Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meet between May 1-2, 2023.</p>

<h2>Repercussions of SEC Action on US Crypto Exchanges</h2>
<p>According to the Crypto Exchange <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cn.tokeninsight.com/en/research/reports/crypto-exchange-report-2023q1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Report</a> 2023 Q1, the top 15 exchanges recorded a total volume of $10.8 trillion, a 40% increase as compared to 2022 Q4. The crypto market recovered this year, with <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-ceo-cz-downplays-post-halving-bitcoin-price-prediction-by-chatgpt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price skyrocketing</a> over 70%.</p>
<p>Binance, OKX, Bybit, Bitget, MEXC, Gate, KuCoin, Upbit, Coinbase, and Huobi were the top 10 crypto exchanges in terms of trading volume. US-based crypto exchanges Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.US lost major market share in the 2023 Q1.</p>

<p>Earlier, <strong>Coingecko</strong> also reported a continuous decline in trading volume on Coinbase from 7% in January to 5% in March. Meanwhile, trading volume on crypto exchanges outside the U.S. rising due to the regulatory crackdown against crypto in the US. The <strong>U.S. House Financial Services Committee</strong> is currently investigating <a href="https://coingape.com/us-house-investigating-potential-operation-choke-point-2-0-to-de-bank-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential Operation Choke Point-type action</a> by agencies such as the Fed, FDIC, and OCC to de-bank the crypto market.</p>
