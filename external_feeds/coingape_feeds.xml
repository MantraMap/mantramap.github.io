Ripple and U.S. SEC recently produced additional references for the court to land a verdict in their favor. As the court is yet to make a decision in the XRP lawsuit, settlement assumptions are making rounds again.</p>

<h2>Will Coinbase Relist XRP?</h2>
<p>According to an Amicus Curiae in the XRP lawsuit, Attorney John Deaton cleared the air over the Settlement calls. He claims that the only time a settlement would happen in this case will be after Judge Torres&#8217;s decision. However, it would be hard for the U.S. SEC Chair to agree that ongoing future XRP sales are not securities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the commission is<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-xrp-lawyer-bids-in-for-coinbase-referring-ripple-case-filing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> facing pressure from crypto exchange Coinbase</a> over providing regulatory clarity regarding crypto trading and dealing. It should be noted that Coinbase delisted XRP when the U.S. SEC announced the legal actions against Ripple Labs and XRP. It would be tough for the commission to reverse its claims of the XRP after 2 years. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/?utm_source=menubar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP Lawsuit News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>

<p>The attorney added Coinbase Kraken relisting XRP completely depends on the ruling and U.S. SEC’s appeal after it. However, the ruling will also decide Bank of America’s decisions if Judge Torres gets overturned after commission’s appeal.</p>
<p>A settlement would purely depend on the SEC’s decision of considering the future sales of XRP as non securities.</p>

The Fed is expected to deliver another <strong>25 bps rate hike</strong> and markets await whether Fed Chair <strong>Jerome Powell</strong> is hawkish or dovish amid the banking crisis and debt ceiling crisis risking an &#8220;economic catastrophe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ethereum price and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altcoins</a> will follow suit, bringing an overall crypto market correction amid the looming Fed interest rate decision. Also, there&#8217;s no support from whales as they are continuously selling.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price To Break Further Ahead US Fed Rate Decision</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-braces-for-4-6-billion-bitcoin-and-ethereum-options-expiry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoinGape Media reported earlier</a>, the market will remain under selling pressure and volatile for several days from the monthly expiry on April 28 to the <strong>U.S. Federal Reserve’s</strong> rate hike monetary policy decision on May 3.</p>
<p>In the daily timeframe, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> broke below the key 50-MA level at $28.2k after failing to hold above the <strong>20-MA</strong> at $29k. BTC price fell to a 24-hour low of $27,680 after breaking the key level. The price is currently trading at $28,011, down 2% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Bitcoin price is also showing weakness at 1-hr and 4-hr timeframes, with <strong>RSI</strong> moving near the oversold region.</p>

<p><strong>Bollinger Bands</strong> and other technical indicators are also painting a bearish picture ahead of significant macro events this week. Traders need to watch the key support level at <strong>$27.2k</strong>. If the BTC price breaks below this level, the price will fall to <strong>$26k</strong> to bring a market correction.</p>

<p>Moreover, analyst <strong>Ali Martinez</strong> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1653178905564528640" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a> that the <span class="link-complex-target">Bitcoin</span> whale transaction count of $1 million or more has been falling since March 22. This trend has various implications for <span class="link-complex-target">BTC price</span> such as declined trading activity among large holders or a possible shift in market sentiment.</p>

<h2>Macro Impacting BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin trading volume continues to decline as <strong>US Dollar Index</strong> (<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DXY</a>) rises above 102 on strong US data and expectations of another 25 bps rate hike by the US Fed. As per the <strong>CME</strong> <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data</a>, the probability of a 25 bps rate hike has jumped to almost 95% amid the recent buyout of <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-declines-amid-jpmorgan-pncs-first-republic-bank-buyout-bid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank by JPMorgan</a>, which is the second-biggest bank failure in U.S. history.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>US 10-year Treasury yields</strong> rose to the 3.55% level amid high inflation and eased concerns over turmoil in the banking sector.</p>

Binance said that someone has been using AI to wage a disinformation campaign against the platform.</p>
<p>Speaking to <em><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/01/binance-claims-to-be-target-of-chatgpt-based-smear-campaign-in-washington-d-c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune</a> </em>magazine, Binance said that they have received several requests on whether Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao was an official member of the Chinese Communist Party. Besides, there has been a flurry of inquiries from the congressional offices recently that points to a purported conversation wherein the OpenAI platform ChatGPT reported that Binance founder CZ build a social media platform for the China National Petroleum Corporation.</p>
<p>Patrick Hillman, the chief strategy officer at <a href="https://coingape.com/companies/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a> has recently come out lashing at ChatGPT sharing the details of the chat. He blamed ChatGPT for pulling out information from a fake LinkedIn profile of CZ as well as a non-existent Forbes article.</p>
<h3>The Details of the chat with ChatGPT</h3>
<p>In a conversational chat with the OpenAI&#8217;s chatbot platform, Hillman asked whether CZ was really a member of the Youth League Committee of the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).</p>
<p>Citing public information, ChatGPT said that he was indeed a member of the CNPC while working at the company in the 90s.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We respond to A LOT of stupid inquiries here, but this is really special. Thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/FortuneMagazine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FortuneMagazine</a> for actually digging into this. Would love for someone to figure out who is behind this. </p>
<p>More details in <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/kDbAEjgkkV">https://t.co/kDbAEjgkkV</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>When asked where this information is available, ChatGPT said that it was publicly available pointing out the fake LinkedIn profile of Changpen Zhao. It also claimed that the information is available in several news articles and interviews.</p>
<p>Later, ChatGPT goes on to point out CZ&#8217;s interview with Forbes, wherein CZ mentions his past stint with CNPC. Citing the fake LinkedIn profile, ChatGPT said that CZ mentioned his role at CNPC as a &#8220;Software Developer&#8221;.</p>
<p>Later, ChatGPT points out a Forbes link that claims that the story doesn&#8217;t exist. This is now of the interesting cases which shows that not everything that ChatGPT shows is real. Thus, one must do due diligence with fact-checking the real information.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>A Coinbase insider has recently filed a new lawsuit naming Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) insiders including Chairman and CEO Brian Armstrong for using insider information to avoid $1 billion in losses during the stock&#8217;s public listing two years ago. The investor filed the complaint on Monday, May 1, in Delaware Chancery Court.

<p>The investor filed the complaint on Monday, May 1, in Delaware Chancery Court. Furthermore, the investor argues that the company&#8217;s board went for direct listing instead of a typical public listing through an initial public offering. Also, Coinbase rapidly sold off $2.9 billion in stock before Coinbase management later revealed: “material, negative information that destroyed market optimism from the company’s first quarterly earnings release forward”.</p>
<p>In the derivative complaint filed in the Delaware court, the investor seeks the return of “ill-gotten gains” from Coinbase co-founder Brian Armstrong. The lawsuit also names other Coinbase executives along with the co-founder of VC giant Andreessen Horowitz.</p>
<h3>Coinbase and Customer Privacy Violations</h3>
<p>On Monday, there was another lawsuit filed against Coinbase in federal court in San Francisco. The lawsuit accesses Coinbase for collecting fingerprints and face templates of customers for violating Illinois’ biometric privacy law.</p>
<p>The lawsuit mentions that Coinbase harvested facial data from government-issued IDs and selfies that customers uploaded during the signup process. It also notes that Coinbase harvested the fingerprint data after customers logged into their accounts using fingerprint-scanning technology.</p>
<p>As per the landmark Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, companies need to take customers&#8217; consent before collecting biometrics. They also need to inform customers how long they intend to keep the information.</p>
<p>The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/coinbase-sued-for-privacy-violations-over-customer-biometrics-1.1914678" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">complaint</a> notes: “Coinbase has created, collected, and stored thousands of ‘face templates’ – highly detailed geometric maps of the face – and fingerprints from countless Illinois residents”.</p>
<p>The lawsuit adds that Coinbase&#8217;s collection and storage of this data would expose users to “serious and irreversible privacy risks,” such as identity theft in the case of a data breach.</p>

Earlier, CoinGape <a href="https://coingape.com/us-supreme-court-agrees-to-abolish-us-sec-cftcs-powers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the top court agreed to consider cutting down powers enjoyed by federal regulatory agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These two agencies have already initiated enforcement actions against crypto businesses, including the likes of Binance, Coinbase and Kraken.</p>

<p>In this context, a shift in the US regulatory power structure could potentially have a major impact on ongoing legal disputes like the XRP Vs SEC lawsuit and the Grayscale spot Bitcoin ETF. The new Supreme Court consideration is about abolishing an old ruling that gives rule making powers to the agencies.</p>
<h2>XRP Lawsuit Impact</h2>
<p>Starting October 2023, the US Supreme Court will take up the case that could potentially reverse a ruling that gave the likes of SEC to define their own powers. The idea is to draft new operational guidelines for the agencies, including the financial watchdogs. Therefore, if the SEC’s power to define which cryptocurrencies are securities is curbed, the new Supreme Court appeal could mark a daunting change for the crypto ecosystem in the United States. Already, the XRP community had pinned hopes on a positive outcome in the pending Summary Judgement in SEC lawsuit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="800" height="500" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02022841/KryptoMoney.com-USA-Cryptocurrencies-California.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="crypto news" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><strong>Crypto News: </strong>According to on-chain data, the Bitcoin exchange reserve ratio for US vs offshore platforms has been declining recently. This comes in the midst of a rampant regulatory crackdown on businesses offering crypto services in the United States &#8212; which seems to have shaken investors&#8217; confidence in the market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Exchange Reserve Ratio Drops</h2>
<p>As noted by an analyst in a CryptoQuant <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/644ebbea12ca611e26454cd0-Bitcoin-reserve-in-American-exchanges-is-decreasing" rel="nofollow">report</a>, the BTC reserve of the US-based exchanges has been decreasing. The &#8220;exchange reserve ratio&#8221; is the relevant indicator in this case rather than the actual exchange reserve. This indicator provides information about the ratio between the exchange reserves of two specified sets of platforms, as its name suggests. According to the on-chain data shared, the American and international <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/">crypto exchanges</a> are the two sets of exchanges being compared.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?" href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-dev-teases-ai-app-chain-block-entropy/" rel="bookmark">LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>When the value of this ratio rises, it indicates that there are more coins available on US-based platforms than there are on offshore exchanges. This logically implies that American platforms are receiving more deposits or in other words, lesser withdrawals than those from other countries. However, the metric&#8217;s declining value indicates that global platforms are currently experiencing a greater increase in their reserves than US-based exchanges.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146820" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/02031338/Jlrsd_48cb20eea57d2494519cbca4a2795cf3398cbe7431f9f2184a7f1e22048288ed.webp" alt="" width="1280" height="806" /></p>
<p>The Bitcoin exchange reserve ratio for these two groups of sites has been declining since the first half of 2022, as shown in the graph above. This suggests that in comparison to overseas platforms, the supply on US-based exchanges has been steadily falling. At the time of writing, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price</a> is currently exchanging hands at $27,984.12 with a market cap of $541 billion.</p>
<h2>Fear Brews As Crackdowns Widen</h2>
<p>While U.S. investors are limited to using crypto platforms outside of their jurisdiction, it&#8217;s assumed that most are switching to decentralized exchange protocols or storing their crypto in self-custody <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallets</a> in order to safeguard from unseen failures or collapses. Multiple reports have indicated that, the use of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">DEXs </a>such as Uniswap, Quickswap &amp; Pancake Swap has grown in recent times along with the use of hardware wallets.</p>
<p>The downfall in user trust has been especially severe after large collapses, which have led to the bankruptcy of some key platforms and the spread of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/">FUD</a> throughout the crypto market &#8212; thereby causing investors to withdraw their coins from centralized exchanges. The February proposal to bar financial advisors from dealing in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a> and the possibility of legal action against certain <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> products are recent instances of the SEC&#8217;s enforcement actions.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the latest crypto news, SPAC King Chamath Palihapitiya famously stated &#8220;Crypto is dead in America&#8221;.  This comes after the SEC Chair <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/gary-gensler/">Gary Gensler</a> blamed the entire banking crisis solely on crypto. &#8220;The United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto&#8221;, he further added.</p>

According to a press <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20230501_33" rel="nofollow">statement</a> issued by OFAC, the platform committed over 66,000 violations of multiple sanctions programs. These violations allowed customers from Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria to trade up to a total $15 million between January 2014 and November 2019, the report states.</p>
<h2>U.S. Treasury Announces Settlement</h2>
<p>The Treasury Department highlighted that Poloniex&#8217;s operations started in January 2014, during which users were able to fund their accounts and engage in trading activity. However, Poloniex did not establish a sanctions compliance program until May 2015 &#8212; sixteen months after it had operated without maintaining any form of KYC. This program required a check of KYC information for new clients who reside in locations that are subject to extensive OFAC penalties but this screening procedure was not applied retroactively to previously existing customers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?" href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-dev-teases-ai-app-chain-block-entropy/" rel="bookmark">LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The OFAC further highlights that despite the fact that Poloniex made efforts to determine and restrict accounts with a nexus to Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Crimea and Syria &#8212; as part of its compliance program &#8212; some users seemingly located within these jurisdictions continued to use Poloniex’s platform to engage in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> transactions.</p>
<p>The OFAC&#8217;s official document was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a result, customers who had self-identified before May 2015 as residing in a sanctioned jurisdiction were generally able to continue using Poloniex’s platform.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto&#8217;s Growing Regulatory Woes</h2>
<p>With this new enforcement action, the regulatory body emphasized the importance &#8220;for new companies and those involved in emerging technologies to incorporate sanctions compliance into their business functions&#8221; from the very beginning. This is especially important when the companies seek to offer financial services to a global customer base, as was the case with other recent cases involving online digital asset companies, the OFAC said.</p>
<p>As things stand, Poloniex is held in ownership by an alliance of several businesses, one of which is Tron&#8217;s founder, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/justin-sun/">Justin Sun</a>. Prior to that, the American cryptocurrency corporation <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/circle/">Circle</a> had a brief ownership stake in Poloniex, although it decided to sell the company after a little under two years.</p>

This pattern consists of two converging trendlines, which squeeze the price action narrow for an imminent breakout. In theory, this pattern presents a higher possibility of upside breakout offering an entry opportunity to interested buyers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The ongoing correction in Dogecoin price will continue until the wedge pattern is intact</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish crossover between the 20-and-50-day may encourage price for a longer correction</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $323.5 Million, indicating a 30% gain.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">Dogecoin price</a> has been in a correction phase since last month</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and continues to resonate within the wedge pattern as it travels lower. The coin price bounced twice from the above trendline and thrice from the lower trendline indicate, the traders respect this bullish setup and follow its potential target as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent reversal from the lower trendline has set the DOGE price to a bull cycle with the pattern to rechallenge the overhead trendline, The Dogecoin price currently trades at $0.078 and is likely to rise another 6% to hit the above trendline.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/low-cap-crypto-gems-gunning-to-explode/">Low Cap Crypto Gems Gunning To Explode In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, interested traders waiting for an entry opportunity should wait for a breakout above the aforementioned trendline with a daily candle closing above. The potential breakout may signal upcoming recovery and set the DOGE price for a 33% rise to hit the $0.104 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below the support trendline will accelerate the selling pressure. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> dived deeper into the bearish territory reflecting a negative sentiment in the market</span></p>

Blend, a peer-to-peer lending protocol is dedicated to making the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/investing-in-nfts-a-beginners-guide-to-the-risks-and-returns/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Non-Fungible Tokens</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (NFTs) market more accessible to buyers and sellers alike.</span></p>
<h2><b>How Does the Protocol Works?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Blend, users are now able to take advantage of the technology to easily and safely buy, sell, and trade digital assets. As NFTs gain popularity, the need for a safe and secure platform to transact them has become increasingly important. Blend provides this exact service and combines smart contracts, blockchain technology, and decentralized protocols to offer a secure and safe environment. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only will users be able to effortlessly buy, sell, and trade different types of NFTs, but they can also use the platform to lend their digital assets. In order to use Blend, users will first need to create an account, log in, then choose the NFTs they wish to trade or borrow. However, those interested in borrowing need to provide collateral to back up the loan. Notably, all transactions are conducted through the platform and the user is protected via the smart contract technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it comes to fees associated with using Blend, the protocol is designed to charge competitive rates that are determined by the market supply and demand. As such, users are not being overcharged for their services. Furthermore, Blend provides financial opportunities for lenders to generate a yield for their assets</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Interestingly, the platform is available on both mobile devices and desktops, enabling users to access their accounts at any given time and place. All of these efforts by the platform, allow users to feel confident in their interactions with other parties as well as increases the overall liquidity of the market.</span></p>
<h2><b>Perceived Risks on Blur</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, there are few risks associated with the lending protocol, especially when borrowers refuse to pay back the stipulated loan. The interest accrued will exceed the value of the NFT and will eventually lead to the loss of the NFT if nothing is done.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recall that a few months ago, Blur </span><a href="https://coingape.com/blur-surpasses-opensea-growth-hedera-hbar-nft/"><span style="font-weight: 400">gained a lot of attention </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">due to its meteoric rise in popularity after conducting an airdrop which resulted in a significant increase in its trading volumes. The NFT platform also </span><a href="https://coingape.com/blur-season-2-airdrop-details/"><span style="font-weight: 400">announced </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">that there will be a second season of the airdrop.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto News: On Monday, May 1, the leading NFT Marketplace Blur announced a new lending protocol for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  The platform, which goes by the name Blend, is designed to enable traders to increase the amount of NFT liquidity available to them by enabling buyers to provide collateral for their token transactions.

Potential consumers who were previously left out of pricey <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/">NFT collections</a> such as Bored Ape Yacht Club, Loot &amp; CryptoPunk NFTs will now be able to participate in the ecosystem as a result of this development.</p>
<h2>Blur Launches Blend NFT Protocol</h2>
<p>According to the white paper for the project, the protocol permits perpetual lending. This means that loans do not have a predetermined date when they must be repaid, thereby &#8220;allowing borrowing positions to remain open indefinitely until liquidated, with market-determined interest rates.&#8221;</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Experts Predict More Bank Runs, Will FED Hike Interest Rates?" href="https://coingape.com/experts-predict-more-bank-runs-will-fed-hike-interest-rates/" rel="bookmark">Experts Predict More Bank Runs, Will FED Hike Interest Rates?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>As per the inner workings of the protocol, borrowers have the ability to repay their loans at any moment, while lenders have the option to pull out their positions by initiating a &#8220;Dutch auction to find a new lender at a new rate&#8221;. In the event that the auction is not successful, the borrower&#8217;s assets will be liquidated, and the lender will assume ownership of the collateral.</p>
<h2>Blend To Charge Zero Fees</h2>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a> Blur stated that the product was developed in conjunction with Dan Robinson, who is the head of research at the venture capital firm Paradigm and an investor in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange (DEX)</a> Uniswap. Additionally, Blur stated that the product was developed in conjunction with the pseudonymous research associate Transmissions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">8/ Blend has 0 fees for borrowers and lenders.</p>
<p>Like the Blur marketplace, Blend fees are controlled by <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BLUR&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BLUR</a> holders and can be turned on after 180 days.</p>
<p>Blend’s code is licensed under BSL like Uniswap V3. Additional use grants are governed by <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BLUR&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$BLUR</a> holders. <a href="https://t.co/M3sewgPP04">pic.twitter.com/M3sewgPP04</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Blur (@blur_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1653051838189703169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Blend will not charge any fees to traders or lenders, and therefore help in deepening the Blur brand&#8217;s integration into the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/">decentralized finance (DeFi)</a> industry. The Blend protocol will go live on Blur as the Season 2 Airdrop reaches an end.</p>

Though this downfall can temporarily pause recovery in several cryptocurrencies the overall market sentiment remained bullish. Amid a higher possibility for an uptrend resuming here are top crypto coins whose bullish setup could offer a significant rally in the near future. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xrp(XRP) </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/pkPY0CyY.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> has been in a correction phase for over a month and plunged to local support of $0.433. However, this bearish pullback shows sustainability above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and keeps the overall sentiment bullish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the XRP price maintained the bullish pattern called the double bottom as mentioned in our previous article. By the press time, the XRP price trades at $0.459 but under the influence of pattern, the coin price should rise 20% to challenge the $0.55 neckline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the aforementioned resistance will signal a bullish rally to $0.8.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polkadot (DOT)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/4/4W5TQa7i.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a year <a href="https://coingape.com/price/polkadot/#:~:text=DOT%20Price%20Trends%20%3A,trading%20volume%20of%20%24194%2C926%2C034%20USD.">Polkadot coin price</a> has been forming an inverted head and shoulder pattern. The neckline of this pattern is the key resistance that carries the ongoing downtrend in DOT price.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the DOT price trades at the $5.74 mark, and under the influence of the chart pattern it should rise 15% to rechallenge the aforementioned neckline resistance. A potential breakout from the overhead resistance signals an early sign of trend reversal and surges the prices for potential gain to $8, followed by $9.67 or $10.85</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cosmos (ATOM)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/BZVct4dd.png" />Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the Cosmos coin price shows a textbook example of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>. The price has gradually narrowed between the pattern’s converging trendline preparing for a decisive breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the sideways trend, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> rising indicated a higher possibility for an upside breakout from this pattern. As of now, the ATOM price trades at $10.99 but in response to this pattern, the prices should offer a decisive breakout from the pattern resistance trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential breakout may signal an upcoming recovery rally and surge the ATOM price to $26 mark.</span></p>

However, financial gurus and market experts predict that there could be additional bank runs in addition to what the United States has witnessed over the past sixty days &#8212; giving rise to the possibility of the Fed hiking <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/interest-rate/">interest rates</a> amid the burgeoning banking shakeup.</p>
<h2>Banking Crisis To Deepen?</h2>
<p>Larry McDonald, a prominent market researcher and the founder of The Bear Traps Report, has voiced his concern regarding the FDIC&#8217;s desire to allow JPMorgan to take over more than 10% of deposits made by US citizens. McDonald brings up the special exemption the banking giant acquired from the FDIC, which further proves the existence of inherent desperation as the buyout bids over the weekend turned out to be incredibly weak. An unfruitful bidding could have made FRC wind up in government receivership.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?" href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-dev-teases-ai-app-chain-block-entropy/" rel="bookmark">LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>In addition, while discussing his perspectives on the upcoming FOMC meeting, McDonald expressed his suspicion that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> needs to &#8220;tone down&#8221; their rate hikes because anything on the hawkish side might result in an even greater degree of financial instability in the market. Recently, the banking regulator issued a cease-and-desist order to Cross River Bank, which is a partner of financial technology companies and crypto enterprises. The directive was issued due to the agency&#8217;s firm belief in &#8220;unsafe or unsound&#8221; practices in relation to fair-lending rules. The FDIC stated on Friday that the bank had failed to develop and maintain &#8220;internal controls, information systems, and prudent credit underwriting practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 57-year-old investment stalwart further hinted at the possibility that the Fed projects the hike as the last tight before a pause.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the overall general consensus in the market is a rate hike of 25bps and the same is reflected on the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" rel="nofollow">CME FedWatch Tool</a> which shows an overwhelming majority of respondents, about 89% of them, voting in favor of a 25 bps rate hike.</p>
<p>In related news, the Fed swaps indicate almost a two-in-three chance of a pause in June following a rate hike in May. Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, will make the announcement regarding the decision to raise interest rates on Wednesday at 18:00 UTC.</p>

Already, several CEOs and company executives in various crypto companies have come to a conclusion that only the judicial action could land respite from the regulatory scrutiny. Since January 1, 2023, the US SEC initiated numerous enforcement actions against crypto businesses, going to the extent of settling charges with the likes of top crypto exchange Kraken.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/first-ever-crypto-themed-shark-tank-show-announced-here-are-details" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>First Ever Crypto Themed Shark Tank Show Announced; Here Are Details</strong></a></p>
<p>As recently as March 2023, leading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-exchange-2/#:~:text=A%20crypto%20exchange%20is%20a,well%20as%20other%20digital%20assets." target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto exchange</a> Binance and its chief executive officer Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, were dragged into a lawsuit over regulatory violation by the CFTC. Another top exchange Coinbase also received a Wells notice, a warning before possible enforcement action, from the US SEC.</p>
<h2>US Supreme Court Could Indirectly Intervene In XRP VS SEC Lawsuit</h2>
<p>In a fresh move, US Supreme Court is considering getting rid of a legal doctrine that gives regulatory agencies like the US SEC and the CFTC bandwidth to decide on their own regulatory purview. In the case of CFTC, the agency&#8217;s chair Rostin Behnam recently told a Senate committee that Ethereum is a commodity, in sharp contrast to the US SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s argument that all tokens except Bitcoin fall under the securities laws. With this, the two agencies effectively got into a clash over which crypto tokens to be governed by whom.</p>
<p>Hence, the new Supreme Court <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/supreme-court-to-consider-toppling-precedent-curbing-agencies?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">consideration</a>, which which is to reverse the 1984 Chevron vs Natural Resources Defense Council ruling, will rob agencies like SEC and CFTC of having the final say in matters where there is no reasonable justification or clarity as per law, as per a Bloomberg report.</p>

<p>Reacting on the development, John Deaton, the attorney representing over 70,000 XRP token holders in the SEC lawsuit, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1653046047852179456?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> this move by the top court could be something huge for the crypto market. Overall, any developments to this effect around the SEC and CFTC powers to regulate crypto could have a major impact on the XRP lawsuit.</p>
<p>On the other side, the US SEC has been constantly expressing its views on &#8220;come forward and register stance.&#8221; In contrast to the majority industry opinion, the Gary Gensler led agency says the existing securities laws are applicable to the crypto market.</p>

This chart pattern is often spotted at the market top for trend reversal and offers an excellent short-selling opportunity upon the breakdown of its support trendline. Here’s how you may trade this pattern threatening the ETH price for longer correction.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the increasing selling pressure, the Ethereum price forms a lower high at $1940, reflecting an early sign of trend reversal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakdown below $1842 support will intensify the selling pressure and threaten the Ethereum price for a longer correction</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $8.97 Billion, indicating a 97.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/o/oIJhctuV.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum price</a> witnessed an intraday loss of 1.5% and showed a breakdown attempt from the $1842 neckline support of the head and shoulder pattern. If the daily candle close below the aforementioned support, the sellers will gain an additional barrier to pressure down the coin buyers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interested sellers can look for entry opportunities below $1842 as the accelerated supply pressure may encourage the Ethereum price for longer correction. In ideal conditions, this pattern offers a sharp downfall of the same distance between the head and neckline measured from the breakdown point.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-declines-amid-jpmorgan-pncs-first-republic-bank-buyout-bid/">Bitcoin Declines Amid JPMorgan, PNC’s First Republic Bank Buyout Bid</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained selling, the ETH price may tumble 15% to hit the $1550-1500 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the coin price manages to sustain above $1842, a breakout above the immediate resistance of $1940 will undermine the bearish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A downtick in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> as it plunges below the midline reflects negative sentiment among market participants.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A potential breakdown below $1842 will also plunge below the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope offering an extra edge to short sellers.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum Coin Price Intraday Levels-</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1843</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $1940 and $2011</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $1840 and $1770</span></li>

With the latest burn, the Terra Luna Classic community total LUNC burn has reached almost <strong>55 billion</strong>. Binance has burned <strong>31.83 billion</strong> LUNC tokens. Traders didn&#8217;t immediately respond to the latest LUNC burn by Binance.</p>
<h2>Binance Burns 1.2 Billion Terra Classic (LUNC) Tokens</h2>
<p>Binance sent 1.612 billion Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) tokens to the burn address, contributing to reducing the LUNC <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulating supply</a>, as the burn <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finder.terra.money/classic/tx/6C38E169A0319E8B29B24CC737CBA2C3E8B3741651F941F48DF62252C9F64B15" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transaction</a>. It also includes a transaction fee of 2.53 million LUNC. Notably, the 9th batch of the LUNC burn mechanism is for the period March 31 to April 29, 2023. Binance has burned over 31.83 billion Terra Classic tokens in total from spot and margin trading fees.</p>
<p>The decline in the LUNC burn rate by Binance is due to a fall in spot and market trading volume in April. The Terra Classic witnessed an overall decline in the burn rate as contributions to the LUNC burn campaign fell. The exchange burning 50% of the LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100% also causing the LUNC burn rates to fall.</p>
<p>Last month, Binance burned 1.6 billion LUNC tokens. Also, <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-burns-8-85-billion-terra-luna-classic-lunc-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance burned 8.85 billion</a> Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), which marked the official return of Binance LUNC burns this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Terra Classic community primarily focusing on increasing bringing back utility to the chain. The new <strong>Joint L1 Task Force</strong> developer group is following the footsteps of core developer Edward Kim and Tobias &#8220;Zaradar&#8221; Anderson, who left the developer group last month. The developer group is targeting <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-classic-devs-announces-major-upgrades-price-to-hit-0-0005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major updates in May</a> including the <strong>Cosmwasm v1.1.0 upgrade (parity)</strong> on May 31, which will allow projects and builders across Cosmos and Terra Luna 2.0 to once again build on the Terra Classic chain.</p>
<h2>LUNC Price to Hit $1</h2>
<p>The Terra Classic community looks to revive LUNC and <a href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-terra-ust-repeg-proposal-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USTC to $1</a>, but the community needs to work continuously for many months in order to achieve the target. The developments are still in the early phase as per the <a href="https://coingape.com/official-terra-classic-lunc-revival-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terra Classic Revival Roadmap</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/price/Terra-luna-classic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LUNC price</a> fell 3% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.000107. The 24-hour low and high are $0.000106 and $0.000112, respectively. However, the trading volume has increased in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The price is trading below the key support level of $0.00012. Until the price recovers over the support, LUNC price will continue to be under pressure.</p>

BIT Mining already operates some LD series of ASIC mining machines that were designed by the company and work specifically on the DOGE and LTC blockchain. They offer high hash rates and energy efficiency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This latest model has undergone extensive testing periods to prove its superiority over previous versions, hence the launch of the hardware. Altogether, BIT Mining has rolled out three models of LD-specific ASIC mining machines since last year when it acquired Bee Computing, a mining hardware producer. With each model, there is a significant advancement that is introduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Xianfeng Yang, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the mining company explained that &#8220;With each new model of mining machine that BTCM develops, we further calibrate our expertise, gaining additional experience with manufacturing products that help contribute to essential blockchain networks. The sophistication of our new model LD4 mining machine is currently unmatched in our industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As one of the world&#8217;s top cryptocurrency mining machine brands, we remain committed to continuing to develop new mining machines with the latest technology and promoting improved efficiency across the industry,&#8221;  he added.</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><b>Bit Mining LD4 Comes With Upgraded Features</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike the LD3 model which has a power efficiency of 0.73 W/MH, the LD4 model has blazed a new trail with an efficiency of 0.71 W/MH. Also, LD4 has the capacity of reaching a maximum output of 5GH/s while LD3 can only stretch to about 4800 MH/s. The benefits of this latest model include even its design features which promote better heat dissipation, allowing the computing chip to run at relatively lower temperatures for long hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In turn, this promotes a longer lifecycle for the LD4 model machines.
