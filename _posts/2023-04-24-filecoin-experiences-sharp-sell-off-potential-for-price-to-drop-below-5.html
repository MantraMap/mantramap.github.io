The demand must recover in the next trading sessions for FIL to jump above the $5.50 price. The decline in the market capitalization of Filecoin over the past day also indicates growing selling pressure. Broader market strength remains crucial for the altcoin&#8217;s price movement over the subsequent trading sessions. Filecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the trading price for FIL was $5.26. Following its drop below the $6 mark, Filecoin has experienced a continuous free fall. The coin faces overhead resistance at $5.60; surpassing this level will push the coin towards $6, with a potential attempt to trade at $6.30. Conversely, failing to trade at the current level will establish local support for the coin at $4.90. If the price falls below this level, it will reach $3.80, strengthening the bears. In the last session, the amount of Filecoin traded was in the red, indicating a drop in demand. Technical Analysis Over the past few trading sessions, the buying strength for FIL has decreased considerably due to a fall in demand.
