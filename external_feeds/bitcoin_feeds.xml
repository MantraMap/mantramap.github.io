<h2>’Sanctions Against Russia Are a Double-Edged Sword’</h2>
<p>Andrey Kostin, the chairman of state-controlled VTB, Russia’s second-largest bank, talked about the U.S. banking crisis and the effects of Western sanctions on Russia in a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Kostin told Putin:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are actively creating a new payments and settlements infrastructure involving rubles and currencies of friendly states.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We have the necessary expertise and infrastructure for this because we are present in major Asian countries, such as China and India, and we are present in the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] countries. We are therefore working actively in this sphere,” the VTB Bank chairman detailed.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of U.S. sanctions on Russia, Kostin said, “We have probably become somewhat immune.” He described: “Sanctions against Russia are a double-edged sword. In effect, by using sanctions against Russia, the West has demolished the global trade system and caused an inflation surge.” The VTB executive continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Look at what is now happening in the United States. This is virtually the largest financial and banking crisis since 2008, and it is already spreading to Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Western attempts to resolve this problem by standard methods devalued bank assets, and we can see the result of this,” he opined.</p>
<p>The VTB president further informed Putin: “Our banking sector is feeling quite safe. I do not think that there will be any problems, although we incurred certain losses last year when our property was simply taken away from us.”</p>

<p>Kostin additionally revealed: “We now have to learn to work in a new way. I believe that it is possible to considerably reshape the financial system in several years.”</p>
<p>The VTB Bank chief added that the bank no longer issues loans in Western currencies, emphasizing that “it is impossible to take out such loans.” He concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are expanding the ruble market, and we are starting to work with the yuan and other currencies. This process is going on, and I think, it is picking up pace. Today, rubles account for over 50 percent of payments and settlements with friendly countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>In June, Kostin predicted the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-banker-predicts-end-of-dollar-dominance-as-global-power-shifts/">end of the U.S. dollar dominance</a> as global power shifted. He expects the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-yuan-to-replace-us-dollar-as-worlds-reserve-currency-says-russian-banker/">Chinese yuan</a> to displace the U.S. dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency.</p>

<h2>Labor Department’s CPI Data Shows 3% Inflation Rate for June</h2>
<p>Inflation in the United States continues to cool, according to the latest Consumer Price Index report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. Inflation has fallen consecutively each month since June 2022. The inflation rate in June 2022 was 9.1%, but the latest CPI statistics show it has dropped to 3%.</p>
<p>“The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) rose 0.2 percent in June on a seasonally adjusted basis, after increasing 0.1 percent in May,” the CPI report <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">details</a>. “Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 3.0 percent before seasonal adjustment.”</p>

<p>Stocks performed well after the news Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and Russell 2000 all closing in positive territory. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.74%, the Russell 2000 jumped 1.05%, the Nasdaq increased by 1.15%, and the Dow, while the lowest, still gained 0.25%. The CPI report is credited with boosting Wall Street&#8217;s sentiment.</p>
<p>Gold and silver also <a href="https://www.kitco.com/market/">saw gains</a> on July 12, with gold rising 1.3% and silver increasing 4.13%. The global <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/">cryptocurrency market</a> capitalization fell 0.77% over the last day, dropping to $1.18 trillion. Bitcoin lost 0.61% in the past 24 hours, and Ethereum shed 0.25% against the U.S. dollar. Both leading crypto assets remained rangebound and had shown lackluster performance on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“There has been significant progress made on the inflation front, and today’s report confirmed that while most of the country is dealing with hotter temperatures outside, inflation is finally cooling,” George Mateyo, chief investment officer at Key Private Bank <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/12/inflation-rose-just-0point2percent-in-june-less-than-expected-as-consumers-get-a-break-from-price-increases.html">told</a> CNBC on Wednesday.</p>

<h2>Biden Celebrates Cooling Inflation, But Critics Question the Real Impact on Middle Class</h2>
<p>Following the report, U.S. president Joe Biden and the White House were quick to take credit for the falling inflation figures. “Today, we learned annual inflation has fallen 12 straight months to 3% – the lowest in over two years,” Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1679164979218464776?s=20">tweeted</a>. “I ran for office to grow the economy from the middle out and bottom up, not the top down: that’s exactly what we’re doing. Bidenomics in action.”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-597534 size-full" title="US Inflation Hits Two-Year Low, Boosting Stocks and Precious Metals" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dcx.jpg" alt="US Inflation Hits Two-Year Low, Boosting Stocks and Precious Metals" width="1280" height="350" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dcx-300x82.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dcx-1024x280.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dcx-768x210.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/dcx.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Not everyone was impressed with Biden&#8217;s tweet on Wednesday. “Everyone spending 5 minutes in a grocery store knows this number is a lie and manipulated,” one user <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoBull2020/status/1679166131326664716?s=20">replied</a> to Biden. “Inflation is way over 20%.” Another individual <a href="https://twitter.com/TheKevinDalton/status/1679176855776292865?s=20">said</a>: “Bidenomics in action is our families not being able to afford food, gas, or other necessities. Bidenomics has broken the back of the middle class.”</p>

<h2>Economist Expects US Dollar to Lose ‘Dominant World Currency’ Status</h2>
<p>S&amp;P Global&#8217;s chief economist, Paul Gruenwald, shared his prediction about the end of the U.S. dollar&#8217;s dominance at a conference hosted by the ratings firm in London on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar &#8220;doesn&#8217;t have quite the pull it used to … There&#8217;s a fragmentation around the edges,” the economist stated, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got other things happening outside of the dollar world.</p></blockquote>
<p>The implementation of aggressive U.S. sanctions, including the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-reserves/sanctions-have-frozen-around-300-bln-of-russian-reserves-finmin-says-idUSL5N2VG0BU">freezing</a> of Russia&#8217;s reserves worth around $300 billion last year, has prompted numerous countries to de-dollarize and increase the use of national currencies in trade settlements.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P Global economist highlighted a trend of countries moving away from the U.S. dollar, exemplified by the rising utilization of the Chinese yuan in international trade. Moreover, he pointed out that development banks based in China offer cheap financing options, including the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank (also known as the BRICS Bank).</p>

<p>While noting that the U.S. dollar “will continue to be a leading world currency,” the economist stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>It will no longer be the dominant world currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the BRICS economic bloc is working on a common currency that many believe will erode the dominance of the U.S. dollar. Rich Dad Poor Dad author <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-warns-us-dollar-will-die-citing-brics-nations-plan-to-launch-gold-backed-currency/">Robert Kiyosaki</a> said on Tuesday that the U.S. dollar &#8220;will die&#8221; citing the BRICS nations&#8217; alleged plan to launch a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">gold-backed currency</a>. A study by asset management firm <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/central-banks-reduce-us-dollar-holdings-plan-to-increase-chinese-yuan-exposure-study-shows/">Invesco</a> found that central banks are reducing their U.S. dollar holdings while planning to increase their Chinese yuan exposure. Renowned investor <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/renowned-investor-jim-rogers-warns-us-is-going-to-suffer-as-dollars-value-erodes-further/">Jim Rogers</a> has cautioned that the U.S. dollar&#8217;s value will erode further.</p>

<h2>Protocol in &#8216;Paused State&#8217;</h2>
<p>Rodeo Finance, a leveraged yield farming product, recently became the latest decentralized finance (defi) protocol to fall victim to the so-called force-investment hack after criminals stole approximately $1.7 million on July 10. As a consequence, the defi protocol has been placed in paused state &#8220;until a remediation plan has been finalized and implemented alongside the advice of multiple security experts.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

This, according to the protocol, means hackers took $830,000. Meanwhile, in the same statement, Rodeo Finance also explained how the cyber criminals were able to carry out the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The attack occurred because of one of our oracles meant to be twap for Camelot&#8217;s Uniswap v2 pools was sandwiched (a first on Arbitrum) just around it&#8217;s price update in order to inflate it&#8217;s price. This allowed the hacker to borrow from the lending pool and swap it all to said token, incurring heavy slippage but still going through because of the inflated oracle pricing,&#8221; Rodeo Finance said in a tweet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p>To cash out their profits, the attacker is said to have &#8220;arbitraged&#8221; the decentralized exchange’s pool back to the normal price. Rodeo Finance said it was able to recover $810,000 from the yield farm used for the attack.</p>
<p>Concerning the yet-to-be-recovered funds, Rodeo Finance said it is attempting to track and freeze the assets. It added that working with security auditors &#8220;to finalize the plan of recovery&#8221; is the next planned step.</p>

<h2>Silk Road Bitcoin Stash Controlled by the Feds Moves, Funds Reportedly Sent to Coinbase</h2>
<p>About 9,800 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> from Silk Road was <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/bc1qe7nk2nlnjewghgw4sgm0r89zkjzsurda7z4rdg">moved</a> in two transactions on Wednesday, reportedly sent to wallets controlled by Coinbase.

<p>The bitcoins came from <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/silk-road-hacker-sentenced-to-a-year-in-prison-for-wire-fraud/">James Zhong</a>, the convicted Silk Road hacker. At the time of his arrest, federal authorities seized about 51,351.89785803 bitcoins on three separate occasions, along with a collection of precious metals and $661,900 in cash.</p>

<p>Last March, the government sold 9,861 bitcoins for just over $200 million. The onchain activity four months prior was also detected by onchain observers and blockchain parsers. It&#x2019;s speculated that all the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> transferred from Zhong&#x2019;s stash has been sold on Coinbase.</p>

<p>The selling through Coinbase is unusual as the U.S. government typically auctions off <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> with assistance from the U.S. Marshals. For example, bitcoins seized from Ross Ulbricht in the Silk Road case were auctioned, with investors like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tim-draper-adjusts-timeframe-for-his-250k-bitcoin-price-forecast/">Tim Draper</a> purchasing some of the coins. Only recently has the government started moving cryptocurrency to spot exchanges.</p>

The stablecoin BUSD&#x2019;s supply has dropped below the 4 billion mark as the token&#x2019;s number of coins in circulation has fallen 16.7% over the last month.</strong></p>
<h2>Dollar-Pegged Cryptos Feel the Pinch as Supplies Shrink Steadily</h2>
<p>During the past ten days, the stablecoin economy shrank by $890 million after dropping from <a href="https://archive.li/lUlbr">$128.21 billion</a> to today&#x2019;s <a href="https://archive.ph/WmOXL">$127.32 billion</a>. Statistics show that the net value of the top dollar-pegged market capitalizations shrunk a great deal since the start of 2023.</p>
<p>On March 26, 2023, the stablecoin economy was worth <a href="https://archive.li/dPBDJ">$135.08 billion</a>, which means $7.76 billion has been removed from the dollar-pegged token economy over the past 108 days.</p>

<p>30-day statistics paint a similar story as four out of the top five stablecoins saw redemptions shrink their supplies. Tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>) saw a slight drop of 0.3%, while usd coin&#x2019;s (USDC) supply was reduced by 3.9%.</p>

<p>Makerdao&#x2019;s <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DAI/">DAI</a> saw a 5.6% reduction last month and BUSD&#x2019;s supply dropped by 16.7%. Trueusd&#x2019;s (TUSD) supply is still up 41.7% for the month but it has dropped under the 3 billion range to 2.88 billion tokens. Over the past 24 hours, the stablecoin economy recorded $26.42 billion in global trade volume.</p>
<p>With BUSD&#x2019;s supply dropping 16.7%, the supply is now under the 4 billion range with an approximate supply of 3,997,265,401 at the time of writing. <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/binanceusd/richlist/">Current data</a> shows that Binance holds 3,623,828,575 BUSD in six different wallets.</p>

<p>Furthermore, out of the 2.88 billion TUSD tokens circulating today, 2.45 billion TUSD is also <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/binance">held by Binance</a>. This means 90.65% of the BUSD tokens today are held by the world&#x2019;s largest exchange and 85.06% of the TUSD supply is controlled by Binance.</p>

Inflation fell by 1.0% from May, coming in at 3.0% last month. Polkadot also rose, extending its winning run for a third straight day.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>)</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>) rose by as much as 6% earlier in today&#x2019;s session. <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a>/USD surged to a peak of $289.49 earlier in the day, which comes following Tuesday&#x2019;s bottom at $271.44.</p>
<p>This rise in price has pushed the cryptocurrency towards a ceiling at $300.00, and closer to a recent 15-month high at $329.71.</p>

<p>From the chart, the move occurred after a marginal breakout of a ceiling at 68.00 on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 70.56, with the next visible point of resistance at 73.00.</p>
<p>Should this point be hit, there is a strong chance that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> will be trading at or over $300.00.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) rose for a third consecutive day during Wednesday&#x2019;s session, as price neared a one-week high.</p>
<p>After falling to a low at $5.13 on Tuesday, DOT/USD jumped to an intraday high of $5.30 earlier today.</p>
<p>This is the strongest level the token has hit since last Thursday, when it peaked at $5.37, marginally below a ceiling at $5.40.</p>

<p>Since today&#x2019;s peak, earlier gains have somewhat slipped, as a result of the RSI colliding with a ceiling at 55.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is at a reading of 54.55, with DOT now trading $0.05 lower than its previous high.</p>
<p>In the event this ceiling is broken, the next target for polkadot bulls will likely be $5.50.</p>

Clark was allegedly the senior advisor to the original Silk Road, an infamous darknet marketplace that operated from 2011 until 2013. Prosecutors from the office reported that Clark provided comprehensive advice to Silk Road&#8217;s founder, Ross Ulbricht, on “all aspects of the enterprise.”</strong></p>
<h2>Accused Silk Road Advisor Sentenced to 20 Years</h2>
<p>Attorney Damian Williams and the Southern District of New York (SDNY) have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/senior-adviser-operator-silk-road-online-black-market-sentenced-20-years-prison">announced</a> that Roger Clark was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiring to distribute massive quantities of narcotics using the Silk Road marketplace. Clark was reportedly the senior advisor of the Silk Road and he had several aliases including “Variety Jones,” “Plural of Mongoose,” and “cimon.”</p>
<p>Clark was described as the Silk Road mentor who allegedly advised Ross Ulbricht about the Silk Road’s security, technical infrastructure, and governance rules. Clark reportedly helped Ulbricht find a software engineer to improve the Silk Road as well. “Roger Thomas Clark was a central figure in helping to lead Silk Road,” attorney Williams said on Tuesday. “Today’s sentence is another reminder that criminal marketplaces, like Silk Road, are a road to prison.”</p>
<h2>Clark’s 2015 Revelations Reveal Rogue Officer ‘Diamond’ Remains on the Lam</h2>
<p>In September 2015 — Prior to Clark’s arrest in June 2018 — Clark reached out to the public from his hiding place in Thailand. Using the alias &#8220;Plural of Mongoose,&#8221; he made his presence known on a darknet market forum known as <a href="http://www.myplanetganja.com/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=11022&amp;start=120#p144158">Ganja forums</a>, divulging his fugitive status from international law enforcement. When the Thai New Year rolled around in April, Clark was blindsided by a message from an individual claiming to be an FBI agent, known only as &#8220;Chrysippus&#8221; or &#8220;Diamond.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clark claimed that Diamond, fully cognizant of his fugitive status, was privy to extensive information about the ongoing operations of several specific darknet marketplaces. Clark&#8217;s account also hinted at Diamond&#8217;s alleged association with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-agent-300000-btc-silk-road-pirates-treasure/">notorious rogue agents</a>, Carl Mark Force and Shaun Bridges. His 2015 narrative serves as a poignant reminder of the Silk Road investigation&#8217;s rampant ethical issues and the infiltration of double agents within law enforcement.</p>

<p>In an interview conducted in October 2019, Kathryn Haun, a former prosecutor for the Attorney General’s office, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/the-silk-road-investigation-a-pattern-of-bad-behavior-and-double-agents/">shed light</a> on the dubious roles of Force and Bridges, who were apprehended for their extortion of Silk Road administrators. Haun&#8217;s interview underscored the pervasiveness of unethical conduct and duplicity within the Silk Road inquiry, with agents like Force <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rogue-silk-road-agent-admits-to-stealing-bitcoins-seized-by-u-s-marshals/">assuming alter egos</a> such as &#8220;Death from Above.&#8221; Haun&#8217;s revelation prompts the public to ponder: Would the government&#8217;s evidence pool be as extensive without the manipulation and intrusion of double agents and rogue officers?</p>
<p>Moreover, Clark&#8217;s account of &#8220;Chrysippus&#8221; or &#8220;Diamond&#8221; — a rogue law enforcement official who managed to evade capture, unlike Force and Bridges — adds another layer to the narrative. Drawing parallels to Force, this official, who went by the name Diamond, exploited the administrators of darknet marketplaces, including the operators of the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/08/agora-dark-webs-biggest-drug-market-going-offline/">Agora</a> platform. In stark contrast to Force and Bridges, the maverick official known as Diamond continues to elude capture and incarceration.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) neared $31,000 in today&#x2019;s session, as traders were optimistic ahead of upcoming inflation data from the United States.</p>
<p>Following a low of $30,358.10 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD jumped to an intraday high of $30,831.81 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s move resulted in the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency breaking out of a key resistance level of $30,800.</p>

<p>Price has since fallen below this point, as the relative strength index (RSI) neared a ceiling at 62.00.</p>
<p>The index is now hovering at 61.98, with bulls hoping that there will be a breakout following the release of the consumer price index (CPI).</p>
<p>Should this occur, the price target will likely be at a resistance of $31,400.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also edged higher on hump-day, with the price once again closing in on the $1,900 zone.</p>
<p>So far today, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD peaked at $1,895.08, which was nearly 2% higher than Tuesday&#x2019;s low at $1,863.22.</p>
<p>Unlike bitcoin, ethereum&#x2019;s 14-day RSI has moved beyond its own ceiling of 52.00, and as of writing is tracking at 53.42.</p>

<p>This comes despite the 10-day (red) moving average (MA) being on the cusp of a downward crossover with the blue 25-day MA.</p>
<p>A crossover of this kind will likely be a bearish signal, and could prompt traders to abandon previous long positions.</p>

The entrepreneur commented on statements by the head of the Bank of International Settlements during an IMF meeting devoted to cross-border payments. </strong></p>
<h2>Balaji Srinivasan Speaks Out Against Centralized Control Over Money Through CBDCs</h2>
<p>Former chief technology officer at Coinbase, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/balaji-srinivasan-highlights-de-dollarization-past-of-bidens-top-economist/">Balaji Srinivasan</a>, voiced his concerns over central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) allowing monetary authorities to control money. On Tuesday, Srinivasan took to Twitter to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the head of BIS says ‘central banks will have absolute control’ over all uses of money, that’s not democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The American investor was referring to statements made by the General Manager of the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Agustín Carstens at a videoconference held by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2020.</p>
<p>Policymakers participating in the event, including the Fund’s Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, discussed future changes in cross-border payments coming with new technologies and the advent of digital currencies.</p>

<p>During the virtual meeting, Carstens pointed out that, unlike cash, with CBDCs central banks will have “absolute control on the rules and regulations that will determine the use of that expression of central bank liability” as well as “the technology to enforce that.”</p>
<p>“That’s when Keynesianism finally drops the mask and becomes flat out communism: total centralized control of all resources by unelected bureaucrats,” Srinivasan elaborated. His comments sparked a lively Twitter discussion on the topic:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">No amount of wordsmithing gets around the fact that CBDCs will be a massive blow to economic freedom. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. With CBDCs the Canadian truckers wouldn&#8217;t have even been able to buy a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>— SK (@SKmacro) <a href="https://twitter.com/SKmacro/status/1678631147851374592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>Balaji Srinivasan’s <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1678596191892946944">tweet</a> coincided with the release of a BIS <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bis-survey-93-of-the-worlds-central-banks-are-engaged-in-cbdc-work/">survey</a> on CBDCs and crypto assets. The institution, which facilitates cooperation between monetary authorities around the world, found that in 2022, 93% of 86 surveyed central banks were engaged in CBDC-related work and over half of them were already carrying out tests and pilots.</p>
