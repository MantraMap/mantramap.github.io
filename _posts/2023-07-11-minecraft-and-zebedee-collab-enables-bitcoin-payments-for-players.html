<p>Satoshis are now being given out as rewards on Satlantis, a unique Bitcoin-themed Minecraft server. This involves the collaboration of Bitcoin payments startup Zebedee and the Minecraft server to fuse the world of cryptocurrency with gaming.</p>
Rewards in bitcoin
<p>While offering over 1 million satoshis per week to winning players, their earnings may not be extravagant. However, it&rsquo;s a nifty bonus for playing one of the world's most popular video games. Appealing to the most dedicated gamers, this Bitcoin initiative adds a real twist to gameplay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Players are inspired by gameplay elements resembling Bitcoin mining rigs and mining pool collectives, with an added excitement of amping up their mining "hash rate" to win Bitcoin rewards in the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not offer substantial rewards, but this new trend connects the budding world of cryptocurrency with exciting gaming experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond Minecraft, Zebedee's cutting-edge gaming tech has been implemented in numerous mobile games as well as premier traditional games like Valve&rsquo;s Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Their technology has also enabled Bitcoin betting and won players Bitcoin rewards throughout 2021.</p>
Minecraft NFT ban?
<p>However, the relationship between the gaming world and cryptocurrency has experienced some turbulence. Minecraft's hinted NFT ban has led some servers and derivative initiatives to shift gears or close operations. For instance, NFT Worlds, which used to sell NFT-based land sections for a specific Minecraft server, ended up creating its own autonomous game.</p>
<p>Despite the prospective cryptocurrency ban, the likes of Satlantis are continuing their Bitcoin initiative. Whether they would continue unfazed in the face of an official ban remains unclear, as Zebedee representatives have not commented on any foreseeable implications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gaming industry and cryptocurrency may be charting unexpected courses according to Minecraft's potential restrictions, but it&rsquo;s clear that the intersection of these two worlds is ever-evolving, creating a fascinating and dynamic landscape.</p>
