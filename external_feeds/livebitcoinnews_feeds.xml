										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever since the Shapella upgrade, it appears <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/22/bitcoin-and-crypto-now-braced-for-a-parabolic-price-move-as-ethereum-institutional-interest-explodes/?sh=763cce763c7d" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">more institutions are interested</a> in Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Is Getting Way More Attention</h2>
<p>Ethereum is the world’s second largest digital currency by market cap and the primary competitor to bitcoin. Not long ago, the asset rose beyond the $2K mark for the first time in what felt like an eternity. The price boost stemmed <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-ethereum-shapella-upgrade-occurred-now-what/" data-wpel-link="internal">from a recent upgrade</a> to its network in which staked Ethereum units were suddenly available for withdrawal.</p>
<p>This has allegedly stirred the interest of institutional investors. According to Ali Martinez, a bitcoin and crypto analyst, the attention for both bitcoin and Ethereum have skyrocketed in recent weeks. Martinez mentioned in a recent Twitter post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reserve risk just crossed 0 again. This bitcoin indicator signals huge potential. When the bitcoin reserve risk moves above 0, it signals parabolic price moves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, it appears the recent activity of bitcoin has rubbed traders the wrong way. For example, not long ago, the world’s number one digital currency by market cap <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">rose to a ten-month</a> high of about $30K, though it failed to retain this position <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-falls-to-28k-analysts-are-wondering-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">and eventually dipped</a> into the high $20K range. Yuya Hasegawa – a crypto market analyst at Bit Bank – recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The market is struggling to find a reason to buy and support the price as profit-taking selling pressure and long liquidation have pushed down the price this week, while the U.S. stock market loses its direction. Unfortunately, despite the decline, bulls do not seem to have given up just yet as bitcoin futures market’s funding rate still reads positive, which could limit the upper potential for bitcoin and worsen its short-term drawdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>With activity and love for bitcoin going down in recent days, this has only paved the way for more institutional attention towards Ethereum, which was recently noted in a report by K33 research head Bendik Schei. The report says:</p>
<blockquote><p>As expected, Shanghai was followed by massive Ethereum withdrawals. The market overestimated the Shanghai selling pressure, leading Ethereum to outshine bitcoin on the backdrop of burgeoning institutional activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>In what appears to be a bonus maneuver, the Shapella upgrade <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/declining-bitcoin-ether-correlation-could-impact-crypto-investors-hedging-strategies-coinbase/ar-AA1afDEk" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">has further allowed</a> ETH to distance itself somewhat from BTC. Up to this point, Ethereum and bitcoin have long been correlated. When BTC goes up or down, ETH will usually follow suit, but this is arguably changing, as bitcoin – while traveling downward – is not affecting the bullish signs currently being noticed in Ethereum.</p>
<h2>The Separation of Two Coins</h2>
<p>Analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>The relevance of this falling correlation for institutional investors is that it can affect quantitative strategies that rely on cross hedging one asset for the other (or using ETH as a hedge for less liquid altcoins). It supports diversification arguments in favor of holding both BTC and ETH.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After receiving a hardcore message <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/chamath-palihapitiya-crypto-isnt-doing-well-in-america/" data-wpel-link="internal">of gloom and doom</a> earlier today, it appears not everyone is worried about the state of crypto, and some – such as Standard Chartered – believe assets like bitcoin are well on their way to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bitcoin-could-hit-100000-by-end-2024-standard-chartered-says/ar-AA1agwjl" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reaching new highs and</a> the tops of the world’s financial ladders.</p>
<h2>Standard Chartered on the State of BTC</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Standard Chartered issued a report claiming that the crypto winter of 2022 is officially over, and analysts foresee bitcoin reaching a whopping $100,000 per unit in the coming months. This would make a huge change from where the world’s number one digital currency by market cap was just six months ago.</p>
<p>During that time (the end of 2022), the crypto world was suffering like it never had before. Assets like BTC lost more than 70 percent of their value after reaching all-time highs during the previous November, and the crypto world was in a tailspin of depression. The industry lost more than $2 trillion in overall valuation, and many thought crypto was on the verge of going out for good.</p>
<p>However, 2023 has been a year of incredible turnaround, and while there’s still plenty of healing room, the fact remains that bitcoin and many of its digital assets have really recovered from the bearish trends that took them down heavily during the previous 12 months. BTC has recently hit a ten-month high of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-rose-to-30k-in-mid-april-analysts-discuss-why/" data-wpel-link="internal">about $30K</a>, and many analysts think the time has arrived for the crypto arena to receive its fair dues.</p>
<p>Geoff Kendrick – the head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered – explained in the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>While sources of uncertainty remain, we think the pathway to the USD 100,000 level is becoming clearer.</p></blockquote>
<p>He went on to suggest that bitcoin has recently garnered more steam behind its alleged “safe haven” status, which had been thinning out in recent months and years given the ugly state of the industry.</p>
<p>He also believes that bitcoin is once again being viewed as a “relative store of value and a means of remittance,” especially during the aftermath of the banking crisis which resulted in the collapse of <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">roughly three separate</a> banks in the U.S.</p>
<h2>What Will Push the Asset Forward?</h2>
<p>One of the big things that he thinks will contribute to the surging of bitcoin’s price is the recent set of regulations <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/european-union-passes-heavy-string-of-new-crypto-regulations/" data-wpel-link="internal">implemented by the European</a> Union (EU). The continental organization has become the first of its kind to implement new digital currency-related laws on a broad scale as a means of keeping traders secure and reserved when engaging in investing strategies.</p>
<p>The move was clearly a response to the FTX collapse, which occurred last November. As one of the world’s leading digital currency exchanges, FTX resulted in more <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-the-damage-caused-by-ftx-was-worse-than-initially-thought/" data-wpel-link="internal">than $200 billion</a> in crypto being wiped away permanently.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is crypto in America dead? According to early crypto <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/24/crypto-is-dead-in-america-early-bitcoin-investor-issues-stark-coinbase-warning-amid-price-chaos/?sh=129bbd284367" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">investor and venture</a> capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, the answer is a resounding “yes.”</p>
<h2>Chamath Palihapitiya Doesn&#8217;t Think Crypto Has a Future in America</h2>
<p>During a recent podcast interview, Palihapitiya mentioned that U.S. financial agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are going after companies like Coinbase, and that they’re not likely to stop until the entire crypto arena is finished and gone.</p>
<p>He took issue with men like Gary Gensler – the current head of the SEC – who are blaming the crypto industry for the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/as-more-banks-fell-bitcoin-rose-beyond-28k/" data-wpel-link="internal">present banking crisis</a> we’re seeing in America, and he thinks this is likely to get in the way of further innovation. During the interview, Palihapitiya stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto is dead in America. So, the United States authorities have firmly pointed their guns at crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attacks on crypto were ultimately ramped up last November when leading digital currency exchange <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/" data-wpel-link="internal">FTX</a> fell into a sorry and twisted state of bankruptcy. From there, many allegations arose claiming Sam Bankman-Fried – the man behind the company – took user funds and paid off loans with them or invested in Bahamian luxury real estate. He’s now awaiting trial <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-to-await-trial-at-his-parents-house/" data-wpel-link="internal">at his parents’ California</a> home.</p>
<p>Palihapitiya is very disappointed in that it appears many companies cannot escape the wrath of agencies such as the SEC no matter how hard they try to play by the rules. He again referred to Coinbase when making his point, saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Coinbase played by the rules, stood in line, [and] tried to do the right things. It seems that every step along the way, everything from board composition to executive composition to how they try to interact with the regulators, yet they were probably the furthest away from getting a license. The one that came the closest was the one that was the most fraudulent, which is FTX. How is that even possible? [Crypto companies are] probably the ones that were the most threatening to the establishment, and they were the ones that, in fairness to the regulators, did push the boundaries more than any other sector of the startup economy. So now, they’re paying the price for that. The bill has come due for them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Going to Bermuda?</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Brian Armstrong – the head of Coinbase – said he’s exploring taking the firm to Bermuda or other outside territories unless the U.S. can take a clearer stance on crypto regulation. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Anything is on the table, including relocating or whatever is necessary. I think the U.S. has the potential to be an important market for crypto, but right now, we are not seeing that regulatory clarity that we need. I think in a number of years, if we don&#8217;t see that regulatory clarity emerge in the U.S., we may have to consider investing more elsewhere in the world.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins are all the rage, and now it appears <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/23/the-price-of-this-new-crypto-meme-coin-rose-21000-as-bitcoin-and-ethereum-stalled-but-theres-a-nasty-catch/?sh=2b35a11b3400" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">one based on the infamous</a> image of Pepe the Frog is making waves in the crypto industry and witnessing price hikes like no other in its category.</p>
<h2>Pepe the Frog Is Now a Currency!</h2>
<p>Meme coins have always been extremely popular. One of the biggest ones – <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/dogecoin/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dogecoin</a> – was initially created as a joke. It was literally built to make fun of the crypto arena and all those that sought to utilize its offerings or that had any respect for it. By some odd chance of fate, the currency has literally become one of the biggest digital currencies out there. It presently boasts a market cap that exceeds $1 billion and has been the subject of heavy <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/latest-elon-musk-tweet-sends-dogecoin-soaring/" data-wpel-link="internal">praise from Elon Musk</a>.</p>
<p>Dogecoin spawned other assets such as the Shiba Inu coin. The Shiba Inu dog long served as the cute little mascot for the parent digital asset Doge, and it wasn’t long before a spinoff of sorts was conceived in the Shiba Inu currency, which has also long been loved amongst crypto fans.</p>
<p>But Pepe the Frog appears to be on an entirely different playing field. At the time of writing, the currency is shooting up in price by a whopping 21,000 percent, and this is a currency that was only launched a few weekends ago. It now sits as the sixth-largest meme currency by market cap, which at press time, exceeds $150 million.</p>
<p>In a recent report, crypto research company Messari explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meme coins are once again polarizing the crypto world. A new project, Pepe, has amassed a $100 million market cap in less than one week. Similar to previous meme coin price surges, Pepe has generated eye-popping returns for its early investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pepe the Frog has been adopted by a wide array of online communities. The image has a circulation of about 420.69 trillion, though it’s not without controversy. The meme currency, for example, comes with a warning on sites like Coinmarketcap.com, which says traders should “exercise caution” if they choose to purchase or trade the asset.</p>
<p>The Messari report also said that while the currency may presently be doing well on paper, it doesn’t feel like it has any real future as a method of payment or as an actual digital token. Right now, the liquidity pool for the meme coin sits at a mere $3 million. Compare this with Ethereum, for example, whose daily trading volume is just shy of $800 million.</p>
<h2>Try to Be Careful</h2>
<p>The report said:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the earliest buyers has turned a 0.125 Ethereum purchase into close to $2 million on-chain. However, since this individual owns 1.4 percent of the total supply, they will not be able to realize these returns without crashing the market.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many companies are beginning to use blockchain technology to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/startups-want-to-use-blockchain-technology-to-improve-the-carbon-credit-markets-here-s-why-big-names-in-the-climate-industry-are-warming-up-to-the-idea/ar-AA1abJYy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">boost the transparency of</a> carbon credits.</p>
<h2>Blockchain and Carbon Credits&#8230; Are They Coming Together?</h2>
<p>Carbon credits are designed to help companies bankroll protocols and projects that ultimately preserve the environment from poor or improper climate activity. However, the problem with these credits is that they are not always transparent, and it’s not entirely clear if they’ve been effective when it comes to keeping the planet and its atmosphere clean and clear from pollution.</p>
<p>Blockchain is presenting several answers for companies like Toucan, Return, and Open Forest Protocol, and they’re seeking to tie climate initiatives in with the illustrious technology that has powered the crypto arena for so long.</p>
<p>The way climate credits work is that they are bought by companies who spew greenhouse gas emissions such as methane into the atmosphere through their operations. These credits are then put towards environmentally friendly projects and initiatives. Think of them as companies’ way of saying “we’re sorry” for all the alleged damage they may be doing to the planet.</p>
<p>This way, for every poor initiative that occurs through the company’s operations, they can at least make sure a project seeking to offset any emissions has what it needs to stay afloat and keep working. Sadly, it’s never been clear if these projects are doing what they say they do, nor is it clear if their methods for cleaning up the planet truly work.</p>
<p>Erin Murphy – the chief growth officer at Topl, a company that’s designed a blockchain specifically for climate-based issues – said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a fundamental issue in the [industry]. We want to see more competition [and] more scientific rigor in this space.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many believe blockchain can provide the answers eco-friendly individuals seek. Blockchain can give them specific information by bringing together several different groups to ensure a project’s merits are in place. They can also see to it that participation in these projects is incentivized, and that general criteria for issuing and using climate credits are laid out properly.</p>
<p>Salmeron Barnes – the co-founder and managing director of Aureus Earth, which builds financial tools to encourage carbon reduction – said in an emailed note:</p>
<blockquote><p>The decentralized verification capability and the promise of new low-emissions blockchain offerings are what attracted AE to create a blockchain-based registry.</p></blockquote>
<h2>An Interesting Reversal of Sorts</h2>
<p>Interestingly, blockchain is centered in a world that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/report-bitcoin-mining-may-require-more-energy-than-180-countries/" data-wpel-link="internal">has long been criticized</a> for its alleged lack of ecological and environmental awareness. Blockchain powers crypto, which was born through the mining process, and it’s this process that has attracted so much hate from environmentalists over the years.</p>
<p>Many claims have been made that crypto mining ultimately uses more energy than most developing countries, and that the process is pushing the planet towards an unforgiving (and irreversible) end.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading digital currency exchange Coinbase is getting <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/coinbase-layer-2-blockchain-plans-155304979.html" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">ready to release its new</a> Base protocol in late 2023.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Says It Will Bring One Billion Users Onboard</h2>
<p>Base is an Ethereum-focused, layer-2 blockchain. The program has been in a testing phase since February of this year, and those in charge are now preparing it for a mainnet launch that will allow it to be utilized by all the exchange’s customers.</p>
<p>Jesse Pollack – the lead for Base – recently divulged several facts about the upcoming protocol in an interview. He said that while Coinbase is not set on releasing any official timelines or dates just yet, he can confirm that 2023 will be the year in which it becomes fully available. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s coming soon. We’re working hard on it. It’s our number one priority alongside decentralization goals, and the rest of the year is about making sure we get there as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>The move will mark a nice change of pace for the once prominent digital currency trading platform. While still popular amongst many crypto traders and fans, Coinbase has endured its fair share of blows to the head in recent weeks in the shape of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which recently sent a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">Wells notice to the prominent</a> investing enterprise.</p>
<p>While a Wells notice does not instigate that the company has been charged with a crime, it hints that potential charges may be coming soon, and that the firm should prepare itself. Coinbase took serious issue with the notice and claimed that it met with SEC officials several times over the past few years to ensure it always remained compliant with present rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Coinbase mentioned that the regulatory environment in the United States has grown so speculative and frightening that the company is now <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/04/19/coinbase-gets-bermuda-license-plans-to-launch-offshore-exchange-in-coming-weeks/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">considering leaving America</a> and setting up shop in Bermuda. While U.S. customers will still be privy to services offered by the firm, the company will no longer be settled on American soil.</p>
<p>Pollack continued his statement by claiming that the company is looking to bring at least one million builders on board, which will in turn lead to about one billion more users. The goal is to have everyone on-chain and provide access to “easy to use” crypto-centered products. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think less about Base passing Coinbase and more about how Base plus Coinbase over the next decade are going to work together to bring those million developers [and] billions of users on-chain.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Keeping Things Off the Radar</h2>
<p>He also said that per verbiage issued by Brian Armstrong – the CEO of Coinbase – the program is going to be fully decentralized.</p>
<p>This makes perfect sense given the many issues the company has clearly dealt with from the SEC and similar agencies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered what it’s like to dive deep into the world of Web3? What lurks around those corners? Is this a path of decentralization and salvation of humanity&#8217;s monotonous jobs and rather boring dogma-like lifestyles that have so far kept the human kind working in silos and well, working in on-end? Or is it just a bridge to a much more centralized conditioning of the human psyche.</p>
<p>Considering today&#8217;s financial climate, the dollar&#8217;s obvious decline, BRICS nations announcing a gold backed digital currency, the clash of CBDC and Bitcoin&#8217;s Web3 is certainly coming to a climax. Yet the industry of blockchain and Web3 that undoubtedly has been made popular due to Bitcoin&#8217;s mass adoption, still to this day promotes the idea of monetary and data sovereignty, while successfully attracting thousands of people daily who open their wallets, get a bit of crypto and find themselves deep in the world of Web3.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-78624 aligncenter" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Picture36-600x428.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="428" /></p>
<p>2020 marked a big year for cryptocurrency mass adoption, as people had what seemed back then an endless amount of time to get into the topic and read Satoshi&#8217;s white-paper thanks to the pandemic. Two years prior to that, on the brink of Bitcoin&#8217;s beyond-20k unprecedented bull run, a film series by the name of #TheFutureisNowFilm came to be. Created by an American filmmaker Miguel Francis-Santiago who radically changed his career path from being a journalist in the world of current affairs, geopolitics &amp; more, to a roving crypto documentarist traveling the world and exposing both the good and the bad but most of all all the excitement behind the industry of Blockchain, through a unique cinematic approach that over the 5 years has had no analogues to the film series he currently creates with his team, which has an uncanny name by today’s standards &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://youtube.com/thefutureisnow" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">The Future is Now</a>&#8220;, implying that every moment counts and all we truly have is the present, for the past we cannot change and the future we cannot truly predict.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-78625 aligncenter" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Picture37-600x255.png" alt="" width="600" height="255" /></p>
<p>Its latest iteration called &#8220;<a href="https://youtu.be/Cuto1kx0A5o" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">The World of Web3</a>&#8221; being the 18th edition of the series, the filmmaker takes us on a ride through today&#8217;s Dubai industry of decentralization and its milestones with such prominent figures like one of the prime authorities on crypto in the region Dr. Marwan AlZarouni of Dubai Blockchain Center, appointed by The Ruler of Dubai H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin-Rashid Al Maktoum himself to help co-create Dubai as a harbor of innovation. According to Dr. Marwan, &#8220;Dubai is run as a business, and we prefer to work with only the best of the best&#8221;, to no surprise as Dubai clearly has become the epicenter for Web3 and digital currencies in today’s world. However, another not far away Emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah is potentially about to take the lead as it is now officially on verge of becoming a Web3 Hub with licenses available for issuing and distribution of digital currencies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-78626 aligncenter" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Picture38-600x270.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="270" /></p>
<p>&#8220;If the people of America only knew how the money system works, there&#8217;d be a revolution the next day&#8221; says Davinci Jeremie, a famous crypto influencer and Founder of DavinciJ15. While another star of the film, Car Runefelt of The Moon Group, who went from a supermarket clerk about 5 years ago, to now a crypto millionaire driving his Bugatti around Dubai, believes that &#8220;Bitcoin has become the Noah&#8217;s Ark, and if you&#8217;re not in, you might find the future bleak&#8221;. There is certainly truth to this, as more assets devalue and the world clearly feels the effects of the current economic and information war that is happening between quite a few nations, sometimes being compared to a proxy world war.<br />
<img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-78627 aligncenter" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Picture39-600x257.png" alt="" width="600" height="257" /></p>
<p>&#8220;The World of Web3&#8221; was filmed at the same titled <a href="https://dubai2023.wowsummit.net/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">WOW Summit</a> organized by GuyWay Events and the film director&#8217;s original idea was to create a guide for anyone entering the space or interested in exploring this industry, says Miguel Francis-Santiago, the CEO and Founder of The Future is Now DAO and the creator of The Future is Now Film &#8211; &#8220;I wanted to create a Web3 encyclopedia for people, while telling the story through tangible innovators who have experienced both highs and lows and are ready to speak about their experience to the public&#8221;. Miguel certainly achieved this through industry professionals like Ilman Shazhaev of <a href="http://farcana.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Farcana</a>, which is quite an interesting source for Web3 mass adoption being a 3D-Shooter GameFi Universe where you enter with its native token but you get to win Bitcoin in what was branded as &#8220;Play to Hash&#8221; algorithm. The company provides mining services as well, and has enabled their data centers to allocate the prize in the form of Bitcoin&#8217;s hashrate. Other revolutionary concepts like MediaChain being a gateway for influencers to monetize their art and enter the Web3 space with the help of industry professionals who create incentives for the audience to join the influencer and become a part of his or her community through for example a unique NFT collection &#8211; is also certainly a way for mass adoption.</p>
<p>It was interesting to note that traditional market making is not far off from crypto market making and if traditional market makers are essentially gatekeepers for the bank liquidity into clients of interest, in the Web3 world, Market Making Pro with Aleks Gladskih and Mikhail Fillipov provides the lifeline for projects in Web3 and from what they describe does it in the same sometimes astronomical manner like traditional market makers, who according to them are simply world’s top banks like JP Morgan.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-78628 aligncenter" src="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/https://s3.amazonaws.com/lbn-s3/2023/06/Picture40-600x258.png" alt="" width="600" height="258" /></p>
<p>Another major influencer in the film happens to be Matthias &#8220;Sheikh&#8221; Mende, who has been a Dubai Resident for over 5 years now. Heading something called <a href="http://bonuz.market" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Bonuz Market</a>, Matthias aims to revolutionize the way celebrities interact with their fans, while also giving them the right to distribute control of their celebrity avatars in the Bonuz Metaverse, to the AI itself as an insurance policy after they die! How exciting? Imagine if Larry King or John McAfee would still be alive in the world of the never ending collective AI consciousness of the world wide web 3.0?</p>
<p>The private screening and premiere party was held at the end of April 2023 in Dubai, under the patronage of H.H. Sheikh Abdulhakim Al-Maktoum Family Office &amp; Royal Investment Club, while the public release appeared on the film&#8217;s YouTube channel a week later (http://youtube.com/thefutureisnow). If you are into Web3 or you feel it&#8217;s time to let loose and discover, you might want to put this on the schedule if you believe that film, emotions and the excitement this combination can cause may actually move the needle in this tug of war between centralized and decentralized powers through the power of cinema.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Bitcoin cash is attempting a recovery wave above the $112 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above the $114 zone and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $116 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair (data feed from Coinbase).</li>
<li>The pair must clear $116 and $118 to start a steady upward movement in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Bitcoin cash price is rising above $114 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-faces-key-resistance-near-28-5k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. BCH/USD could start a fresh surge if it clears the $118 level.</em></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Price Analysis</h2>
<p>Bitcoin cash price formed a decent support base above the $110 level. BCH started a decent increase and was able to clear the $112 resistance zone.</p>
<p>The price climbed above the $114 resistance level. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $117.30 swing high to the $111.60 low. It is now trading above the $114 zone and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-cash-analysis-risk-of-fresh-drop-to-105-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $116 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $116 on the 4-hour chart of the BCH/USD pair.</p>
