Their findings, which reveal that Pyongyang proceeds with the development of its nuclear and weapons programs, will be included in a U.N. report which is to be released in the coming weeks. </strong></p>
<h2>North Korea Still Trying to Steal Cryptocurrency, Sanctions Experts Say</h2>
<p>North Korea continued to produce nuclear fissile material and develop nuclear weapons in 2023, a new report prepared for a U.N. Security Council committee unveils. The document, which is yet to be officially published, has been seen by Reuters.</p>
<p>Its authors, independent sanctions monitors who report to the U.N. twice a year, have also established that the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DPRK</a>) continued to evade sanctions put in place to cut off funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.</p>
<p>North Korea has been previously accused of conducing cyberattacks to source funds for these programs and 2022 was a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/north-korea-stole-record-amount-of-crypto-assets-in-2022-un-report-unveils/">record-breaking</a> year in terms of the total amount of money that hackers allegedly affiliated with the regime in Pyongyang managed to steal — an estimated $1.7 billion. In their latest report, the monitors noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>DPRK hackers reportedly continued to successfully target cyber cryptocurrency and other financial exchanges globally.</p></blockquote>

<p>The hackers, believed to be working for North Korea’s main foreign intelligence agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB), “continued to use increasingly sophisticated cyber techniques to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-north-korea-affiliated-cybercriminals-stole-721-milion-worth-crypto-assets-from-japan/">steal</a> funds and information,” the experts added.</p>
<p>“Companies in the cryptocurrency, defense, energy and health sectors were targeted in particular,” highlights the executive summary of the report. “The DPRK continued to access the international financial system and also engaged in illicit financial operations,” the sanctions monitors concluded.</p>
<p>Korea’s Communist North has been under U.N. sanctions over its nuclear and weapons programs since 2006. While in the past, these have been unanimously strengthened, Reuters remarked that the Security Council is now deadlocked with China and Russia pushing for easing of the measures to stimulate the DPRK to return to negotiations on denuclearization.</p>

The services of the Tokyo-headquartered biometrics firm will allow Binance Japan to ensure its know-your-customer (KYC) procedures comply with Japan’s strict regulations.</strong></p>
<h2>Liquid to Provide Binance Japan With AI-Based KYC Solution</h2>
<p>Binance, the largest crypto exchange in terms of trading volume and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-users-reach-150-million-cz-reveals/">users</a>, will employ Japanese company Liquid for identity verification of customers on its new domestic platform in Japan. As a first step in this partnership, Liquid said it will provide Binance with its eKYC service.</p>
<p>“Liquid eKYC offers top-in-class facial authentication through its unique AI-based image processing capability, enabling smooth identity verification in accordance with the respective legal and security framework in each country,” explained the firm which specializes in image and big data analysis related to biometrics.</p>
<p>Binance’s General Manager for Japan, Takeshi Chino, pointed out that the exchange’s “robust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KYC</a> framework plays a critical role in protecting the platform, users and community, and the entire ecosystem from potential threats.” He also emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited to launch our Japan platform in a fully compliant manner with stringent and comprehensive eKYC solutions enabled by Liquid. Binance will continue to uphold a high standard of safety and compliance in Japan.</p></blockquote>

<p> has been dealing with heightened regulatory pressure around the world in the past months. Following warnings from Japanese regulators that it was operating without the necessary authorization, the crypto behemoth acquired the Japan-registered Sakura Exchange Bitcoin (SEBC) in November 2022.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the company announced that Binance Japan will fully comply with local regulations and said that Japanese users of its global exchange will be able to migrate to the new domestic platform after passing identity verification. In late July, founder Changpeng Zhao said Binance will restore <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-restore-full-services-in-japan-in-august-cz-unveils/">full services</a> in Japan and on Aug. 1. The Japanese subsidiary revealed it’s launching with <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-japan-to-launch-with-34-listed-cryptocurrencies/">34 listed coins</a>.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Liquid CEO Hiroki Hasegawa highlighted that his company’s eKYC product, which uses facial recognition and ID document image recognition technologies, has been implemented across multiple industries. “We are pleased to provide the necessary service that will allow them to continue serving more users in a secure and compliant manner,” he added.</p>

Central bank governor John Mangudya also said the results of a consumer survey had shown that residents had limited knowledge about an envisaged central bank digital currency (CBDC).</strong></p>
<h2>An &#8216;Effective Monetary Policy Instrument&#8217;</h2>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has said it is now &#8220;at an advanced stage in preparations for the rolling out of GBDT [gold-backed digital tokens] for transactional purposes.&#8221; The bank said the rollout would see the gold tokens complement the U.S. dollar &#8220;in domestic transactions as retailers will be offered a safer, more convenient, and value-preserving medium of exchange.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a recently released mid-term monetary policy statement, RBZ governor John Mangudya revealed that the central bank will soon kickstart awareness campaigns whose objective is to &#8220;educate the public on the use and benefits of GBDT.&#8221; Mangudya also revealed that key stakeholders such as the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) have pledged to configure their systems to allow for the issuance of cards denominated in the GBDT.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-says-zimbabwe-gold-backed-digital-currency-a-potential-threat-to-financial-stability/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, the RBZ launched the gold-backed tokens in May to counter local residents’ demand for U.S. dollars. However, just a few months after the launch, the central bank governor said the GBDTs have already proved to be an effective monetary policy instrument.</p>
<p>&#8220;The GBDTs have since proved to be an effective monetary policy instrument with strong potential to help restore normalcy to the domestic financial and capital markets within the short term,&#8221; Mangudya said.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>More Than 70% Willing to Use CBDC</h2>
<p>The governor claimed that the &#8220;divisibility nature&#8221; of the digital gold tokens means they can be accessed or acquired by people from all economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Concerning the uptake of physical gold coins, the RBZ boss revealed that out of the 36,059 coins which had been sold by July 14, only 769 gold coins or approximately 2% of the total had been redeemed following the end of the 180-day vesting period. According to Mangudya, the low redemption rate means residents and businesses are indeed using the physical gold coins as an alternative store of value.</p>
<p>With respect to the RBZ’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), Mangudya said the results of a consumer survey had shown that residents had limited knowledge about the envisaged digital currency. However, some 71.7% of the respondents expressed their willingness to use a CBDC if the central bank introduces it, Mangudya added.</p>

The changes, which will enter into force next year, seek to enhance registration requirements for businesses offering certain services for digital assets like custody and trading. </strong></p>
<h2>AMF Revamps Crypto Regulations to Enforce Stricter Registration Rules for DASPs</h2>
<p>Autorité des Marchés Financiers (<a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AMF</a>), the French financial regulator, announced Thursday it’s amending its regulations and policies regarding digital asset service providers (DASPs) to implement “enhanced” registration for some of these entities.</p>
<p>The new requirements for crypto companies were introduced with a law known by the French abbreviation DDADUE, allowing the government in Paris to transpose European Union directives, which was adopted earlier this year.</p>
<p>The DDADUE law clarified some provisions relating to the EU’s new Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-council-adopts-new-rules-for-europes-crypto-markets/">legislation</a>. It introduced an “enhanced” registration regime that will be mandatory from Jan. 1, 2024 for market players who wish to provide certain services for digital assets, such as custody, buying with and selling coins for fiat as well as crypto-to-crypto trading.</p>
<p>The amendments the AMF is making now seek to incorporate in its General Regulation and policy the provisions applicable to DASPs which are subject to “enhanced” registration. The other main objective is to align the requirements for DASPs in France with those for obtaining an EU authorization for crypto asset service providers (CASPs) under MiCA.</p>

<p>The enhanced DASP registration comes with various requirements for crypto companies, including the implementation of adequate security and internal control systems and systems for managing conflicts of interest as well as the provision of accurate and non-misleading information and maintaining public pricing policies.</p>
<p>There are also specific provisions regarding the custody of customer funds requiring the segregation of client and company assets and prohibiting the use of client assets without their express prior consent. The new French standards come amid a global clampdown on the crypto industry with regulators accusing major crypto exchanges like the bankrupt FTX and the world’s largest crypto trading platform, Binance, of diverting or commingling customer funds.</p>
<p>France’s relatively clear regulatory framework until now has attracted a number of crypto companies, including , as well as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banking-giants-credit-agricole-santander-seek-to-provide-crypto-custody-under-french-registration/">institutional players</a> that want to offer digital asset services to their clients. In June, AMF Secretary General Benoît de Juvigny was quoted as saying that “if American players want to benefit, in the very short term from the French regime, and from the start of 2025 from European arrangements, clearly they are welcome.”</p>

<h2>Former SEC Official&#x2019;s Warning of Ongoing Crypto Regulatory Sweep</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark warned in a lengthy tweet on Saturday that &#x201C;the SEC&#x2019;s crypto-regulatory onslaught will never end (ever).&#x201D; Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>Referring to the recent regulatory action taken by the SEC against cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-bittrex-settles-with-sec-agrees-to-pay-24-million/">Bittrex</a>, he pointed out that the charges against Bittrex mirror those taken against other crypto exchanges, including Coinbase and <span style="font-weight: 200;"></span>. The former SEC official stressed that &#x201C;by calling themselves &#x2018;exchanges,&#x2019; &#x2018;brokers,&#x2019; and &#x2018;market-makers,&#x2019; crypto trading platforms like Bittrex, Beaxy, Coinbase, Binance, and others co-opt historically powerful nomenclature that implies trust, oversight and consumer protection, etc.&#x201D; He cautioned: &#x201C;This powerful grift can quickly evolve into dangerous and unlawful marketing theater.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He explained that &#x201C;Congress enacted the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 to prevent and police investment schemes orchestrated by large financial conglomerates of any ilk.&#x201D; Emphasized that &#x201C;a Walking Dead-like post-apocalyptic marketplace quickly evolves&#x201D; without SEC registration, the former SEC official asserted:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is why the SEC&#x2019;s crypto-enforcement sweep will never end.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that the crypto regulatory onslaught will not end because the SEC has a &#x201C;threefold mission (to protect investors; to maintain fair, orderly and efficient markets; and to facilitate capital formation)&#x201D; that is &#x201C;far too critical for the SEC to relent.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Stark proceeded to detail the importance of SEC exchange registration and broker-dealer registration for crypto platforms that list tokens that are securities. According to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chairman-explains-why-he-views-all-crypto-tokens-other-than-bitcoin-as-securities/">all crypto tokens</a>, except bitcoin, are securities. However, a recent court ruling found that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-isnt-appealing-whether-xrp-is-a-security-lawyer-clarifies/">not a security</a>.</p>
<p>He also discussed &#x201C;the defiance of crypto trading firms,&#x201D; stating: &#x201C;For years too many crypto trading platforms have been operating as unregistered exchanges.&#x201D; The former SEC internet enforcement chief claimed: &#x201C;Crypto trading firms have carried out these functions despite the fact that the crypto assets it has made available have included crypto asset securities,&#x201D; adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Financial firms like Binance, Coinbase, Beaxy, Bittrex, and other crypto-trading platforms are simply playing (and winning) a short game of regulatory arbitrage, all carried out in an effort to make as much fiat as possible before their inevitable demise (or severe reduction in size).</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;The biggest irony is that these so-called &#x2018;crypto-exchanges&#x2019; claim to be champions of the future of finance and promote themselves as digital couriers of transformative innovation that is the future of money,&#x201D; Stark continued. &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t be fooled. Beneath their sophisticated exterior, these crypto trading platforms are masquerading a spectacularly mammoth (and effective) affinity fraud that is as old as finance itself.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Peter Schiff Sounds Alarm on U.S. Economy</h2>
<p>Economist and gold bug Peter Schiff issued multiple warnings about the U.S. economy in a series of tweets this week. He wrote on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investors are in for two huge surprises. The first is that future inflation rates will be much higher than they think. The second is that the Fed won&#8217;t be willing or able to do what it takes to fight it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report, released Thursday, that the consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.2% from a year ago in July, Schiff tweeted: &#8220;Don&#8217;t believe the financial media&#8217;s spin that July&#8217;s 3.2% YoY CPI rise, with YoY core at 4.7%, means the Fed is winning its war against inflation. Core is bottoming, and the headline number is about to rise sharply, led higher by surging oil prices. The Fed has already lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics also reported Friday that the producer price index (PPI), which gauges the costs that goods and services producers receive for their products as opposed to those that consumers pay, rose 0.3% for the month.</p>
<p>“Today&#8217;s hotter than expected .3% rise in July PPI is only the beginning. Future, even larger upside surprises are coming,” Schiff tweeted in response to the PPI report. He opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>The worst part is that by the time the U.S. economy officially enters a recession, inflation will be too high for to the Fed to ‘stimulate’ with rate cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff has regularly warned about the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar. Earlier this month, he said the USD&#8217;s collapse is &#8220;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-warns-us-dollar-collapse-inevitable/">inevitable</a>,&#8221; advising people to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/economist-peter-schiff-advises-get-out-of-the-dollar-says-the-usd-is-being-destroyed/">get out of the dollar now</a>. He has also repeatedly cautioned that the Fed has already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-the-fed-has-lost-inflation-fight-markets-just-havent-figured-that-out-yet/">lost its inflation fight</a> but the markets have not figured that out yet.</p>

An examination of data from 99 distinct mining pools, spanning the previous 14 years, reveals that unidentified mining participants discovered 28.37% of the network&#x2019;s total blocks. Trailing not far behind, F2pool secures the second position, having found just slightly more than 10% of all the blocks since 2009.</strong></p>
<h2>Unknown, F2pool, and Antpool Lead the Pack in Terms of Number of Bitcoin Blocks Mined</h2>
<p>Over the last year, Foundry USA has emerged as the prevailing <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-applications-face-more-delays/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> mining pool, uncovering 15,767 blocks from a total of 53,703 block rewards since August 12, 2022. Although Foundry has consistently led among large mining pools in recent periods, it ranks ninth in <a href="https://btc.com/stats/pool?pool_mode=all">all-time statistics</a>, with a tally of 25,946 blocks as of block height 802,854.</p>
<p>The top position is occupied by unidentified miners from 99 diverse pools, as identified by btc.com, with unknown miners, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/decade-old-wisdom-unpacking-satoshi-nakamotos-definitive-quote-on-bitcoin-transaction-challenges-13-years-on/">Satoshi</a> and early miners, having found a cumulative 227,800 blocks, or 28.37% of the total. F2pool commands the lead as an identified pool with the most blocks mined since 2009, having discovered 80,364 blocks, approximately 10.01% of the total.</p>

<p>Following closely, Antpool ranks second to F2pool and third overall, with 75,829 blocks, or 9.44% of the total. The subsequent ranks are filled by Btc.com&#x2019;s mining pool (39,996 blocks), Braiins Pool (39,647 blocks), and Viabtc (33,194 blocks).</p>
<p>The now-inoperative Btc Guild is in seventh place, having found 32,935 blocks since 2011 before officially shutting down in June 2015. Despite its inactivity for over eight years, Btc Guild&#x2019;s contributions remain noteworthy. In eighth place, regarding all-time blocks discovered, stands Poolin with 27,236, while Foundry occupies the aforementioned ninth place with its 25,946 blocks.</p>

<p>Following Foundry is Ghash.io, which commenced mining in 2013 and officially halted operations on October 24, 2016. Though it hasn&#x2019;t mined in years, Ghash.io&#x2019;s 23,083 blocks substantially outpace the 11th place holder, Bitfury, a mining pool that, while absent in the past year&#x2019;s hashrate, has found a total of 19,513 blocks all-time.</p>
<p>Data indicates that a tally of 11 pools total have mined fewer than 50 blocks. Moreover, approximately 19 pools have mined fewer than 100 blocks, while around 80 pools have extracted more than 100 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> block rewards. To date, 92.64% of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>&#x2019;s total supply, or nearly 19,455,124.32 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, has been mined into circulation. Furthermore, Bitcoin&#x2019;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-adjusts-mining-difficulty-rises-0-12-to-52-39-trillion/">mining difficulty</a> has been adjusted 397 times since the first adjustment at block height 2,016.</p>

<p>Currently, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> miners are committing a staggering 387.62 exahash per second (EH/s), translating to 387,620,000,000,000,000,000 hashes per second (H/s). A mere two days after Bitcoin made its debut, the hashrate hovered around 948,000 hashes per second, or 948 kilohash per second (KH/s). This data reveals that the total hashrate fortifying the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> network has ballooned by an astonishing 40,888,185,654,008,340% since the inception of the blockchain.</p>

With oil reserves dwindling at a breakneck pace, OPEC&#8217;s spare capacity restrained, and powerhouse consumers like China and India snapping up record quantities of Russian crude at discounted rates, a confluence of these factors is signaling the likelihood of an enduring escalation in oil prices, the International Energy Agency (IEA) warns in its August report.</strong></p>
<h2>IEA Report Sheds Light on Skyrocketing Oil Demand in the Face of Production Slump</h2>
<p>According to the IEA&#8217;s <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-august-2023">projections</a>, the world&#8217;s thirst for oil is set to swell by 2.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), reaching a new peak of 102.2 mb/d in 2023. In stark contrast, OPEC+ saw its supply contract by 1.2 mb/d in July, plummeting to 50.7 mb/d, due to Saudi Arabia&#8217;s <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-extends-oil-production-cuts-further-irking-us-officials/">voluntary reductions</a>. This downtick in production occurs as U.S.-led non-OPEC production inches up a mere 1.5 mb/d for the entire year.</p>
<p>Refineries are <a href="https://www.energyintel.com/00000186-7eee-df73-afe7-feff69510000#:~:text=Global%20refiners%20will%20have%20little,late%20for%20the%20summer%20season.">feeling the pinch</a>, grappling to keep up, as margins for gasoline and diesel touch multi-month peaks. The depletion of crude and product stocks is accelerating, with OECD inventories falling over 100 mb below 5-year averages in July.</p>

<p>The IEA anticipates that stocks may plunge an additional 3.4 mb/d in the latter half of 2023 if OPEC+ sticks to its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-and-opec-reveal-surprise-oil-production-cut-white-house-insists-cuts-arent-advisable-right-now/">slashed</a> output objectives. With the world&#8217;s cushion of spare capacity wearing thin, extra OPEC barrels will be vital to bolster refining operations.</p>
<p>In a significant move, U.S. president <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bidenomics-agenda-struggles-to-gain-support-as-joe-bidens-approval-ratings-plummet/">Joe Biden</a> authorized the withdrawal of 180 million barrels from the nation&#8217;s strategic oil reserve in March 2022, depleting the stockpile to its most anemic levels since the 1980s. Yet, with oil prices stealthily <a href="https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/#prices">climbing above</a> $80 a barrel, the Biden administration made a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/biden-administration-delays-plans-to-restock-nations-emergency-oil-reserve">calculated decision</a> to postpone replenishing the country&#8217;s vital strategic oil reserve.</p>
<p>Moreover, OPEC&#8217;s prudent stance implies that supplies might continue to be stretched thin. &#8220;If the bloc’s current targets are maintained, oil inventories could draw by 2.2 mb/d in [the third quarter] and 1.2 mb/d in [the fourth quarter], with a risk of driving prices still higher,&#8221; the IEA report states.</p>
<p>Much like the U.S., the United Kingdom finds itself with dwindling reserves and a reliance on imports. In terms of proven petroleum reserves, the U.K. is estimated to have a back-up of roughly four times its annual consumption. Europe&#8217;s oil supply has historically been sourced from various regions, but until 2021, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-to-test-digital-ruble-in-11-cities-moscow-subway/">Russia</a> held the crown as the EU&#8217;s principal petroleum supplier.</p>

<p>The dynamic shifted dramatically, however, with the onset of the Russia/Ukraine conflict, leading to the U.S. supplanting Russia as Europe&#8217;s foremost provider of crude oil. In the meantime, an RT <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/581109-russia-india-china-oil/">report</a> further indicates that leading importers such as China and India are capitalizing on discounted Russian crude in record amounts, as Western sanctions redirect trade currents.</p>
<p>RT staff writers explain that Russia, having held onto its position as China&#8217;s primary supplier for half a year, accounted for a fifth of China&#8217;s June imports. India, too, sourced a staggering 45% of its June crude from Russia, maintaining it as the top provider for a full year.</p>
<p>The IEA&#8217;s study concurs with the RT report and notes, &#8220;Russian oil exports held steady at around 7.3 mb/d in July, as a 200 kb/d decline in crude oil loadings was offset by higher product flows.&#8221; It goes on to note, &#8220;Crude exports to China and India eased month-over-month but comprised 80% of Russian shipments.&#8221;</p>

<p>This combination of strained supplies, depleted reserves, and burgeoning Asian markets sketches an alarming scenario of looming price surges. As the global economy finds its footing, any proliferation of Russian crude sales to major importing nations could potentially magnify the peril. For the time being, the IEA alerts that the market teeters on the brink, dangerously skewed towards price amplification.</p>

<p>The past week marked a small uptick in NFT sales, rising 6.59% higher than the preceding week, with the total reaching $106.87 million according to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/">metrics</a> provided by cryptoslam.io. Ethereum-based NFTs led the market, capturing $60.23 million, while Polygon-based NFTs took second place in weekly sales, commanding $13 million &#x2014; an increase of 92.07% over the previous week.</p>
<p>Solana&#x2019;s NFT sales seized just over $9 million, a 30.54% rise from the previous week. Following Solana, Mythos, Immutable X, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" target="_blank">BNB</a> Chain, and Bitcoin rounded out the list. Bitcoin-based NFT sales settled in the seventh position for the week, capturing $2.7 million. However, the seven-day sales from <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> dipped 24.90% lower than the previous week. Tezos made a notable stride, jumping 50.44% higher, yet only contributed a mere $376,024 to the week&#x2019;s NFT sales.</p>
<p>This week&#x2019;s crown for the top-selling NFT collection went to <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/draft-kings">Draftkings</a> issued on Polygon, with a staggering $7,891,650 in sales. Trailing behind were <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/dmarket">Dmarket</a> ($6.17M), <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/degods-ethereum">Degods</a> ($5.03M), <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/gods-unchained-cards">Gods Unchained</a> ($4.85M), and <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/bored-ape-yacht-club">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> ($4.46M).

Other collections that witnessed notable gains included Tensorian Shards ($1.89M) and Y00ts ($1.25M).</p>

<p>The past week&#x2019;s top-selling NFT was the <a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/clonex/mint/11164">Clonex NFT #9,418</a>, fetching $360K just a day ago. Cryptopunk #4,757 claimed the second spot, selling for $326K about four days ago, and the third position went to Autoglyphs #203, selling for $304K. Interestingly, all five of the week&#x2019;s top-selling NFTs were Ethereum-based. In fact, the week&#x2019;s top 30 sold NFTs were all crafted atop the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

Within this ravaged financial terrain, one specific category — rebase tokens — suffered a tremendous deflation in worth over the previous 20 months. In a stark illustration of this downturn, the total value of the leading rebase tokens, once exceeding $8 billion in November 2021, has now plummeted to a mere $351 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Winter Chills Rebase Tokens: A $7.68 Billion Loss in Value</h2>
<p>In 2021, the rebase token economy soared to an impressive <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211121162057/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/rebase-tokens">$8.03 billion</a>, concurrent with the crypto economy&#8217;s monumental valuation of $2.78 trillion. Fast forward to the present, and the crypto economy has contracted to $1.21 trillion, with a significant portion of value having been drained from the rebase token economy during 2022’s bear market cycle.</p>
<p>At their core, rebase tokens represent a category of cryptocurrencies capable of modifying their supply through a mechanism known as rebasing. This distinctive class of tokens strives to meet specific price targets or other financial objectives by dynamically altering the supply of tokens.</p>
<p>Having soared to heights exceeding $8 billion in November 2021, the rebase economy has since experienced a precipitous downfall, shedding a staggering $7.68 billion in value. A mere 20 months ago, Olympus DAO&#8217;s token OHM commanded a price of $856 per unit, while Wonderland&#8217;s token TIME boasted a value of $8,962 per coin.</p>
<p>As the calendar pages turned to August 11, 2023, <a href="https://archive.ph/p0L8w">archived data</a> reveals a dramatic shift: OHM has plummeted to $10.60 per coin, and TIME has tumbled to $13.60. OHM, once the titan of the rebase tokens with a market capitalization of $3.99 billion, retains its crown today, despite sliding to a modest $191 million.</p>

<p>TIME, which once comfortably held the second position with a market valuation of $2.05 billion, has now descended to the seventh spot, reduced to a mere $12.23 million. Positioned between TIME and OHM in the digital currency hierarchy are coins such as TEMPLE, SB, AMPL, FHM, and KLIMA.</p>
<p>The market has been brutal to several of these assets; TEMPLE has retreated 68.76% from its all-time high, while AMPL has declined by 73.55% from its peak. The data paints a detailed picture of OHM&#8217;s presence, with 26.66 million tokens spread across 6,927 unique addresses. 17,939,074 OHM is circulating today and Olympus DAO claims the liquid backing toward OHM is $11.34 per OHM.</p>

<p>OHM&#8217;s activity is further evidenced by a total of 365,981 transfers, with the Olympus DAO wallet holding 62.79% of the existing supply. On the other side, Wonderland&#8217;s TIME flaunts a circulating tally of 51,970,826.48 coins, held in 33,648 distinct addresses. A staggering 99.93% of this vast supply is nestled within the Wonderland TIME staking address.</p>
<p>Despite the severe decimation that rebase tokens have endured, reducing their value to a meager $351 million, this figure resonates like a faint heartbeat within the broader crypto economy — a landscape that has exhibited a more robust recovery. While rebase tokens languish, the greater digital currency world has demonstrated resilience, healing at a pace that outstrips the rebase token economy’s slow recovery of rebase tokens.</p>
