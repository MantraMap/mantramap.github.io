<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has gone after two of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges this week, filing suits against Binance and Coinbase and making grave allegations about both firms (y i k e s!).</p>



<p>In the wake of the back-to-back enforcement actions, XRP holder’s attorney John E. Deaton has announced he is prepared to also represent the customers of these two exchange giants by submitting an amicus curiae brief in a bid to safeguard their interests in the ongoing cases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-deaton-considers-amicus-status-for-binance-and-coinbase-customers"><strong>Deaton Considers Amicus Status For Binance And Coinbase Customers</strong></h2>



<p>John E. Deaton, the lawyer representing over 75,000 XRP holders, feels the SEC is not working in the best interests of the users of Coinbase and Binance as it claims.</p>



<p>As such, he is calling on customers of these two exchanges to come together and see if they can have their voices heard by participating in the lawsuits as amicus or friends of the court.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1666987520809218048">series of tweets </a>recently, Deaton posited that he did not back Ripple as a firm, and he will also not be taking any position on whether Binance and Coinbase violated securities laws, as the SEC alleges. The CryptoLaw founder noted that the SEC determined that Coinbase’s initial public offering (IPO) was in the public interest before approving it over two years ago, and doing a complete U-turn now only proves that the securities watchdog is not acting in favour of the exchange’s customers.</p>



<p>Deaton said he expects the two digital asset exchanges to defend themselves, not the users. “As I said to the Judge in the Ripple case, I expect Ripple to look out for Ripple and not individual #XRPHolders. The same applies to Coinbase and Binance. But the SEC is NOT acting in the best interests of retail crypto holders and that is for sure. The SEC has an agenda,” he postulated.</p>



<p>While the lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance have not entered the court phase yet, there’s a high possibility that these cases won’t be decided or settled for many years — if the SEC’s three-year-old case against Ripple is any indication. Hence, Deaton is taking action by collecting the details of Coinbase and Binance&#8217;s users who want to be represented. The XRP lawyer assured that the customers who fill out their names and emails in the Google form he shared will remain anonymous unless the courts demand the information.</p>



<p>That being said, it&#8217;s believed that the judges assigned to the Coinbase and Binance lawsuits will be paying close attention to whether XRP is a security. This means the outcome of the Ripple suit could influence the cases against the two exchanges.</p>

<p>Prominent trading platform Robinhood is cutting support for three coins implicated in the SEC lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase. The firm will no longer support Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) after June 27, 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-robinhood-axes-sec-designated-crypto-securities"><strong>Robinhood Axes SEC-Designated Crypto Securities</strong></h2>



<p>Robinhood has announced to its millions of customers that it has decided to delist tokens that were identified as securities in recent legal proceedings initiated against crypto exchange giants Binance and Coinbase by the SEC.</p>



<p>“We regularly review the crypto we offer on Robinhood,&#8221; the company said in a<a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/cardano-polygon-solana-update/"> blog post</a>. &#8220;Based on our latest review, we’ve decided to end support for Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), and Solana (SOL) on June 27th, 2023, at 6:59 PM ET.&#8221;</p>



<p>Holders should withdraw or transfer these tokens on the app before the deadline. Afterwards, the company will automatically sell the coins left in holders’ accounts at market value and credit the amount into the users&#8217; Robinhood buying power. Notably, this decision only affects SOL, MATIC, and ADA, and not other tokens supported by the platform.</p>



<p>The prices of the three coins remained largely unchanged following the delisting, with ADA plummeting 4.69%, SOL falling 1.22%, and MATIC dropping 1.68%.</p>



<p>The move by Robinhood comes days after the SEC sued both <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>for a myriad of alleged securities laws violations. The SEC’s recent aggressive actions against crypto exchanges highlight the agency’s intent to police the industry through enforcement in the absence of a clear regulatory framework.</p>



<p>While testifying before the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday, Robinhood Markets&#8217; chief compliance lawyer Dan Gallagher said the company was keenly reviewing the SEC’s complaints against the two exchanges. </p>



<p>The fintech trading app listed Solana and Polygon in April 2022, with Cardano’s addition coming in September 2022. Developers behind ADA, Input Output Global (IOG), have publicly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-devs-vigorously-dispute-secs-classification-of-ada-as-a-security-as-robinhood-mulls-delisting-coin/">disputed </a>the SEC’s classification of the token as unregistered securities.</p>

<p>Australia-based attorney, Bill Morgan, has highlighted three upcoming events that are set to happen on the same day: June 13. Morgan thinks the said date will prove “monumental” for the crypto sector.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-important-events-to-watch-out-for-on-june-13"><strong>Important Events To Watch Out For On June 13</strong></h2>



<p>Pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan observed that Binance is expected to file its response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">injunction </a>for a temporary restraining order to freeze corporate assets, including cryptocurrencies, held by Binance.US.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The regulator and Binance.US are due back in court on June 13 regarding the matter — the same day the American entity of the global crypto exchange Binance says it will halt the use of fiat and transition to a crypto-only exchange.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, news broke that the SEC is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">suing </a>Binance, the CEO of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Changpeng Zhao (aka CZ), alleging the sale of unregistered securities, commingling of customer funds and that CZ was &#8220;secretly&#8221; controlling Binance.US. The SEC also launched a lawsuit <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">against rival U.S.-based exchange Coinbase</a> a day later.</p>



<p>And to boost its emergency motion seeking the freezing of Binance.US’s assets, the SEC also claimed that BAM Trading Services — the operator of Binance.US — and Binance deposited billions of dollars into one account that belonged to Merit Peak, of which Zhao is the beneficial owner.</p>



<p>Curiously, June 13 is also the day the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/groundbreaking-ripple-win-in-xrp-case-looking-likely-as-court-rejects-secs-request-to-keep-hinman-docs-hidden/">long-awaited Hinman emails</a> are set to be unsealed and the same day the House Financial Service Committee will discuss the future of digital assets. Many believe the committee hearing will mark another possible move toward a bipartisan negotiation on the law that could be the easiest way to take a first step toward U.S. regulation of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading 0.78% higher at $26,727 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Tuesday the 13<sup>th</sup> is likely the most important day of the week and could be trend-setting for the crypto market. It remains to be seen whether the monumental day turns out to be crypto’s best.</p>

<p>Even amid a regulatory upheaval, Cathie Wood of Ark Invest is sticking to one of the loftiest forecasts yet: that the price of Bitcoin will exceed $1 million by the end of the decade. The noted investor-cum-longtime bull for the crypto industry believes Bitcoin is a perfect hedge against inflation and counterparty risk. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wood-still-expects-btc-to-close-decade-at-1m"><strong>Wood Still Expects BTC To Close Decade At $1M</strong></h2>



<p>Cathie Wood has once again doubled down on her $1 million Bitcoin price prediction.</p>



<p>Wood said in a Thursday <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuAu0fGaII&amp;ab_channel=BloombergTelevision">interview </a>with <em>Bloomberg </em>that the “uncertainty and volatility” in the global economies have only increased her confidence in the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>For Wood, Bitcoin is an “antidote” to counterparty risks and a hedge against inflation. Because of this fundamental soundness, the investor says, bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2030. </p>



<p>In May 2021, Wood made her first bold price prediction during an interview on <em>Bloomberg</em>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/amid-crypto-market-armageddon-ark-invests-cathie-wood-still-thinks-bitcoin-can-go-to-500000/">forecasting Bitcoin would go to $500,000 by 2026</a>. In early 2022, she upped the ante to $1 million by 2030.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wood Says Coinbase Will Come Out Winner In SEC Suit</strong></h2>



<p>Wood has also been quite bullish on Coinbase in recent months. Speaking about the legal showdown at Binance and Coinbase amid SEC’s ongoing onslaught against the crypto industry, the Ark Invest CEO and CIO said that the two heavyweight crypto exchanges are “not at all in the same bucket”. </p>



<p>The SEC filed two major suits and an application for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">temporary restraining order</a> over two days against Binance and Coinbase, respectively the world’s and America’s biggest crypto exchanges. Despite the suits against the firms coming in quick succession, Wood emphasized that the Binance complaint was far more serious. She posited that “we have the competition for Coinbase disappearing, so that’s a good thing longer term for Coinbase.”</p>



<p>Wood further observed that it was “unfortunate” the SEC sued Coinbase the day after taking action against Binance and that SEC chair Gary Gensler was just “trying to implicate Coinbase in the same way he was implicating Binance.”  </p>



<p>Wood’s Ark Invest has scooped up huge amounts of Coinbase stock. On Tuesday, ARK purchased 419,324 shares of Coinbase worth about $22 million shortly after the SEC announced its complaint against the only publicly traded crypto exchange.</p>

<ul>
<li>Solana and XRP soared by 4% and 11%, respectively, in the last seven days performing above other top coins.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The uptick comes as XRP daily addresses surge near its record high and news of&nbsp; Ripple contemplating going public makes the rounds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Solana’s NFTs lose ground to BRC tokens, but its outlook is bullish despite the NFT downturn.</li>
</ul>



<p>The digital asset market has regained lost ground recovering from four-week lows with slight gains recorded in Bitcoin (BTC) amid thriving altcoins.</p>



<p>XRP was the biggest gainer in the crypto market this past week, surging 11% following positive reports from its case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and growth in its number of active users. XRP recorded a spike in network activity as the number of unique addresses increased to 490,000.</p>



<p>XRP also recorded a 45% Daily Active Address (DAA) spike in March, setting the tone for bullish traders expecting a similar rally following the recent data. Furthermore, talks of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/?amp">Ripple going public</a> after its case with the SEC also sprung up around crypto circles last week, with bulls setting eyes on $10.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Solana (SOL) showed strong signs at the start of the year before slowing down last month. SOL is up 4% in the past seven days as traders believe it can break past $24. Hovering below $20, SOL will need a 12% boost to overcome that resistance. The 24-hour trading volume for SOL stands at $303 million, a 59% gain from its previous averages, signifying growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Market leader Bitcoin recorded slight gains amid soaring altcoin and eventually retested $28,000 before plunging below $27,000. The leading altcoin, Ethereum (ETH), moved past $1,900 within the week but currently exchanges hands at $1,844.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-s-nft-tanks-again"><strong>Solana’s NFT tanks…. again</strong></h2>



<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been at the top of Solana’s growth attracting countless users and investors to the project. Previously, NFT activities on the platform have displaced&nbsp;Ethereum, with several pundits tipping Solana’s NFTs over top Ethereum releases.</p>



<p>The good days may be over for Solana as present figures remain a shadow of their former glory. In May, NFT sales plunged by nearly 50% to $44 million, and its overall activity declined by 12%. The slow growth in Solana marked a sharp spike in Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin-based NFTs soared 475% in the last 30 days, with over 10 million <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-attract-ethereum-devs-to-bitcoin-as-projects-mass-adoption-skyrockets/">inscriptions</a> since its launch. Ordinal sales volume stands at $194 million in May from $32 million in April. While controversy surrounds Ordinals, it has displaced the community dubbed “<em>kings of NFTs.”&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>ARK Invest, Cathie Wood&#8217;s investment firm, acquired additional shares of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, valued at over $21 million, despite ongoing accusations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>ARK Invest&#8217;s decision comes one day after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">sued</a> Coinbase, accusing it of operating as a national securities exchange and an unregistered broker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ark-invest-buys-21m-of-coinbase-shares-amidst-sec-accusations"><strong>ARK Invest buys $21M of Coinbase shares amidst SEC accusations</strong></h2>



<p>Cathie Wood and her investment firm demonstrated their confidence in Coinbase through a multimillion-dollar purchase, expecting long-term profits. Despite the SEC lawsuit, Coinbase remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the United States.</p>



<p>While many investors panicked over the SEC lawsuit, several ARK Invest ETFs took advantage of the stock price drop to make substantial purchases. The Ark Innovation ETF acquired 329,773 shares, the Next Generation Internet ETF acquired 53,885 shares, and the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF acquired 35,666 shares.</p>



<p>With the recent purchase of over 419,000 Coinbase shares, Ark Invest now holds a total of more than 11.4 million shares, valued at approximately $609 million based on the press time price of $51.6.</p>



<p>Although the decision to buy Coinbase shares at this time may seem risky, given the current regulatory environment and bearish market, Wood has shown that she has rarely been wrong in her investments, becoming one of Wall Street&#8217;s most respected gurus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase demands clarity from SEC on crypto asset regulation</strong></h2>



<p>This is not the first time Coinbase has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-v-sec-chamber-of-digital-commerce-weighs-in-argues-regulator-is-causing-substantial-economic-harm/">targeted by the SEC</a>. In 2022, regulators issued an enforcement action notice to the exchange, citing alleged securities law violations.</p>



<p>However, Coinbase immediately responded to the SEC&#8217;s accusations, stating that they lacked arguments and demanding greater clarity from a U.S. court on how the exchange should apply securities laws to digital assets. The court ordered the SEC to respond to the complaint within 30 days, but they have not complied with the orders thus far.</p>



<p>On May 7th, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals requested the SEC to respond within seven days to Coinbase&#8217;s complaints and clarify their rules on which assets should be considered securities and how they should be regulated.</p>



<p>Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, commented on Twitter that the Court of Appeals learned about the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit on the same day as the exchange, stating that regulators should not be proceeding with litigation against the crypto industry.</p>



<p>Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-risks-losing-global-technology-leadership-role-to-china-due-to-restrictive-crypto-policies-coinbase-ceo/">indicated</a> that if the SEC continues to attack crypto companies without providing clear regulation, it will drive them away from the country, as happened with some exchanges like Bittrex.</p>

<p>A long-dormant Bitcoin whale has resurfaced after 10 years, amassing an astounding profit of around $38 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transaction was reported by on-chain analysis firm LookIntoChain on Twitter, providing a glimpse into the intriguing world of cryptocurrency whales. As per the Thursday tweet, the dormant whale, who had remained inactive for over a decade, <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1E6nViR5Xv1wyNXg87SamvtLJ5TyXuksLC">initiated</a> a transfer of 1,432.93 BTC, equivalent to $37.8 million, to a new address labelled &#8220;bc1psv.&#8221;</p>



<p>The impressive nature of this transaction lies not only in the substantial profit but also in the lengthy period of inactivity. According to the tweet, the whale received these 1,432.92 BTC on April 9, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was a mere $195.4.</p>



<p>This event adds to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-whales-someone-just-moved-257-worth-of-bitcoin-from-a-dormant-address/">similar instances</a> where long-dormant whales resurface and make substantial moves within the cryptocurrency market. In April, another dormant whale transferred 400 BTC, valued at nearly $11 million, after a sleep of nearly 12 years. In February of this year, an old Bitcoin address that had remained untouched for 11 years initiated a transaction, moving $9.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. Mid last month, another whale holding 311 bitcoins since June 2011 woke up, transferring the coins to a new Segwit address</p>



<p>The emergence of these whales after extended periods of dormancy raises questions about their motivations and overall strategy. While some experts believe these movements signify profit-taking or strategic portfolio reallocations, others suggest that these whales may seek to drive the market, capitalizing on opportunities to acquire undervalued coins.</p>



<p>Regardless of their intentions, these events emphasize the significance of long-term investment strategies in cryptocurrency, with substantial profits often realized by those who patiently hold their assets.</p>



<p>Notably, cryptocurrency whales, particularly those who have held Bitcoin for extended periods, have been among the most successful investors in the market. Bitcoin&#8217;s remarkable growth of over 29,000,000 percent in the past 10 years is a testament to the potential returns garnered by those who have demonstrated a long-term investment approach. Moreover, research indicates that inexperienced retail investors who engage in short-term trading tend to fare less favourably than those who adopt a patient, long-term perspective.</p>



<p>That said, as the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, it is anticipated that similar instances of dormant whale awakening will continue to emerge, shaping the history of Bitcoin and fueling curiosity and interest in crypto.</p>

<p>Cardano blockchain builder Input Output Global (IOG) has rejected the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) claims that ADA is a security. The SEC had argued in lawsuits levied against two of the world’s biggest crypto brands this week that Cardano’s native token ADA and several other coins qualify as securities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-under-no-circumstances-is-ada-a-security-iog"><strong>“Under No Circumstances Is ADA A Security”: IOG</strong></h2>



<p>Input Output Global has responded to SEC’s recent claim that ADA is an unregistered security.</p>



<p>In a June 7 <a href="https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2023/06/07/iog-response-to-the-recent-sec-filings/">statement</a>, the Cardano developers refuted the SEC’s assertion, positing that “under no circumstances is ADA a security under U.S. securities laws. It never has been.”</p>



<p>IOG pointed out the lack of understanding of decentralized blockchains and stressed the importance of formulating responsible legislation in collaboration with regulators. The statement further notes that the regulation-by-enforcement approach employed by the SEC does not provide the clarity that the cryptocurrency industry is entitled to. IOG advocates for regulation that recognizes blockchain’s unique traits and the key role it can play in the modern world.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC Lawsuits And Possible Robinhood Delisting&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">sued </a>Coinbase on Tuesday, just one day after the securities watchdog sued Binance for unregistered securities offerings. A core pillar of the SEC’s charges against Binance and BAM Trading — the operator of Binance.US — is that the two commingled customers’ funds. In fact, the SEC has filed a new court document alleging that Binance and Binance.US redirected more than $12 billion worth of customer assets to firms controlled by Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao between 2019 and 2021.</p>



<p>The SEC claims America’s largest digital asset exchange Coinbase operated for years as an unlicensed securities exchange and “elevated its interest in increasing its profits over investors’ interests.”</p>



<p>In these two lawsuits, the SEC publicly declared which cryptocurrencies are in its sights. The regulator considers the following to be securities: Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Filecoin (FIL) and Sandbox (SAND), among several others. If these tokens were to be officially categorized as securities under federal laws, this could have profound ramifications for investors and crypto exchanges, likely altering the outlook of the crypto industry in the U.S.</p>



<p>Amid these growing regulatory concerns, online trading brokerage Robinhood has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-06/robinhood-reviews-crypto-offerings-after-regulatory-crackdown">revealed </a>it may soon cease offering trading services for several cryptocurrencies implicated in the SEC lawsuit, including ADA, to comply with U.S. securities laws. The potential removal of ADA from Robinhood’s trading platform comes less than a year after the company announced support for the peer-reviewed Proof of Stake (PoS) cryptocurrency. Robinhood <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-trading-for-over-20-million-robinhood-users-is-a-mind-blowing-ada-moonshot-incoming/">listed </a>ADA in September 2022 as part of a broader expansion of the company’s cryptocurrency offerings that year.</p>

<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price movements have presented a mix of positive indications and challenges, resulting in a cautious sense of optimism among investors regarding its future.</p>



<p>Throughout the previous week, Bitcoin had comfortably sustained a position above $27,000. However, the allegations against Binance and Coinbase have reignited concerns about the industry&#8217;s integrity and raised questions about regulators&#8217; intentions to tighten their control over the crypto sector.</p>



<p>The top cryptocurrency experienced a flash crash on Monday, plummeting to around $25,500 in response to the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lawsuit</a> against Binance for allegedly violating securities laws. However, Bitcoin showcased its resilience by swiftly rebounding, and on Tuesday, it surged to a price of $27,390, with traders seemingly disregarding SEC’s move.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81905" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-11-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>Earlier today, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode shed light on the market&#8217;s reaction to the mounting regulatory pressures. Notably, despite significant volatility triggered by the intensifying regulatory scrutiny from US authorities, Glassnode revealed that the recorded realized losses on-chain remained relatively low at $112 million.</p>



<p>“<em>This remains -$3.05B (-96.5%) smaller than the largest recorded capitulation event, suggesting an increased degree of resilience amongst market participants,” </em>tweeted the firm.</p>



<p>Cryptohell, an analyst from Cryptoquant, highlighted impressive long-term holder reactions amidst the negative news surrounding Binance. In a tweet, the analyst examined two indicators, Exchange Inflow &#8211; Spent Output Age Bands and Exchange Inflow &#8211; Spent Output Value Bands, to identify the investors responsible for the short-term correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>As per his analysis, long-term holders with a holding period of over one year did not engage in significant sell-offs. Instead, holders with 3-6 months holding periods, day traders, and weekly swing traders were identified as the current sellers.</p>



<p>The pundit concluded that long-term holders continue to retain their Bitcoin supply, leading to speculation that they may be preparing for the anticipated halving event in 2024.</p>



<p>That said, despite Tuesday’s resurgence, Bitcoin&#8217;s woes seem to have worsened, with the SEC reportedly asking a court to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">freeze the assets of Binance US</a> temporarily. This led to Bitcoin witnessing a further drop Wednesday, with crypto analyst “Material Indicators” tweeting, <em>&#8220;Yesterday went as predicted. Today, FUD continues to stimulate PA across the market.”</em></p>



<p>The pundit then shared his analysis, stating that Bitcoin is currently retesting the 200-Week Moving Average (MA). However, bid liquidity appears to be relatively low at this level. According to him, should the 200-Week MA fail to hold, he predicted another retest of the 50-Month MA, where both liquidity and sentiment exhibit greater strength.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="556" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-1024x556.png" alt="" class="wp-image-81904" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-1024x556.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-300x163.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-768x417.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10-1536x833.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-10.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Notably, Bitcoin has already formed a double bottom pattern at the 50-Month MA, which is visible in the hourly timeframes. If a triple bottom were to emerge, it would signal a bullish trend, according to Material Indicators.</p>



<p>However, the expert cautioned that a sudden price drop to $25,000 could potentially clear the path towards a bearish market sentiment, urging traders to “plan for the possibilities.&#8221;</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $26,384, down 0.27% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. </p>

<p>Binance lawyers have revealed that prior to becoming the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler offered up his advisory services to the exchange.</p>



<p>As the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance heats up, these attorneys say Gensler should thus recuse himself from the case, given his history with Binance and its founder and owner Changpeng Zhao.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gensler-once-offered-to-work-for-binance"><strong>Gensler Once Offered To Work For Binance</strong></h2>



<p>Binance’s legal team claims that SEC boss Gary Gensler previously offered to be an advisor to the cryptocurrency behemoth.</p>



<p>As per documents filed by the SEC on June 7, attorneys from Gibson &amp; Dunn and Latham &amp; Watkins — two of Binance’s law firms — alleged that Gensler offered to serve as an advisor to the exchange in March 2019 — not all that long ago. Gensler allegedly had several conversations with Binance execs, including Changpeng Zhao, before eventually meeting CZ in Japan for lunch, where they discussed the BNB token and Binance launching an exchange in the United States.</p>



<p>At the time, Gensler was a professor of the practice of global economics and management at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management. Nonetheless, he and Zhao kept in touch after the March meeting, and the Binance boss “understood that the now-Chairman was comfortable serving as an informal advisor,&#8221; something that Gensler had suggested, the filing claims. Zhao even accepted Gensler’s request and sat down with him to interview as part of a crypto course he was tutoring at MIT.</p>



<p>The lawyers claim Gensler was trying to get in good with Binance before he started going after the exchange. Gensler, sworn into office on April 17, 2021, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">alleged </a>on Monday that Binance, the world’s largest crypto asset exchange by volume, was operated through a “web of deception” by Zhao and commingled customer funds and shortly after announcing this lawsuit, the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">sought an emergency order</a> to freeze all assets on Binance.US.</p>



<p>Back in 2019, Gensler was scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, and he forwarded Zhao a copy of his planned testimony ahead of the hearing for advice, Binance’s lawyers revealed.</p>



<p>However, although the letter by the exchange’s legal team makes it appear that Gensler himself pitched Binance on the advisory position idea, a March <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texts-from-crypto-giant-binance-reveal-plan-to-elude-u-s-authorities-3a17ddeb">report </a>from the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> indicated that Binance had first approached the now SEC chairman. The WSJ cited internal messages and records from 2018 to 2020, claiming that the then head of Binance’s venture investing arm Ella Zhang, and Harry Zhou, co-founder of Binance-invested firm Koi Trading, first met with Gensler in October of 2018 to offer him an advisory role — an offer he later rejected.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Gensler’s Relationship With Binance Could Affect Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>If true, the latest revelation by the lawyers representing Binance could have a notable impact on the lawsuit with the SEC. Gensler’s former ties to Binance and Zhao potentially create a conflict of interest.</p>



<p>In fact, in the latest court filing, Binance demands Gensler’s recusal from any actions involving the exchange. </p>



<p><em>“Mr. Gensler should have been recused from any consideration in this matter based on this history and the prospect that Mr. Gensler may be a material fact witness,” Binance’s counsel wrote. “To date, the Staff has never confirmed whether Mr. Gensler has recused himself, and if he has not, the Commission’s explanation for why not.”</em></p>



<p>Binance’s legal team indicated that the SEC is yet to confirm if Gensler will be recused from the lawsuit. Still, according to <em>CNBC</em>, a spokesperson for the SEC said Gensler &#8220;is very familiar with and in full compliance with his ethical obligations, including any recusal obligations”.</p>

<p>According to blockchain data, centralized exchange volumes have fallen to an all-time low, with DEXs rising in popularity in the cryptocurrency market. The numbers show trading activity on centralized exchanges is declining and has reached its lowest point since October 2020.</p>



<p>The general sluggish market circumstances, the exit of well-known companies like Jane Street and Jump owing to regulatory worries, and the rise of decentralized exchanges with meme coin trading are some of the causes of this decline.</p>



<p>Decentralized exchanges are taking advantage of the rising need for better privacy and quicker asset listing. As centralized exchanges see a decrease, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have seen substantial growth.</p>



<p>By enabling direct peer-to-peer trading, these blockchain-based platforms provide improved security, anonymity, and control over funds. According to recent statistics from Dune, an on-chain analytics company, May has seen a noticeable surge in user activity on various decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms in May 2023. This increase in user numbers highlights the growing acceptance and popularity of DEXs in the crypto industry and is similar to the peak levels seen during the bullish market era in 2021.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has been having problems with its crypto gateway and delays in the deposit and withdrawal processes. Frustrated users have reported having trouble accessing their money. Delays and gateway issues are viewed as potential roadblocks for investors and traders using the Kraken platform, raising questions about its dependability and effectiveness.</p>



<p>Further on the legal front, a global emergency order to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-us-says-customer-funds-are-safe-as-sec-requests-restraining-order-to-freeze-assets/">freeze Binance.US assets</a> has been requested by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC&#8217;s action is part of a case now being litigated against the crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The development underscores the possible impact on Binance.US&#8217;s activities and assets and the increased regulatory scrutiny it is currently subject to. The development shows the importance of this regulatory action and the SEC&#8217;s efforts to impose control over Binance.US and its operations outside of the United States.</p>



<p>The agency claimed that the emergency restraining order was required to &#8220;prevent the dissipation of available assets for any judgment, given the Defendants&#8217; years of violative conduct, disregard of the laws of the United States.&#8221;</p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, is also required under the ruling to &#8220;show cause why a preliminary injunction&#8221; against him and two holding companies &#8220;should not be entered.&#8221;</p>



<p>The action follows the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Binance</a> and Zhao earlier this week, claiming that CZ and the exchange conspired to inappropriately combine money, deceive investors, and act as an unregistered broker, dealer, and clearing house.</p>

<p>Bitcoin shook off the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) latest enforcement actions to climb back up to as high as $27,300.13 today, according to CoinGecko. BTC recovering lost ground prompted Arthur Hayes, the founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, to make a bullish prediction for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-btc-bulls-unfazed-by-new-sec-lawsuits"><strong>BTC Bulls Unfazed By New SEC Lawsuits</strong></h2>



<p>Cryptocurrency prices largely ticked higher over the past 24 hours despite the uptick in regulatory scrutiny that the digital assets industry has confronted recently.</p>



<p>Bitcoin plummeted $25,400 on Monday in the hours after the SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">unveiled </a>a complaint against Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. But the crypto began inching higher by the end of the day and continued its path on Tuesday even as the securities regulator initiated a second lawsuit against Binance competitor Coinbase. In so doing, BTC regained all of its lost ground, as it returned to just below $27,000, where it is trading at press time, up 4.53 percent on the day. The second most valuable crypto, ether, also rallied Wednesday to trade hands near $1,900, a 2.94 percent gain over the last 24 hours.</p>



<p>Analyzing the bounce, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoHayes/status/1666232026054418432">stated </a>that the &#8220;wall of worry is being climbed,&#8221; encouraging his followers to join him on the &#8220;bull market bus&#8221; for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>“We are still on struggle street, but the moon ain’t far away,” Hayes tweeted.</p>



<p>Hayes’ prediction is a sign of strong conviction in a market that has been hit hard in recent days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Harsh Steps Against Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Crypto prices have been extremely volatile this week in the wake of news that the SEC had charged Binance and Coinbase with selling unlicensed securities in the country. Binance and the company’s chief executive officer, Changpeng Zhao, were struck with 13 civil charges by the SEC on Monday. The commission claims Binance was involved in an “extensive web of deception” by commingling customer funds. Coinbase, on the other hand, was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">accused </a>of failing to register with the SEC as an exchange, clearing house, and broker.</p>



<p>The charges came despite the SEC&#8217;s lack of regulatory clarity on which crypto tokens qualify as securities. The SEC has not provided any formal legal definitions to token issuers and is yet to give its response to a petition from Coinbase seeking clearer rules on crypto.</p>



<p>That said, Binance and Coinbase have <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-responds-to-secs-complaint-pledges-vigorous-defense-amid-overwhelming-industry-support/">vowed</a> to “vigorously defend” the suits against them.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has ordered the SEC to clarify its position on Coinbase’s rulemaking petition within one week.</p>

<ul>
<li>Digital asset lawyer John Deaton sees only a slight window of opportunity for the SEC to emerge victorious over Ripple.</li>



<li>The lawyer predicted an end to the case in September, with a likely split in the middle between Ripple and the SEC.</li>



<li>Fox Business reporter tweeted on Ripple hosting a roadshow meeting with investors to gather ideas on the possibility of a public offering.</li>
</ul>



<p>Positive signs have come out of Ripple and XRP spaces in the past week as its case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nears its end. Who comes out victorious will set a landmark precedent in cryptocurrency regulation in the future, experts say.</p>



<p>A web3 lawyer, John Deaton says there is only a 3% chance that the SEC will win its case against Ripple. While he conceded that the Commission might get some concessions, an outright win from the present realities will be impossible. </p>



<p>Deaton has been vocal in the defence of Ripple since the SEC filed its case against them and two executives, Brad Garlnghouse and Chris Larsen. The founder of CryptoLaw, while speaking on The Good Morning Crypto Podcast, stated that there is a 25% chance of an outright win by Ripple.</p>



<p>He explained his position by noting that Judge Torres will likely “<em>split the baby”, </em>with Ripple claiming most of the victory. Deaton illustrated his position by claiming that Judge Torres could rule that XRP offered before 2018 was a security. This is <a href="https://zycrypto.com/web3-lawyer-backs-ripple-amid-discovery-of-conversation-between-sec-staff-prior-to-the-hinman-speech/">hinged</a> on the Hinman documents, a speech made by a former SEC director in 2018, therefore, digital assets can become commodities if they are fully decentralized.</p>



<p>“<em>I think that XRP itself is going to be deemed not a security and that I think that secondary market sales show comment. Even if [Judge Torres] does rule finding that Ripple violated the law, that doesn&#8217;t apply to secondary market sales,” </em>Deaton noted.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-at-last-the-end-is-finally-within-sight"><strong>At last!! The end is finally within sight</strong></h2>



<p>Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse, alongside other stakeholders, have predicted an end to the case in the coming months. According to Deaton, the case would be concluded before Sept 30 because of the “<em>six-month list” </em>judges have to file. The list which is published in March and September, highlights all summary judgments pending more than six months.</p>



<p>“<em>She has never been on this list. It’s like a public shame list that says, ‘Look I’m shitty at my job,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>Deaton also predicted the price of XRP post the case stating that the price could soar between $2 and $10. Deaton’s views have been justified by a renewed surge of XRP following a tweet from Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terret on Ripple hosting a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-contemplates-ipo-as-sec-lawsuit-finally-nears-end-will-it-propel-xrp-to-10/">roadshow</a> with investors on the possibilities of going public soon.</p>



<p>At press time, XRP exchanges hands at $0.52, surging over 11% in the past ten days.</p>

<p>Block co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey — also co-founder and former CEO of Twitter — has caused outrage in the Ethereum community after claiming that the network’s native token, ether (ETH), is a security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ether-a-security"><strong>Ether A Security?</strong></h2>



<p>Noted Bitcoin enthusiast and investor Jack Dorsey got into an online scuffle with multiple industry experts and prominent figures on Tuesday after designating ether as a security.</p>



<p>Amid the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">lawsuit </a>against Coinbase, Pierre Rochard, vice president of research at Riot Platforms, suggested that the San Francisco-based exchange should refocus its attention on Bitcoin. Rochard was referencing a 2015 post by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, where he referred to altcoins as a “distraction” and implied that the company should instead “be focused” on Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Jack Dorsey voiced support for prioritizing the OG cryptocurrency amid regulatory pressures. The Twitter founder added that there are only three truly censorship-resistant technologies at scale today: tor, bitcoin, and nostr. While these technologies are presently not accessible to most people or even easy to use, Dorsey is convinced that they will be someday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you are well aware, Dorsey is a long-time Bitcoin supporter, who has expressed his strong belief in its potential to become a global currency. Back in 2014, Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin could become the &#8220;native currency of the internet.&#8221; He has continued to endorse the flagship cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology through his different ventures, including Block’s Cash App, a mobile payment service that lets users buy and sell BTC.</p>



<p>Asked by one Twitter user whether ethereum, the second-largest crypto by market cap, is a security, Dorsey simply <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1666078896327122946">replied</a>: “Yes.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crypto Twitter Reacts</strong></h2>



<p>Dorsey’s remark prompted brutal backlash from crypto pundits, including ordinals proponent and independent developer at Taproot Wizards Udi Wertheimer, who indicated Dorsey was a “clown” in a Tuesday tweet.</p>



<p>Dorsey replied saying, “ETH is not a security? Teach me wizard,” to which Wertheimer <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1666197838852677638">shared a viral 2018 video</a> where SEC chair Gary Gensler acknowledged that ether was not a security as it had attained sufficient decentralization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Twitter war comes in light of the SEC launching high-profile lawsuits against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">Coinbase </a>and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance </a>for allegedly offering a slew of tokens like Cardano, Solana, Polygon, Dash, Filecoin, and others, which the agency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-community-mount-offensive-against-the-u-s-sec-for-naming-ada-a-security/">considers </a>to be unregistered securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the Digital Asset director at VanEcK, Gabor Gurbacs, appeared to agree with Dorsey on Ether’s security designation. Gurbacs <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1666218913699356673">argued </a>that Ethereum’s switch last year from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system for operating its network brought it closer in alignment with the SEC’s definition of a security.</p>



<p>An ether-as-a-security world would have serious consequences for the broader crypto industry. It is not, however, a foregone conclusion that the SEC will soon categorize ETH as a security.</p>
