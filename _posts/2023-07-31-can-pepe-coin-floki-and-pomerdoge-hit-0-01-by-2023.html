Pepe (PEPE) Soar on Bullish Whale Activity 
<p class="s8">Pepe (PEPE) is a cryptocurrency inspired by the internet meme Pepe the Frog. Surprisingly, Pepe experienced a phenomenal rally after its launch on April 16th, achieving a 7000% price pump within just 17 days.</p>
<p class="s8">However, its price sharply dropped to $0.000001153 on May 12th, 2023, and has been on a decline since then. According to CoinMarketCap, Pepe is bullish today trading at $0.00000143, an increase of 12% in the last 24 hours. This is coming after huge whale activity.</p>
<p class="s8">Lookonchain, a blockchain analytics firm, revealed that two whales bought over 1.56 trillion tokens. This is about 1,100 ETH ($2.06 million). Although Pepe's price has dropped, it still maintains a robust market cap of over $500 million. However, being a meme coin with no use case, Pepe would have a tough time reaching $0.01. Besides, Pepe will have to soar more than 600,000x to reach $0.01.</p>
Floki Inu (FLOKI) Drops 8% on the Weekly Chart 
<p class="s8">The Floki Inu (FLOKI) project initially started as a meme-coin based on Elon Musk's dog. However, it has since evolved into a fully-fledged web3 project, spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. The Floki token is now famously referred to as "The People's Crypto." Meanwhile, Floki Inu is bearish on the weekly timeframe, trading at $0.00002243. This is an 8.01% price decline in the past 7 days.</p>
<p class="s8">Floki Inu is 93.46% away from its all-time high of $0.0003437. Similarly, Floki Inu's trading volume has been on a steep decline. It has dropped by about &nbsp;24.10% in the last 24 hours, a sign of low market activity and support from investors. Looking forward, Floki Inu has a bleak chance of hitting 0.01$ in 2023.</p>
Analysts: Pomerdoge (POMD) To Skyrocket 4,000%
<p class="s8">Unlike Pepe and Floki Inu, Pomerdoge has a great utility that would increase its price in 2023. Currently, the token's price stands at a mere $0.007. Despite this, analysts express a bullish outlook on the project, projecting an impressive 4,000% ROI for potential investors.</p>
<p class="s8">Pomerdoge aims to capitalize on the potential of the blockchain gaming market as a P2E cryptocurrency game. As per MarketsandMarkets, the global blockchain gaming market will hit $65.7 billion by 2027.</p>
<p class="s8">Pomerdoge's vision is to foster global connections among players by offering an engaging and competitive gaming experience. The SolidProof and Cyberscope have already audited the project, ensuring user security. &nbsp;At the heart of the Pomerdoge ecosystem lies $POMD, the Pomerdoge token.</p>
<p class="s8">This in-game currency grants users access to a variety of benefits, including NFTs, rewards, and exclusive items from the Pomerdoge marketplace.</p>
