<p>The Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a cryptocurrency academy aimed at educating those wanting to invest in digital assets free of charge. </p>
<p>The Thai SEC announced recently that it launched &ldquo;Crypto Academy,&rdquo; an initiative aimed at providing free online resources and courses on digital assets for all those wanting to invest in the sector. The SEC said the &lsquo;academy&rsquo; is aimed at equipping the public with in-depth knowledge of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology before they invest. The regulator argues:</p>

<p>The more you know your investments, the less risk you will have.</p>

Four Courses Offer Comprehensive Knowledge of Crypto
<p>The Crypto Academy offers four courses on crypto and blockchain technology. The first offers new investors a basic understanding of the digital asset market, including the definition of cryptocurrency and the principles of blockchain technology. The second educate potential investors on the key features of cryptocurrencies and the technologies that underlie them. The second course also includes information on Bitcoin, decentralisation, and peer-to-peer systems.</p>
<p>A third of the courses cover pertinent events from the past, the present, and also the future, including bitcoin halving and previous market crashes. This course further covers the digital asset ecosystem, digital tokens, NFTs, the metaverse, and the future of the crypto market. Finally, the fourth course focuses on investment strategies, portfolio diversification, investor sentiment, and basic price analysis through the use of charts and other indicators, and finally covers asset management.</p>
<p>The SEC has also taken the initiative to include a very useful tool that could potentially save many from losing their money &ndash; a Crypto Quotient (CQ). The CQ is a self-assessment for investors that they can use to test their knowledge of the crypto world to ascertain whether they are ready to enter the market.</p>
India Launches Crypto Awareness Campaign
<p>Asian countries have seemingly taken charge of informing their citizens of the cryptocurrency market and the potential dangers thereof. The Indian government is reportedly launching a similar initiative aimed at raising awareness of cryptocurrencies. India however takes a slightly different approach to Thailand, by focusing much of their campaign on the legal status of cryptocurrencies rather than purely educating its citizens on the intricacies of crypto and all that involves the digital asset market. India&rsquo;s approach seems to be aimed at discouraging citizens to invest in the sector, while Thailand tries to educate its citizens before they enter the market &ndash; providing a sense of encouragement.</p>
