					<description><![CDATA[<p>According to a CNBC report on May 8, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussed the regulatory hurdles his company is facing during the Dubai Fintech Summit. Garlinghouse revealed that Ripple has spent a whopping $200 million defending itself against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit, which he claims &#8220;doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense&#8221; [&#8230;]</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/08/ripple-will-have-spent-200-million-fighting-sec-lawsuit-ceo-says.html">CNBC report</a> on May 8, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussed the regulatory hurdles his company is facing during the Dubai Fintech Summit. <br /><br />Garlinghouse revealed that <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ripple-president-responds-to-multibillion-dollar-win-in-crucial-market/">Ripple</a> has spent a whopping $200 million defending itself against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit, which he claims &#8220;doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense&#8221; from its inception. <br /><br />This was the first time Garlinghouse has publicly disclosed the cost of the legal conflict, and he argues that the U.S. is<em> &#8220;definitely stuck&#8221;</em> when it comes to regulation.<br /><br />In response to the regulatory landscape in the U.S., Garlinghouse announced via <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1655563716795170818">Twitter</a> that Ripple plans to expand to Dubai. He highlighted that the MENA region, where 20% of Ripple&#8217;s customers are based, has<em> &#8220;clear regulatory regimes&#8221;</em> and is on its way to becoming a global financial hub.<br /><br />Ripple has been facing regulatory challenges since December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple and its executives of breaching securities regulations by selling XRP tokens.<br /><br />Ripple isn&#8217;t the only company attempting to challenge the SEC, with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also preparing to take on the regulator after receiving a Wells notice. It remains unclear whether Ripple&#8217;s or Coinbase&#8217;s challenge will succeed.</p>

<p>According to recent data from crypto-analytic firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1654355262638288897">Santiment</a>, the Ethereum network has reached an eight-month high in active deposits. <br /><br />This metric includes all incoming and outgoing transactions involving deposit addresses, including user-to-exchange and exchange-to-wallet transactions.<br /><br />However, this surge in deposits could potentially lead to increased volatility in Ethereum&#8217;s price. Such volatility could have a similar impact as the blockchain&#8217;s transition from PoW to PoS during Merge or FTX&#8217;s collapse.<br /><br />Despite the widely expected 25 basis point interest rate hike by the Fed, Ether&#8217;s price has remained stagnant within a narrow range due to low trading volume. The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-what-awaits-eth-ethereum-developer-gives-key-determinant-for-shanghai-mainnet-launch-date/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which took place on April 12th, also failed to impress investors, as the asset only increased by 3% after the event.<br /><br />While it is unclear which direction Ether&#8217;s price will take in the short term, data suggests that there is increased selling pressure on the asset. Whales holding 1,000 to 10,000 ETH have offloaded a significant amount of tokens over the past two weeks, which has contributed to the suppression of the price.<br /><br />Furthermore, on May 2nd, ETH saw a transfer of $505 million to crypto exchange <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-faces-doj-investigation-for-alleged-violation-of-russian-sanctions/">Binance</a>. This level of exchange inflow was last seen before the Merge and is generally considered a bearish indication, as investors depositing their ETH tokens on exchanges are typically preparing to sell.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-accused-of-deliberately-flouting-laws-by-cftc-chief/">Binance,</a> the cryptocurrency exchange, is reportedly being investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) for potentially violating Russian sanctions, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-05/binance-faces-us-probe-of-possible-russian-sanctions-violations">Bloomberg</a>. <br /><br />The DOJ’s national security division is said to be investigating whether Binance or its executives evaded sanctions related to Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, with sanctions imposed since early 2022.<br /><br />Binance reportedly limited its services to Russia in April 2022. The DOJ’s criminal division is also said to be conducting a separate ongoing inquiry.<br /><br />As per sources, the DOJ&#8217;s national security division is currently investigating the potential violation of Russian sanctions by Binance, along with another ongoing inquiry by the DOJ&#8217;s criminal division. <br /><br />No charges have been filed, and the exchange has not been officially named as part of the investigation. Binance is also said to have engaged with the DOJ to resolve issues relating to Iranian sanctions evasion.<br /><br />In March, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) charged Binance with permitting illegal access to commodities by its users. Senator Elizabeth Warren also addressed Binance’s handling of cryptocurrency from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on May 4.</p>

<p>North Carolina has become the latest state to ban <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-central-bank-digital-currency-is-inevitable-says-federal-reserve-official/">central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC) payments and testing. Lawmakers in North Carolina have passed a bill to ban central bank digital currency (CBDC) payments and block the state from participating in testing, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1653918920305414146">Dennis Porter</a>, co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund.<br /><br />The digital dollar, which was previously touted as a potential solution for reducing currency system costs, cross-border payment friction, and counterfeiting, seems to have taken a backseat to the FedNow instant payment service, which is set to launch in <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/03/16/fednow-fed-digital-dollar-stablecoins-cbdc/">July</a>. <br /><br />However, critics have raised concerns about personal privacy infringement, centralization of power, and security breaches, which could make the system vulnerable to hacking.<br /><br />The progress of the digital dollar has appeared to have stalled in favor of the FedNow instant payment service, which is scheduled to launch in July.<br /><br />Former Coinbase CTO Balaji Srinivasan has suggested that FedNow is a precursor to the digital dollar system. Supporters say CBDCs reduce the cost of running a currency system and reduce cross-border payment friction, but critics raise concerns about privacy, centralization, and security. <br /><br />Catherine Fitts, a former US government official, has criticized CBDCs, calling them a “financial transaction control grid.” <br /><br />She urged viewers not to believe the propaganda that they are convenient and necessary. Florida and North Carolina have passed anti-CBDC legislation, with <a href="https://twitter.com/Dennis_Porter_/status/1653918457396879361">Porter</a> claiming &#8220;we are winning.&#8221; <br /><br />Senator Ted Cruz has <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-prohibit-the-fed-from-establishing-a-central-bank-digital-currency">introduced</a> legislation to prohibit the development of a digital dollar, arguing that it would stifle innovation and freedom.</p>

The company&#8217;s restructuring plan, which saw the layoff of 950 staff in January, cost $144 million, near the lower end of its previous estimates.<br /><br />Coinbase also acknowledged the loss of Silvergate Bank and Silicon Valley Bank as banking partners. The company reported that it has replaced these banks&#8217; 24/7 instant settlement services and onboarded new partners to ensure redundancy.<br /><br />The news of Coinbase&#8217;s positive financial report has boosted its stock, with <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-gains-regulatory-approval-to-operate-in-bermuda/">COIN</a> up 1.51% today and up 7.05% after hours.

<p>The<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20230503a.htm"> Federal Reserve</a> has increased its benchmark rate to between 5% and 5.25%, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price showing little reaction to the news. <br /><br />The market had largely predicted the rate hike, with the central bank raising interest rates to combat high consumer price index inflation. Some financial experts, like <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitmex-adds-14-tokens-as-it-expands-beyond-trading-derivatives/">BitMEX</a> co-founder Arthur Hayes, had speculated that the Fed might stop raising rates and even begin lowering them sooner than expected due to bank failures.<br /><br />However, the Fed has remained firm in hiking rates, stating that it will adjust its monetary policy if risks emerge that could hinder its goals.<br /><br />Despite a reduction in inflation to 5%, there are concerns that the Fed&#8217;s efforts to protect the banking system could lead to an increase in inflation in the future.<br /><br />The FOMC has announced its goal to achieve maximum employment and 2% inflation in the long run. <br /><br />The committee has also stated that it will consider previous actions, policy delays, and economic and financial events in deciding on future actions, unlike previous meetings where it anticipated further rate hikes. <br /><br />It is now expected that the rate hikes will be put on hold to assess macroeconomic conditions</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-03/truthgpt-elon-musk-ai-crypto-tokens-draw-the-ire-of-state-regulators">reported</a> on May 3 that regulators in <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/texas-securities-board-shuts-down-cloud-mining-firm-over-unregistered-offerings/">Texas</a> are cracking down on the individual behind two cryptocurrencies that aim to capitalize on Elon Musk&#8217;s AI projects. The two tokens are called <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-gains-5-as-elon-musk-meets-with-north-american-bitcoin-miners/">Elon Musk</a> AI Token and TruthGPT Coin, with the latter named after Musk&#8217;s proposed ChatGPT competitor of the same name.<br /><br />Joe Rotunda, enforcement director for the Texas State Securities Board (TSSB), has alleged that the tokens are<em> &#8220;part of a fraudulent securities scheme&#8221;</em> and issued a cease-and-desist order in conjunction with other states. <br /><br />The TSSB&#8217;s filing names San Francisco resident and entrepreneur Horatiu Charlie Caragaceanu as the promoter of both assets. Caragaceanu claims that the tokens are powered by a trading platform that uses an AI algorithm developed by Musk to create trading strategies. <br /><br />However, Musk has not created any such system. The TSSB&#8217;s filing also names Caragaceanu&#8217;s company, The Shark of Wall Street, as a promoter of the assets. <br /><br />The regulator noted that Caragaceanu&#8217;s earlier assets, including various NFTs and a Shark of Wall Street token, have lost their value. In recent months, numerous crypto projects have attempted to capitalize on trends related to ChatGPT and other AI projects, including fraudulent examples of ChatGPT honeypot tokens. <br /><br />On May 2, digital artist Rhett Mankind created a meme coin using AI that saw $26 million in trading volume on Uniswap over 24 hours.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/microstrategy-adds-to-bitcoin-holdings-with-150-million-btc-purchase/">MicroStrategy</a>, a company that provides BI solutions, cloud computing, and software services to a range of clients, has emerged as one of the world&#8217;s largest Bitcoin holders with approximately 140k Bitcoins in reserves. <br /><br />The decision to purchase Bitcoin in bulk was made by former CEO Michael Saylor in 2020, citing concerns over inflation. Saylor believes that the strategy of simply holding Bitcoin has given MicroStrategy an edge over its rivals in the BI industry. <br /><br />Despite the uncertainty regarding the regulation of cryptocurrencies in the US and other countries, Bitcoin has made a comeback recently, spiking by over 70% over the past quarter. This has allowed MicroStrategy to turn a profit this quarter, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-01/microstrategy-posts-profit-on-benefit-tied-to-bitcoin-holdings?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter">Bloomberg</a>. <br /><br />The company&#8217;s quarterly report indicated a net income of $461 million in Q1, with firm shares trading at $31.79. The company also took advantage of tax benefits resulting from its Bitcoin stash. <br /><br />Bitcoin&#8217;s price appreciation allowed MicroStrategy to repay a loan from Silvergate at a 22% discount and strategically manage its balance sheet by adding 7,500 bitcoins in the quarter. <br /><br />Thanks to Saylor&#8217;s confidence in Bitcoin, the company is now reporting profits while most of its peers are faltering amid inflation and a looming recession.</p>

<p>On May 2, Europol announced that law enforcement agencies worldwide had seized and closed down Monopoly Market, an illegal <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/dark-market-search-site-deepdotweb-gets-seized-by-fbi-for-money-laundering/">dark web</a> marketplace, as part of their efforts to crack down on illicit cryptocurrency transactions.<br /><br />The operation, known as SpecTor, resulted in the seizure of $53.4 million in cash and crypto and the arrest of 288 vendors who primarily sold drugs and firearms on Monopoly Market and other similar websites.<br /><br />Of the 288 arrests, 153 were made in the US, 55 in the UK, and 52 in Germany, with one Californian man accounting for over $2 million worth of sales of methamphetamines and fentanyl. The remaining arrests were made in the Netherlands, Austria, France, Switzerland, Poland, and Brazil. Operation SpecTor involved law enforcement agencies from eight countries.<br /><br />Europol stated that Operation SpecTor began in October 2021 and is part of the same efforts by law enforcement agencies that led to the seizure and closure of Hydra and Genesis Market in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Hydra was the largest illegal marketplace operating on the dark web, while Genesis was the largest identity theft market.<br /><br />As with the operation against Hydra, German police initially seized the server infrastructure of Monopoly Market in December 2021 and began a <em>&#8220;honey pot&#8221;</em> operation in collaboration with Europol and other agencies worldwide. The operation targeted &#8220;high value&#8221; vendors supplying millions of dollars&#8217; worth of illegal goods to multiple markets across the globe.<br /><br />The US Justice Department described Operation SpecTor as an <em>&#8220;unprecedented&#8221;</em> enforcement action by a consortium of US and international law enforcement agencies against dark web drug markets and illicit crypto transactions.<br /><br />During a press conference, Attorney General Merrick Garland <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?527819-1/attorney-general-garland-news-conference-targeting-fentanyl-trafficking">stated</a> that the DoJ&#8217;s efforts to combat the fentanyl epidemic and the Sinaloa Cartel had revealed that criminals were increasingly turning to the dark web and selling drugs in exchange for cryptocurrencies. Garland added that the DoJ intended to pursue every criminal on the dark web, no matter where they tried to hide in the <em>&#8220;farthest reaches of the internet.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Creditors of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/celsius-network-ceo-has-revival-plans-post-crypto-crash/">Celsius Network</a> LLC are seeking a subpoena against FTX to obtain information that may identify users involved in suspicious cryptocurrency trades that may have manipulated the price of Celsius’ native token last year. <br /><br />The creditors&#8217; committee said they want to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-26/celsius-creditors-seek-to-unmask-suspicious-ftx-crypto-trades?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic"> subpoena FTX</a> for information to identify users behind ten cryptocurrency wallets that they allege engaged in suspicious trades of Celsius’ CEL coin between April and August. <br /><br />The committee said they retained blockchain consultant Elementus Inc., which identified 947 transactions over a three-day period <em>“involving a near one-to-one relationship”</em> between CEL token deposits and withdraws between the ten private crypto wallets and wallets on the FTX exchange. <br /><br />The CEL trades in question occurred between the date Celsius paused customer withdrawals on June 12 and the company’s Chapter 11 filing on July 13, when the price of the token was 81 cents.<br /><br />The company has valued the token at 20 cents in its proposed Chapter 11 plan, but a committee representing Celsius creditors alleges that suspicious trades of the token on FTX may have artificially inflated the price to 81 cents between June and July 2020.<br /><br />FTX has not yet agreed to engage in informal discovery, and the bankruptcy case is being heard in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
