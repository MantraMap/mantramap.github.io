<p>Gary Gensler, chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has warned investors against dabbling with cryptocurrencies, likening the asset class to “the wild west”. </p>



<p>Speaking alongside SEC commissioner Caroline Crenshaw during a Wednesday meeting with US Army on Twitter spaces, Gensler advised the soldiers against getting caught up in the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) narrative that is being driven around cryptocurrencies. According to him, the fact that cryptocurrencies were <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-will-continue-treating-crypto-assets-like-other-securities-regardless-of-their-technology-gary-gensler/">largely non-compliant</a> with basic US financial regulations, highly speculative and volatile, disqualified them as worthy investment vehicles.</p>



<p><em>“The reason some of them are not under the agency is because of non-compliance. Most of these assets are not complying with the securities laws but they should be.”</em> Gensler said before adding, “<em>It’s the wild west</em>.”</p>



<p>He further predicted an <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-chair-gensler-predicts-destructive-ending-for-defis-100-billion-industry/">epic failure for most crypto projects</a>, likening them to any other business startup.</p>



<p><em>“Most of these 10 or 15 thousand tokens will fail. That’s because venture capital fails,</em> and new startups fail. History also tells us that there is not much room for micro currencies. So, don’t get caught up in the FOMO, the fear of missing out; please<em> don’t get caught up in that.”</em></p>



<p>On the other hand, Mrs Crenshaw advised the soldiers to be wary of the significant risks posed by cryptocurrencies, adding that it was important if they chose to invest in assets they “really” understood.</p>



<p><em>“It’s important to understand that crypto is novel and speculative. There are really reduced investor protections because most of them have not chosen to come under the SEC limits- so they are outside our traditional fundamentally important protections,” </em>she said.</p>



<p>According to her, although the blockchain was transparent, the crypto sector had been infiltrated by nefarious actors aiming to perpetuate scams and hide their bad dealings.</p>



<p><em>“So, if you are considering investing in crypto give careful consideration to how much of your portfolio to devote to it and certainly no more than you can afford to lose,”</em> she concluded.</p>



<p>Gensler’s comments come even as the industry faces an unprecedented number of bankruptcies by leading crypto firms. In the past two years, crypto has been a hot sector, attracting a wall of money from both retail and institutional investors. However, since November 2021, cryptocurrencies have retreated sharply, worsening the situation after the Terra Luna collapse in May last year.</p>



<p>Last November, the epic tumble of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire deteriorated things further, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-community-calls-for-congressional-probe-into-sec-gary-genslers-ties-to-bankrupt-ftx/">dragging the SEC</a> right in the middle for its alleged failure to put the necessary guard rails to prevent FTX’s collapse.</p>

<p>After an epic battle for control at the beginning of January, Bitcoin bulls managed to topple bears this week, with the price soaring past $18,000 on Dec 12 for the first time since mid-December.</p>



<p>At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by traded volume was exchanging hands at $18,687 after a 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Earlier in the day, the price rose as high as $18,780, marking the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-cardano-eye-explosion-to-new-highs-bitcoin-recaptures-17k-as-exchange-signals-tilt-bullish/">sixth consecutive day</a> for the asset to print a bullish candle.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-77100" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-2-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>For most of the day, the crypto market remained green, with Ethereum adding roughly 6% to tap a two-month high of $1,400. On the other hand, Cardano, Solana and XRP traded mostly sideways, adding about 5% each.</p>



<p>Avalanche was the biggest gainer among the top 20 coins by market capitalization, adding 21.11% in the past day. On Wednesday, the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/avax-sees-massive-boost-on-avalanches-partnership-with-amazon-web-services/">network partnered</a> with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale blockchain services for businesses and governments. Overall, the global crypto market cap rose by 4.78% to tap&nbsp;$900 Billion,&nbsp;marking the largest single-day push this year.</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s impressive ascent over the past seven days has been attributed to a return of big social dominance spikes as the asset’s plunge offers extremely discounted prices. After being kept at bay by poor market liquidity towards the end of 2022, onchain data shows that whales with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC added around 20,000 BTC to their holdings between Jan 5 and Jan 11.</p>



<p>Today, Glassnode noted that over 13% of the circulating supply had returned to profit, making it a significant milestone since mid-2022.</p>



<p><em>“As Bitcoin rallies to $18.2k, over 13% of the Circulating Supply has returned to profit. The observed sharp move upwards in this metric helps to confirm that a large volume of BTC was acquired between $16.5k and $18.2k,” </em>wrote Glassnode sharing the chart below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/uSSYt_yyQgZQhSxGfRIwy5ZqJpoRcAJ8LTaFbC45fSyfO7Dj2QraJVGgzB-JyxxD18kgDsU8wnyA0nFT2Nm5dm5VeOoWkUSl-PkCM6uEa01pMjjvZA1xENZUMxuxYF-Mu_P97fJ_l6HMpHub2bs31xyBOj81AvcwTcCD7icWBYiV_8vFbiZVK4U3Xu2LGFMQ3nZJFa_eEw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>On the other hand, observers have attributed <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-is-positioned-to-outperform-bitcoin-bloombergs-top-strategist-asserts/">Ethereum’s recovery</a> to the impending Shanghai upgrade. The upgrade, due in March, will allow users to unstake and withdraw their Ether which has been locked into the Beacon chain since December 2020. Furthermore, the upgrade is expected to reduce centralization on Ethereum, allowing more projects to onboard and, as a result, liquidity to flow into the ecosystem.</p>



<p>That said, the markets seem to be pricing that in advance. 3,000 new shark addresses (holding 100 to 10,000 $ETH) have shown up on the network over the past week bringing the total number of shark addresses since Feb 2021 to 48,556.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, onchain data showed that shark and whale addresses holding different cryptocurrencies have been accumulating Tether, the top stablecoin by market cap, as they prepare for the next bull run. According to Santiment, <em>“There are now 21,459 addresses that hold $100k or more USDT, just 1% from a new all-time high.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Ferrari announces the termination of its partnership with the Velas Blockchain after 12 months.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The premature ending of the sponsorship deal is rumoured to cost Ferrari up to $55 million in losses.</li>



<li>Several racing teams in the Formula One have ended their partnerships with virtual currency service providers in the last year.</li>
</ul>



<p>Scuderia Ferrari, the racing arm of luxury automobile brand Ferrari, has decided to terminate its contract with Velas, with insiders claiming that multiple contract breaches and fears of bankruptcy fuelled the premature ending.</p>



<p>Ferrari revealed its official list of sponsors ahead of the new season, but Velas was conspicuously absent from the exclusive bunch. Only last year, Velas Blockchain was unveiled as a blockchain partner in a multi-year deal worth over $30 million.</p>



<p>A core focus of the partnership between both entities was the creation of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) for fans. Insiders claim that Ferrari breached several clauses related to digital collectibles amid claims that Velas was tethering on the brink of bankruptcy.</p>



<p>It is unclear if Velas had any exposure to FTX’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/a-deliberate-move-shark-tank-star-kevin-oleary-blames-binance-for-ftx-collapse/">implosion</a> back, but the termination might cause Ferrari losses of up to $55 million as both parties head to court. Data from CoinMarketCap shows a steep decline of 95% from its all-time high in Nov 2021, with some suggesting that a bleak future for the platform may have forced Ferrari to terminate the deal. </p>



<p>Ferrari extended the terminations to its data analysis partner Snapdragon ahead of the new season, which financial experts believe could set the racing team back by $25 million.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bad-streak-for-formula-one">A bad streak for Formula One</h2>



<p>Formula One teams are turning their backs on crypto partnerships following a series of unsavory incidents in the virtual currency ecosystem. In the wake of the digital asset exchange&#8217;s liquidity issues, Mercedes took a $15 million hit after it severed its contract with FTX.</p>



<p>Red Bull Racing partnership followed suit, deciding not to renew its agreement with The Tezos Foundation over an unfortunate case of strategy misalignment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mercedes’ team lead Toto Wolff predicted that more teams would be forced to terminate their deals with crypto firms as advertising regulators tighten the noose around advertising guidelines relating to digital asset investments.</p>

<p>CNBC’s mad money host Jim Cramer has implored crypto investors to “sell everything”, terming the sector as a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/no-real-value-cnbcs-jim-cramer-predicts-deeper-crypto-crash/">house of cards</a>.</p>



<p>The veteran markets reporter made the utterances Tuesday when asked about his thoughts on the ongoing crypto sector onslaught, particularly with the massive jobs cuts by Coinbase.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;This whole thing is just a house of cards,” </em>Cramer,67, said during an interview with Squawk Box host Andrew Ross. “<em>I don&#8217;t think anyone should be in any of these. I think everything should be sold,” </em>he added.</p>



<p>He went on to criticize Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), suggestively referencing them as one of the biggest examples of all that is wrong with crypto.</p>



<p><em>“Does anyone really own NFTs? I don&#8217;t even know what to do with a fungible token. What do you do with a non-fungible token?” </em>he asked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He went on to warn that the SEC would soon come knocking, potentially toppling crypto prices further as Gary Gensler “has had it”. </p>



<p><em>“There isn’t anything that’s not going to be manipulated and investigated, and the SEC is going to come in and sweep everything.”</em></p>



<p>Cramer’s comments come after he referred to investors who own various cryptocurrencies as idiots last month, asking the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to conduct “a big sweep” on the crypto sector. At the time, the former hedge fund manager <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1606510226655436800">told</a> CNBC that he “would not touch crypto in a million years because I wouldn’t trust the deposit bank” and advised crypto investors to try getting their money out.</p>



<p>That said, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cnbcs-jim-cramer-describes-xrp-solana-dogecoin-as-giant-cons/">Cramer’s messages</a> have often been downplayed by the crypto community, more so for making market forecasts that turned out to be wrong.</p>



<p><em>“Thanks for the bottom signal Jim Cramer,”</em> one tweep commented after Cramer’s latest warning.</p>



<p>“<em>For 25 years, I have listened to JC. I came to view him as entertainment and self-serving. I watched him get banned from CNBC. I saw him implode at a Robin Hood charity benefit as his The Street.com stock price collapsed. I would never put any value on his recommendations</em>,” another said.</p>



<p>Since 2020 the Mad Money host had been a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-cnbcs-jim-cramer-changed-his-mind-on-outlaw-currency-bitcoin/">strong advocate for Bitcoin</a> and Ether before he sold his stash in mid-2021, citing ransomware and china’s bitcoin crackdown concerns. Last week, he advised investors to drop crypto from their balance sheet, stating that <em>“it&#8217;s not too late to get out of ANYTHING created or related to crypto”.</em></p>

<p>US Bank, Goldman Sachs, has announced plans to lay off 3,200 workers, starting this week. Falling 2% short of its intended cut-back, close to 629 workers will heave a sigh of relief as they continue to keep their jobs alongside the rest 45,300 workers who make up the bank’s total workforce. The bank, disclosed the decision on Tuesday, adding that such measures are crucial in the face of unfavourable market conditions.</p>



<p>The crypto-friendly bank had, in September, pushed the pedal on a large swathe of corporate lay-offs, labelling it an annual routine pruning of selected underperformers, even as a large majority of Wall Street big players like Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and Citigroup continued to grow leaner to survive.</p>



<p>With over $900 billion in valuation and close to $29 in profits last year, investors remained confident, CEO David Solomon, had had enough stashed for prolonged downturns. Much of its public confidence stemmed from the bank’s decision to roll out a $10 million bail-out fund for trustworthy crypto firms affected by the fallout of FTX.</p>



<p>Solomon strongly believes that though the market may currently be embattled, the fundamental technology–blockchain–is largely unscathed.</p>



<p>In the past few months, Goldman Sachs has stood out remarkably as one of the few mainstream traditional financial institutions with both feet adventurously planted in crypto. Over the last five years, it has invested in over 11 digital asset startups, even pouring close to $410 million into a Euro-based blockchain digital bond with the European Investment Bank (EIB), alongside Santander and Societal Generale.</p>



<p>This time, the 2022 Global Finance Best Investment Bank is throttling up the path of crypto with the launch of a Digital Asset Platform (GS DAP). The platform, which has been built to facilitate the exchange and transaction of digital bonds such as the one issued last year with the EIB, runs on Canton, a private blockchain compliant with the defence against money laundering (DAML) code of operation.</p>



<p><em>“Our goal from the outset has been to help our clients realize the benefits of end-to-end digital lifecycle processing across tokenized assets, digital currencies, and other financial instruments,” said Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs. “We are pleased to bring this DAML-based solution to market and continue to find efficiencies that will improve the velocity of transactions.”</em></p>



<p>Goldman Sach is up 0.65% today with an NYSE share price of $359.76 as of the time of reporting.</p>

<p>A new wallet address fraud that targets careless copy pasters is becoming rampant, according to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/paypal-teams-up-with-metamask-to-enable-ethereum-purchases-in-the-us/">MetaMask</a>. In a series of tweets yesterday, the MetaMask team took steps to warn unsuspecting users of a growing type of scam called “address poisoning.”</p>



<p>Scammers extract the first and last four alpha-numerical combinations in a wallet address and use them to create a fake new address. A $0 transaction is then sent from the newly created fake address to replace the matching stored address in your transaction history. Address poisoning targets crypto users who blindly copy and paste addresses in their transaction history without a much-needed extra cross-check.</p>



<p>The security update, however, was greeted with displeasure from a section of the crypto community who believe the world’s largest crypto wallet provider may have acted too slowly to bring it to public notice. A Twitter user Tuzun (0xTuzun), who had posted a public warning of the incident as far back as December 2nd, 2022, gave further insight into the nature of the attack and the scope of wallets affected.</p>



<p>According to Tuzun, over 340,000 addresses have been poisoned since December 2022, fleecing nearly 95 wallets of unsuspecting victims of approximately $1.6 million. The analysis puts the total cost of the attacks at a little over $25,000, signalling a profit margin above 6,000%.</p>



<p>Exploitation on BSC and ETH addresses date back to the 22nd and 27th of November 2022, respectively, with a broad range of attackers emanating from regions of the Asian time zone, according to Tuzun’s findings.</p>



<p>Tuzun had used the on-chain monitoring platform, Xplore, to track down some suspected culprits, further recommending that MetaMask upgrade its UI features to make users identify wallet addresses in transaction history by colour markers. Users were also advised to double-check the alpha-numerical composition on wallet addresses beyond the first four digits before transferring funds.</p>



<p>The poison address scam adds to the list of growing scams in the crypto industry that resulted in a collective loss of over $3.5 billion last year.</p>



<p>Last May, MetaMask signed a partnership with Asset Reality–a Saas tool for crypto asset recovery–aimed at helping victims of crypto scams recover their stolen assets. Eight months later, it is unclear how much asset recovery progress both companies have made. MetaMask is yet to respond to the affected users and any feasible compensation plans for losses incurred.<br></p>

<p>Ava Labs, the Web3 organization overseeing the development and promotion of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-pundit-explains-why-avalanche-avax-is-positioned-to-grow-exponentially/">Avalanche (AVAX)</a> blockchain, has scored a long-term partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to scale blockchain adoption across governments and enterprises.</p>



<p>According to a Wednesday announcement, the partnership aims at helping individuals and developers to launch and manage nodes on Avalanche, strengthening the network’s functionalities and flexibility.</p>



<p>Avalanche’s infrastructure and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem are also expected to receive a major boost alongside one-click node deployments. The partnership will also see Ava Labs join AWS Activate, a program under the web services platform that helps early-stage startups and programs to get started on its platform. Ava Labs will also become a member of the AWS Partner Network (APN), giving the firm access to AWS&#8217;s large pool of partners around the globe.</p>



<p>In a thread of tweets following the announcement, Emin Gün Sirer, Founder and CEO of Ava Labs, described the partnership as “a big deal”, noting that they were not required to pay a dime, unlike other chains.</p>



<p><em>“AWS recognizes how blockchains are evolving, with subnets serving as appchains, and wants to be one of the hosting providers for the many subnets that people are about to launch.” </em>He said.</p>



<p><em>“To this end, they will be contributing substantial amounts of AWS credits to projects looking to deploy subnets on Avalanche. They, along with AliBaba, understand where the blockchain tech is going and they want to partner with the one chain that is delivering the vision.”</em></p>



<p>His counterpart, Howard Wright, VP and global head of startups at AWS, said in a separate statement;</p>



<p><em>“When you multiply Activate times Avalanche times Subnet, you have something that’s a seminal moment. I think blockchain [technology] will become commonplace and used in our marketplace by developers”</em> </p>



<p>Avalanche now becomes the latest network to join the AWS platform, which already hosts over 70 blockchain protocols, including Hyperledger, Corda, DAML, Ethereum, Quorum, Blockstack, Blockapps Strato and RSK, among others. Last month, the proof of stake network <a href="https://zycrypto.com/avax-receives-major-boost-as-alibaba-cloud-expands-support-for-avalanche/">joined Alibaba cloud</a>, bagging rights to enjoy the platform’s line of cloud infrastructure technology and developer tools.</p>



<p>That said, AVAX, the native cryptocurrency for Avalanche, has received a major boost from the news, surging by over 23% in the past 24 hours. Its volume also exploded by over 440% as investors splurged on the token, expecting to catch the post-announcement rally. At press time, AVAX was trading at $15.13, according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p>Binance maintained hockey-like growth since 2021 despite the crypto market downturn, according to on-chain data provider Cryptoquant. Sharing its findings on Tuesday, Jan 10, the firm noted that the exchange’s annual revenue topped around $12 billion in 2022, growing ten times over the past two years.</p>



<p>Binance’s revenue growth comes amid a daunting crypto winter that has sent crypto prices to record lows. Since Bitcoin topped $68,000 in November 2021, the global crypto market capitalization has folded by over half, putting various crypto exchanges under immense pressure to reduce spending through <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-continues-staff-layoffs-citing-ongoing-market-conditions/">job cuts</a>.</p>



<p>And although Binance continued to maintain that it was business as usual, the exchange’s trading volumes also started to fall towards the end of 2022, tapping a two-month low of $9.39 billion on Dec 23 and lowering its estimated quarterly revenue.</p>



<p>According to a December report by Glassnode, Binance experienced an outflow of 90,000 Bitcoin in a week. On Jan 9, Forbes reported that the exchange saw $12 billion worth of crypto assets withdrawn in the past two months, citing a report availed to it by a reliable source. </p>



<h2 id="h-binance-outdoes-crypto-winter"><strong>Binance Outdoes Crypto Winter</strong></h2>



<p>Binance has had a robust company culture which explains its growth against the odds. Aside from becoming the first exchange to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binance-publishes-proof-of-reserves-system-for-btc-more-assets-to-follow/">provide proof-of-reserves</a> following the FTX debacle, Binance focused on building new products and trading functionalities to attract more users. </p>



<p>The exchange has also ramped up efforts to become regularly compliant across various jurisdictions. As of Dec 31, 2022, Binance had secured registrations and Licences in 14 jurisdictions globally. It also reinforced its commitment to fight against bad actors in the space, increasing its security and compliance headcount by over 500%.</p>



<p>In January last year, the exchange became the first crypto exchange to join the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance (NCFTA). Earlier this month, it joined the Association of Certified Sanctions Specialists (ACSS) as it seeks to strengthen its sanctions compliance procedures.</p>



<p>Binance has also received <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/markets/a-long-history-of-doing-right-by-the-customer-market-research-firms-weigh-in-on-binances-solvency-and-market-standing-8979050151649648422">positive rankings</a> by leading crypto analytics firms, further strengthening its public image. Last month, Cryptoquant verified the exchange&#8217;s proof of reserves, concluding that the structure of its holdings was robust, with no signs of dangerous “FTX-like” behaviour.</p>



<p>Further, Norway-based, digital asset-native research firm Arcane research noted, “in terms of trading activity, Binance is the crypto market,” in its year-in-review report, attributing the exchange’s strong growth to user-friendly policies such as lifting trading fees for BTC spot pairs and sound employment policies.</p>



<p>In his end-of-2022 report, Changpeng Zhao “CZ” insisted that the exchange would continue building, putting users first, and “leading by our own example”. According to him, “the next bull market will come from innovation in the ways these products are used to create unique utility.”</p>

<p>The crypto community has had to bear one of the coldest crypto winters in the sector’s history this past year. However, nothing has been as chilling to them as the unexplained deaths of some wealthy crypto holders.</p>



<p>Interestingly, the death of 4 crypto billionaires towards the end of 2022, all in less than a month, has left the crypto community scratching their heads and sparked fierce rumours of crypto-related conspiracies.</p>



<p>On October 29, young crypto pioneer Nikolai Mushegian was found dead on a Puerto Rican beach just hours after tweeting that intelligence agencies CIA and Mossad were after him. However, his family noted that the 29-year-old had been battling mental health issues and that there was no foul play.</p>



<p>Then on November 22, Javier Biosca, the man at the centre of Spain’s biggest probe into cryptocurrency fraud, was found dead in Estepona. Biosca, who until his death had been staying with his wife and son at a retreat in the Costa del Sol town, is said to have fallen to his death after he went out onto the terrace.</p>



<p>The next day, Nov 23, Tiantian Kullander, founder of Hong Kong-based crypto company Amber Group died mysteriously in his sleep aged 30. Although no previous dark dealings could be traced to the tech guru, crypto pages and pop-up sites were inundated with questions around the sudden death, with the most searched topics being “what disease did Tiantian have?” and “Tiantian cause of death”.</p>



<p>Two days later, on November 25, Russian crypto billionaire and Libertex crypto exchange head Vyacheslav Taran died in a helicopter crash. While the cause of death was not ruled out, Ukrainian authorities linked the mysterious crash to Kremlin’s foreign intelligence, claiming that Taran was responsible for laundering cash from Russia via crypto operations. On the other hand, Russian media reported that an identified VIP who was expected to join Taran cancelled his flight at the last minute.</p>



<p>The four deaths have sparked a fierce debate within crypto-twitter, with some convinced that a triangle of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-do-kwon-apologizes-to-luna-victims-insists-he-is-not-on-the-run/">disgruntled customers</a> who lost their funds “unfairly” using the deceased’s firms was out to get revenge.</p>



<p>“<em>That&#8217;s what happens when you steal from someone that can&#8217;t forget,”</em> one user wrote.</p>



<p>Another user linked the death spiral with the “central banking hierarchy, sarcastically writing, “<em>I would definitely not put money on it being connected to the central banking hierarchy. There is no way. They are very trustworthy. 100% no chance.”</em></p>



<p>On Reddit, some users were convinced that some of those deaths <a href="https://zycrypto.com/eccentric-crypto-rebel-john-mcafee-faked-his-death-ex-lover-shockingly-reveals/">were faked</a> to enable the crypto heads to start over a fresh life. </p>



<p><em>“I wonder how many of these are people faking their own deaths,”</em> one user asked.</p>

<p>Binance has been granted registration to operate in Sweden, expanding its foothold in Europe.</p>



<p><em>“Binance is pleased to announce that Binance Nordics AB has been granted registration as a financial institution for management and trading in virtual currency by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Swedish FSA),”</em> the exchange announced today.  </p>



<p>The exchange noted that the greenlight came after a month of constructive engagement between Swedish regulators and Binance Nordics AB. This means that going forwards, Swedish nationals will have access to all of Binance&#8217;s crypto products and services, including crypto buy/sell through Euros, Binance Visa Card, Binance NFT, auto invest and custody, among others.</p>



<p>Sweden now becomes the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/france-plans-to-become-the-european-hub-of-the-crypto-ecosystem-but-theres-a-catch/">seventh EU member state</a> to grant Binance an operating license after France, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Lithuania, and Poland issued it with similar authorizations within the past two years. Furthermore, following today’s announcement, Binance now boasts 15 operating licenses and registrations globally.</p>



<p>Commenting on the new milestone, Richard Teng, head of Europe and MENA at Binance, wrote;</p>



<p><em>“Binance continues to demonstrate its commitment to work closely with regulatory agencies to uphold global standards. Our registration in Sweden is the result of many months of diligent, hard work from our team, underpinning our commitment to the Swedish market and our users. We are deeply grateful for the support from the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority throughout the application process and for the approval.”</em></p>



<p>On a separate note, Roy van Krimpen, Nordics and Benelux Lead, stated that Binance Nordics AB had “adopted risk and AML policies to match EU laws and local laws by Sweden. “<em>Our next big task will be the successful migration and launch of local operations, including hiring of local talent, organizing more events and delivering more crypto education in Sweden,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>Binance expansion into Europe has been a big win for the world’s largest crypto exchange by traded volume, especially considering the headwinds it faced, particularly after the Terra Luna crash. In June 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a circular stating that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/uk-financial-watchdog-clamps-down-on-worlds-largest-crypto-exchange-binance/">Binance was unregulated</a>, hence could not conduct any activities in the country.</p>



<p>In July 2021, the crypto exchange was forced to temporarily halt payments from the European Union’s Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) as well as U.K.’s Faster Payments network citing events beyond its control. Earlier in the same month, Barclays said that it was blocking deposits to the exchange, although withdrawals were allowed. </p>



<p>Yet, despite the cold reception, Binance has continued to push into the EU region, with Martin Bruncko, Binance’s Executive Vice President for Europe, <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/06/22/binance-is-in-it-for-the-long-game-when-it-comes-to-europe-and-doesnt-fear-the-crypto-cras">noting</a> that they are “in it for the long term” when it comes to Europe.</p>

<ul>
<li>New court filing reveals troubled FTX splurged $40 million on luxury meals and flights before its collapse.</li>



<li>A large chunk of the sum was spent on hotels, with one raking in $5.8 million within a nine-month period.</li>



<li>FTX’s bankruptcy filing has opened up a can of worms from which industry members are still reeling.</li>
</ul>



<p>A deep dive into FTX’s expenses nine months preceding the exchange’s collapse reveals a wild pattern of frivolous expenses that disappointed creditors.</p>



<p>As the bankruptcy proceedings against FTX drags on, a new filing has unmasked the nature of spending embarked upon by the exchange. The filings show that the embattled exchange blew over $40 million between January and September 2020 before succumbing to liquidity issues.</p>



<p>The filing disclosed that the company spent 5.8 million dollars at the luxury Albany Hotel in the Bahamas while 3.6 million and $800,000 were spent at the Grand Hyatt and Rosewood resort respectively. In total, FTX high-level employees spent nearly $15 million on accommodation in five-star hotels around the world.</p>



<p>Meals were a major expenditure for FTX in the nine-month period under review, with the filing showing that over $3 million were paid to catering services. Other forms of entertainment caused FTX a small fortune, while a staggering $4 million was spent on flights.</p>



<p>Another source of spending for the company was donations to local charities in the Bahamas. It is unclear how much the company donated to local aid groups in the small island nation, but pundits believe the bulk of donations will be returned as the Bahamian government tries to absolve itself of any <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-accepts-extradition-to-the-us-after-deadlock/">wrongdoing</a>.</p>



<p>The Financial Times reports that the Sam Bankman-Fried company struck a deal with an airline to deliver employees’ Amazon purchases to the Bahamas in record time.</p>



<p>Former employees have described FTX’s profligate spending as “<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ftxs-sbf-bags-250-million-bail-could-face-up-to-100-years-in-jail-as-close-associates-plead-guilty/">cult-like</a>” and “moronically inefficient”.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-large-can-of-worms"><strong>A large can of worms</strong></h2>



<p>Caroline Ellison, a former top-level executive at Alameda Research, told the court that she collaborated with Bankman-Fried to “conceal” the extent of the firm&#8217;s loans and borrowing to investors. Ellison confirmed in her plea hearing Bankman-Fried and other top executives received loans running into billions of dollars.</p>



<p>FTX co-founder Gary Wang pled guilty to charges, saying that he was part of a plot to give Alameda Research “special privileges” by tweaking FTX’s code without disclosing the move to investors of the exchange.</p>

<p>Cardano (ADA), the 8th most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, experienced a colossal price spike in the first week of January 2023. The move is auspicious for ADA, especially as many altcoins are still nursing losses carried over from 2022.</p>



<h2 id="h-ada-whale-addresses-are-to-be-credited-mostly-for-the-price-swing"><strong>ADA whale addresses are to be credited mostly for the price swing</strong></h2>



<p>The price upswing is linked to a notable force in the market: <a href="https://zycrypto.com/even-as-whales-offload-ada-cardano-could-see-huge-price-boost-if-this-happens/">ADA whales</a>. Popular cryptocurrency market intelligence platform Santiment reported that barbel backtracks from sellers had been spotted.</p>



<p>It appears that ADA holders had dumped over half a million worth of ADA tokens within November and December of 2022, only to return to holding a notable size of the dumped coins.</p>



<p><em>“Cardano is enjoying a mini-surge at this hour, and addresses holding between 1M to 100M $ADA may be a main validator to watch for a price breakout. After dumping 568.4M coins the final 2 months of 2022, they have added back 217.2M $ADA to start 2023.” Santiment noted in a recent tweet.</em></p>



<p>While there’s no known factor fueling this backpedalling, investor behaviour, as highlighted by a previous report from Santiment, gives insight into what might be happening.</p>



<p>Apparently, investors holding between 10,000 and 1,000,000 ADA&nbsp; were imitating behaviours exhibited by investors during the 2019 bear market by accumulating assets.</p>



<p>This pattern took a pause within the last periods of 2021 when ADA’s price tapped $1.3 and turned into “net sellers” of ADA, up until ADA’s price was at $0.33 and dipped even lower within the last two months of 2022.</p>



<p>Santiment explains why investors might have taken the route they took and hints at the possibility of their return to the market by accumulation, a pattern which now seems to be unfolding.</p>



<p><em>“This suggests that these investors may be cautious about the potential of ADA and have been selling off their holdings. It will be interesting to see if these investors decide to start accumulating aggressively again in the future.” Santiment explained.</em></p>



<p>It is worth noting that many market players have collectively predicted that the cryptocurrency market is likely to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/global-recession-will-push-bitcoin-price-to-remarkable-highs-in-2023-bloomberg-analysts/">record an upsurge</a> in adoption. This is due to the expected economic recession that the United States is expected to experience this year.</p>



<p>As such, market players might be increasing their holdings in assets like ADA to hedge against inflation. However, whether that is the sieving factor behind ADA’s current accumulation by whales is not certain.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, at the time of this report, ADA is trading at $0.32. ADA’s performance in 2023 at this time is quite impressive. The asset is up over 29% within the last seven days and has recorded a favourable price increase every day since the 29th of December last year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto payments platform Wyre sets a new withdrawal policy allowing users to withdraw only 90% of their assets.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The policy will include limits to specific assets, including a daily cap of 5 BTC, 50 ETH, and 20,000 USDC withdrawals. </li>



<li>Amidst growing concerns of bankruptcy, Wyre management expresses commitment to weather the storm.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The crypto winter has stretched longer than predicted by many experts and has made several web3 firms think outside the box to stay afloat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Digital asset payment platform Wyre has announced a new withdrawal policy in the wake of bankruptcy concerns hovering around the company. The new policy will allow users to withdraw up to 90% of their funds subject to their present daily limits. </p>



<p>The Francisco-based firm has <a href="https://twitter.com/sendwyre/status/1611774171050299392?s=21&amp;t=rGuB5tnGZGjAQr2ypXQlKQ">stated</a> that it is exploring strategic options to navigate the present bear market and it is in the <em>“best interest of the community.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>“We are modifying our withdrawal policy. While customers will continue to be able to withdraw their funds, at this time, we are limiting withdrawals to no more than 90% of the funds currently in each customer account, subject to current daily limits,” </em>the company shared via Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new policy also restricts daily withdrawals of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and fiat.  According to their website, there will be a limit of up to 5 BTC, 50 ETH, and 20,000 in DAI and USDC, while daily fiat withdrawals will be $150,000 and £140,000. </p>



<p>The company restated its commitment to simplify and expand global digital asset payments, adding that it will continue to “<em>explore strategic options” </em>to survive current market conditions. The announcement of withdrawal limits sparked panic within crypto spaces however some believe that the firm will weather the storm. </p>



<h2 id="h-wyre-s-issues-run-deep">Wyre’s issues run deep&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new company withdrawal policy comes amidst bankruptcy rumours and other operational issues. Last week, MetaMask made a shocking <a href="https://twitter.com/metamask/status/1611112520944701440?s=21&amp;t=SIG4AZVVwYwe3wFZdwbiEg">announcement</a> removing Wyre from its mobile aggregate which allows users to buy virtual assets via its extension. </p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s bankruptcy travails came to the fore last month by allegations by two former employees. The company denied the allegation stating that it will “<em>scale back” </em>to plan new strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyre has also carried out a management shakeup with Stephen Cheng elevated to the CEO whilst assuring that the company’s operations will continue and the community will be updated with new developments.</p>

<p>Coinbase announced Tuesday that it plans to lay off 950 staff members, about 20% of its workforce, to reduce costs &#8211; according to an internal memo. The exchange is blaming the current market conditions for its continued personnel reduction.</p>



<p>In June last year, Coinbase announced another layoff of a fifth of its employees. Besides, its CEO Brian Armstrong is attributing the move to the macroeconomic factors that played a role in last year’s market downturn.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>In 2022, the crypto market trended downwards along with the broader macroeconomy. We also saw the fallout from unscrupulous actors in the industry (referring to the collapse of the crypto derivatives exchange FTX). There could still be further contagion</em>,’’ Armstrong said in a coverage by CNBC.</p>



<h2 id="h-coinbase-joins-amazon-meta-and-salesforce-in-layoff-trends"><strong>Coinbase Joins Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce in Layoff Trends</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase is not the only company cutting headcount amid the bear run. Amazon, Meta, and Salesforce have equally downsized, saying they hired more staff during the heightened activity before the pandemic. Coinbase announced that the layoff could reduce up to a quarter of its overhead costs, with the overall cost averaging $170 million, including sendoff packages for the retrenched personnel.</p>



<p>The exchange, publicly listed on Nasdaq under ticker COIN, added that it expected to adjust EBITDA losses for the year to within the $500 million benchmark set in 2021.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s announcement comes as the industry continues to battle the contagion around the collapse of FTX and the bankruptcies filed by notable industry players, including BlockFi and crypto miner Core Scientific. According to Armstrong, the exchange is also planning to close down projects with a lower probability of success. The executive is less optimistic about the future but believes tightening regulations could sanitize the space.</p>



<p>‘‘<em>The FTX collapse and the resulting contagion has created a black eye for the industry</em>,’’ he said. ‘‘<em>We may not have seen the last of it – there will be increased scrutiny on various companies in the space to ensure that they follow the rules. Long term, that is a good thing, But short term, there is still a lot of market fear,</em>’’ Brian commented.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently showing a slight recovery following a market plunge last year. Bitcoin is up 4% in the past week, while Ethereum has gained more than 10% in the same period.</p>
