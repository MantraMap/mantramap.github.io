Authorities have already implied a 30% tax on the capital gains earned from crypto trading in India. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/reserve-bank-of-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indian Central Bank</a> governor has issued a warning regarding the next financial crisis.</p>
<h2>RBI Chief warns of a financial crisis</h2>
<p>In the<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pDiWyN0IWQ&amp;ab_channel=ReserveBankofIndia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> BFSI insight Summit</a>, Shaktikanta Das, RBI Governor talked about the recent collapse and developments in the crypto industry. However, he warned of the next possible financial crisis and mentioned that it will come from private digital assets.</p>
<p>Das further asserted that he still holds the same view regarding that digital assets and wants them to be prohibited. Meanwhile, he also added that the crypto has no underlying value. Private Digital assets are major risks for macroeconomic and Financial Stability.</p>
<p>RBI Chief mentioned the recent decline in the crypto market highlighting the major <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.binance.com/es/feed/post/126268" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">FTX collapse</a>.

However, Das stated that a change in the value of any product is a function of the market.</p>
<h2>Crypto origin is to bypass system</h2>
<p>He stated that the origin of cryptocurrency is to bypass and break the system. Meanwhile, Das argued that he is yet to hear any credible argument of what public good crypto serves.</p>

Since Solana Foundation had close relationships with FTX and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sbf/">SBF</a>&#8216;s other companies, it took the fall for the crisis.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Solana prices slumped to a record low of $13 (on November 11), days after the news of the FTX liquidity crisis crippled the market. Since then, SOL has struggled to recover.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">The price of Solana hit an all-time high of $260.06 during the bull run of 2021 (on Nov. 6). SOL prices have been declining ever since and are currently trading at $12.08.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132433" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21124626/SOLANA.jpg" alt="Solana" width="926" height="642" /></p>
<h4 style="color: #252525">SOL&#8217;s Future Prospects</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">According to several cryptocurrency analysts, it could be challenging for SOL to return to its all-time high ($260) because Solana&#8217;s fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $100 billion was never justified.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/solana/">cryptopredictions.com</a>, SOL can breach the $40 barrier by 2026.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Given that the value proposition offered by the Solana ecosystem remains more or less the same (despite market sentiments not being in favour of Solana, which is one of the main reasons behind its price crash), it is very likely that SOL will touch the $100 mark in the next bull run.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Since SOL is in a dip, if you can hold it for the long term, that is, until the next bull run hits and market sentiments are in favour of Solana, you can make decent money from this investment.</p>

<h4 style="color: #252525">How Much Money You Would Make if Solana (SOL) Reaches $100?</h4>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s say you invest a modest $100 in SOL tokens today. This will get you 8.28 SOL tokens at the current price of $12.08. In the event that SOL hits $100, your $100 investment will become worth $828, giving you an 8x  or 728% return on investment.</p>
<p style="color: #252525">Let&#8217;s assume that you buy $1000 worth of SOL tokens today. At the current rate, you will have approximately 82.78 tokens. Your $1000 investment will be worth $8278 if liquidated at the price of $100. If SOL hits the $100 mark in the next 3 years, you will get an annualised ROI of 102% on your investment.</p>
<p>It is important for anyone considering investing in Solana or any other cryptocurrency to carefully research the asset and understand the risks involved before making any investment decisions.</p>

The original work is worth more than the postcard you purchased from the museum, much like the priceless nature of Matisse or Van Gogh, and the same logic applies to NFTs and their copyrights.</p>
<p>Influencers and celebrities aren&#8217;t far behind in the NFT race. The <a href="https://coingape.com/nft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT collections</a> of well-known celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, Eminem, Bella Hadid, etc. have been released for their fans. The way we think about ownership and digital marketing has changed as a result of NFTs. Unsurprisingly, the NFT industry has been growing faster than ever, and the non-fungible tokens craze hasn&#8217;t spared Indian celebrities.</p>
<h2><strong>Top 5 Bollywood celebrities who owned NFTs in 2022</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Amitabh Bachchan</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132411" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115021/Amitab-bachchan.jpg" alt="Amitab bachchan NFT" width="752" height="423" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The renowned Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan joined the NFT movement in November 2021. In addition to autographed Sholay posters and other items related to the movie, he also launched Madhushala, his father&#8217;s celebrated poetry recital. Through an <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/">NFT marketplace</a>, the collection was auctioned off for Rs. 7.18 crores.</p>
<h3><strong>Salman Khan</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132412" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115116/Salman-khan.jpeg" alt="Salman Khan NFT" width="800" height="448" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wanted actor debuted his NFT line, which was inspired by his film Dabangg. A total of 200 NFTs, 42 of which were movie scenes, were part of the NFT series he started. Salman Khan announced his NFT series on Twitter on December 25, 2021, and the collection launched on December 30, 2021. Fans could use <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">ETH</a> or MATIC tokens to purchase NFTs.</p>
<h3><strong>Rajnikant</strong></h3>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132413" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115200/Rajnikant.jpg" alt="Rajnikant NFT" width="640" height="640" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Thalaiva of the south Indian film industry, Rajinikanth, is also involved with NFTs. He launched his collection in July 2021 in collaboration with the Singapore-based non-fungible token marketplace Diginoor.io. However, his 2007 film Sivaji: The Boss was featured in his non-fungible token collection. On Diginoor.io, customers could use a debit card or a cryptocurrency of their choice to buy their favorite movie moments.</p>
<h3><strong>Sunny Leone</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132415" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21115244/Sunny-Leone.jpg" alt="Sunny Leone NFT" width="1200" height="900" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sunny Leone debuts her own non-fungible token collection, Misfitz, making her the first Indian actress to do so. Unusual patterns, boisterous characters, and an eclectic atmosphere characterized the collection. However, in November 2021, the collection, which contained about 9600 non-fungible tokens, quickly ran out of stock.</p>
<h3><strong>Manish Malhotra</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132256" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20132601/jpg_20221220_132346_0000.jpg" alt="Manish Malhotra NFT" width="1200" height="800" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manish Malhotra, a famous fashion designer in India, is the first in his profession to enter this market. He unveiled five exclusive sketches and runway GIFs of his clothing in October 2021. However, Lisa Ray, Deepika Padukone, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Alia Bhatt wore.</p>
<p>However, when the auction went live on the WazirX, it was completely sold out. The Illuminous Showstopper, a famously worn outfit by Kareena Kapoor Khan, generated the highest payment of 3,000 WRX, or roughly USD $4,000. (almost Rs 2.8 lakh).</p>

FIL tokens are used as payment for these services as well as a financial incentive to guarantee that files are consistently stored over time.</p>
<p>As a<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/"> proof-of-work</a> token, FIL allows the Filecoin community to mine and receive additional coins as payment. Additionally, FIL can be used on the Filecoin network, where users can pay miners to store or retrieve their data. In the event that there are no or insufficient proofs, the token may also be used as collateral.</p>
<h3><b>Filecoin (FIL) Price Analysis</b></h3>
<p>Filecoin’s price today is $2.93, with a market capitalization of $1B and a 24-hour trading volume down by 4.62%. Now it stands at $127 million. At the same time, the circulating supply is approximately 344,966,605 FIL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132396" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105612/FIL_1D_graph_coinmarketcap1.jpg" alt="Source: coinmarketcap" width="1161" height="500" /></p>
<h6>Source: Coinmarketcap</h6>
<p>Despite the negative market trends, the technical analysis of the Filecoin price shows a significant surge fueled by FIL growth. The Filecoin (FIL) price has increased significantly in comparison to counterparts such as Stellar and <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>.</p>

<h2><b>How Much Money Would You Make If FIL Reaches $10?</b></h2>
<p>According to <strong><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/filecoin/" rel="nofollow">Cryptopredictions.com</a></strong>, FIL can go as high as $10.9 by December 2025. Let’s assume that you invest a modest $100 in Filecoin today.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132397" style="width: 1491px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-132397" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21105732/Screenshot-2022-12-21-at-10-17-09-Filecoin-FIL-Price-Prediction-2023-2024-2026.png" alt="Filecoin Prediction chart" width="1491" height="847" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132397" class="wp-caption-text">Filecoin Prediction chart</figcaption></figure>
<p>According to today’s price, which is $2.92, you will have approximately 34.26 FIL. If Filecoin’s price hits $10 in the next few years, your $100 will become approximately $342.6. Let’s say you bought $100 worth of FIL coins today. With the current rate, you will have approximately 34.26 coins. However, you can potentially make $342 when it reaches the $100 mark.</p>

It is one of the largest publicly listed crypto mining companies in the U.S. Core Scientific has decided to file for bankruptcy due to falling crypto prices and rising energy prices that deteriorated its finances.</p>
<p>Despite the $72 million in financing from its lender B. Riley last week to avoid bankruptcy, the crypto miner was unable to work efficiently and will work on restructuring, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KenzieSigalos/status/1605420482005704705" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a> CNBC. Core Scientific plans to keep mining until it restructures its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Core Scientific’s market cap dropped to $78 million on Tuesday, down from a $4.3 billion valuation in July 2021 when it went public. The CORZ stock price has fallen more than 98% in the last year. On Tuesday, the stock price ended at $0.21, up 3.07%.</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the company’s situation, the company is still generating positive cash flow. However, cash is insufficient to repay the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financing debt owed on mining equipment</a> it was leasing. Core Scientific will not liquidate and operate normally until reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, which hold the majority of the company’s debt.</p>
<h2>Crypto Twitter Reactions To Core Scientific Bankruptcy</h2>
<p>Crypto influencers took to Twitter to report Core Scientific&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. Many crypto miners are facing financial constraints amid the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a>.</p>
<p>Crypto researcher Dylan Leclair reported that the firm owns approximately 5% of the global hash rate. He also shared the situation of listed crypto miners with many having stock prices down over 90% in 2022.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132410" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132410" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21114843/Crypto-Miners-Performance.jpg" alt="Crypto Miners Performance" width="710" height="378" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132410" class="wp-caption-text">Crypto Miners Performance</figcaption></figure>
<p>Crypto investor and board member at Iris Energy Mike Alfred said Core Scientific had told him that the company would have 13 EH by July of this year when he first looked at the company in the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Many people showed concerns over the future of bitcoin mining as several crypto miners such as Argo Blockchain and Iris Energy are facing bankruptcy risks.</p>

<p>Core Scientific joins the list of other crypto miners who have succumbed to the crash in the crypto space and the soaring energy prices. A month ago, the Bitcoin miner had already hinted about <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-bitcoin-mining-giant-core-scientific-could-file-for-bankruptcy-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extreme pain in its operations</a> and cash crunch owing to the market conditions.</p>
<p>Core Scientific was mining some proof-of-work digital assets such as Bitcoin. As we know, this requires high-end machinery and hardware while also consuming massive electricity in the process. Over the last year, the price of Core Scientific (NASDAQ: CORZ) stock has tanked by 99% losing more than $4 billion in valuations.</p>
<p>Last year in July 2021, the Bitcoin miner had gone for a public listing via a special purpose acquisition vehicle or SPAC. Although the company still generates a positive cash flow, it&#8217;s not enough to repay the financial debt on equipment, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/bitcoin-miner-core-scientific-filing-for-bankruptcy-will-keep-mining.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said sources</a> familiar with the matter.</p>
<h3>Core Scientific&#8217;s Further Action Plan</h3>
<p>The sources also added that core Scientific is not willing to liquidate, however, it would continue to operate normally while reaching a deal with senior security noteholders, who hold a majority of the company&#8217;s debt.</p>
<p>In their filing earlier in October, Core Scientific said that holders of their common stock might suffer a total loss on their investment. However, the Bitcoin miner&#8217;s deal with its convertible note holders is such that if the market conditions for Bitcoin improve, common equity holders might not get totally wiped out.</p>
<p>Core Scientific has operations currently in North Dakota, North Carolina, Georgia, and Kentucky. It is also one of the largest providers of blockchain infrastructure and hosting.</p>
<p>Core Scientific is not the only Bitcoin miner to face bankruptcy. Compute North, the hosting infrastructure for crypto mining also filed for bankruptcy in September.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried has finally decided to drop his fight against extradition to the United States.

As per the latest report from ABC News, SBF who&#8217;s currently in the Fox Hill jail of The Bahamas has agreed to his extradition to the US on multiple charges.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that SBF has signed his extradition paper and a hearing for the same will happen on Wednesday in Nassau. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-12-21/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-signs-extradition-papers/101796332" target="_blank" rel="noopener">development</a> has been confirmed by Bahamas Acting Commissioner of Corrections Doan Cleare.</p>
<p>After signing his surrender documents on Tuesday, the Bahamas Commissioner said that SBF will sign a separate set of papers and finalize his waiver of rights to fight extradition.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Federal authorities are looking to fly back SBF to the U.S. soon after Wednesday&#8217;s hearing. The Bloomberg <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sam-bankman-fried-to-fly-to-us-wednesday-escorted-by-fbi-agents-1.1861932" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes that the disgraced FTX founder will be accompanied to the US by FBI agents in a non-commercial aircraft. Another source familiar with the matter said that the plane will leave from a private airport in The Bahamas.</p>
<h3>Not A Good Christmas for SBF</h3>
<p>Sam Bankman Fried has been facing severe charges over the misuse of customers&#8217; funds at FTX which led to a dramatic collapse of a $32 billion company. Some previous <a href="https://coingape.com/how-much-jail-time-sbf-is-looking-at-if-convicted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> suggest that SBF might face 115 years of prison which is equivalent to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>After getting earlier this month, the Bahamian court also denied bail to SBF last week. Since then, he&#8217;s been placed in one of the most notorious jail facilities of the island nation i.e. Fox Hill.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Bahamian authorities will escort Sam Bankman-Fried from the prison to the court. Although initially hesitant, SBF has agreed to the extradition to the U.S. This change in attitude might be partly due to the expectation that SBF could get bail in the US. So far, it isn&#8217;t clear where SBF is planning to land on Wednesday.</p>

This facility is now available to 160 countries across the world.</p>
<p>Currently, Uniswap supports Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. It means over the DEX, users can purchase their respective cryptocurrencies such as DAI, ETH, MATIC, USDC, USDT, WBTC and WETH.</p>
<p>Amid the recent collapse of crypto exchange FTX, trust from <a href="https://coingape.com/uniswap-unveils-new-feature-to-rival-crypto-exchanges/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centralized exchanges</a> has dropped as many investors are moving their crypto into self-custody. As a result, the demand and trading volumes on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have also shot up.</p>
<p>DEX&#8217;s offers greater user protection since they have self-custodial wallets, and are permissionless and immutable protocols. But when compared to centralized exchanges, DEXs don&#8217;t offer a very sound onboarding experience. With the latest move, the Uniswap DEX is planning to solve this exactly.</p>
<h3>Uniswap Partners With MoonPay</h3>
<p>In partnership with MoonPay, Uniswap will now allow users to transact in DeFi via the Uniswap Web App and buy crypto using any card and bank transfers. Users just need to connect their wallet to the Uniswap Web app and can buy crypto instantly. The DEX platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://uniswap.org/blog/web-fiat-on-ramp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing you the best fiat on-ramp experience &#8211; no spread fees on USDC, the lowest processing fees in the market, and instant access!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Uniswap has also made it clear that they would not collect any financial information of their users such as credit card, debit card, and bank information. Besides, they also don&#8217;t collect any personally identifiable information for their users. Uniswap has also placed minimum and maximum caps for the purchase of different crypto and stablecoins.</p>
<p>After the purchase, users can see their digital assets in their wallets within minutes. So far, the off-ramp facility of moving crypto to a bank account isn&#8217;t available. But the DEX added that they are working on it.</p>
<p>Also, users cannot purchase NFTs directly using cards or bank accounts. They first need to purchase ETH and buy NFTs through it.</p>

Earlier, reports suggested that the billionaire was already in the hunt for his replacement. It may be recalled that Musk had fired former CEO Parag Aggarwal among others as his first official act since taking over as the company head. It remains to be seen how his favorite cryptocurrency <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> will perform if someone replaces Musk.</p>

<h2>Software And Servers</h2>
<p>In a reaction to the Twitter poll on his leadership, Musk said he will still have some oversight on the company even if someone takes charge as new CEO. In line with his aggressive approach in leading the social media company, Musk said he would like to lead the software and servers teams. This is regardless of if he continues to be the CEO or not. Also, it will be interesting to see how soon would Musk be able to find his replacement. It may be recalled that he said his role as Twitter CEO would be temporary.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I will resign as CEO as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job! After that, I will just run the software &amp; servers teams.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

Thus, losing the $12.75 support may intensify the ongoing selling pressure and push the prices back to the last swing low of $11.35. But will this support replenish the bullish momentum or encourage prolonged downfall?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $12.75 breakdown sets Solana coin price for a 7.5% downfall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evident bullish divergence in the daily-RSI slope indicates a potential bullish reversal from $11.35</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $192 Million, indicating a 0.3% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/d/DaNmqCfB.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For nearly a month, the Solana price wobbled in a fixed range from $15 to $12.75. This long consolidation was supposed to bolster the coin price for higher recovery once it breached the overhead resistance of $15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and hearsay for US Fed to tighten interest rate hikes caused significant outflow in Solana coin. As a result, the coin price ended the range setup in the seller&#8217;s favor with a breakdown of $12.75 support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 16th, the Solana price breached the $12.75 support with increasing volume, indicating the sellers are aiming to visit lower levels. However, with the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market, this altcoin is stuck in a retest phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the SOL price trades at $12.25 with an intraday gain of 2.35% Furthermore, the higher price rejection candle attached to this daily candle indicates the intense selling pressure from above.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this selling pressure persists, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> should eventually drop 7.5% lower to pierce the $11.35 support. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the recent selling pressure was solely due to panic selling in the market, the Solana price should rebound from the $11.35 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> Despite the sideways price action, the higher high movement in the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> indicates growth in underlying bullishness and a higher possibility for price reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the large gap between the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) indicates the overall trend is bearish.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $12.7 and $15</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $11.35 and $10</span></li>

The genesis blockchain was then split in two, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, similar to how <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> split into Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash back in 2017.</p>
<h2>What Sets ETC Apart</h2>
<p>Ethereum Classic describes itself as an open-source, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract functionality.</p>
<p>The fundamental functioning of Ethereum (ETH) and <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://br.coingape.com/tag/ethereum-classic/">Ethereum Classic (ETC)</a> is quite similar. On Ethereum Classic, the majority of Ethereum&#8217;s key functionalities are also available. However, there are a few significant distinctions between the two. The most crucial being the fact that, upgrades to the Ethereum <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a> are predominantly incompatible with Ethereum Classic.</p>

<p>This became particularly notable in September 2022, when<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/ethereum-merge/"> The Merge</a> took place, where the Ethereum blockchain finished transitioning to a proof-of-stake consensus method. As, Ethereum Classic still remained a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/">proof-of-work chain</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of last year, when the bull run was ready to commence, the token took off and rallied along with other major cryptocurrencies. And, despite having reached record highs, ETC&#8217;s price recently had a significant fall as a result of recent pullbacks and ongoing turmoil in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a>.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Classic (ETC) Price Prediction For Long Term</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of ETC is $15.77, up by 1% over the previous day, according to the market monitoring portal <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>. The price of the cryptocurrency was almost double the last year with ETC trading at around $34 in December of 2021.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132375" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21002903/Capture10.png" alt="" width="918" height="539" /></p>
<p>But according to projections made by the website <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptopredictions.com/ethereum-classic/">cryptopredictions.com</a>, the price of ETC might increase again in the coming years.</p>

<p>The data further predicts a steady growth rate for the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> in case there are no more black-swan events.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-132374" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/21002813/image4.png" alt="" width="1579" height="903" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, according to today’s price, if you invested $1,000 into Ethereum Classic, you would receive 63.33 ETC coins.</p>
<p>And in case the price hits $100 in the next few years, this $1,000 investment of yours would become $6,333, which is an increase of 533%.</p>

However, XRP Holders’ lawyer has claimed that the SEC is filing cases against crypto firms as it wants to kill the market.</p>
<h2>XRP lawyer slams watchdogs approach</h2>
<p>Gabriel Shapiro, General Counsel at Delphi Labs mentioned that SEC is aggressively expanding <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1605231668012408833" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">the notion of &#8220;disgorgement&#8221;</a> in the <a href="https://coingape.com/lbry-faces-defeat-in-sec-vs-lbry-case-tweets-wont-give-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit against LBRY</a>. It is trying to treat all distributions of LBC tokens as sales.</p>
<p>It added that the SEC is equating the resulting benefits of distribution to profit generated on the current LBC spot price.</p>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> in the XRP lawsuit or XRP holders’ lawyer slammed the SEC over its approach towards the crypto market. He highlighted the commission&#8217;s alleged in its objection that all money raised by the crypto firms went into operation.</p>
<h2>SEC making abrupt claims</h2>
<p>Deaton added that after these claims the SEC brings up disgorgement. As per the XRP lawyer, under Liu, it is meant to be offset by legitimate business expenses. However, the watchdog pled that everything raised by the LBRY went into operations.</p>
<p>XRP lawyer is being abusive in the non-fraud case against LBRY. He mentioned this directly reflecting the SEC’s approach to crypto which is to kill it. Deaton brought up the SEC vs KiK summary judgment the commission wasn’t able to get disgorgement.</p>
<p>He added that this is a dangerous message that SEC is sending to the crypto market in general.</p>

Previously this support has initiated some strong rallies, validating it as a high accumulation zone.  Thus, the coin price is currently hovering above this support in order to replenish lost bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The short-term trend in polygon coins is sideways.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily EMAs accumulated near the $0.87 mark create a tough hurdle to overcome.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $382.5 Million, indicating a 33% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/vvIdPYEO.png" alt="Polygon Coin Price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent sell-off in the crypto market triggered by <a href="https://coingape.com/massive-bnb-selling-amid-binance-fud-where-is-it-heading/">FUD surrounding Binance</a> and the possible tightening of interest rate hikes by the US Fed, the polygon coin price witnessed significant outflow in last since last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the top of $0.94, the altcoin is 18% down and evaporates the entire gains from the November end rally. By the press time, the coin currently trades at $0.79 and wavers above the multi-month support of $0.763.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the accumulation zone has well supported the polygon coin price over the past two months, maintaining an overall sideways trend. While the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/bitcoin-ethereum-price-prediction-is-this-a-temporary-recovery-in-crypto-market/">crypto market turned bullish today</a>, the MATIC price rebounded 2.71% higher from the mentioned support. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the buying pressure persists, a daily candle closing above the $0.82 resistance will increase the chances for a bullish reversal.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, considering the overall market sentiment is still negative, the Polygon coin price will likely breach the $0.763 support. This possible breakdown may hint at a deeper correction which could plummet the prices 13.5% down to the $0.69 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the flattish EMAs(100 and 200) accentuate an overall range-bound movement. However, these EMAs offer additional selling pressure with a potential bearish crossover between the 50-and-100-day EMA.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily-RSI slope</a> dives below the last swing slow for the support level, indicating weakness in the bullish momentum and a higher possibility for downtrend resumption.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polygon Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.79</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.82 and $0.87</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.76 and $0.6</span></li>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied today after the U.S. Dollar Index fell sharply in response to the Bank of Japan&#8217;s raising their upper band limit for 10-year yields to 50 basis points. The BTC price rebounded after hitting a low of $16,398 on Monday and extended gains on Tuesday to hit almost $17,000.

The BTC price rebounded after hitting a low of $16,398 on Monday and extended gains on Tuesday to hit almost $17,000.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price soars nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $16,933. The 24-hour low and high for Bitcoin are $16,398 and $17,028. The resistance near $17,150 remains crucial for the BTC price. Bitcoin will be bullish in 2023 if the BTC monthly close breaks above the resistance level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin On-Chain Data Indicates Selloff</h2>
<p>While the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear market</a> rally supported by the weak U.S. dollar amid Bank of Japan monetary policy changes pushes Bitcoin price upwards, the upcoming rally will likely be weak.</p>
<p>On-chain data indicates short-term Bitcoin holders, especially 3-6 months, are selling their Bitcoin holdings continuously. In fact, the decline in BTC price observed on Monday was due to a selloff by 3-6 month Bitcoin holders.</p>
<figure id="attachment_132366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-132366" style="width: 714px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class=" wp-image-132366" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20212101/Bitcoin-Spent-Output-3-6-Months.webp" alt="Bitcoin Spent Output (3-6 Months)" width="714" height="354" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-132366" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Spent Output (3-6 Months). Source: CryptoQuant</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, the Spent Output Age Bands rise for 3-6 months holders is followed by massive downward movements. In fact, a sharp move occurred just before the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> crisis. Therefore, traders must keep an eye on the Spent Output of 3-6 month Bitcoin holders to help predict an upcoming Bitcoin price fall.</p>

<h2>Crypto Analysts&#8217; Bitcoin Predictions</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-close-to-this-level-for-next-support-range/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael van de Poppe predicts that BTC</a> could have a strong continuation if it breaks the $16,900 level. Moreover, Bitcoin holding the $16.5K support level remains key for the price rally toward $18K.</p>
<p>Rekt Capital earlier suggested that <a href="https://coingape.com/popular-analyst-predicts-bitcoin-btc-eth-ada-link-price-for-new-year-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price holding the $17,150 level</a> will be crucial for Bitcoin and altcoins. If Bitcoin closed the month below the support level, a move toward $13,900 can be seen. Moreover, Bitcoin has strong resistance at $18K and a strong rally is possible only if BTC price breaks the $18K-$19K level.</p>
