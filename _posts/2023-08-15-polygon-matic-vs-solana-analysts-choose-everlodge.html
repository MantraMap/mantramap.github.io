<p>Polygon and Solana are two of DeFi&rsquo;s most popular altcoins. In 2023, both projects have grown their ecosystems, with Solana taking a slight lead over Polygon in terms of market cap. Now, however, a new cryptocurrency could outperform both.</p>
<p>Everlodge is a new DeFi project set to release in 2023. It has revolutionary utility and could offer returns of 280% during its presale. Here&rsquo;s why analysts are choosing Everlodge over Polygon and Solana.</p>
<p class="s6">Find Out How To Buy Everlodge (ELDG)</p>
Everlodge Brings Travel Properties To Web3 
<p>Everlodge is a DeFi property marketplace designed for luxury villas, vacation homes, and hotels. Its marketplace lets individuals buy, sell and invest in fractional real estate on the blockchain. To achieve this, a property is minted into an NFT and fractionalized.</p>
<p>For example, A $2 million luxury villa in Spain could be fractionalized into 20 fragments. Each can then be purchased or sold for $200,000, reducing the amount an investor needs for their investment.</p>
<p>Everlodge will also offer a launchpad designed for property developers. This launchpad will let developers raise capital from the Everlodge community to kick-start developments. Investors will then profit from getting involved in developments early to maximize their returns.</p>
<p>In addition to its launchpad and property marketplace, Everlodge will offer an exclusive rewards club. As part of the rewards club, investors will earn free nightly stays across properties throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. Several tiers will be available and will determine the properties and number of stays an individual gets. Members aren&rsquo;t obliged to use this timehowever. Instead, it can be sold on third-party platforms such as Airbnb to generate another income source.</p>
<p>Investors who co-own properties will be able to use their NFT as collateral to obtain other short term loans. This will give them access to more capital to quickly scale their property portfolio.</p>
<p>ELDG tokens will be used throughout the Everlodge ecosystem. They will grant holders a number of benefits such as staking bonuses, discounts on property and free stays at properties. Tokens will start at $0.01 when the Everlodge presale begins, and are expected to hit $0.035 before tokens are launched on mainstream exchanges.</p>
Experts Predict That Solana Will Pass $30 
<p>Solana&rsquo;s total value locked has consistently increased since the start of 2023. Over the last month, Solana&rsquo;s TVL has stayed above $1 billion. This indicates that confidence in Solana is starting to build following the project's crash in June.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Solana&rsquo;s value has also increased. In the last 30 days, Solana has increased in value by 22.44%. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $23.59. Given its steady increase, experts believe that Solana will pass $30 in August.</p>
Confidence In Polygon Remains High Despite POL Proposal
<p>Polygon&rsquo;s price increases slowed over the last week after Polygon founders proposed an upgrade to Polygon's native token. This proposal has caused Polygon to decrease in value by 2.24%, andcreated confusion throughout the Polygon community.</p>
<p>The development team has proposed replacing MATIC tokens with POL. This new token would be used throughout the Polygon network, though investors are questioning why the upgrade needs to be made.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, confidence in Polygon continues to rise. PancakeSwap recently launched its v3 on the Polygon zkEVM Mainnet Beta, which is a huge win for the Polygon ecosystem.</p>
<p>Currently trading at $0.6897, analysts believe that Polygon will increase to $1 by the end of the year. Despite this increase, experts still predict that Everlodge will be a more profitable investment.</p>
