<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Users who make an stETH withdrawal request on Lido Finance receive an NFT as a Web3 receipt.</em></li>



<li><em>The special thing is that these NFTs can be traded on the secondary market and are transferable.</em></li>



<li><em>The number of requests for withdrawal processing of the protocol is recording at a peak of 686 requests</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Nansen, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/187894-lido-witnessing-huge-steth-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lido Finance</a> will send users an NFT as a Web3 receipt when the recipient submits a request to withdraw their staked ETH.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-929.png"><img decoding="async" width="1000" height="561" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-929.png" alt="Lido Gives Users Withdraw stETH A Transferable NFT Like A Receipt Web3" class="wp-image-188578" title="Lido Gives Users Withdraw stETH A Transferable NFT Like A Receipt Web3 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nansen, a blockchain analytics company, has released a document stating that after Lido Finance submits a request to withdraw stETH, users will receive NFTs. Once the withdrawal request is accepted, the NFT image will be updated, and the withdrawal will be notified. Subscribers, and users can use this NFT as a Web3 withdrawal receipt.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>According to information revealed by Twitter @lido_intern, the ETH withdrawal NFT offered by Lido Finance is transferable, meaning users can send it to any ETH wallet they wish to receive without being stolen.</p>



<p>Besides, these NFTs can be traded on the secondary market, as the next NFTs in the queue will be traded at a higher rate as some investors will pay more for faster withdrawals.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THEORETICALLY SPEAKING, these NFTs could be traded on a secondary marketplace, as the NFTs further up in the queue should expect to trade at a premium since some stakers will pay more to withdraw faster.</p>&mdash; Lido Intern (@lido_intern) <a href="https://twitter.com/lido_intern/status/1659145906711658497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>At the end of May 15, Lido Finance successfully upgraded to version V2 – a significant change that allows users to withdraw staking Ethereum from the platform. Previously, the protocol opened voting on the implementation of V2 on May 12.</p>



<p>The V2 upgrade is considered the most important update on this protocol after the Shapella hard fork last month to unlock large amounts of ETH for investors. Since then, Lido V2 has been continuously tested and undergone 9 rigorous evaluations.</p>



<p>With V2, will be 270,000 ETH available in the Withdrawals vault, so investors can make withdrawal requests without waiting too long. After this amount of ETH is drained, the vault will continue to be pumped more. In other words, investors have a better chance of returning their ETH in the first three days of unlocking, Lido said. The maximum time to exit the queue is 5 days and 14 hours, Rated network explorer estimates.</p>



<p>Therefore, since the upgrade, there have been 686 withdrawal requests totaling over 451k stETH. This amount is expected to increase still, especially after the large institutions that invested in Lido start processing withdrawals.</p>

<p>The IMF<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/05/16/Nigerias-eNaira-One-Year-After-533487" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/05/16/Nigerias-eNaira-One-Year-After-533487" rel="noreferrer noopener"> researchers</a> have commended the eNaira&#8217;s debut year, stating that it has been &#8220;laudable&#8221;. However, the paper also has a few suggestions on how to further improve its performance.</p>



<p>It is worth noting that the eNaira was the world&#8217;s second CBDC, having launched in October 2021 after the Bahamian Sand Dollar. According to the paper, the eNaira&#8217;s retail side was intermediated, but it has yet to make its breakthrough beyond its initial adopters. The Central Bank of Nigeria introduced a phased introduction, which unfortunately has put off two of the CBDC&#8217;s biggest goals &#8211; extending financial inclusion to the unbanked and facilitating remittances &#8211; according to IMF officials.</p>



<p>The current usage of the eNaira is relatively low, with only about 1.5% of wallets being active on any given week. Additionally, there were only a total of 802,000 transactions during the timespan examined, which represents less than one per wallet. Furthermore, less than 1% of bank accounts in Nigeria have wallets. The paper has observed that breaking the initial low adoption equilibrium for any network products with similar traits, such as credit cards, requires a mix of clever strategies and luck.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMF-Gives-eNaira-Thumbs-Up-In-First-Year-Report.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMF-Gives-eNaira-Thumbs-Up-In-First-Year-Report.jpeg" alt="IMF Gives eNaira Thumbs Up In First Year Report" class="wp-image-188575" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMF-Gives-eNaira-Thumbs-Up-In-First-Year-Report.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMF-Gives-eNaira-Thumbs-Up-In-First-Year-Report-300x171.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMF-Gives-eNaira-Thumbs-Up-In-First-Year-Report-768x439.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMF-Gives-eNaira-Thumbs-Up-In-First-Year-Report-750x428.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="IMF Gives eNaira Thumbs Up In First Year Report 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The relationship between the eNaira and mobile money operators (MMOs) in Nigeria is a key question raised in the paper. The CBDC could either compete with the MMOs on the retail market or facilitate MMOs&#8217; operations by providing a bridge between them. The paper has called the eNaira&#8217;s replacement of all the MMOs&#8217; services &#8220;hard to imagine,&#8221; but also noted that a bridge function could set off a difficult &#8220;industry reshuffle.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a single-currency system, the IMF has mentioned that the eNaira is unable to accommodate remittances directly. However, this could be overcome either by allowing international money transfer operators to receive eNaira wallets or through intermediation. The researchers have recommended the former, though both options will remain expensive, which the IMF considers a serious problem in light of the parallel, underground market that serves the same purpose.</p>



<p>The paper has recommended a few steps for boosting eNaira usage. For instance, the eNaira could be used for social payments in conjunction with MMOs that improve the social cash transfer system and increase adoption. Merchants could also be incentivised to use the eNaira. The Central Bank of Nigeria has already started to work on inclusivity through the eNaira, according to the paper. However, remittances remain problematic, and resolving this issue is crucial for achieving the eNaira&#8217;s full potential.</p>

<p>Whampoa Group is associated with two prominent Singaporean Lee families, including Amy Lee, niece of Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan Yew, and Lee Han Shih of Singaporean multimedia conglomerate Potato Productions. The Group&#8217;s LinkedIn page reveals that its digital arm, Whampoa Digital, was founded in 2021. The company has been involved in several high-profile investment initiatives, including a $500 million fund created by Binance Labs, the cryptocurrency exchange&#8217;s venture capital arm, in June 2022. In September of the same year, it launched a $100 million venture capital fund to support Web3 startups. It is also an investor in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok.</p>



<p>The Middle East and North Africa region was identified as the world&#8217;s fastest-growing crypto market in a Chainalysis report released in October. Whampoa Group CEO Shawn Chan cited the kingdom&#8217;s solid reputation in the financial services sector, transparent regulatory framework, and ongoing pledge to collaborate and innovate as key reasons for launching the initiative in Bahrain. The move is part of the Group&#8217;s broader strategy to expand its digital banking footprint in the region.</p>



<p>Binance received a license to operate in Bahrain in March 2022, and local payment platform EazyPay partnered with Binance Pay to enable the use of crypto at more than 5,000 points of sale in the country in October. Bahrain is also home to CoinMENA, a Shariah-compliant cryptocurrency exchange, creating a favorable environment for digital banking and payment solutions.</p>

<p>On May 17, 2023, a lawsuit was filed against former Sam Bankman-Fried and other top FTX insiders concerning the Embed acquisition. On the same day, a separate lawsuit was filed seeking to claw back funds from Embed’s CEO Michael Giles and its shareholders, accusing FTX of paying a “wildly inflated” price of $220 million for the stock-trading platform.</p>



<p>Court documents filed in relation to the case provide a number of insights into the acquisition process and the concerns of some Embed employees. For instance, Embed’s Chief Technology Officer Laurence Beal expressed shock at the amount paid by FTX during a short meeting with Giles. In correspondence with another senior employee at Embed, Beal described due diligence process with a cowboy emoji. This suggests that there were concerns around the acquisition process and whether sufficient checks were carried out.</p>



<p>As part of the acquisition, FTX also paid Embed employees a total of $70 million in retention bonuses. The majority of that sum — $55 million — was paid to Giles, who later became concerned about how he would justify this amount to other employees. Between the day that Giles signed the acquisition agreement on June 10, 2022, and the closing of the acquisition on September 30, 2022, he was being paid a staggering $490,000 each day, assuming that he worked seven days every week. He was also awarded an additional $103 million when the deal closed, due to his standing as Embed’s largest shareholder.</p>

<p>This amount stands in stark contrast to Giles’ normal salary of $12,500 per month as Embed’s CEO. Despite a number of Embed employees being awarded retention payment agreements, Giles was the only one who was paid his full retention bonus on the closing date. The other employees were obligated to remain at Embed for two years if they wished to receive their full bonuses.</p>



<p>As a result of these disproportionate payouts to Embed insiders, FTX is now seeking to claw back $236.8 million from Giles and Embed executives as well as an additional $6.9 million from Embed’s smaller shareholders. In addition to this, lawyers have accused FTX insiders of taking “advantage of the FTX Group’s lack of controls and recordkeeping to perpetrate a massive fraud” by using misallocated funds to facilitate the purchase of Embed, while being fully aware that the company was insolvent when finalizing the deal.</p>



<p>FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11, 2022. The firms’ new leadership — headed by bankruptcy attorney John Ray III — has been focused on clawing back funds to repay customers and creditors. More recently, FTX lawyers have considered a possible reboot of the exchange.</p>

<p>Often used to create NFT-like assets on Bitcoin, Ordinals launched in January 2019, and the protocol &#8211; although not fully adopted by the Bitcoin community &#8211; has created a new wave of experimentation with the oldest coin of cryptocurrencies. And since then, thousands of other so-called BRC-20 tokens have been created.</p>



<p>Despite mixed opinions from experts that this wave can deviate from Bitcoin&#8217;s original goal and cause network congestion causing gas fees to skyrocket, there is no denying the huge attraction from the community to BRC- 20, although most tokens currently are memecoins.</p>



<p>Many people still believe that Ordinals/BRC-20 will be the driving force to &#8220;revive&#8221; the world&#8217;s oldest, somewhat dull blockchain. The living proof is that the rise of Pepecoin is taking the market by storm, and the market has grown by 7000% since its launch on April 16.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Cuscal, the third-party payments provider for Binance Australia, suggests a connection between &#8220;scams and fraud&#8221; and crypto activity, prompting questions about why it stopped supporting Binance Australia on May 18.</em></li>



<li><em>Cuscal said it was committed to identifying and implementing detection services to protect clients from financial crimes.</em></li>



<li><em>Binance Australia&#8217;s Australian dollar services were suspended, but Cuscal declined to comment on Binance Australia specifically or why it instructed its partner payments firm Zepto to &#8220;offboard&#8221; the exchange.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The payments provider did not specifically mention Binance Australia or any other crypto exchanges in its statement but did mention that it&#8217;s committed to identifying and implementing detection services for its clients across the Australian payments system.</p>

<p>While Cuscal declined to elaborate on why it pulled support for Binance Australia specifically, it did mention that it has, and will continue to, terminate any clients or their customers and/or merchants that fail to meet its onboarding and compliance requirements. This decision comes in the wake of media attention on the impact of scams and fraud in Australia, with particular focus on account fraud, ID takeover, and crypto activity.</p>



<p>Binance Australia, on the other hand, said its Australian dollar services were suspended with immediate effect on May 18, citing a decision made by its third-party payment service provider. The Sydney-based B2B financial services firm, however, reassured Cointelegraph that it&#8217;s focused on supporting the financial industry in protecting Australians from financial crimes and scams.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Filecoin Foundation has refuted the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) assertion that its FIL token is a security.</em></li>



<li><em>The company has described them as &#8220;a decentralized, peer-to-peer network for storing files&#8221; and unequivocally states that FIL is not secure.</em></li>



<li><em>Earlier, Filecoin Trust registrar, Grayscale also disagreed with the decision of the SEC staff.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/filecoin-foundation-rejects-secs-classification-of-fil-as-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CryptoSlate</a>, the Filecoin Foundation has refuted the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) assertion that its FIL tokens are securities in a statement.</strong></h5>

<p>The Filecoin Foundation describes its blockchain network as a &#8220;decentralized peer-to-peer network for storing files&#8221; and emphasizes that FIL is not a security.</p>



<p>&#8220;Over the last decade, thousands of people worldwide have contributed to this open-source project to create a decentralized, efficient, and robust foundation for humanity&#8217;s most important information. That includes hundreds of organizations and teams building on the network, thousands of storage providers, and 13,000 Github contributors, building a foundational layer for the next generation of the web.&#8221; The Foundation said.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Grayscale revealed that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had asked it to withdraw its application to launch a Filecoin trust product (FIL). Grayscale said in a statement that it received comments from the SEC stating that the FIL &#8220;meets the definition of a security.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, the organization <a href="https://news.coincu.com/188212-us-sec-deems-filecoin-a-security-grayscale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disagrees</a> with the opinion of the SEC staff and does not believe that the FIL is a security under federal securities laws. Grayscale intends to respond promptly to SEC staff to explain the legal basis of the company&#8217;s position.</p>

<p>Grayscale cannot predict whether or not SEC staff will be convinced that their position is correct, and if not. Suppose the SEC employee disagrees with Grayscale&#8217;s position. In that case, Grayscale may need to seek alternative arrangements allowing the Trust to register under the Investment Companies Act of 1940 or consider dissolution.</p>



<p>Since receiving the negative news, the FIL token has continuously recorded a bearish sign. Currently, FIL is trading at $4.43, down 5% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Meta executives have announced that a new round of mass layoffs will begin next week.</em></li>



<li><em>In March of this year, Zuckerberg said that the company planned to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of May, and the company cut 4,000 jobs last month.</em></li>



<li><em>The layoffs due to massive hiring during the boom period are still happening to cut costs even though the loss-making Metaverse division is still focused on growth.</em></li>

<p>The layoffs will affect Meta&#8217;s business units, potentially affecting thousands of employees. Although the company&#8217;s executives did not confirm the specific size of the layoffs, Zuckerberg said in March of this year that the company planned to cut 10,000 jobs by the end of May and it had cut 4,000 jobs last month.</p>



<p>The afternoon before layoffs occur, the head of human resources at Meta will post a note to employees with details on when the layoff process begins and which teams will be affected. Affected employees will then be notified, followed by unaffected employees. The company will require all employees &#8220;whose work allows&#8221; to work from home.</p>



<p>Downsizing is one of the clearest examples of how big tech companies are due to over-hiring during the pandemic combined with massive changes in the tech industry at large. It is tightening its belts after nearly two decades of relentless growth.</p>



<p>Metaverse, a technology once famous when CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisioned a future where billions of people would live, work and play in the digital world, has almost &#8220;died&#8221; after being abandoned by the business world.</p>

<p>In October 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta and turned to building virtual universes. After a well-known debut, the metaverse immediately became a craze for Wall Street investors. However, the hype couldn&#8217;t save the lack of a consistent vision for the final product that led to the demise of the virtual world universe.</p>



<p>In the context that the technology world is moving to a new and more potential trend like AI, the fate of the metaverse is already predetermined.</p>



<p>Recent comments by Mark Zuckerberg and company&#8217;s management show that the company focuses on AI (artificial intelligence) and no longer prioritizes the metaverse. Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth said the company focuses most of its time on AI. Facebook&#8217;s parent company plans to launch an AI ad-generating tool later this year.</p>



<p>However, on April 26, Mark Zuckerberg denied &#8220;abandoning&#8221; the metaverse to focus on developing AI. He said Meta has been developing both areas for many years now and will continue to focus on both.</p>



<p>The company&#8217;s virtual reality projects division reported an operating <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184215-meta-loss-3-9b-after-pumping-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loss of $3.9 billion</a> for the first quarter of 2023. This is slightly lower than its $4.3 billion loss in the previous quarter.</p>

The funds will be used to develop new products and grow into the European and South American markets.</p>



<p>Consumers in cash-centric communities may access the asset by buying vouchers, and the firm is paid a fee for each transaction. Additionally, many users are unfamiliar with the complexity of crypto exchanges and Web3 wallets. For them, vouchers are significantly more accessible, familiar, and easy.</p>



<p>Azteco co-founder Paul Ferguson stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;This funding will fuel our market activation and product refinement efforts, enabling us to reach consumers more effectively, to develop deeply intuitive products and empower individuals worldwide to participate in global commerce regardless of their financial or technical experience level.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Azteco, founded in 2014 by Paul Ferguson, is a supplier of a voucher system that enables customers to store, spend, and distribute small amounts of Bitcoin via a worldwide network based on trust and local relationships.</p>



<p>The solution was developed in response to the discovery that over 2 billion individuals globally own smartphones but lack access to conventional banking services. For these individuals, bitcoin offers a low-cost, safe, and flexible alternative to conventional banking that eliminates payer fraud and enables the unbanked population to hold money, make transactions, and obtain credit without the need for a typical bank account.</p>



<p>Azteco Vouchers, which are equivalent to the traditional paper coupons provided by mobile phone networks, may be purchased by users. These are redeemable directly on users&#8217; mobile phones, similar to how top-up coupons function to add call time to Pay-as-You-Go mobile phones.</p>



<p>Azteco intends to expand beyond the vouchers. In the next months, the business intends to streamline the process of purchasing Bitcoin online by eliminating the need for customers to register accounts or go through a lengthy Verification procedure. The present deal values the firm at $84 million pre-money. For a firm that is just a year old, this demonstrates that investors are confident in Azteco&#8217;s growth potential.</p>
