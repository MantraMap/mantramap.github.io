					<description><![CDATA[XRP has been one of the trending tokens following the summary judgment which ruled that the token was not a security, giving its parent company, Ripple, a ‘partial victory’ over the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That event saw XRP’s price soar to about $0.93.  However, XRP’s price seems to have cooled off, settling at the $0.7 price mark. Despite this, there still seems to be bullish sentiment around XRP’s future price, which is why this Machine Learning tool was consulted to predict XRP’s price.  Here’s What It Said PricePredictions.com, a site powered by an advanced machine learning algorithm that provides current and futuristic trends about several tokens, was consulted in a bid to get an insight into XRP’s future price and to better position themselves in case of a rally by the token.

According to XRP’s futuristic price action, the AI tool forecasts that there will be an upward trend that will see XRP gain about 1.5% in value from its current price of $0.7.

					<description><![CDATA[Tether USDT has seen its market cap value reach new highs in the month of July. According to a report by on-chain analytics company Into The Block, the world’s largest stablecoin is steadily approaching the key $84 billion mark. Based on data from DeFiLlama, USDT’s market cap is up by over $480 million since the beginning of July, indicating an increasing level of adoption. Generally, the stablecoin’s total market share value has been on the rise for the majority of 2023, moving from $66.23 billion on January 1 to its current value of $83.80 billion. In tandem with USDT’s market cap growth, Into The Block also noted the token’s circulating supply is up by almost 30% year to date. Interestingly, USDT’s market growth has also been reflected in its operator&#8217;s development.  Back in May, Tether Holdings Ltd published its quarterly assurance report announcing a net profit of $1.48 billion for Q1 2023, bringing its excess reserve to an all-time high of $2.44 billion.  Into The Block noted that currently, Tether is well on course to surpass those profit levels in Q2 and Q3 as there is an increase in the amount of USDT being issued.

According to data from DeFiILama, Tether’s market dominance has grown by about 19% in 2023, as the token now accounts for two-thirds of the stablecoin market.  While this development is mainly driven by USDT’s impressive performance, there has also been a notable decline in the market shares of some other prominent stablecoins. &#160; Source: DeFilLama For example, Circle’s USD Coin (USDC), which ranks as the second-largest stablecoin, has seen its market cap fall by a staggering 40% in 2023, with the current value now set at $26.26 billion. Meanwhile, Binance USD (BUSD), with a market cap of $3.71 billion, has shed over 77% of its market shares following an embargo on its issuance earlier this year.  At the time of writing, Tether&#8217;s value remains pegged at $1. With a market cap of 83.80 billion, the stablecoin ranks as the third biggest cryptocurrency falling Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) Tether (USDT) rising market cap in 2023 &#124; Source: USDT Market Cap Daily Chart On Tradingview.com Related Reading: Tether CTO Paulo Adoino Explains 1 Billion USDT Issuance DeFi Stablecoins Gearing Up To Match Centralized Counterparts In other news, DeFi stablecoins have been rolling out some impressive upgrades as they attempt to close the gap between them and their centralized competitors. In a tweet on Friday, Into The Block highlighted some of these developments. Firstly, the MakerDAO recently hiked the DAI Savings Rate (DSR) to 3.49%, and there is the possibility of an increase to 8% in the coming weeks. Furthermore, the Frax protocol will be launching FRAX v3 in August as they look to make FRAX a fully algorithmic token, delinking its minting process from the USDC token. In addition, there is Lybra Finance which lends its stablecoin eUSD to users at an interest rate of 0%. Other DeFi stablecoins with impressive features or upgrades include Curve Finance’s crvUSD and Aave’s GHO.  Featured Image From Barron, Chart From Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[AI (artificial intelligence) tokens were one of the most promising assets in the cryptocurrency market at the beginning of 2023. One of the major drivers of this was the launch of ChatGPT &#8211; an AI-based chatbot &#8211; in late 2022, which propelled some AI-related cryptocurrencies to substantial gains. However, the interest in this set of cryptocurrencies appears to be cooling, with data research firm Kaiko revealing a significant decline in trading activity for the AI-related tokens. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows Lowest Weekly Trading Volume For AI Tokens AI-related tokens registered their lowest weekly trading volume since January 2023, according to a recent data report from Kaiko. In this report, the research platform looked at the trading volume of six of the top seven AI tokens, including FET, INJ, ROSE, AGIX, RNDR, and GRT. Source: Kaiko/Twitter This notable decrease in trading activity suggests a decline in attention from investors since the AI token frenzy peaked in January. And this appears to be reflected in the price performances of many AI-related cryptocurrencies. The Graph (GRT), the largest AI token in the market, was one of the top gainers at the start of 2023, surging by roughly 122% to reach a yearly high of $0.2323 on February 7. However, the price of the GRT token has since plummeted, with a 51% decline from the 2023 peak. Can ChatGPT &#38; OpenAI Do It Again? As mentioned earlier, the surge of interest in AI tokens was partly driven by the launch of ChatGPT. However, there has not been a similar effect on the AI and big-data crypto economy following the launch of Sam Altman’s Worldcoin project and WLD token. On July 24, 2023, Altman, the CEO of OpenAI &#8211; the artificial intelligence company behind ChatGPT &#8211; rolled out his crypto product, releasing the World ID development kit and the WLD token.  The WLD token soared more than 85% to reach an all-time high of $3.3 on the day of launch, according to CoinGecko data. However, the cryptocurrency’s price has declined by over 31% since hitting this peak. Related Reading: Why Worldcoin (WLD) And PEPE Dominate The Crypto Market Trends This Week Although there has been enthusiasm around the launch of Worldcoin, the project &#8211; especially its technology &#8211; has also been met with some skepticism. Notably, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin voiced his concern over the project’s iris-scanning hardware and biometric data collection practices. Meanwhile, Worldcoin looks set to face some regulatory scrutiny, with the UK’s data regulator Information Commissioner Office (ICO) already making inquiries. France’s privacy regulator CNIL has also questioned the legality of the project’s biometric data collection. While the Worldcoin project and the WLD token seem to be gaining some traction at the moment, it remains to be seen how they will impact the AI and big-data crypto economy. As of this writing, the WLD token changes hand at $2.27, with a 6.8% price increase in the past day.

					<description><![CDATA[Non-fungible tokens continue to play a significant role in developing the Web3 ecosystem, despite the enthusiasm around them having subsided since its peak in 2021. Unquestionably, these distinctive digital assets have been a significant force behind the NFT transformations that have taken place. Despite the wide variety of NFT collections and their accomplishments, it is crucial to recognize that some particular ones have recently been severely affected by market pressures and are now beginning to fall from their lofty positions. Consider the situation with CryptoPunks. CoinGecko discovered that of the top 11 &#8220;blue chip&#8221; NFT projects studied, CryptoPunks suffered the worst losses. Non-fungible tokens known as &#8220;blue chip NFTs&#8221; are regarded as highly precious and prestigious in digital assets. These NFTs are frequently linked to well-known and recognized producers or organizations, such as renowned artists, enduring businesses, or essential historical items. Source: CoinGecko Collectors and investors widely seek after them due to scarcity, historical relevance, and the artist&#8217;s reputation that determine their value. Alarming statistics currently facing CryptoPunks are raising questions among NFT enthusiasts. These formerly well-liked digital assets have recently encountered a worrying situation, sparking disputes and disagreements among investors and fans. Related Reading: Traders’ Interest In XRP Remains Solid Despite Price Retreat, Data Shows Source: NFT Floor Price At the time of writing, the floor price for these NFT collections was set at 47.69 ETH. Data from NFT Floor Price shows that the collection&#8217;s value declined after reaching a high of 11,000ETH during the 2021 NFT bull market. The volume and sales of CryptoPunks have significantly decreased during the past seven days, claims OpenSea. Sales were down 60%, while volume dropped sharply by 64%. Bitcoin slightly above the  $29K level.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Non-fungible tokens continue to play a significant role in developing the Web3 ecosystem, despite the enthusiasm around them having subsided since its peak in 2021.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, these distinctive digital assets have been a significant force behind the NFT transformations that have taken place.

					<description><![CDATA[Casper (CSPR) has been making significant strides in the cryptocurrency market, attracting attention with its aim to accelerate enterprise and developer adoption of blockchain technology. As a live proof-of-stake blockchain built off the Casper CBC specification, Casper offers unique features and growth potential, drawing interest from investors and enthusiasts alike. In the past week, there has been a significant upturn in its on-chain volume. Casper has experienced a substantial price surge in the past 24 hours, with its value increasing by 4.62%. This surge has created excitement among investors, especially as the cryptocurrency has displayed steady growth over the past 7 days, gaining an impressive 14.58%. The positive price movement has generated enthusiasm and optimism among Casper investors, who are pleased with their returns during this period. As of the latest data, Casper (CSPR) is ranked 84th among all cryptocurrencies, with a current price of $0.04035. The circulating supply of Casper stands at 11,202,499,993, contributing to a total market capitalization of $456,309,769. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent performance has been particularly noteworthy, showcasing impressive short- and long-term growth. Collaboration With INX Boosts Market Sentiment A contributing factor to Casper&#8217;s recent growth can be attributed to its strategic partnership with INX, a United States-regulated broker-dealer. Casper&#8217;s equity was tokenized and listed through this collaboration, enhancing investor confidence and further supporting the cryptocurrency&#8217;s upward trajectory. This strategic move has enabled Casper to tap into new markets and expand its reach to a broader audience. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Price Remains Muted Despite Significant Milestones, Why?

Casper (CSPR) Price Analysis Casper has experienced a consistent upward trend in July after it bottomed at $0.0365. Since then, its price has increased by 30% and has hit heights of $0.0405. This positive trend is likely to continue in the coming weeks with more developments expected to be deployed on Casper. From a technical analysis standpoint, Casper exhibits promising signals. The daily chart reveals the formation of a bullish falling wedge pattern, indicating a potential trend reversal. CSPR has also surpassed the 25-day exponential moving average and is currently testing the 50-day MA. If the bullish trend continues the next resistance point is $0.40 while a bearish downturn will see the support at $0.0397.

					<description><![CDATA[Despite a favorable ruling as a non-security token, XRP had experienced a correction for over a week and a half, losing bullish momentum after reaching a yearly high of $0.94. It is trading above the $0.70 mark, with the $0.66 level acting as a support. Related Reading: Stanford MBA Explains Why Next Bitcoin Cycle Could Be “Bigger” Over the past 24 hours, XRP has exhibited sideways trading yet shows potential signs of price appreciation. The technical analysis indicates a leaning toward bullish sentiment, with positive buying strength, demand, and accumulation. Even though the emergence of a pattern suggesting further bullishness is possible, it remains critical for XRP to maintain support at $0.66 and $0.56 levels.

XRP Price Analysis: One-Day Chart When writing, the altcoin XRP was trading at $0.71. The XRP price chart shows the formation of a bullish reversal pattern known as a cup and handle. Despite this positive pattern, the coin&#8217;s true bullish potential will be determined by its ability to surpass two significant resistance levels at $0.76 and $0.84, respectively. It&#8217;s worth noting that after reaching a yearly high of $0.94, XRP encountered resistance at $0.84 twice.

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) has been at the forefront of network development over the last few months. This continued commitment to further development on the blockchain has led to the network hitting multiple new milestones. However, the price of ADA has remained stagnant, so what’s going on? Latest Achievements For Cardano The year 2023 has been a good year for the Cardano network so far as it has celebrated multiple achievements during this time. The first of these is the fact that the Cardano network has recorded one of the longest uptimes of any blockchain in the space. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falls While Others Rally, Is It Decoupling From The Market? Cardano has recorded a continuous uptime record of 2,131 days as of July 28, which means that the network has not had an outage in almost six years.

Cardano has a current UPTIME of 2129 days exactly. That&#8217;s 5.83 YEARS with NO downtime.

Cardano has consistently ranked among the top 3 ecosystems when it comes to development and this time around has been no different. ADA price trending at $0.31 &#124; Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com According to data from the on-chain tracker Santiment, the network is number 3 on the list of assets with the most developments over the last 30 days. This puts it behind only Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama Network (KSM), both of which emerged 1st and 2nd, respectively. This placement also puts Cardano ahead of its largest competitor Ethereum in terms of development. 🧑‍💻 Top 10 #crypto assets by development activity: notable #github commits, past 30 days: T1 @Polkadot $DOT T1 @kusamanetwork $KSM 3 @Cardano $ADA 4 @dfinity $ICP 5 @hedera $HBAR 6 @vegaprotocol $VEGA 7 @ethstatus $SNT 8 @cosmos $ATOM 9 @Ethereum $ETH 10 @decentraland $MANA pic.twitter.com/SnWDQf5a3y — Santiment (@santimentfeed) July 27, 2023 But Why Is ADA Not Reflecting The Achievements? Usually, when a network such as Cardano is recording such achievements as it has, it is reflected in the price of its native in the form of a rally. However, there has been no such performance from ADA. Rather, the altcoin has been shedding its gains since June. The problem may not be from ADA and might stem from the fact that the crypto market just reverted into another bear market trend. As a result, the broader market has been following the movement of Bitcoin, which on its own has reversed toward the low $29,000s. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Patterns Suggest Bull Market Is Not Starting In 2023 Given Cardano’s developments, if the market were to resume its rally, then ADA may emerge as one of the top performers. This would stem from the positive sentiment surrounding the token due to its significant achievements. Meanwhile, ADA is still performing well on a broader scale. At its current price, the digital asset’s price is up over 40% from its June lows, and ADA holding a good chunk of these gains shows that demand is rising to meet supply, thereby steadying the price.

					<description><![CDATA[Worldcoin and its native token WLD have been taking the attention of crypto investors, according to recent data from Coingecko. The project recently announced its worldwide launch inviting users to “visit the orb” and receive rewards by onboarding the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens WLD has doubled its value from its launch on July 24th, when the cryptocurrency was trading at around $1. The token rose to $2.19 the following week and has been moving sideways since amid a surge in controversy from different angles. Worldcoin (WLD) Leads Crypto Tendencies In addition to WLD, Coingecko shows that Bitcoin (BTC), Unibot (UNIBOT), Chainlink (LINK), HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have been trending along with other tokens. Bitcoin remains the leader on this chart despite the crash in the BTC.D chart. This metric gauges the percentage of the crypto total market cap comprised solely of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Often, when the chart trends to the upside, altcoins, such as Worldcoin (WLD) and PEPE, experience a drop in their prices and vice versa. In that sense, WLD’s launch came at a favorable time for small tokens. The project has promised a reward for every user willing to scan their eyeballs with one of the devices scattered around different countries. Thus, sparking controversy about their practices from the crypto community and regulators, some of which are already looking into the project’s legitimacy. Via his Twitter (X) account, Adam Cochran wondered if the hype around WLD is organic or fabricated by a marketing strategy. Cochran wrote: So either Worldcoin, or some group of Orb operators are legit paying plants to stand in line at orbs both for videos and to create demand for the orbs. Got pinged by an old marketing firm friend who does field event marketing, who was asking if Worldcoin is legit. PEPE Leads Trends In The United States While WLD took over the global attention in the nascent sector, PEPE Coin is still the king of the top trending tokens in 2023. Research conducted by Marketplace Fairness indicates that the token has been trending across 23 of the 50 states in the U.S., including Florida, California, and Texas.

<h2>Worldcoin (WLD) Leads Crypto Tendencies</h2>
<p>In addition to WLD, Coingecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/watchlists" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shows</a> that Bitcoin (BTC), Unibot (UNIBOT), Chainlink (LINK), HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu, and Pepe Coin (PEPE) have been trending along with other tokens. Bitcoin remains the leader on this chart despite the crash in the BTC.D chart.</p>
<p>This metric gauges the percentage of the crypto total market cap comprised solely of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Often, when the chart trends to the upside, altcoins, such as Worldcoin (WLD) and PEPE, experience a drop in their prices and vice versa.</p>
<p>In that sense, WLD’s launch came at a favorable time for small tokens. The project has promised a reward for every user willing to scan their eyeballs with one of the devices scattered around different countries.</p>
<p>Thus, sparking controversy about their practices from the crypto community and regulators, some of which are already looking into the project’s legitimacy.</p>
<p>Via his Twitter (X) account, Adam Cochran wondered if the hype around WLD is organic or fabricated by a marketing strategy. Cochran <a href="https://twitter.com/adamscochran/status/1684702689752383488" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So either Worldcoin, or some group of Orb operators are legit paying plants to stand in line at orbs both for videos and to create demand for the orbs. Got pinged by an old marketing firm friend who does field event marketing, who was asking if Worldcoin is legit.</p></blockquote>
<strong>PEPE Leads Trends In The United States</strong>
<p>While WLD took over the global attention in the nascent sector, PEPE Coin is still the king of the top trending tokens in 2023. Research conducted by Marketplace Fairness <a href="https://www.marketplacefairness.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">indicates</a> that the token has been trending across 23 of the 50 states in the U.S., including Florida, California, and Texas.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency was launched a few months ago but has already garnered more interest than Cardano (ADA), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), Dogecoin, etc. Most of these tokens only trended in 2 of the 50 states in the U.S. in 2023.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Evernode, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) Layer 2 platform, has shared a series of updates on its journey toward launch, offering insights into its progress and the challenges it has faced. XRP Ledger Layer 2 Platform Audit Scheduled For Mid-August Evernode is a Layer 2 platform that seeks to bring smart contracts to the XRP Ledger ecosystem via Hooks. The platform is being developed by a team of experienced developers working to enhance the XRP Ledger network with advanced functionalities.

In the first update, Evernode announced that the audit of their three hooks is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-August. However, the team is still waiting for paperwork and funding from Ripple to confirm the audit, just like other XRPL Grants Grantees. In the second update, the Evernode team shared that the Nomad contract proved more challenging than expected. The contract did not persist on the betanet, which helped the development team identify bugs and areas for improvement. The team has been working hard to resolve these issues and remains optimistic that they will overcome the obstacles soon. Ultimately, Evernode appreciated the approximately 104 betahosts who have provided invaluable feedback in testing and improving the platform in a near-live environment. These updates highlight the complexity of developing a Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger and the importance of thorough testing and auditing. It also emphasizes the dedication and hard work of the Evernode team throughout the development process. However, upon successful launch, Evernode&#8217;s platform will enable developers to build and deploy smart contracts on the XRP Ledger network, opening up new use cases and applications for the ecosystem. This will enable XRP Ledger to compete with other smart contract platforms such as Ethereum, which has gained significant traction in decentralized finance (DeFi). Moreover, Evernode&#8217;s platform will help drive the adoption of XRP Ledger by attracting more developers to the ecosystem. As the number of developers grows, the network&#8217;s capabilities will expand, leading to more use cases and applications, ultimately driving adoption and value. The development of Evernode&#8217;s Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger is a significant milestone for the XRP Ledger community. It showcases the continued innovation and development within the ecosystem, which are critical for its growth and success. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally May Not Resume Until This Happens Overall, Evernode&#8217;s updates on the progress toward launching a Layer 2 platform for XRP Ledger demonstrate the importance of rigorous testing and auditing in developing complex systems.  The successful launch of the platform will open up new opportunities for developers, potentially driving adoption and growth in the XRP Ledger ecosystem.  At the time of writing, XRP has encountered a sideways price movement since Monday. As the fourth largest cryptocurrency in the market regarding trading volume and market capitalization, it is currently trading at $0.7119, representing a decrease of 1.6% over the last 24 hours.
