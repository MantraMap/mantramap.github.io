<h2>Indian Government Answers Questions About Crypto Bill and Regulation</h2>
<p>The Indian government answered two sets of questions about cryptocurrency and its regulation Monday by various members of Lok Sabha, the lower house of India&#8217;s parliament.</p>
<p>Parliament member Bhartruhari Mahtab asked the minister of finance to state &#8220;the current status of the cryptocurrency bill, which was due for being tabled during the winter session, 2021, of the Parliament&#8221; and &#8220;the timeframe within which the cryptocurrency bill would be tabled and subsequently be open for public inputs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Ministry of Finance, replied without providing a specific timeframe:</p>
<blockquote><p>Crypto assets are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, any legislation on the subject can be effective only with significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mahtab further asked the finance minister to state which ministry and/or department would regulate cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens, and which would regulate other types of &#8220;virtual digital assets,&#8221; such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized applications (dApps), real estate tokens, and other blockchain-based assets.</p>
<p>Chaudhary simply replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, policy related to crypto assets and related ecosystem is with the Ministry of Finance.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Parliament Members Also Ask for Details of Crypto Exchanges Under Investigation</h2>
<p>Another set of questions by several other parliament members requests &#8220;the details of crypto exchanges which are under investigation by the government for money laundering and tax evasion cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chaudhary explained that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) &#8220;is investigating several cases related to crypto frauds wherein a few crypto exchanges have also been found involved in money laundering.&#8221; The minister explained that as of Dec. 14:</p>
<blockquote><p>Proceeds of crime amounting to Rs. 907.48 crores have been attached/seized, three persons have been arrested and four Prosecution Complaints have been filed before the Special Court, PMLA, in these cases.</p></blockquote>

<p>Furthermore, under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA), assets amounting to Rs. 289.68 crores ($35,046,152) have been seized. In addition, one Show Cause Notice has also been issued to Zanmai Labs, which operates crypto exchange Wazirx, and its director under FEMA for transactions involving crypto assets worth Rs. 2,790.74 crores.</p>
<p>The minister added that 12 cryptocurrency exchanges have been investigated for evading Goods and Services Tax (GST). So far, 110.97 crore rupees, including interest and penalties, have been recovered. Moreover, eight cases are under further investigation and four cases have been closed. He provided Lok Sabha with the table below:</p>

<p>Chaudhary also clarified:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, crypto assets are unregulated in India. The government does not register crypto exchanges.</p></blockquote>
<p>India&#8217;s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, said in October that the government plans to discuss crypto regulation with the G20 countries to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/india-to-discuss-crypto-during-g20-presidency-to-establish-tech-driven-regulatory-framework-says-finance-minister/">establish</a> &#8220;a technology-driven regulatory framework&#8221; for crypto. Ajay Seth, India&#8217;s economic affairs secretary, said last week that the G20 nations aim to build a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/g20-countries-to-build-crypto-policy-consensus-for-better-global-regulation/">policy consensus on crypto</a> assets for better global regulation. Last month, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Sitharaman <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-treasury-secretary-and-indian-finance-minister-discuss-crypto-regulation/">discussed</a> crypto regulation during the ninth India-U.S. Economic and Financial Partnership meeting.</p>

As the billionaire seeks a new CEO to run the social media platform, privacy advocate Edward Snowden threw his name in the hat, stating that he takes payment in bitcoin. &#8220;The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive,&#8221; Musk clarified.</strong></p>
<h2>Elon Musk Discusses Finding New Twitter CEO</h2>
<p>Elon Musk set up a poll on Twitter over the weekend asking his 122.3 million followers whether he should step down as head of the social media platform. The billionaire added that he will abide by the results of the poll, which ended with 57.5% of over 17.5 million respondents wanting him to step down.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon-poll.jpg?X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Credential=AKIAYIWLWC3GPQWL5SMB%2F20221219%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Date=20221219T191540Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Signature=aed3f33aec5579a54adc4a481eb3ad8c587c256dbdad415e6f7ca8a31266b8eb"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-564814 aligncenter" title="Elon Musk Promises to Step Down as Head of Twitter — Edward Snowden Throws His Name in the Hat for CEO" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon-poll.jpg" alt="Elon Musk Promises to Step Down as Head of Twitter — Edward Snowden Throws His Name in the Hat for CEO" width="923" height="422" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon-poll-300x137.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon-poll-768x351.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/elon-poll.jpg 923w" sizes="(max-width: 923px) 100vw, 923px" /></a></p>
<p>Responding to a comment about him having a new CEO picked out already and that he will retire to being chairman of the Twitter board, Musk clarified: &#8220;No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor.&#8221; In another tweet, the Tesla chief explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is not finding a CEO, the question is finding a CEO who can keep Twitter alive.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many people urged Musk not to quit. &#8220;If Elon Musk steps down from Twitter, I will close my account. He’s why I opened it in the first place,&#8221; one exclaimed. &#8220;The crowd chose to crucify Jesus too, remember that Elon Musk. The crowd is not always right. Leaders LEAD, they don’t bow!&#8221; another told the billionaire. &#8220;Stand up for free speech. The First Amendment needs you,&#8221; a third user emphasized.</p>
<p>In November, Musk said in court that he did not want to be the CEO of Twitter, stating: &#8220;I expect to reduce my time at Twitter and find somebody else to run Twitter over time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Comments from people indicating that they could serve as the new Twitter CEO also flooded Musk&#8217;s tweet. Among those who responded was whistleblower Edward Snowden, a free speech and privacy advocate who has been living in exile in Russia after he exposed a National Security Agency (NSA) spying program affecting millions of Americans in 2013. He wrote: &#8220;I take payment in bitcoin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Replying to a question about whether he is &#8220;strong enough to be despised&#8221; as the CEO of Twitter, noting that Musk&#8217;s main problem is that he is &#8220;being steered by right-wing crazies away from what he wanted Twitter 2.0 to be,&#8221; Snowden wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, I think I&#8217;ve weathered a little criticism in the past.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people complained that they did not see Musk&#8217;s poll in time to vote. Many users suspect that most voters were bots. &#8220;This poll is not fair, I didn&#8217;t even see it till the last day because this time of the year, like me, most people are busy getting ready for the holidays and haven&#8217;t been able to even log in, and probably most of the votes on this poll are from made up Dem accounts!&#8221; one user stressed.</p>
<p>Kim Dotcom told Musk: &#8220;It&#8217;s unwise to run a poll like this when you are now deep state enemy #1. They have the biggest bot army on Twitter. They have 100k &#8216;analysts&#8217; with 30-40 accounts all voting against you. Let&#8217;s clean up and then run this poll again. The majority has faith in you.&#8221;</p>

Since the economic collapse in 2019, Lebanon&#8217;s banks froze Lebanese bank accounts, and a number of branches have remained closed indefinitely. The deprivation of wealth has caused a few impoverished Lebanese to demand their savings at gunpoint but so far, even these tactics have left most residents walking away or arrested penniless.</strong></p>
<h2>Lebanon&#8217;s Banks Deal With Protests and Gunpoint Demands From People Who Want Their Savings Back</h2>
<p>In August 2019, it became apparent to the world that Lebanon was suffering from a liquidity crisis, and there have been many reports that say <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/975026645">financial coverups</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/economy-financial-markets-ap-top-news-international-news-lebanon-a37836f1f39f40028710c2ad226a7760">U.S. sanctions</a> put Lebanon’s economy in a vice grip. It has been reported that by late 2018, a handful of Lebanese commercial banks <a href="https://som.yale.edu/blog/part-ii-of-crisis-in-lebanon-buildup-of-interrelated-challenges">froze</a> people’s accounts and by the first week of March 2020, Lebanon <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51785690">said</a> it would default on its Eurobond debt.</p>
<p>The country started seeking out restructuring agreements, and Lebanon’s lira exchange rate diverged significantly from the black market rate. A <a href="https://johnnyafrica.com/exchange-money-black-market-lebanon/">report</a> published in August 2022 details that the “black market rate is what the currency is actually worth now.” In June 2022, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lebanon-inflation-rate-surges-to-211-economist-steve-hanke-recommends-a-currency-board/">reported</a> on Lebanon’s inflation rate surging to 211% which highlighted the economist Steve Hanke, who said the country should leverage a currency board.</p>

<p>On Dec. 17, NPR columnist Ruth Sherlock <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/17/1143142512/lebanon-economy-bank-robbery-savings">described</a> how poverty-stricken Lebanese have been outside of banks protesting in order to get access to their own savings accounts. In Tripoli, Lebanon at an IBL Bank branch, Sherlock said a 53-year-old woman named Zahra Khaled sat in a wheelchair and would not leave the bank until the staff gave up her life savings. Khaled commented that the bank froze “tens of thousands of dollars,” Sherlock says in her report.</p>
<p>Sherlock further details that Khaled’s protest is “one of the milder tactics” and some are using either real or toy guns to get their money back. The NPR reporter does note that some Lebanese who resort to this tactic only want “what they are owed.” Countless <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/sep/16/spate-of-lebanese-bank-holdups-continues-amid-capital-controls">reports</a>, littered all over the internet, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/asia/lebanon-banks-shut-holdups-intl/index.html">confirm</a> Sherlock’s account that says Lebanese bank accounts have been frozen since 2019, since the onset of Lebanon’s economic collapse. In 2020, angry depositors and protests got so bad that the commercial banks <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneFerguson5/status/1260453979361816577?s=20&amp;t=FJTv7gy2TQMURenNFQOayw">armored</a> the fronts of specific branch buildings with <a href="https://twitter.com/HermanvanUum/status/1260252143073837057?s=20&amp;t=mVCTGLSyQNCvmMMrxTaX3A">steel and cement walls</a>.</p>
<p>Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/armed-man-detained-after-holding-up-south-lebanon-bank-access-own-savings-2022-09-16/">reported</a> in Sept. 2022 that “bank holdups snowball in Lebanon as depositors demand their own money,” as these types of acts have become a normal occurrence in the country. Reuters elaborated that five depositors held up banks in order to access their own funds and some depositors managed to get around $60K, while some people were taken into custody. In Nov. 2022, Al Jazeera <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211122150119/https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/11/1/lebanons-banks-reopen-after-two-week-closure">detailed</a> that banks in Lebanon reopened for two weeks. “I’ve been waiting to cash a cheque for more than two weeks,” a Lebanese photographer told Al Jazeera.</p>

<p>Sherlock’s report specified that Khaled negotiated with the bank’s staff for hours but eventually the staff left and Lebanese police known as the Internal Security Forces (ISF) escorted Khaled out, without any of her funds. Lebanese depositors have had issues and have held protests at banks like Bank Audi, IBL Bank, Blom Bank, BLC Bank, Bank of Beirut, Fransabank, and Byblos Bank. On Dec. 16, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-court-decision-paves-way-depositor-case-against-lebanese-bank-2022-12-16/">reported</a> that a U.S. court of appeals has decided that Lebanese commercial banks can be tried outside Lebanon.</p>

<h2>Mike McGlone Believes a Crypto &#x2018;Warm Spell&#x2019; Is in the Cards, Suggests Bitcoin Will Resume Its Climb in Value When the &#x2018;Fed Pivots to Easing&#x2019;</h2>
<p>Mike McGlone is convinced bitcoin has some healing ahead as he recently tweeted about a &#x201C;warm spell&#x201D; on Monday. McGlone&#x2019;s comment details that &#x201C;what was resistance for bitcoin vs. Nasdaq 100 stock index at 1:1 may be transitioning to support.&#x201D; McGlone also shared a chart that he says indicates the &#x201C;crypto price escaping confinement of the stock index level in 4Q20, on the back of unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Right now, McGlone says what&#x2019;s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto&#x2019;s history is &#x201C;its declining relative risk vs. the stock index.&#x201D; &#x201C;At 2x,&#x201D; the market strategist continues, &#x201C;Bitcoin&#x2019;s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021.&#x201D; Bloomberg&#x2019;s senior commodity analyst added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Next year may be about how much lower global economies fall. Risk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral.</p></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Bitcoin is down more than 75% lower than the crypto asset&#x2019;s all-time high (ATH) reached on Nov. 10, 2021, at $69,044 per unit. Over the last 14 days, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has slid 2.3% lower against the U.S. dollar and since the start of Nov. 2022, following the FTX collapse, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has dropped 16.5% against the greenback. Bitcoin&#x2019;s market capitalization is around $322 billion, which represents 38.2% of the $843 billion crypto economy.</p>

<p>McGlone suggests bitcoin&#x2019;s warm spell, however, won&#x2019;t come to fruition until the U.S. Federal Reserve pivots toward monetary easing. &#x201C;A warm spell ahead,&#x201D; McGlone added. &#x201C;Bitcoin Crosses vs. Propensity to Outperform &#x2013; The world&#x2019;s benchmark digital asset has taken a beating in 2022 with most others, but bitcoin appears poised to resume its inclination to outperform. When the Fed pivots to easing,&#x201D; McGlone&#x2019;s tweet concludes.</p>

Shiba Inu supporters believe the Shibarium launch is imminent as a number of community members have been sharing animated images of countdown clocks on social media. </strong></p>
<h2>Meme Token Project Shiba Inu Hints at Launching L2 Scaling Application Shibarium</h2>
<p>On Dec. 19, 2022, the meme token shiba inu (SHIB) increased by roughly 2.3% against the U.S. dollar amid a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=Shibarium&amp;src=typed_query">great number of rumors</a> that say the layer two (L2) project Shibarium is on its way. Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shibs-shibarium-public-beta-is-planned-for-deployment-in-q3/">reported</a> on the L2 project Shibarium on June 24, 2022, as it was reportedly set to launch by the third quarter.</p>
<p>At that time, it was said that the developers behind the SHIB-centric L2 scaling project launched Shibarium in a private setting during the alpha testnet phase. The developers noted that the hardest part of the software development was the wallet application, but besides that, the results were successful.</p>
<p class="p1"></p>
<p>Then on Dec. 15, the Shiba Inu team member and Discord admin called “Shibakraken” <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibaKraken/status/1603503294428618752?s=20&amp;t=6HBxSYXwvi8cOm7pkJtIRw">tweeted</a> an image of an animated clock. Another community member, “Shib Trophias” also <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibaTrophias/status/1603469506701295616?s=20&amp;t=p_QrS_7V3UuUo3DZVjLIEg">tweeted</a> a different animated image of a clock countdown on the same day. It is suspected that these teases are hinting about the launch of the L2 project Shibarium.</p>
<p>“Can&#8217;t wait for what happens when the clock stops ticking,” one SHIB fan <a href="https://twitter.com/jds_updates/status/1603476406360367104?s=20&amp;t=p_QrS_7V3UuUo3DZVjLIEg">wrote</a> in response to Shib Trophias’ tweet.</p>
<p>The speculation has caused a flurry of social media accounts discussing the probability that Shibarium will launch soon. A SHIB proponent dubbed “Classy” <a href="https://twitter.com/ClassyCrypto_/status/1604564302022823936?s=20&amp;t=JMxDdCR1qG0m2oFqYg8Iag">said</a>: “the BIG Day for SHIB is tomorrow — Many are speculating Shibarium could be coming. This would be MASSIVE. We&#8217;ve been waiting for [what] seems like forever.” On Dec. 17, Shib Trophias updated the community with a tweet and <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibaTrophias/status/1604292552806764544?s=20&amp;t=p_QrS_7V3UuUo3DZVjLIEg">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First thing is to update our main website. It was much needed and this is our first step as we march toward Shibarium&#8217;s Beta launch. The entire website will not launch all at once. Phased rollouts will happen and we&#8217;ll try to make it as smooth as possible. We hope you like it.</p></blockquote>

The announcement details that the acquisition “sets a clear path forward for Voyager customers’ funds to be unlocked as soon as possible.”</strong></p>
<h2>Binance Reveals U.S. Subsidiary to Purchase Voyager Digital&#8217;s Assets for $1B, Company Bid Seeks Bankruptcy Court Approval</h2>
<p>At the end June 2022, it was revealed that Voyager Digital <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-firm-voyager-digital-secures-a-500m-line-of-credit-from-alameda-ventures-to-cope-with-3ac-exposure/">secured</a> a line of credit worth $500 million from Alameda Research, but by July 1, the TSX-listed Voyager <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tsx-listed-voyager-digital-temporarily-suspends-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals/">suspended</a> trading, deposits, and withdrawals. Voyager suffered a significant loss from Three Arrows Capital (3AC), as it was reported that 3AC owed Voyager $655 million.</p>
<p>On July 6, Voyager <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/voyager-files-for-bankruptcy-citing-contagion-in-crypto-markets-three-arrows-capitals-loan-default/">filed</a> for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and it cited 3AC’s loan default. By the end of July, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve Board <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-board-fdic-order-voyager-digital-to-retract-federal-deposit-insurance-claims/">issued a joint letter</a> to Voyager demanding a cease and desist against any FDIC claims Voyager had made or advertised on its website.</p>
<p>Then, before Sam Bankman-Fried’s and FTX’s fall from grace, it was assumed FTX would <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-to-help-voyager-customers-ceo-says-firm-willing-to-deploy-hundreds-of-millions-to-help-crypto-industry/">help the company</a> and purchase Voyager’s assets. But just before the FTX cracks started to show, regulators from the state of Texas and the state’s attorney general <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/texas-securities-regulators-and-attorney-general-object-to-ftx-purchasing-voyager-digital/">objected</a> to FTX purchasing Voyager. Since FTX is now out of the picture, on Dec. 19, 2022, Binance <a href="https://blog.binance.us/voyager-binance-us/">revealed</a> that Binance US has swooped in to purchase Voyager’s assets.</p>
<p>The company stressed that the Binance US bid “sets a clear path forward for Voyager customers’ funds to be unlocked as soon as possible, and returned to them in the form of the cryptocurrencies previously held in their Voyager accounts.”</p>
<p>“Our bid is a reflection of our guiding principle that customers should come first. Our goal is simple: return users their cryptocurrencies on the fastest timeline possible,” Brian Shroder, Binance US’ CEO and president said on Monday. Shroder continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>We hope our selection brings to an end a painful bankruptcy process, which saw customers unfairly dragged into it at no fault of their own. Upon [the] close of the deal, users will be able to seamlessly access their digital assets on the Binance US platform where they will continue to receive future disbursements from the Voyager estate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Binance bid follows the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-speculation-and-rumors-surrounding-binance-exchange-token-bnb-suffers-losses-from-the-alleged-fud/">speculation and rumors</a> that have surrounded the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume. There’s been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-and-crypto-com-publish-proof-of-reserve-audits-conducted-by-global-auditor-mazars-group/">criticism</a> against the company’s proof-of-reserve (POR) efforts, and the accounting firm Mazars <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/accounting-firm-mazars-stops-proof-of-reserve-audits-for-crypto-firms-binance-audit-removed-from-the-web/">removed</a> Binance’s POR audit from the web. A Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-justice-dept-is-split-over-charging-binance-crypto-world-falters-sources-2022-12-12/">report</a> published on Dec. 12, claimed the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been investigating Binance. The following day, more than $3 billion in crypto assets were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amid-withdrawals-binance-ceo-warns-of-bumpy-months-ahead/">withdrawn</a> from Binance’s coffers. The stablecoin BUSD saw its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-busds-supply-shrunk-by-3-24-billion-in-3-days-market-cap-is-down-20-since-last-month/">supply shrink</a> by more than $3 billion in three days after Dec. 13.</p>
<p>Binance said on Dec. 19, that Voyager Digital will “seek bankruptcy court approval to enter into the asset purchase agreement between Voyager Digital LLC and Binance US at a hearing on January 5, 2023.” Similar to FTX’s attempt to purchase Voyager’s assets, there could be an objection to Binance’s request before the Jan. 5 hearing.</p>

<p>Binance further elaborated that Voyager customers should look out for emails from Voyager Digital “regarding next steps soon.” Voyager <a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/voyager-announces-agreement-for-binance-us-to-acquire-its-assets-891555229.html">confirmed the purchase</a> on Monday as well, and noted that the assets would be acquired for $1.022 billion and that includes all of Voyager’s crypto assets. However, that is based on current fair market value, which could very well change in the future. Forbes author Steven Ehrlich explains in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2022/12/19/binanceus-is-not-buying-voyagers-crypto-assets-for-102-billion-heres-whats-really-happening/?sh=333ef7681da7">recent article</a> about Binance&#8217;s bid how this could happen.</p>
<p>In addition to Binance US, INX, Wave Financial, and Crosstower also attempted to bid on Voyager’s remaining assets. “Binance US will make a $10 million good faith deposit and will reimburse Voyager for certain expenses up to a maximum of $15 million,” the announcement details. “Should the deal not close by April 18, 2023 subject to a one-month extension, the agreement allows Voyager to immediately move to return value to customers,” Voyager’s update concludes.</p>

Today&#x2019;s surge comes as the global cryptocurrency market cap was largely unchanged, and is down 0.01% as of writing. Monero was another notable mover to start the week, as it too rose in back-to-back sessions.</strong></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu (SHIB)</h2>
<p>Shiba inu (SHIB) was in the green to start the week, as the meme coin rose for a third consecutive session.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.00000848 on Sunday, SHIB/USD surged to an intraday high of $0.00000875 earlier today.</p>
<p>The move saw the token continue to climb away from last week&#x2019;s low of $0.00000800, which was its weakest point since June.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, SHIB has somewhat retreated from earlier highs, as price uncertainty increased, as the coin edged closer to a key resistance level.</p>
<p>As of writing, shiba inu is trading at $0.000008684, which is below today&#x2019;s top, and below a ceiling of $0.000008800.</p>
<p>This comes as the relative strength index (RSI) collided with, but failed to break out of, its own resistance point at the 43.00 mark.</p>

<h2>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>)</h2>
<p>Monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>) was another notable token to climb on Monday, as it also extended a recent bull run.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD rose for a third straight day to start the week, hitting a high of $145.97 in the process.</p>
<p>Monday&#x2019;s move comes as monero continues to move away from a recent support point of $140.00, which was last hit this past Saturday.</p>

<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s surge, the RSI of 14 days is now hovering around a ceiling at the 53.00 mark, which seems to be an obstacle preventing any further upward moves.</p>
<p>Should this ceiling be broken, the target for <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> bulls will likely be a ceiling of $150.00, which is where the token was trading prior to last week&#x2019;s U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decision.</p>
<p>As of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>/USD is trading at $145.25, which is still 1.42% higher than Sunday&#x2019;s low of $143.00.</p>

The document establishes two different crypto asset classes, including tokenized real assets and stablecoins in one, and other cryptocurrencies in another, discriminating on the collateral and quantity that banks might hold for each one.</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Basel Committee Defines Final Rules for Crypto Exposure</h2>
<p>As banks have stepped into the realm of cryptocurrency services, standards organizations are now defining the ways in which traditional financial institutions will be able to hold crypto. The Basel Committee, which is the standards-setting organization for banks at a worldwide level, has finalized the rules which will define requirements for banks to be allowed to have cryptocurrency exposure, dividing the assets into two different groups.</p>
<p>The first group includes stablecoins and tokenized assets, while the second one includes other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Among the new directives <a href="https://www.bis.org/press/p221216.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Dec. 16 by the institution, is the establishment of the maximum amount of crypto that banks can have. This is recommended to be 1% of their Tier 1 capital, which includes the core assets of such institutions such as reserves and stocks. However, the Basel Committee sets 2% as the maximum amount of crypto that banks will be able to hold.</p>
<p>Stablecoins, which are part of the first group, have to comply with strict rules to be considered as such, and will not be able to be received as collateral.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Evolution of the Framework</h2>
<p>This new group of rules is the result of the third consultation among members of the group, after receiving heavy criticism for some of the decisions adopted as part of the second iteration of this ruleset, that was published on June 30. For example, the most recent version of the document includes cryptocurrency asset hedging, and sets a 100% capital charge for it, while in the earlier version there was no mention of this.</p>
<p>About the importance of this crypto framework, Pablo Hernandez de Cos, chairman of the Basel Committee and Governor of the Bank of Spain, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Committee’s standard on cryptoassets is a further example of our commitment, willingness and ability to act in a globally coordinated way to mitigate emerging financial stability risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In October, the Basel Committee <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/basel-study-shows-worlds-largest-banks-are-exposed-to-9-billion-in-crypto-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">determined</a> that banks around the world were exposed to $9 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets.</p>
<p>The cryptocurrency-related rules will begin to be applied on Jan. 1, 2025, and will be subject to more changes as the committee monitors the behavior of the crypto situation with banks.</p>

The world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency remained below $17,000 on Monday, as price attempted to break out of a key resistance level. Ethereum was below $1,200 on Monday.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) started the week below $17,000, as prices continued to consolidate following a volatile weekend.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $16,671.80 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD rose to a peak of $16,815.39 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Monday&#x2019;s move saw the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency rise above a key resistance level of $16,700.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite this, market sentiment remains volatile, with neither bulls nor bears taking charge of price movement so far today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As can be seen from the chart, the uncertainty comes as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) hovers below a resistance point at the 46.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is currently tracking at 44.16, with a floor of 42.00 seemingly the target for bears. Prices will likely continue to consolidate up until the support or resistance is broken.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also consolidated during Monday&#x2019;s session, with prices remaining below the $1,200 point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD hit an intraday high of $1,192.92 earlier in the day, however bulls were unable to push through the $1,200 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s move comes as prices found an interim floor at $1,170 over the weekend, with bulls using this as a point of entry.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, this floor coincided with the RSI hitting one of its own at 39.00, with price strength moving to rebound.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As of writing, the index is tracking at 42.30, with a ceiling at 44.00 the next visible resistance level.&#13;<br />

The plan aims to entice the creation of a $28.7 billion metaverse industry and construct an ecosystem of several companies integrating this tech as part of its operations by 2025.</strong></p>
<h2>Zhejiang Presents Metaverse Development Plan</h2>
<p>Zhenjiang, a Chinese province, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3203603/zhejiang-province-home-alibaba-eyes-200-billion-yuan-metaverse-industry-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> its metaverse development plan on Dec. 15, aiming to become one of the biggest metaverse hubs in the country. The plan, which contemplates the integration of several active companies into the metaverse, aims to produce a $28.7 billion metaverse industry by 2025.</p>
<p>In the document, the province outlines the actions that it will need to reach its goal, starting in 2023. One of these includes the incubation of 10 industry leaders and 50 companies involved in several of the key technologies related to the metaverse, like AI (artificial intelligence), VR (virtual reality), and even blockchain.</p>
<p>These technologies will be applied to several processes to integrate companies dedicated to product production, industrial design, medicine, and even the government to this metaverse push.</p>
<p>The document mirrors plans already laid out and presented by other Chinese local governments that are also interested in the metaverse as a development element. In June Shanghai <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/shanghai-aims-to-grow-a-52-billion-metaverse-cluster-by-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> its own roadmap to becoming a $52 million metaverse cluster.</p>

<h2>China&#8217;s Metaverse Bet</h2>
<p>China is becoming a hotbed for metaverse projects, as several companies in the country have shown interest in developing related tech. On Sept. 5, local sources <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-chinese-metaverse-industry-raises-780-million-in-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that the metaverse industry in the country had raised $780 million, with the expectation of this number to grow to $5.8 trillion by 2030.</p>
<p>Even the Chinese government is also interested in the development of metaverse-related tech. In November, the Chinese government <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-government-releases-vr-research-plan-including-metaverse-and-odor-simulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> a plan to research virtual reality (VR), in order to advance the technologies to build a more immersive experience. The same plan contemplates the construction of a virtual social world that would allow users to socialize and communicate online.</p>
<p>Chinese software behemoth Tencent has already <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/tencent-launches-extended-reality-unit-to-tackle-the-metaverse-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jumped</a> on the metaverse van, creating its own division dedicated to this area and aiming to employ more than 300 workers in different tasks and projects.</p>
<p>However, the government has criticized the euphoria that is brewing when it comes to metaverse-related investments. State-run newspaper Economic Daily <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/state-run-chinese-newspaper-economic-daily-warns-against-betting-big-on-the-metaverse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an article on Nov. 10 that warns about this, stating that &#8220;the metaverse industry sounds promising, but it may not fit every region. Be wary of feverishly following suit and betting big on it while detached from reality.&#8221;</p>
