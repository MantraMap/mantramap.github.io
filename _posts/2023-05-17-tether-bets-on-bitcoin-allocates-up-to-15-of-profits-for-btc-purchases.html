Tether, the company managing the reserves of the world’s largest stablecoin USDT, has announced a new investment strategy aimed at strengthening its reserves portfolio. Tether will now allocate up to 15% of its net realized operating profits toward purchasing Bitcoin (BTC) regularly. This move is expected to diversify Tether’s reserves, which currently hold approximately $1.5 billion in BTC. Tether’s Q1 2023 Assurance Report highlights the company’s commitment to maintaining a strong shareholder capital cushion while increasing its Bitcoin holdings. The report also notes that Tether takes possession of the private keys associated with all of its Bitcoin holdings, reflecting the company’s philosophy of “not your keys, not your Bitcoin.” Tether To Boost Bitcoin Reserves According to the announcement, under this new approach, Tether will disregard unrealized capital gains generated by price increases and will focus solely on the tangible gains from its operations. The company will consider the difference between the purchase price and net proceeds from the sale or the reimbursed amount in case of a maturing investment.  Related Reading: Cosmos (ATOM) Price Trends Upwards: A Potential Breakout Or Impending Correction?
