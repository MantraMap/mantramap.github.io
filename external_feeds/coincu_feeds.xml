<p>US bankruptcy judge Brendan Shannon approved Bittrex&#8217;s request to apply for a 250 BTC loan from parent company Aquila Holdings, which is currently worth $7 million.</p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto exchange also said it would apply for another loan at a hearing in June, seeking a 450 BTC loan. That means the total value of the two loans could be as high as $19 million. If the Bitcoin price remains stable until next month, the loan will be worth $12.4 million.</p>



<p>While Bittrex says it has the ability to repay all customers in crypto, the loan will help smooth the bankruptcy process.</p>



<p>Prior to the news on May 9, Bittrex&#8217;s US subsidiary <a href="https://news.coincu.com/185982-bittrex-exchange-file-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had filed</a> for bankruptcy and said it planned to return customer funds and cease operations in the US. The company&#8217;s international affiliates will continue to operate cryptocurrency exchanges for customers outside of the United States.</p>

<p>Revealing the reason for filing for bankruptcy, the company said that the US regulatory environment had become untenable after the SEC <a href="https://news.coincu.com/181924-sec-charges-bittrex-violated-securities-law/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> the company for allegedly operating an unregistered stock exchange.</p>



<p>As mentioned earlier, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged the exchange with violating federal securities laws by operating a national stock exchange, broker, and agency clearing at the same time. Bill Shihara, former CEO and Bittrex Global GmbH, was also charged.</p>



<p>Increasingly, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is appearing to clean up the crypto industry. While some investors argue that more regulation will help legitimize the space, others fear that too much regulatory interference could reduce its decentralized appeal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1024" height="731" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-440.png" class="webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image" alt="Uniswap Expects To Charge Liquidity Pool Fee On V2, V3 To Promote Token Holder" decoding="async" style="display: block; margin-bottom: 5px; clear:both;max-width: 100%;" link_thumbnail="" title="Uniswap Expects To Charge Liquidity Pool Fee On V2, V3 To Promote Token Holder 7">
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Uniswap suggests introducing a protocol charge across all Uniswap v3 pools and activating the Uniswap v2 fee switch.</em></li>



<li><em>The goal of this proposal is to introduce a pool fee as well as a method for claiming and selling earned fees.</em></li>



<li><em>The UNI community may determine how to manage, allocate, distribute, or otherwise use the funds accumulated to the treasury in a later proposal.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Members of the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap are debating whether to implement fees for several of its liquidity pools.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-439.png"><img decoding="async" width="2262" height="1140" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-439.png" alt="Uniswap Expects To Charge Liquidity Pool Fee On V2, V3 To Promote Token Holder" class="wp-image-186664" title="Uniswap Expects To Charge Liquidity Pool Fee On V2, V3 To Promote Token Holder 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>The objective of this proposal is to establish a charge for Uniswap pools, a way to claim earned fees and a trustless sale of the fees earned for a UNI-designated asset. Fees on pools would enable the Uniswap protocol to replenish its treasury and reward holders of the system&#8217;s native coin Uniswap (UNI).</p>



<p>Uniswap&#8217;s move to monetize its platform further by charging fees for a substantial portion of its v3 liquidity pools and all of its v2 pools may create a precedent for the larger DeFi ecosystem, in which the DEX has about 70% market share.</p>



<p>The UNI community may determine how to manage, allocate, distribute, or otherwise use the funds accumulated to the treasury in a later proposal.</p>



<p>According to DefiLlama statistics, the total value of v2 is almost $1.17 billion. Meanwhile, the entire value of v3, which is deployed on SushiSwap, Curve, Balance, and PancakeSwap, among other networks, is around $2.86 billion.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time members of the community have requested that fee switches on Uniswap liquidity pools be activated. This summer, a proposal to increase switch costs sparked debate among the DEX community.</p>



<p>Moreover, the v3 Polygon deployment will be the system&#8217;s inaugural deployment. After a successful implementation, a proposal for Ethereum deployment and others as considered required by governance will be made.</p>



<p>The DEX has maintained its position in the DeFi market. It is still the biggest decentralized exchange in the world, with over $4 billion in total locked value (TVL) across all blockchains. For the second time this year, the platform trade volume has <a href="https://news.coincu.com/184064-uniswap-surpassed-coinbase-1-5-trillion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed</a> Coinbase.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Circle has adjusted its USDC-backed reserve portfolio to support short-term US Treasuries, thereby avoiding the possibility of a US debt contract breach.</em></li>



<li><em>The Circle Reserve Fund is managed by BlackRock, which no longer holds Treasuries that mature after the beginning of June.</em></li>



<li><em>Tuesday&#8217;s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling hike failed to break the deadlock, and the United States could be forced into an unprecedented default in three weeks.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle CEO, which issues<a href="https://news.coincu.com/185705-circle-usdc-circulation-decreased/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> USDC stablecoins</a>, Jeremy Allaire, said in an interview that Circle had adjusted its USDC-backed reserve portfolio to support short-term US Treasuries, which avoids the possibility of breaching the US debt contract.

<p>According to information disclosed by the Circle Reserve Fund managed by BlackRock, the bonds currently held by the reserve fund will expire at the latest on May 31. The issuer of the largest stablecoin reported on Wednesday. that they have increased their holdings of US Treasuries to $53 billion. Its Treasury bill holdings have an average maturity of less than 90 days. As of Wednesday, USDC has a market capitalization of around $30 billion, according to CoinGecko.</p>



<p>The vulnerability of Circle&#8217;s reserves to external shocks came into the spotlight in March when USDC temporarily lost its 1-to-1 ratio to the dollar following the news suggested that $3.3 billion in reserves used to support stablecoins were held at the Silicon Valley Bank collapse. Since then, the token has been stable.</p>

<p>It is reported that face-to-face negotiations between US President Joe Biden and top congressional officials over raising the $31.4 trillion debt ceiling on Tuesday failed to break the deadlock, and the United States could be forced into an unprecedented default in three weeks. However, Biden and leading members of Congress will meet again on Friday to continue discussions, and both sides insist that the United States will not default.</p>

<p>Early this morning, a Twitter user said he had received an Arkham alert indicating that the &#8220;US government address transferred 9819 bitcoins&#8221;. This immediately caused the community to shake. The price of BTC at that time plummeted from $28,200 to $26,900.</p>



<p>Previously, the US government sold 9,861 BTC on March 14, earning $ 216 million at that time, with a selling price of around $21,800. The US has to pay the fee when making a sale transaction amounting to more than 215,000 USD.</p>



<p>The above BTC is part of a 50,000 Bitcoin sum confiscated by US authorities from James Zhong, who has admitted to hacking and stealing assets from Silk Road, the notorious Internet black market that they shut down. Notably, the US government intends to liquidate the remaining 41,500 BTC in four more sales in 2023.</p>



<p>However, ZachXBT, data firm Arkham and on-chain detectives confirmed that bitcoins held by the US government had not been transferred. Now, KOL has deleted the related tweets and says that the Arkham warning they received earlier was a personal error flag. This caused the BTC price to have a slight recovery toward the $27,500 region,</p>

<p>Arkham has made a false announcement before. Earlier, on the evening of April 26, the cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization in the world surged sharply, from $28,900 to $30,000. But a few hours later, this on-chain data statistics unit issued a warning about the transactions of transferring nearly $ 28 million in Bitcoin of the Jump Trading investment fund to several major exchanges. Bitcoin slid to 27,235 USD on the Binance exchange.</p>

<p>These claims are classified as &#8220;Admin Priority,&#8221; which could allow the IRS&#8217; claims to take precedence over the claims of other creditors in a bankruptcy case. According to bankruptcy documents, the $20.4 billion claim against Alameda Research LLC is primarily for partnership taxes, while the remaining amount includes millions in withheld income taxes and payroll taxes.</p>



<p>While the IRS has warned crypto investors to pay their taxes for years, this is the first time the agency has pursued a crypto exchange on such a scale. The outcome of this case will have far-reaching implications for the crypto industry. Whether other regulators will follow the IRS&#8217; lead remains to be seen.</p>



<p>FTX filed for bankruptcy in the United States after its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, made a series of large donations to political campaigns. Bankman-Fried has since stated that the donations were unrelated to FTX and that the exchange remains financially sound. </p>

<p>Marathon Digital Holdings, a Bitcoin mining company, has disclosed in a recent filing that it received another subpoena from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to an investigation of a Montana data center that may involve potential violations of securities laws.</p>



<p> Marathon stated that it is cooperating with the SEC. This is the second subpoena the company has received, following one during the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2021, asking to produce documents and communications concerning the Hardin, Montana, data center facility.</p>



<p>In February, the Las Vegas-based company restated its annual report and said it had found accounting errors in financial statements for several quarters after receiving comments from the SEC. Despite these issues, Marathon is one of the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded crypto-mining companies with computing power, with facilities across the US.</p>



<p>The stock of Marathon has been closely correlated with Bitcoin as the company holds a large amount of digital assets on its balance sheet. The shares have been considered a proxy for the cryptocurrency for those who want to get exposure to the coin without holding it directly. The stock has almost tripled this year to around $10 but fell almost 90% in 2022 as crypto prices tumbled.</p>



<p>This latest subpoena from the SEC highlights the regulatory scrutiny faced by crypto companies, especially those involved in mining. It also emphasizes the need for companies in the industry to have robust compliance practices to avoid legal and financial issues.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Some crypto miners are turning to AI.</em></li>



<li><em>Crypto miners generate revenue in part thanks to AI customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI is still a potential to be mined in many areas, it can be stated that the cryptocurrency mining industry has changed as crypto miners have diverged after the Ethereum revolution last September, <em>Bloomberg</em> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-10/ether-crypto-miners-woo-artificial-intelligence-ai-with-gpu-chips-services#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-429.png"><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="800" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-429.png" alt="AI Makes Crypto Mining More Advantageous: Report" class="wp-image-186631" title="AI Makes Crypto Mining More Advantageous: Report 24"></a></figure></div>


<p>Companies that utilized and hosted GPUs, or graphics processing units, saw a significant portion of their once-thriving company disappear against the background of an increasingly challenging crypto environment.</p>



<p>Some cryptocurrency miners are turning to artificial intelligence. Hut 8 reported that after only one year of existence, its HPC division produced over $16.9 million in sales in 2022, fueled in part by AI clients. Hive Blockchain, which spent $66 million on GPUs in early 2021, plans to increase its HPC income to $10 million by 2024.</p>



<p>Hut 8 Chief Executive Officer Jaime Leverton said in an interview:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“If you can reapply some of that investment in the GPU mining infrastructure and convert it to new cards and workloads, it makes sense.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Not all cryptocurrency miners are in a position to profit from the AI hype or the surplus of pricey chips on hand. According to Bitpro Consulting, which provides mining brokerage services, 5% to 15% of current crypto-oriented GPUs may be repurposed for artificial intelligence and related applications like computer vision and generative graphic design.</p>



<p>Core Scientific, the biggest publicly traded Bitcoin miner by processing power, declared bankruptcy last year, and many miners have warned of liquidity problems. Yet, there might be an opportunity for miners to reclaim the $15 billion Bitpro estimates they spent on processors.</p>



<p>Machine learning may infuse much-needed efficiency into various economic sectors, from hospitality to investment banking too, most notably, cryptocurrencies, in addition to boosting intellectual progress.</p>



<p>When crypto and artificial intelligence combine their powers, they will really be a force to be reckoned with. It has the potential to remove friction from the crypto user experience, resulting in a truly smooth end-to-end Web3 trip.</p>



<p>There will be no more clumsy transaction approval procedures or switching between programs. Artificial intelligence will automate the time-consuming background processes of crypto protocols, allowing users to have a one-click experience similar to Amazon&#8217;s.</p>



<p>According to Ethan Vera, chief operations officer of Luxor Technologies Inc., a Bitcoin-miner products and services firm, miners may find it difficult to compete with big data services providers such as Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.</p>



<p>AI customers may already access widely used tools, systems, and support professionals on these platforms. Yet, miners&#8217; skills in energy management may provide them an advantage, considering that artificial intelligence, like crypto mining, requires a lot of energy.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Elon Musk drove the price of Milady NFTs soaring on Wednesday after tweeting a Milady joke.</em></li>



<li><em>Milady NFT sales and the project&#8217;s floor price increased shortly after Musk wrote.</em></li>



<li><em>It&#8217;s not the first time Musk has used Twitter to drive up the price of digital assets.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The crypto world is buzzing over billionaire Elon Musk&#8217;s next action. Instead of discussing Dogecoin (DOGE), Tesla&#8217;s CEO did something entirely different this time: he shared a photograph of an NFT.</strong></h5>

<p>Elon Musk picked Milady, an NFT collection that has appeared in the crypto industry since April 2022 but has also been contentious because of the founder&#8217;s controversy.</p>



<p>Elon Musk posted a meme using the clearly identifiable mascot from the Milady NFT collection on Wednesday, much to the joy of many Milady NFT holders:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“There is no meme, I love you.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After this, the digital collectible&#8217;s floor price climbed to unprecedented heights on the OpenSea marketplace.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://nftpricefloor.com/milady" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> from the major NFT marketplace, the entry-level price for the collection on crypto marketplaces immediately jumped from 3.75 ETH to 5.41 ETH. As of Wednesday afternoon, sales of Milady NFTs had surged by a factor of 900% over the previous twenty-four hours, and the floor price had jumped by over half. The NFT collection&#8217;s transaction volume increased by more than 1500%.</p>

<p>Miladys is a profile-pic (PFP) NFT with 9,823 NFTS with wide-eyed childish features. Despite the harmless picture, the collection has sparked debate due to conspiracy theories and insults published by the project&#8217;s author, known as Charlotte Fang, Charlie Fang, or Charlemagne.</p>



<p>The CEO of Remilia acknowledged being behind an insulting Twitter account and other tweets and quit the enterprise.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Musk has used Twitter to drive up the price of digital assets; the Milady meme is the most recent example. The price of Dogecoin increased over the previous month when Musk altered Twitter&#8217;s official logo to include the famous canine meme portraying a Shiba Inu dog.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Hungary sees no immediate need for a publicly accessible CBDC but is testing the concept to see whether it might assist the unbanked.</em></li>



<li><em>The nation is required to join the eurozone, but it does not seem to be in any hurry to establish a timetable for leaving its currency.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to a top official, Hungary sees no immediate need for a publicly distributed central bank digital currency (CBDC) but is experimenting to see whether one may benefit the unbanked.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424.png"><img decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424.png" alt="Hungary Doesn&#039;t See A CBDC Urgency Right Now" class="wp-image-186620" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424.png 800w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-424-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="Hungary Doesn&#039;t See A CBDC Urgency Right Now 31"></a></figure></div>


<p>Although being a member of the European Union (EU) and so having to adopt the euro, Hungary has shown little urgency in establishing a precise schedule to replace its native currency, the forint.</p>



<p>Around 114 nations were investigating CBDC projects as of the beginning of 2023. The most well-known are the digital yuan, dollar, and euro. Several nations, however, have made tremendous headway with their CBDC programs.</p>



<p>Thailand&#8217;s central bank, for example, collaborated with SCG to undertake a pilot test for its CBDC, while South Korea launched a trial program for its intended CBDC project and then established a legal advisory council to address potential regulatory issues.</p>



<p>Various European authorities, notably the central banks in charge of the pound, euro, and Swedish krona, are actively considering issuing their currencies in digital form. The European Central Bank is expected to decide later this year whether to begin constructing a digital euro, while the Bank of England has said that a digital pound is likely to be required in the future.</p>



<p>With so many nations investigating CBDC projects, it is apparent that this technology is gaining appeal globally.</p>



<p>&#8220;For the moment, we don&#8217;t see any imminent need for large-scale retail CBDC to be introduced&#8221; by ordinary residents and companies, says the report. Hungarian Central Bank Chief Digital Officer Anikó Szombati said at an event held by think tank the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.</p>



<p>She did, however, remark that the Central Bank of Hungary is launching a series of pilot projects to investigate the possibility of issuing a CBDC, with the goal of remaining at the forefront of CBDC research.</p>



<p>Szombati said that while considering the implementation of a CBDC, the key incentive should be a substantial market failure or a strong governmental goal.</p>



<p>She stated that one potential motivation for Hungary might be increased financial inclusion since around 13% of Hungarian individuals do not presently have access to bank accounts.</p>



<p>According to research undertaken by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), nearly 90% of central banks throughout the globe are considering the implementation of a CBDC.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Many alleged inconsistencies were reported by ParaSpace, linking its CEO, founder, and CTO Yubo Ruan to the mishandling of cash totaling 2,909 Ether seized via a white-hat interception.</em></li>



<li><em>Ruan had sole ownership and administration of a part of the protocol monies returned by BlockSec, according to Paraspace.</em></li>



<li><em>Ruan vehemently denied any misconduct.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>This afternoon, the NFT lending agreement ParaSpace disclosed internal disagreements and accusations of asset embezzlement.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-423.png"><img decoding="async" width="909" height="537" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-423.png" alt="ParaSpace Insiders Fierce Controversy About 2,909 Ether Still Unreimbursed" class="wp-image-186615" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-423.png 909w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-423-300x177.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-423-768x454.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-423-750x443.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 909px) 100vw, 909px" title="ParaSpace Insiders Fierce Controversy About 2,909 Ether Still Unreimbursed 34"></a></figure></div>


<p>On May 10, the NFT financialization protocol ParaSpace released a series of alleged anomalies linking its CEO, founder, and CTO Yubo Ruan to the mishandling of money totaling 2,909 Ether retrieved through a white-hat interception on March 18.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear ParaSpace Community,<br><br>TL;DR: There have been no malicious acts from the team. All funds are safe from Yubo, the protocol is under the full control of the team, and we have the financial means to ensure the stability of the platform.<br><br>Today, we are sharing information brought… <a href="https://t.co/58M3U1uLwv" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/58M3U1uLwv</a></p>&mdash; ParaSpace (@ParaSpace_NFT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ParaSpace_NFT/status/1656254657562578944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 10, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Ruan vehemently denied any wrongdoing:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Manufacturing claims with the intent to take over and force me to step down as CEO. This is highly problematic and the legal team has taken action.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>&#8220;There is no misappropriation of public assets,&#8221; Yubo said, but certain members of the team want to overthrow the kingdom!</p>



<p>On its official Twitter account, ParaSpace requests that Ruan &#8220;step down from his roles as CEO and CTO.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jay, the co-founder, was also there at Planet Daily&#8217;s Twitter Space conflict, when the two sides traded fire over the air. Jay also posted via ParaSpace that the creator, Yubo, had embezzled mobile account cash and had contacted them 30 hours before the Twitter Space.</p>



<p>According to the Twitter text, the 2,909 ETH funds recovered after ParaSpace was hacked on March 18 of this year have not been fully returned to ParaSpace, and initially, more than 50% have not been returned, resulting in loopholes in the protocol treasury, and these funds were collected by external wallet management named 0x909…; additionally, any exchange activity by 0x909 has nothing to do with the ParaSpace vault, and all funds are directed to yubo.</p>



<p>As a result, Jay said that the team is working together to assure the agreement&#8217;s multi-signature &#8220;majority security,&#8221; and Yubo&#8217;s multi-signature address authority has been removed. At the moment, all users&#8217; assets are secure, and Yubo can no longer meddle. Jay repeatedly said on Twitter Space, &#8220;Blockchain Don&#8217;t Lie,&#8221; calling on creator Yubo to quit as CEO and give over all remaining assets.</p>



<p>Ruan, on the other side, claims that two former ParaSpace consultants, Thomas Schmidt and Jay Yao, who are now listed as the protocol&#8217;s COO and CBO, respectively, illegally got control of one of the protocol&#8217;s multisig and social media accounts by misrepresenting themselves. Ruan said that upon receiving saved monies from BlockSec, himself, Thomas, Jay, and other key engineering parties agreed to and arranged an organized redeposit mechanism in stages.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;To date, following the schedule, all of the hacker&#8217;s debt has been deposited back into the hacker account. The residual amount has already been paid back in full according to schedule. The mischaracterization by them is absurd, and I have nothing to hide,&#8221; Ruan wrote.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The incident seemed to have transitioned to Rashomon at the conclusion of Twitter Space. Both parties have their own points of view. Jay also requested that the battleground be transferred to ParaSpace&#8217;s official Twitter and that the video camera be opened to allow the team to face each other. The reality is obvious, but the most essential thing for consumers is to promptly limit dangers and remove funds.</p>
