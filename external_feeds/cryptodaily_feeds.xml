			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ilya Lichtenstein admitted to laundering the $4.5B worth of Bitcoin stolen during the 2016 Bitfinex attack; his wife Heather Morgan also pleaded guilty.</p>
Seven-year-long Investigation Comes to an End
<p>According to the CNBC report, resident of New York City Ilya Lichtenstein admitted to being the original hacker behind the 2016 Bitfinex attack in a federal court in Washington, D.C on July 3. On the same day, his wife Heather Morgan also pleaded guilty to the counts of money laundering and conspiracy related to the hack.</p>
<p>The cyberattack deprived Bitfinext of almost 120 BTC, which was worth $70 million at the time and has since risen to the price of $4.5 billion. It took the US Department of Justice (DOJ) seven years to seize the stolen funds and the person responsible for the hack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitfinex diligently worked with the U.S. Department of Justice to identify the perpetrators of the hack, recover the stolen bitcoin, and bring the hackers to justice," said an external spokesperson for Bitfinex. "After seven years, those efforts have come to fruition.&rdquo;</p>

The Bizarre Couple Caught for Money Laundering
<p>Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan, also known as &ldquo;Razzlekhan&rdquo; (the name she uses to publish her comedy rap videos) were arrested on charges of money laundering and theft in connection to the 2016 Bitfinex hack in February 2022. However, the Department of Justice didn&rsquo;t accuse the couple of being the original hackers behind the attack at that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan proclaimed to be a cybercrime expert specializing in social engineering on her LinkedIn, while Lichtenstein had technical background in coding and data analysis. These facts suggested that the couple had enough expertise to pull off the hack, even though many didn&rsquo;t believe it due to the image of eccentric personas the two projected on the Internet.</p>
Most of the Bitfinex Funds Recovered
<p>At the time of Lichtenstein's and Morgan&rsquo;s arrest, the DOJ was able to recover 94,000 BTC linked to the hack, the sum now equivalent to around $3.6 billion. It was discovered that in early 2017, Lichtenstein &ldquo;began to move a portion of the Bitcoin&rdquo; stolen during the Bitfinex attack &ldquo;in a series of small, complex transactions across multiple accounts and platforms.&rdquo; The shuffling process, which involved a large number of transactions, was aimed at obscuring the path of the stolen money.</p>
<p>Last month, the crypto exchange recovered another part of its lost funds: $312,219 in cash and 6.9 in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) worth around $1951 today. Apparently, the United States Department of Homeland Security got control of the sum in 2022 after the culprit&rsquo;s arrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The couple is now facing up to 25 years in prison. Following their arrest in 2022, Netflix announced it might create a series about the case.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the top-10 mining pools offers a comprehensive solution to crises that cryptocurrency miners face in 2023: emcd. Cyberbank &mdash; a cyberbank with a package of services that help miners make more without &lsquo;additional costs&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Mining in 2023, with operational costs&rsquo; growth and a long cryptowinter, is becoming less and less profitable for miners. But one of the largest pools in the world has a solution: launching its own ecosystem aimed specifically at miners and other cryptocurrency users. The cyberbank from the leading pool offers users services from friendly commission-free withdrawal tools to investment tools with up to 12% per annum to raise mining profits.</p>

&lsquo;Miners should make more money, and we know how to make it happen. We&rsquo;re launching a neobank where miners will be able to fully manage their assets in a single app, without additional commissions and other costs.&rsquo;

<p>&nbsp;&mdash; emcd. team</p>
Top-5 Solutions from emcd.
<p>Mining on asics and videocards is no longer the &lsquo;wild west&rsquo; it was at the dawn of crypto. Without pools and growing ecosystems it&rsquo;s harder and harder for miners to manage assets and wait until investments and huge operational costs pay off.</p>
Who are emcd.?
<p>In 5 years, emcd. made the journey from a small startup to a major pool that made it to the top-10 BTC mining pools in the world. 270,000 miners from 120 countries already use the platform.</p>
<p>emcd. decided to choose a comprehensive approach to miners&rsquo; issues, with a whole set of services for digital asset management. And even though mining always involves costs nobody can single-handedly control, emcd. is cutting additional operational costs that hit miners with 5 easy solutions.</p>
One of the lowest comissions on the market
<p>How did a start-up make it to the top-10 BTC mining pools in the world? Easy &mdash; the service has a fixed commission rate of 5%. Hardly any pool in the world is ready to offer its miners to take away 98.5% of their rewards, but emcd. are playing the long game on the market (and so far, judging by volumes and users, they&rsquo;re making the right call).</p>
Secure and user-friendly wallet
<p>Everything a miner makes goes to an internal wallet that is actually easy to use. Without shelling out extra commissions for transfers, users can convert currencies and withdraw money directly to their cards directly in the emcd. app. Moreover, there&rsquo;s no minimal withdrawal amount, which is usually the case for platforms like this &mdash; if you want to withdraw each dollar one by one, nobody&rsquo;s stopping you.&nbsp;</p>
A native P2P platform
<p>One of the biggest headaches miners have is withdrawing their rewards to fiat. And P2P exchanges remain one of the most popular solutions &mdash; even people who still haven&rsquo;t heard of mining in 2023 know how to use them. emcd. Isn&rsquo;t asking miners to ditch their long-trusted tool in favor of the built-in withdrawal features in the wallet, instead, they offer their own P2P platform, once again helping miners bypass unnecessary transfer commissions.</p>
12% per annum on your balance
<p>Mining as a source of income is inevitably tied to issues in the rest of the economy, including unpredictable inflation, especially in regions where mining is an affordable additional income source. To make sure miners&rsquo; profits don&rsquo;t devalue because of economic fluctuations, emcd. offers its own investment tools with rates better than any bank &mdash; 12% per annum.&nbsp;</p>
Live support
<p>No bots &mdash; only actual humans who respond in approximately 15 minutes 24/7. Don&rsquo;t waste time searching for the code phrase that will finally get you to an operator, only to refresh the chat page for hours waiting for a response to urgent questions about your own assets.&nbsp;</p>
Will there be mining in 2023?
<p>And more importantly, is mining profitable in 2023, and what will happen with Bitcoin mining after Bitcoin halving? emcd. has answers for experts and newbies alike. The platform&rsquo;s official Telegram offers all the current updates and news, reviews, and even cryptocurrency mining guides for newbies. Following the project&rsquo;s progress!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Bankrupt cryptocurrency lending platform BlockFi's restructuring plan has taken a step closer to fruition, as the firm announced that its disclosure statement has received conditional approval from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This development is a critical part of the company's mission to maximize recoveries for creditors and expedite the return of cryptocurrencies to clients, said Mark Renzi, BlockFi&rsquo;s chief restructuring officer.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The firm's restructuring plan will allow BlockFi to direct efforts towards recouping funds from other failed businesses such as Alameda Research, FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Emergent, Marex, and Core Scientific. However, the proposed plan has not been devoid of criticism,.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Organizations like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and the Securities and Exchange Commission have voiced concerns about the plan's fairness and its potential to absolve BlockFi and its management from legal responsibility, especially with disputed transactions worth over a billion dollars hanging in the balance.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Under the new plan, BlockFi intends to refund non-wallet funds back to customers, while also creating a "convenience claim class" for customers with claims under $3,000, who would receive a lump sum payout equating to 50% of the total claim. The company will also refrain from clawing back amounts under $250,000 that clients properly transferred from BlockFi interest accounts or BlockFi private client accounts to wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the progress, hurdles remain. FTX and Three Arrows Capital have contested the disclosure statement, citing failure to meet bankruptcy code requirements and provide adewquate information for creditors to evaluate the feasibility of BlockFi's strategy. Meanwhile, the SEC has requested more detailed information on the releases.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">BlockFi's restructuring process comes after allegations of fraud by the company's unsecured creditors and former CEO Zac Prince. The firm was accused of breaking promises to customers by liquidating nearly $240 million in customers' crypto, which forms part of the justification for the move to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee outside of its bankruptcy plan. The deadline for voting on BlockFi's proposed reorganization is slated for September 11.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">Under the new plan, BlockFi intends to refund non-wallet funds back to customers, while also creating a "convenience claim class" for customers with claims under $3,000, who would receive a lump sum payout equating to 50% of the total claim. The company will also refrain from clawing back amounts under $250,000 that clients properly transferred from BlockFi interest accounts or BlockFi private client accounts to wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite the progress, hurdles remain. FTX and Three Arrows Capital have contested the disclosure statement, citing failure to meet bankruptcy code requirements and provide adewquate information for creditors to evaluate the feasibility of BlockFi's strategy. Meanwhile, the SEC has requested more detailed information on the releases.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">BlockFi's restructuring process comes after allegations of fraud by the company's unsecured creditors and former CEO Zac Prince. The firm was accused of breaking promises to customers by liquidating nearly $240 million in customers' crypto, which forms part of the justification for the move to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee outside of its bankruptcy plan. The deadline for voting on BlockFi's proposed reorganization is slated for September 11.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hong Kong's Hashkey Exchange has become the first cryptocurrency platform in the city-state to upgrade its type 1 and type 7 licenses, thus obtaining approval to serve retail customers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This landmark achievement followed what is, by contrast, a fairly simple process facilitated by existing licenses, making Hashkey Exchange the first licensed trading platform in Hong Kong to offer services to retail users. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Hong Kong issued the crypto license to Hashkey just two months after regulators implemented a Virtual Asset Service Provider registration policy. This strategic move is part of a broader push to establish Hong Kong as a competitive global hub for digital asset businesses.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The Hashkey Exchange, part of the broader Hashkey Group which provides cryptocurrency financial services, had prior licenses that enabled it to serve professional investors. The latest upgrade allows it to significantly expand its services and meet the increasing demand from retailk consumers in the city-state, a market that has expanded after Hong Kong enacted legislation designed to foster crypto activity and attract digital asset businesses.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a press statement, Livio Weng, COO of HashKey Group, expressed his excitement at becoming the first licensed trading platform in Hong Kong committed to serving retail users. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"With the establishment of licenced trading platforms and the further clarity of regulatory frameworks in Hong Kong, the industry as a whole will witness increased transparency, leading to a significant boost in investor confidence," the HashKey exec said.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In addition to its licensing upgrade, Hashkey Exchange has undergone a brand revamp to ensure that both professional investors and retail users are offered more secure and convenient virtual asset trading experiences. The exchange prioritizes safety, segregating user funds from platform operations, with 98% stored in cold storage and 2% in hot wallets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To supplement its offering, HashKey Exchange has also launched its over-the-counter (OTC) trading service, HashKey Brokerage, the first compliant OTC trading platform in Hong Kong since the implementation of the new regulatory framework. This new service offers high liquidity bulk trading for investors and high-net-worth clients, providing a secure and reliable channel for fund circulation.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Hong Kong's inaugural licensing of a crypto platform to serve retail customers heralds a new era for the city-state as it positions itself as a preferred location for digital asset businesses.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase will open its Layer-2 blockchain Base to the general public on August 9; the Ethereum bridge is already released.</p>
Base Mainnet Is about to Go Live, Open for Bridging
<p>On August 3, 2023, crypto exchange platform Coinbase announced the date of its Layer-2 blockchain Base launch. After opening it for builders on July 13, Coinbase will make the Base network available to everyone else on August 9, 2023.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since we announced Base, our mission has been clear and consistent: bring the next million builders and billion users onchain,&rdquo; Base creators wrote in the blog post.</p>

<p>Besides, the platform&rsquo;s official bridge for moving tokens between the Base and Ethereum networks starts operating today, a week before the mainnet&rsquo;s public release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Base is built upon the OP software stack and functions as a Layer-2 blockchain. It was created as an alternative way to use Ethereum, which offers lower transaction fees and serves a wider range of customers, including both regular Coinbase users and DeFi participants.</p>
Onchain Summer
<p>To celebrate the release of the long-awaited network, Coinbase is also launching a dedicated month-long festival called &ldquo;Onchain Summer'' which is presented by 50 chosen builders, brands, products, artists, and creators. Every day in August, Coinbase will feature a wide array of onchain activities, related to art, music, gaming, advocacy, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, to get more people involved in the celebration, Coinbase in collaboration with PropHouse, are ready to fund other projects built and created on Base, by offering over 100 ETH in grants.&nbsp;</p>
How to Bridge to Base?&nbsp;
<p>To prepare for Onchain Summer and Base Mainnet, one needs to have a crypto wallet with ETH on Base. Coinbase highlighted wallets that could be bridged to the Layer-2 network: Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow, Safe, Brave, Rabby, Frame, Exodus, Trust Wallet, rhino.fi, and Frontier.</p>
<p>The team has also outlined six easy ways to bridge to Base which include Onchain Summer, Base Bridge, Quests on Coinbase, Galxe, Layer-3, and Mint.fun.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Secret Master Plan
<p>The official Base website states that the team has been building towards this network for the last 10 years, according to the Coinbase secret master plan which consists of four stages. The company has repeatedly claimed that its mission is to create an open financial system for increasing economic freedom around the world. The launch of Base is one of the key steps in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Base is our &ldquo;all in&rdquo; commitment to onchain.</p>
<p>We believe that the onchain platform is the most important builder platform since the internet (&ldquo;online&rdquo;). We believe that the onchain platform should be open source, free to use, and globally available. And we believe that in order to make it really work, we need all hands on deck, working together to scale in a secure, safe, easy-to-use way.&rdquo; states the message on the Base website.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Bridgecoin Capital has unveiled a groundbreaking lending platform that could reshape the landscape of crypto investment. This innovative platform, born from a collaboration between real estate and crypto experts, aims to address the challenge of crypto capital gains taxation by leveraging traditional real estate assets.</p>
<p>In the midst of a cryptocurrency market valued at over $500 billion and a towering real estate market worth more than $3 trillion, Bridgecoin Capital's solution takes aim at the tax implications arising from the $163 billion in crypto gains during the recent market surge. The platform provides a regulated process wherein users can use their crypto holdings as collateral to secure cash loans, bypassing the capital gains tax burden. These borrowed funds are then allocated into real estate investments that yield interest over time.</p>
<p>Joey Billet, Co-Founder and CEO of Bridgecoin, highlighted the significance of the platform, noting that "our approach avoids tokenization, instead opting for borrowing crypto at a flat interest rate, providing stability backed by tangible real estate assets."</p>
<p>Bridgecoin's platform places a strong emphasis on regulatory compliance. Customers undergo a Know Your Customer (KYC) process, and the collateralized loan assures a predictable USD return at the end of the lockup period, maintaining a consistent Annual Percentage Yield (APY) throughout. The launch of this platform intends to steer crypto gains towards more strategic investments while maintaining transparency and adherence to compliance standards.</p>
<p>The Bridgecoin team brings together experts well-versed in both commercial real estate and cryptocurrency sectors. Since 2018, they have championed the integration of blockchain technology into the real estate domain. This initiative serves as a countermeasure against risks associated with non-compliant ventures. It offers crypto investors a channel to direct unrealized gains into tangible real estate assets, unlocking the tax advantages synonymous with debt investment.</p>
<p>This introduction of Bridgecoin Capital's innovative platform marks a significant convergence of cryptocurrency and traditional real estate strengths, opening new avenues for the evolving financial landscape.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">In the dynamic crypto landscape, a potential disruptor has emerged - Tradecurve. Analysts are predicting a viral surge for this newcomer, setting it up as a formidable rival to established players like Huobi Token (HT) and Binance (BNB). This article delves into this developing narrative, exploring the potential reasons behind Tradecurve's predicted rise and what it means for its competition.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Tradecurve (TCRV): The Viral Surge and Its Impact on Huobi Token (HT) and Binance (BNB)
<p class="s6">Signing up for crypto exchanges like Huobi and Binance can be a daunting task. There are endless KYC requirements, complex interfaces, and often long wait times. Enter Tradecurve: a trading platform that removes KYC requirements to enable anonymous transactions.</p>
<p class="s6">All that's required to sign up on Tradecurve is an email address and a crypto deposit. Once signed up, you can get instant exposure to crypto, forex, commodities, and company stocks. Tradecurve really is an all-in-one trading platform.</p>
<p class="s6">Tradecurve is introducing an array of features designed to give traders an edge in the market. Among these is copy trading, enabling traders to emulate the strategies of successful peers. Tradecurve also includes AI-assisted automated trading, staking for passive income, and substantial leverage of up to 500:1.</p>
<p class="s6">Market sentiment towards Tradecurve is overwhelmingly positive, as demonstrated by the successful sale of over 100 million tokens in the fourth phase of the presale. Now in phase 5 for $0.025 per token, market analysts predict that the price of TCRV could surge to well over $1.00 in the next year.</p>
<p class="s6">Some market watchers have even drawn comparisons between the potential growth trajectory of Tradecurve and the rise of Binance. The latter started at a mere $0.11 during its ICO phase and has since ballooned to over $600. If these predictions materialize, early TCRV investors could see significant returns once the token is listed on major exchanges.</p>
Huobi (HT) Faces Regulatory Pressure
<p class="s6">Huobi, a top global cryptocurrency exchange, finds itself in choppy waters as its token price has plunged an alarming 93% to just $2.66. This steep Huobi decline is largely attributable to the crypto winter which has caused the entire digital asset market to suffer.</p>
<p class="s6">However, there is no denying that Huobi is under increasing pressure from regulators, as well as the competition. For instance, Huobi was forced to shut its operations in Malaysia, a market where it had been flourishing.</p>
<p class="s6">An analysis of Huobi's daily trading chart reveals a discernible descending triangle pattern, indicating that Huobi's price is trapped in a downward spiral. Although a reversal might be possible, breaking through the formidable $3.00 resistance level presents a substantial obstacle for the Huobi token.</p>
<p class="s6">Moreover, Tradecurve's debut in crypto trading could effectively take a slice of Huobi's market share away, eating into its profits and further depressing its token price.</p>
Binance (BNB) Loses Ground To Tradecurve (TCRV)
<p class="s6">Navigating through a storm of regulatory scrutiny, Binance finds itself in a precarious position. It is wrestling with the enforcement measures taken by both the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) and the U.S. SEC.</p>
<p class="s6">The Binance token has nosedived from $308 on June 5th to a low of $221 within a few days. This is in the wake of these unsettling developments. The road ahead for Binance appears riddled with obstacles.Although, Binance has managed a modest recovery, trading at $245 at present, t</p>
<p class="s6">The future of Binance now hinges on its ability to navigate these regulatory challenges and regain the trust of its user base. Market analysts are closely watching the critical $200 support level for Binance, a threshold that has marked the lower bound of its trading range for the past year.</p>
<p class="s6">With Tradecurve's arrival, Binance faces a formidable new rival that is expected to siphon off some of its market share. Binance holders are already starting to sell their tokens to take part in the Tradecurve presale, further threatening the drop below $200.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Solv, the investment platform that allows investors to gain exposure to onchain funds, has completed a new funding round of its own. Originally backed by Binance Labs and Blockchain Capital, Solv&rsquo;s latest round attracted participation from a host of leading names including Laser Digital, a subsidiary of Japanese banking titan Nomura Securities.</p>
<p>UOB Venture Management, Mirana Ventures, Emirates Consortium, Matrix Partners, Apollo Capital, HashCIB, Geek Cartel, Bing Ventures, and Bytetrade Labs all participated in the latest round, which arrives off the back of Solv V3 successfully launching. The latest version of the investment platform went live in Q2 of this year and has already recorded more than $100 million in trading volume from over 25,000 users.</p>
Investors Invest in the Investor
<p>Solv is in the business of democratizing access to crypto investments, giving regular users exposure to funds that have been tailored to suit their risk profile and expectations. The platform brings professional asset management to an on-chain environment with the corresponding transparency to show that funds are being utilized for their stated purpose.</p>
<p>The V3 launch of Solv has gone smoothly so far, with investors finding favor with the improved interface and enhanced options for accessing a variety of funds. Investors are presented with a range of choices to suit their preferred strategy starting with the estimated APR and fund term. There&rsquo;s also information on the maturity date, fund size, and status e.g whether it is currently active or closed.</p>
<p>Commenting on the sort of investment opportunities that V3 will be focused on, moving forwards, Solv CEO Ryan Chow said: &ldquo;New DeFi narratives, such as RWA and LSD, are driving speculation around the next iteration of DeFi summer. Solv V3 will focus on the RWA track, and is committed to introducing billions of dollars worth of income-generating assets for the industry through our fund platform, in preparation for the next phase of DeFi mass adoption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Real world assets and liquid staking derivatives are two of the largest verticals currently taking shape under DeFi&rsquo;s broad umbrella. The former entails making stocks, commodities, and real estate as well as forex markets tradable on-chain, complete with the benefits this bestows in terms of information symmetry, 24/7 access, and greater transparency. LSDfi, meanwhile, in which staking derivatives are repurposed elsewhere for yield generation and to secure L2 chains, is fueling much of the DeFi innovation taking place at present.</p>
The Convergence of TradFi and DeFi
<p>Olivier Dang, General Partner of Ventures at the Nomura subsidiary Laser Digital, who participated in Solv&rsquo;s latest round, explains: &ldquo;Solv has built a trustless DeFi platform with a trusted institutional network, integrating brokers, underwriters, market makers, and custodians to create the first fund infrastructure on the blockchain, becoming an important infrastructure that bridges DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ability to unite TradFi and DeFi accounts for why Solv Protocol appears to have had no trouble in filling its funding round. Investors are aware of the upside to startups that can bring legacy money to &ldquo;the future of finance&rdquo; by convincing institutions that on-chain is where the real yield lies. Companies creating the picks and shovels required to facilitate this &ndash; decentralized identities; institutional-grade wallets; better onramps &ndash; will play a key role in bringing this vision into reality. And the projects that invest in them in turn, through funds such as Solv, have the potential to capture a slice of the pie.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An Australian financial regulator has sued the eToro crypto trading platform over &ldquo;volatile&rdquo; trading products.</p>
ASIC Sues eToro&nbsp;
<p>The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has taken legal action against eToro's crypto trading platform, alleging violations of licensing and distribution regulations. The ASIC's move comes after around 20,000 eToro clients lost money while trading Contract for Difference (CFDs) between October 2022 and June 2023, including 77% of retail investor accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFD product or Contract for Difference is a leveraged derivative contract used by customers to speculate on asset value changes. The ASIC has accused eToro of not acting fairly as required by the design, distribution, and license mandate of the product.&nbsp;</p>
ASIC Alleges Shoddy Screening
<p>ASIC has alleged that the platform&rsquo;s screening test was not appropriately thorough and, as a result, effectively useless. The commission also claimed that clients could amend their answers however many times they wished, and the platform also prompted the clients to select favorable answers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the customer base for the CFD product was not defined clearly, it led to retail clients investing in the high-risk product and losing money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consequently, ASIC wants the court to issue declarations and pecuniary penalties against the trading platform.</p>
<p>ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our message to the industry is that CFD target markets should be narrowly defined given the significant risk that retail clients may lose all of their deposited funds.&rdquo;</p>

Binance In Similar Waters
<p>The ASIC is deeply concerned about eToro's alleged wrongdoing, especially given the trading platform's extensive market presence and reputation as a prominent brand expected to adhere to local and international laws.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another prominent name in the industry, Binance, has faced similar charges from the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). While the ASIC pursues eToro, the DOJ is considering federal charges against Binance. The allegations against the largest crypto exchange also involve fraud, but the stakes are higher due to the potential impact on customers.&nbsp;</p>
Legal Action Could Have Consequences
<p>The DOJ is concerned about a potential run-on effect that could harm Binance customers, similar to what happened with the FTX exchange when its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, faced legal issues.</p>
<p>The ASIC's legal action against eToro reflects its strict stance on targeting markets for CFD products. The commission is determined to protect retail investors from significant financial harm. Conversely, the DOJ's approach to Binance is influenced by considerations of customer welfare and potential repercussions on the market. The outcome of Binance's case remains uncertain, pending confirmation from the DOJ.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Identity and financial public network, Worldcoin has revealed plans to allow companies and governments everywhere to use its ID system.&nbsp;</p>
Worldcoin Growing Worldwide
<p>According to Ricardo Macieira, the general manager for Europe at Tools For Humanity (the San Francisco and Berlin-based company behind Worldcoin), the company will allow more users worldwide to sign up for its ID system. The company requires users to provide iris scans to obtain a digital ID and, in some regions, receive free cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also allow other organizations and governments worldwide to use its iris-scanning and identity-verifying technology. With a recent funding round that raised $115 million from venture capital investors like Blockchain Capital, a16z crypto, Bain Capital Crypto, and Distributed Global, Worldcoin plans to continue its expansion into Europe, Latin America, Africa, and other receptive regions.</p>
Enabling Third-Party Use
<p>In the future, Worldcoin intends to open-source the technology behind its iris-scanning orb, allowing others to benefit. Companies could pay to use Worldcoin's digital identity system, enabling secure and privacy-conscious applications.</p>
<p>This technology's various potential use cases highlight the need for a global identity and financial public network. Worldcoin's website outlines potential applications for its technology, such as distinguishing between humans and artificial intelligence, facilitating global democratic processes, and paving a path toward universal basic income. However, the realization of these outcomes is not guaranteed.</p>
Privacy Concerns
<p>Despite Worldcoin's claims of being "completely private," regulators and privacy advocates remain concerned about the data collection practices. The Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision initiated an investigation in November 2022 due to concerns about the large-scale processing of sensitive data. French regulator CNIL is also investigating Worldcoin. Furthermore, it has been suspended by the Kenyan government, citing privacy and security concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite concerns from privacy campaigners, Worldcoin claims that 2.2 million users have signed up, with data watchdogs in Britain, France, and Germany investigating the project.</p>
Worldcoin Commits To Privacy Compliance
<p>The Worldcoin Foundation, based in the Cayman Islands, asserts its compliance with all laws governing personal data and pledges cooperation with regulatory bodies to address privacy and data protection concerns.</p>
<p>Worldcoin's future remains uncertain as it navigates regulatory scrutiny and addresses privacy concerns. However, with its ambitious expansion plans and potential applications, the company continues to be a notable player in the evolving landscape of digital identity and cryptocurrency.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market has continued its downward trajectory over the last three weeks. The next big move is imminent.</p>
Exceptionally low volume becalms market
<p>As bitcoin moves sideways and downward the altcoins are hit harder as usual, with around $40 billion having been wiped off of the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum.</p>
<p>A lack of volume still besets the sector, likening this situation to a period of calm before a storm hits. Whether this storm will push the market higher or lower is still to be determined.</p>
<p>The value of the total 3 market cap (all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum) is delicately poised at $340 billion. A further fall to $330 billion is a possibility, especially given that the upwards trend since June has been broken to the downside.&nbsp;</p>
$XRP still coming down after recent surge
<p>A particular altcoin, much in the news of recent times, to have been hit quite hard, is $XRP. $XRP is down 3.2% to $0.66 on the day so far, and this following a 30% descent from the high achieved on the news that $XRP wasn&rsquo;t considered a security when being bought by retail investors on exchanges.</p>
<p>However, $XRP is just above support right now, with the 0.618 Fibonacci for this latest move just below this. If these are broken, $0.58 and $0.50 are good supports further down.</p>
$DOGE triple bottom?
<p>$DOGE is another one investors have their eye on. Following a 55% surge from what could be considered a triple bottom, $DOGE has since retraced to strong support at $0.073. $DOGE is trapped inside a downwards wedge since November 2022 so a break to the upside could happen in the next few months.</p>
The $KAS top in for now?
<p>One of the altcoin success stories over recent months is certainly Kaspa ($KAS). This would-be successor to ethereum has bucked the trend since the latter end of May by surging over 300%. A top may be in for now, but this coin is certainly worth keeping an eye on.</p>
$INJ bearish?&nbsp;

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market has continued its downward trajectory over the last three weeks. The next big move is imminent.</p>
Exceptionally low volume becalms market
<p>As bitcoin moves sideways and downward the altcoins are hit harder as usual, with around $40 billion having been wiped off of the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum.</p>
<p>A lack of volume still besets the sector, likening this situation to a period of calm before a storm hits. Whether this storm will push the market higher or lower is still to be determined.</p>
<p>The value of the total 3 market cap (all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin and ethereum) is delicately poised at $340 billion. A further fall to $330 billion is a possibility, especially given that the upwards trend since June has been broken to the downside.&nbsp;</p>
$XRP still coming down after recent surge
<p>A particular altcoin, much in the news of recent times, to have been hit quite hard, is $XRP. $XRP is down 3.2% to $0.66 on the day so far, and this following a 30% descent from the high achieved on the news that $XRP wasn&rsquo;t considered a security when being bought by retail investors on exchanges.</p>
<p>However, $XRP is just above support right now, with the 0.618 Fibonacci for this latest move just below this. If these are broken, $0.58 and $0.50 are good supports further down.</p>
$DOGE triple bottom?
<p>$DOGE is another one investors have their eye on. Following a 55% surge from what could be considered a triple bottom, $DOGE has since retraced to strong support at $0.073. $DOGE is trapped inside a downwards wedge since November 2022 so a break to the upside could happen in the next few months.</p>
The $KAS top in for now?
<p>One of the altcoin success stories over recent months is certainly Kaspa ($KAS). This would-be successor to ethereum has bucked the trend since the latter end of May by surging over 300%. A top may be in for now, but this coin is certainly worth keeping an eye on.</p>
$INJ bearish?&nbsp;
<p>Injective Protocol ($INJ) is one of the biggest movers to the upside this year, rising as much as 723% since January 1.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Prominent lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to initiate a crackdown on crypto tax evaders and enforce tax reporting guidelines for users in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The United States Congress had mandated new tax rules for crypto traders, but officials have been slow to implement these rules.&nbsp;</p>
Act Against Evaders&nbsp;
<p>According to experts, cryptocurrency brokers have ignored at least half of their tax obligations. Now, a group of prominent Democratic senators has joined Bernie Sanders in demanding federal officials initiate a crackdown to fix what analysts believe is a $50 billion tax gap in the budget caused due to wilful crypto tax evaders. The lawmakers have urged the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Treasury to publish tax reporting guidelines for cryptocurrency brokers and enforce the guidelines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with Bernie Sanders, Democratic Senators Elizabeth Warren, Bob Casey, and Richard Blumenthal have signed a letter warning the heads of the IRS and the Treasury that time was running out to implement the proposed rules. The rules lawmakers were referring to in the letter are the directives that were included in the Senate&rsquo;s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, passed in August 2021. The bill broadened tax reporting requirements for businesses that acted as brokers for cryptocurrencies,&nbsp;</p>
Officials Slow To Implement Rules
<p>The four lawmakers stated that the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act required new reporting requirements when it came to crypto trading. However, officials in the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have not yet created any rules to implement them, despite a deadline set by Congress looming. Many experts have stated that such a delay in drafting tax regulations of such nature is highly unusual. The lawmakers quoted a report by Congress&rsquo;s Joint Committee on Taxation, which stated that failure to address the tax gap due to crypto brokers evading taxes could cost the Treasury $28 billion over the next eight years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nearly two years have passed since the law was enacted, and the implementation deadline is less than six months away&mdash;but Treasury has yet to publish proposed rules. If your agencies fail to implement the new crypto tax reporting rules by December 31, 2023 &mdash; the deadline established by Congress &mdash; you will risk losing an estimated $1.5 billion in tax revenue in 2024. This is an unacceptable outcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawmakers further argued,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Research suggests that crypto tax evaders are cheating the IRS out of at least $50 billion a year&mdash;but the figure may be much higher. Given the chance, tax evaders and the crypto intermediaries willing to aid them will continue to game the system, exploit loopholes, and siphon off billions of dollars a year from the U.S. government. You must not give them that chance.&rdquo;</p>

A Significant Gap&nbsp;
<p>Analysts from Barclays had claimed the $50 billion figure quoted by the lawmakers last year, based on IRS data from 2017. However, they say that the actual figure could be much higher given the jump in activity in the crypto space in recent years. According to analysts, the $50 billion gap accounts for 10% of the national tax gap, which is the money owed in taxes every year but not paid. Furthermore, because of the anonymous nature of crypto exchanges, the Internal Revenue Service faces a daunting task in figuring out where the taxes are not being paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Officials have repeatedly pointed out that the longer it takes to implement rules, the more large crypto traders can avoid paying taxes.&nbsp;</p>
New Rules Could Tackle Offenders&nbsp;
<p>If passed, the new rules implemented by the Treasury Department will require entities such as Coinbase to furnish information about crypto trades. This information would include gains and losses, which would be reported to the IRS. Many experts are of the view that the new rules would give the IRS the much-needed tools to ensure the closure of the tax gap. It would also give the IRS the resources it needs to go after large-scale tax evaders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules have received support from President Joe Biden, who has stated on numerous occasions that crypto loopholes are allowing wealthy crypto investors to hide their revenue from authorities. The new rules will also help the industry, which is already grappling with numerous types of fraud and corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawmakers in question have been highly critical of the crypto space, with Warren being extremely outspoken about the FTX debacle. Warren had also asked Fidelity to shelve its 401(k) Bitcoin plan and alleged that the illegal fentanyl drug trade was being funded using crypto.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Michael Saylor, CEO of Microstrategy, recently said that his company will keep on buying more bitcoin.</p>
<p>In a Bloomberg interview on Wednesday Michael Saylor said that Microstrategy will continue to buy bitcoin on behalf of its shareholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to accumulate as much bitcoin as we can on behalf of our shareholders, and we acquired from cash flows, we bought that last tranche for $48.4 million dollars of company cash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went on to say that Microstrategy would buy as much bitcoin as it possibly could as long as market conditions allowed it. Commenting on the fact that Microstrategy shares were up more than 200% Saylor said that potential share sales would just be used to buy even more bitcoin.</p>
<p>The Microstrategy plan, according to Saylor, is to use all the resources the company has in order to keep on acquiring bitcoin going forward. He remarked that at the same time that bitcoin was up 145%, since three years ago when his company began its strategy, shares in his company had risen 254%. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our strategy is levered long, offer a yield, don&rsquo;t charge a fee, and then actively manage our position and actively manage acquisitions and financings between equity, debt, and cash flows in order to get the best result for our shareholders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the potential of spot Bitcoin ETFs becoming available, Saylor was really bullish, saying that this would enable large hedge funds and sovereigns to enter the space with many $billions of capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the difference between investing in Microstrategy and a spot ETF, Saylor remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a capital structure that would allow for tens of billions of dollars to be invested in bitcoin, so we are a unique instrument, we&rsquo;re that sports car, and the spot ETF has gotta be like the supertanker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the fact that Microstrategy has rallied so much more than bitcoin so far this year Saylor explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bitcoin is the house everybody wants, but it&rsquo;s in a foreign country and you have to pay cash to buy it. It takes about a year and you can&rsquo;t rent it or mortgage it. Microstrategy is that same house in the best neighbourhood with 10,000 acres of ranch land attached to it, and we can generate a yield and you can actually buy it financed by your local bank right? We&rsquo;re a compliant security. So if you&rsquo;re an institutional investor and you&rsquo;re looking for an easy way to get bitcoin exposure that doesn&rsquo;t charge you a fee, that is financeable, that is good collateral, then Microstrategy is pretty compelling right now.</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will always be differentiated from the ETFs because they can never offer leverage, no yield, they have limited hedging options. They are not diversified, and they charge a fee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the report, while officials are mulling action, they are also concerned about the drastic domino effect it could have on the larger crypto market, leading to considerable market instability. According to sources familiar with the matter, Department of Justice officials are concerned that action against Binance could trigger a bank run similar to the one seen with bankrupt exchange FTX. The bank run in the wake of the FTX situation caused thousands of customers to lose their funds, triggering panic in the crypto markets.</p>
<p>Reacting to the news, the crypto markets came under some selling pressure, with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) witnessing drops. BNB also saw a drop of over 3% following the reports but has since recovered, rising by 2%.</p>
A Compromise?
<p>Given the concerns surrounding action against Binance, the Department of Justice is contemplating compromise options such as non-deferred prosecution agreements and large fines. According to sources, such action would minimize harm to consumers while still holding the exchange accountable for its actions. Reports of the Department of Justice contemplating action against Binance gathered steam after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued the cryptocurrency exchange and its billionaire founder Changpeng Zhao.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission brought 13 charges against the exchange, which included operating as an unregulated securities exchange in the United States and commingling investor funds. It has also charged Binance with misleading customers by using a secret market-making firm called Sigma Chain and manipulating trades on Binance&rsquo;s US platform. Additionally, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also brought similar charges against the exchange.</p>
A Potential Black Swan
<p>According to the Q1 2023 crypto industry report, FTX held a 5% market share of the spot crypto trading volumes across the top ten crypto exchanges. The exchange&rsquo;s collapse decimated the crypto markets, with Bitcoin dropping by almost 25% in 2 days. Data from the Block has revealed that in July 2023, Binance held a market share of 47% in spot crypto trading activity. Given that Binance holds a far more dominant position than FTX did, the ramifications for the market in the event of Binance meeting the same fate as FTX would be catastrophic.</p>
<p>FTX collapsed largely due to a bank run due to fears about its balance sheet&rsquo;s strength, which were well-founded in the end as FTX eventually had to halt withdrawals. This is because the exchange did not have enough assets to process withdrawal requests. But is the concern surrounding Binance legitimate? Binance has stated on a number of occasions that it is possible to verify that the exchange holds its user assets in a 1:1 ratio apart from its reserves.</p>
<p>According to its website, the exchange claims that the ratio of bits Bitcoin holdings with respect to customer net balances stands at around 104%. This means that as things stand, even if the Department of Justice brought fraud charges against Binance, the exchange would be able to fulfill all withdrawal requests without any issues. Despite the developments, Changpeng Zhao remained defiant, highlighting the fact that Binance Coin (BNB) was the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.</p>
