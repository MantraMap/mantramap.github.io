<h2>JPMorgan on Institutional Crypto Investing</h2>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management&#8217;s head of institutional portfolio strategy, Jared Gross, discussed crypto and institutional investors&#8217; interest in the asset class on Bloomberg Friday. The senior investment strategist described:</p>
<blockquote><p>As an asset class, crypto is effectively nonexistent for most large institutional investors … The volatility is too high, the lack of an intrinsic return that you can point to makes it very challenging.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gross added that it is &#8220;self-evident&#8221; that bitcoin has not proven itself to be a form of digital gold or haven asset like some have hoped. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most institutional investors probably are breathing a sigh of relief that they didn&#8217;t jump into that market and are probably not going to be doing so anytime soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>The crypto market has declined significantly this year as the Federal Reserve and other major central banks around the world raised interest rates to fight inflation. There have also been collapses and bankruptcies within the sector, including the most recent fallout of crypto exchange FTX.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a growing number of banks and financial institutions are offering crypto products and services to their institutional clients. Investment giant <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/financial-giant-state-street-sees-unwaning-crypto-demand-from-institutional-investors/">State Street</a>, for example, said in September that it sees unwaning demand for crypto assets from institutional investors. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/nasdaq-establishes-crypto-unit-sees-increased-demand-for-digital-assets-among-institutional-investors/">Nasdaq</a> recently established a crypto unit called &#8220;Nasdaq Digital Assets,&#8221; citing increased demand among institutional investors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a survey released in November by crypto exchange Coinbase showed that institutional investors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-institutional-investors-increased-allocations-during-crypto-winter-long-term-price-outlook-positive/">increased their allocations</a> during the crypto winter. The firm emphasized that there is &#8220;a strong signal of the acceptance of crypto as an asset class.&#8221; A study published by financial giant Fidelity in October showed that 74% of institutional investors surveyed <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fidelity-74-of-institutional-investors-surveyed-plan-to-invest-in-digital-assets/">plan to invest in digital assets</a>.</p>

He called investors who own various altcoins idiots and urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to do &#8220;a big sweep&#8221; on the crypto industry.</strong></p>
<h2>Jim Cramer&#8217;s Crypto Warnings</h2>
<p>The host of CNBC&#8217;s Mad Money show, Jim Cramer, has issued more warnings about cryptocurrency. Cramer is a former hedge fund manager who co-founded Thestreet.com, a financial news and literacy website. He said on CNBC Friday:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would not touch crypto in a million years because I wouldn&#8217;t trust the deposit bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>He was then asked whether he is making a distinction between centralized and decentralized platforms. &#8220;They fought regulation. They didn&#8217;t want regulation and you don&#8217;t have regulation,” Cramer replied, indicating that he does not trust any platforms that do not want regulation.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m just saying you are using a lot of blind faith, and I like to have my money at JPMorgan, and I check on Monday to see whether my balance is there. It feels good.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Try getting your money out,” he advised crypto investors, adding that when he had money at a crypto firm: &#8220;It was a fight to get the money out — a fight!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cramer opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that everybody who owns these various coins — you know, solana, litecoin — I do think you are an idiot, okay. I did not go to college to get stupid. These people who own these things should not own them. They shouldn&#8217;t own them.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Jim Cramer Calls on SEC to Do a Big Crypto Sweep</h2>
<p>Cramer also commented on the chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, stating that existing securities laws are adequate for the regulation of the crypto industry. He wants the SEC to &#8220;come on and enforce&#8221; crypto firms.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host added:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think they need to do a big sweep. They have to stop people creating money.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the creation of money by cretins. I don&#8217;t think cretins should create money and then suck people in. These are worse than even the worst Nasdaq stocks,&#8221; Cramer concluded.</p>
<p>The Mad Money host <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-money-jim-cramer-buys-bitcoin-strategy-to-increase-holdings/" target="_self" rel="noopener">used to invest</a> in bitcoin, ether, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/jim-cramer-dumps-bitcoin-china-mining-crackdown-ransomware/" target="_self" rel="noopener">sold</a> all his crypto holdings last year. Cramer has been advising investors to avoid <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-recommends-avoiding-crypto-other-speculative-investments/" target="_self" rel="noopener">investing in speculative assets</a>, including crypto, while the Federal Reserve continues to tighten the economy. Earlier this month, he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mad-moneys-jim-cramer-advises-investors-to-get-out-of-crypto-says-its-never-too-late-to-sell/">advised</a> investors to get out of crypto, emphasizing that it is never too late to exit &#8220;an awful position.&#8221;</p>

The password management company detailed that a breach, committed earlier this year, allowed hackers to obtain a “backup of customer vault data.”</strong></p>
<h2>Lastpass Reveals &#8216;Threat Actor Was Also Able to Copy a Backup of Customer Vault Data&#8217;</h2>
<p>On Dec. 22, 2022, the password management firm Lastpass <a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/2022/12/notice-of-recent-security-incident/">disclosed</a> that an “unknown threat actor” managed to breach the firm’s cloud-based storage environment in or around Aug. 2022. As soon as the news was published, the Lastpass data leak has been a <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=lastpass%20&amp;src=typed_query">topical discussion</a> on social media and forums. A great number of people <a href="https://twitter.com/Cryptopathic/status/1606416137771782151?s=20&amp;t=19SxY03tBVQ6imOzad_qog">believe</a> that Lastpass’ situation “may be worse than they are letting on.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">LastPass attackers now know all websites you have passwords stored for and the blobs, encrypted only by your master password <a href="https://t.co/Wdbt6mWe8C">https://t.co/Wdbt6mWe8C</a> <a href="https://t.co/HldcJ8DYkK">https://t.co/HldcJ8DYkK</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“Based on our investigation to date, we have learned that an unknown threat actor accessed a cloud-based storage environment leveraging information obtained from the incident we previously disclosed in August of 2022,” Lastpass disclosed. The password management company added:</p>
<blockquote><p>The threat actor was also able to copy a backup of customer vault data from the encrypted storage container which is stored in a proprietary binary format that contains both unencrypted data, such as website URLs, as well as fully-encrypted sensitive fields such as website usernames and passwords, secure notes, and form-filled data.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lastpass insists the encrypted fields are secure with 256-bit AES encryption and the info can only be decrypted by leveraging each user’s master password using the firm’s <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/security/zero-knowledge-security">zero-knowledge architecture</a>. “As a reminder, the master password is never known to Lastpass and is not stored or maintained by Lastpass,” the company detailed.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Lastpass&#8217; Security Reassurance Doesn&#8217;t Seem to Convince a Number of Critics</h2>
<p>However, a number of <a href="https://www.reviewgeek.com/140432/the-lastpass-data-breach-just-got-even-worse-again/">reports</a> believe that the situation is worse than Lastpass is letting on. Reviewgeek.com’s Andrew Heinzman stresses in his report to “please, stop using Lastpass.” “Even if you use a strong master password, there’s a chance that hackers will try to phish some information out of you,” Heinzman wrote. The author added:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be clear, Lastpass is still investigating this data breach. And after four months of ‘sorry, it’s worse than we thought,’ customers are rightfully worried that Lastpass doesn’t have all the details. For all we know, things could get even worse. We asked our readers to stop using Lastpass in July 2020.</p></blockquote>

<p>Crypto supporter Udi Wertheimer also <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1606501962526097408?s=20&amp;t=qF0JrIiasIF3onCzjzo7FA">warned</a> people that if they use Lastpass “attackers probably have a copy of your vault.” Wertheimer’s recommendation is the same as Heinzman’s as the digital currency proponent insisted that users should “stop using Lastpass.”</p>
<p>“We don’t know how bad things are,” Wertheimer <a href="https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer/status/1606501968263778304?s=20&amp;t=qF0JrIiasIF3onCzjzo7FA">added</a>. “It’s possible that attackers have ongoing access, so don’t just change your passwords and put them back into Lastpass.” Moreover, a Twitter user who claims to have worked as an engineer for the company seven years ago also noted that Lastpass’ breach situation is a big deal.</p>
<p>“I worked at Lastpass as an engineer a long time ago. 7+ years ago. My 2 cents on the situation,” the individual <a href="https://twitter.com/ejcx_/status/1606428769731878913?s=20&amp;t=19SxY03tBVQ6imOzad_qog">said</a>. “This is the worst breach Lastpass has had. By a lot. The key difference is that customer vaults were accessed this time, which are kept in a completely separate database.”</p>

Another person people are curious about these days is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO Sam Trabucco. The 30-year-old executive left Alameda in Aug. 2022, but since Ellison detailed misconduct happened in 2019, it&#8217;s assumed that Trabucco knows a thing or two about what happened.</strong></p>
<h2>Spotlights Remain on a Few More FTX and Alameda Execs Like Sam Trabucco</h2>
<p>Since Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bahamian-ag-and-prime-minister-announce-sam-bankman-frieds-arrest-in-the-bahamas/">arrested</a> and then later released on bail, attention has been drawn toward executives who have not come forward, or at least not publicly announced they have been cooperating with law enforcement.</p>
<p>So far we know that at least three co-workers have turned on SBF including Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and Ryan Salame. Two other execs <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/3-ftx-execs-have-snitched-on-sbf-now-scrutiny-is-aimed-at-nishad-singh-and-ramnik-arora/">people are curious about</a> include FTX’s former director of engineering, Nishad Singh, and FTX’s former head of product Ramnik Arora.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Caroline Ellison: Stanford degree in Mathematics<br />Sam Trabucco: MIT degree in Mathematics<br />SBF: MIT degree in Physics &amp; Mathematics</p>
<p>These degrees are not easy to get. Make no mistake &#8211; these criminals didn&#39;t &quot;accidentally&quot; forget about $8b. This was methodical, systematic fraud.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Another executive people are scrutinizing is Alameda Research’s ex-co-CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco">Sam Trabucco</a>. The former co-CEO left Alameda in Aug. 2022 and amid the FTX chaos he tweeted two interesting tweets.</p>
<p>On Nov. 6, he retweeted a tweet written by Caroline Ellison that <a href="https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589287457975304193?s=20&amp;t=BIxlUe3taB4tDW9tKYVswA">said</a>: “[Changpeng Zhao] if you&#8217;re looking to minimize the market impact on your FTT sales, Alameda will happily buy it all from you today at $22!” Then on Nov. 8, 2022, he <a href="https://twitter.com/AlamedaTrabucco/status/1590032437501124609?s=20&amp;t=BIxlUe3taB4tDW9tKYVswA">tweeted</a>: “Much love to everyone — I&#8217;m sure the past few days have been dark for many and I hope the road ahead is brighter.”</p>

<p>Since then the ex-Alameda executive has been pretty silent on social media and he hasn&#8217;t spoken with the press. It is uncertain whether or not Trabucco is working with the feds. He has not been named in any of the indictments besides the brief mentions of his association with Alameda.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sam Trabucco and Brett Harrison really got out at the right time.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>People have been speculating on social media and saying that Trabucco is being hunted by law enforcement. “The FBI is now looking for Sam Trabucco, the Former Co-CEO of Alameda Research and Nishad Singh,” the Twitter account called “Wall Street Silver” <a href="https://twitter.com/WallStreetSilv/status/1606438507869880320?s=20&amp;t=dy7Gm9rSNNSHzQSNWOlNxw">said</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m 99% sure Williams is referring to Sam Trabucco (among others) here without naming him when he asks additional co-conspirators to come forward. <a href="https://t.co/CWsNnpOrIl">https://t.co/CWsNnpOrIl</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/11/22/ex-alameda-co-ceo-sam-trabucco-used-poker-blackjack-tricks-to-trade-crypto/">New York Post</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-22/alameda-former-co-ceo-sam-trabucco-used-poker-blackjack-strategies-in-trading?sref=MTy2GeXk">Bloomberg reports</a>, the 30-year-old executive who helped run Alameda up until last summer revealed a number of things on Twitter. For instance, The Post details that Trabucco explained that Alameda helped people “reduce exposure to Okx,” the centralized crypto exchange.</p>
<p>“Not only are we not sellers, we’re HUGE buyers — even though it’s risky — because, in fact, we can take the risk and this trade is GREAT according to what we know — was crucial, and it’s something we’re always aiming to do,” Trabucco said on Twitter.</p>

<p>Before working for Alameda, Trabucco was a trader at Susquehanna International Group. Furthermore, Bloomberg’s report details that Trabucco revealed that he “may or may not be banned from 3 casinos” for counting cards at blackjack tables.</p>
<p>Ellison’s testimony claims that the fraud between FTX and Alameda took place as early as 2019 and Trabucco joined Alameda the same year. In crypto circles, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) graduate is suspected of being aware of financial misconduct if he was the co-CEO for that long and if Ellison’s story is accurate.</p>

<h2>Privacy Economy Loses 55% Against the Greenback, European Union Looks to Ban Anonymizing Cryptos</h2>
<p>Privacy coins are not talked about like they used to be. These days, the hype and discussions surrounding decentralized finance (defi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have eclipsed privacy coin conversations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, during the last 12 months, the privacy coin economy has dropped from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220119234245/https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins">$11.7 billion</a> to today&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/privacy-coins">$5.22 billion</a>. Last January, the top two privacy tokens included monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>) and zcash (ZEC).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-565652 size-full" title="Privacy Coins Take a Beating This Year Losing Over $6 Billion, Anonymity Takes a Back Seat to Defi, NFTs" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5.jpg" alt="Privacy Coins Take a Beating This Year Losing Over $6 Billion, Anonymity Takes a Back Seat to Defi, NFTs" width="1280" height="550" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-300x129.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5-768x330.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/5.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px"></p>
<p>At the time, monero was the largest privacy coin by market cap and still is today. In Jan. 2022, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>&#x2019;s price was around $202.97 per unit and it had a market valuation of around $3.66 billion on Jan. 19, 2022.</p>
<p>Today, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> is exchanging hands for around $142.35 per coin and it has an overall market capitalization of around $2.58 billion. Zcash holds the second-largest privacy coin market valuation this year and in January it was around $1.53 billion.</p>

<p>At the end of Dec. 2022, ZEC&#x2019;s market cap is down to $517 million. Jan. 2022&#x2019;s top five privacy coins by market cap included monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>), zcash (ZEC), secret (SCRT), decred (DCR), and horizen (ZEN).</p>

<p>December 2022 stats show the top five privacy coins include monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>), zcash (ZEC), dash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>), decred (DCR), and beldex (BDX). <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>&#x2019;s and ZEC&#x2019;s market caps equate to roughly $3.1 billion which is 59.4% of the entire privacy coin economy.</p>
<p>In Jan. 2022, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> and ZEC were valued at $5.19 billion and represented only 44.36% of the entire privacy coin economy. Today, the top two privacy coins by market cap have a lot more dominance.</p>

<p>Last month it was <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/15/privacy-enhancing-crypto-coins-could-be-banned-under-leaked-eu-plans/">reported</a> that leaked EU plans could ban privacy coins like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a>, ZEC, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/DASH" target="_blank">DASH</a>. &#x201C;The European Union could ban banks and crypto providers from dealing in privacy-enhancing coins such as zcash, monero, and dash under a leaked draft of a money laundering bill obtained by Coindesk,&#x201D; the publication noted on Nov. 15, 2022.</p>
<p>Government policy decisions and proposed guidelines have caused a number of crypto exchanges worldwide to stop listing privacy coins like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" 312024  target="_blank">XMR</a> and ZEC. The lack of listings gives privacy coins a lot less liquidity which makes them more susceptible to price fluctuations.</p>

Today’s drop saw the token fall for a fourth straight session, as market sentiment shifted bearish. Uniswap was also in the red on Saturday, with price falling for a second consecutive day.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was in the red on Saturday, as prices moved lower for a fourth straight session.</p>
<p>SOL/USD slipped to a low of $11.24 in today’s session, which comes less than a day after the token was trading at $11.95.</p>
<p>Today’s drop saw solana fall to its lowest point since November 22, when price hit a low of $10.94.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, Saturday’s decline came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 34.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently tracking at 31.79, with the next visible point of support at the 29.90 level.</p>
<p>Should the RSI continue to head to this point, it is likely that solana will fall below the $10.94 level, which was last seen four weeks ago.</p>

<h2>Uniswap (UNI)</h2>
<p>Uniswap (UNI) also moved lower to start the weekend, as the token extended a recent bear run.</p>
<p>Following a high of $5.32 on Friday, UNI/USD fell to an intraday low of $5.20 on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>The move led to uniswap landing on its long-term point of support, with bears likely to force a breakout as the weekend matures.</p>

<p>As of writing, the token remains marginally above its $5.20 floor, and is currently trading at $5.22.</p>
<p>Should this floor be broken, a possible target for sellers will possibly be a floor at $4.95, which was last hit in late November.</p>

The global cryptocurrency market cap is down 0.32% as of writing. Ethereum was also higher earlier in the day, with prices nearing the $1,230 level.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) remained under the $17,000 level to start the weekend, as prices continued to consolidate despite earlier gains.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD hit a high of $16,905.22 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes a day after price was at a bottom, at the $16,793.53 mark.</p>
<p>The move saw the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency continue to trade above a key point of support at $16,800.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, earlier gains have somewhat eased, as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) failed to break above a ceiling at 48.00.</p>
<p>The index is currently trading at 46.72, with bulls still attempting to push past the aforementioned point of resistance.</p>
<p>On the other hand, should price strength decline below a floor at 45.00, bitcoin will likely move towards the $16,000 level.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>In addition to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also consolidated to start the weekend, with prices edging closer to a key resistance level.</p>
<p>Following a low of $1,216.34 on Friday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to a peak of $1,227.00 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s move, ethereum once again attempted to break out of a key ceiling at the $1,230 level.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, the breakout did not occur, mainly due to the RSI also remaining below a ceiling of its own at 47.50.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 47.12, with momentum appearing to be bearish as a result of the direction of moving averages (MA).</p>
<p>The 10-day (red) MA extended its downward cross with its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which typically is a sign of price declines.</p>

The event is designed to showcase the innovative asset class that is NFTs, while also educating Rögle fans on how to utilize the blockchain and purchase their favourite player trading cards.</p>
<p>The event, due to take place on December 30th, will feature educational content, a free mint for the first 500 fans, and in-person interaction with cryptocurrency experts &#8211; <i>The Nordic Whales. </i></p>
<p><strong>About The Event</strong></p>
<p>Rögle BK fans were the first fanbase able to mint their favourite players and in-game moments via the Locker <a href="https://lockertoken.io/sports-nft-marketplace/">sports NFT marketplace</a>. The team have been equipped with the technology to mint any NFTs that would potentially be sought-after by fans, with NFTs created with ease through the Locker Token app. In line with the partnership, the event has been planned to help fans make their first steps into blockchain.</p>
<p>The event will be hosted and supported by local natives the <i>Nordic Whales</i>, who are located a mere 20 minutes from the stadium. The AMA enthusiasts are able to provide educational content in both English and Swedish due to their close proximity to the team.</p>
<p>The first 500 fans are in for a treat upon arrival after <a href="http://locker-token.com/rogleclaim/">scanning the event QR code</a>. This will provide them with a free mint, with a further 6500 being minted on the day that will be made available for purchase. The first 500 will be randomized in terms of rarity.</p>
<p><strong>What is Locker Token?</strong></p>
<p>Locker Token is an ecosystem for sports teams and athletes that allows them to futureproof and monetize their respective offerings through blockchain, while connecting fans and the athletes themselves via a unique asset class. Locker is known by its ticker &#8211; $LKT &#8211; and was recently listed on CoinMarketCap after a successful contract migration.</p>
<p>Despite being a relatively new project, the ecosystem features a number of the worlds best Ice Hockey teams and players including; <i>Rögle BK</i>, <i>Manchester Storm</i>, and <i>HC Bolzano</i>. More teams across both Ice Hockey and other sports are in the process of being onboarded, with the end goal being to onboard each respective team&#8217;s fan base to Locker as engaged fans and buyers.</p>
<p>From a token perspective, the <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/price/ethereum">Ethereum price</a> decline of late has dragged the price of $LKT with it due to the closely-connected nature of Locker as an ERC20 token. However, the team has continued to build and create new partnerships despite the market-wide downturn.</p>
<p><strong>500 lucky fans will receive a free mint upon scanning a QR code.</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Rögle BK</strong></p>

The research will continue next year with the regulator planning to make a decision whether to proceed to the realization of the project in the fall of 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>ECB to Develop Rules for Digital Euro Distribution Through Intermediaries</h2>
<p>The eurozone’s central bank has released a second <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/digital_euro/investigation/governance/shared/files/ecb.degov221221_Progress.en.pdf?f91e0b8ff8cbd6654d7e6b071a8f7071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> on the advance of the investigation phase of its project to issue a digital version of the common European currency. The document presents a set of design and distribution options, recently endorsed by its Governing Council, and defines the roles of the ECB and market participants in the digital euro ecosystem.</p>
<p>Just like banknotes today, a digital euro would be a liability on the balance sheet of the Eurosystem, the monetary authority of the eurozone consisting of the ECB and the national central banks of the member states. Therefore, the Eurosystem must be in full control over the digital euro issuance and settlement, the regulator explains.</p>
<p>Supervised intermediaries, such as credit institutions and payment service providers, will distribute the digital euro to end users — individuals, merchants, and businesses — open digital euro wallets, process payments and provide other related services. Conducting know-your-customer and anti-money laundering checks will be part of their responsibilities, too. The ECB also emphasizes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paying in digital euro should always be an option, irrespective of the entity with which end users open digital euro accounts or wallets and of their country of origin.</p></blockquote>

<p>Further, the European Central Bank assures that the design of the digital euro would minimize its involvement in the processing of user data. “The Eurosystem would not be able to infer how much digital euro any individual end user holds nor to infer end users’ payment patterns,” the monetary authority elaborated.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-euro-project-gets-going-as-ecb-launches-investigation-phase/">investigation phase</a> of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brussels-to-put-out-digital-euro-law-shortly-ecbs-lagarde-says/">digital euro</a> project was launched in 2021. The ECB issued its first progress report in September, 2022. Work on a rulebook for the distribution scheme should begin in January. The central bank’s Governing Council will review the results of the research in the fall of 2023 and decide whether to proceed to a realization phase, an announcement detailed.</p>

The bill is expected to set the rules for the extraction and sale of cryptocurrency in Russia amid sanctions limiting the country’s access to global finances and markets.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia’s New Crypto Mining Legislation Is Yet to Be Fully Approved</h2>
<p>Members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">State Duma</a> will review and vote on the draft law designed to legalize cryptocurrency mining in the Russian Federation in 2023, the head of the Financial Market Committee Anatoly Aksakov announced in comments for the crypto section of the business news portal RBC.</p>
<p>The high-ranking lawmaker, who has been closely involved in efforts to regulate Russia’s crypto space, explained that the proposed legislation needs additional approvals. He was likely referring to the reconciliation of the positions of the various regulators involved in the process.</p>
<p>The bill, which was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">submitted</a> to the lower house of Russian parliament in November, introduces amendments to the existing law “On Digital Financial Assets.” The latter went into force in January of 2021 and only partially regulated crypto-related activities.</p>
<p>Mining, for which Russia has certain competitive advantages like low-cost power and a cool climate, has been expanding as an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitriver-to-mine-crypto-using-excess-gas-from-gazprom-nefts-oil-extraction/">industry</a> and spreading as an additional income source for many <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-cracking-down-on-crypto-miners-minting-in-residential-areas/">amateur miners</a>, especially in the country’s energy-rich <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/electricity-consumption-spikes-in-irkutsk-as-more-russians-start-mining-cryptocurrency/">regions</a>.</p>

<p>Throughout this year, Russian government institutions have been mulling over how to expand the current regulatory framework to cover operations with cryptocurrencies. While most officials remain opposed to allowing the free circulation of bitcoin and the like inside Russia, their use in cross-border payments amid financial restrictions imposed over the war in Ukraine has gained significant support. Sanctions have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-sanctions-bitriver-targets-russias-crypto-mining-potential/">affected</a> the mining sector, too.</p>
<p>The mining law was initially rejected by the legal department of the Duma which insisted that the draft should first be coordinated with the Bank of Russia. The central bank, which has maintained a hardline stance on crypto, later <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-russia-backs-crypto-mining-bill-but-insists-minted-coins-should-be-exported/">supported</a> the document under the condition that the minted coins will either be sold abroad or exchanged to fiat only under special legal regimes in Russia.</p>
<p>In mid-December, Aksakov’s committee considered the bill and proposed its adoption on first reading before the end of the fall session. The establishment of the “experimental legal regimes” proposed by the Bank of Russia should be regulated with a separate bill which also had to be filed with the Duma this year. Aksakov added that this piece of legislation needs to be approved as well.</p>
