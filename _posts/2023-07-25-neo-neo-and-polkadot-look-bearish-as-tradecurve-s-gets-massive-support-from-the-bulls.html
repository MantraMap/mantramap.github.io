<p class="s6">As the crypto market is evolving rapidly, investors are looking for stable projects for investments. The market value of Tradecurve (TCRV) is projected to soar by 80x in 2023. On the contrary, Neo (NEO) and Polkadot (DOT) are witnessing an erosion in their investor base. </p>
<p class="s6">Therefore, Tradecurve&rsquo;s presale has become a huge hit from the very first day of its launch due to its stable and growth-bound business roadmap.</p>

Neo (NEO) Launches Neo Compounder
<p class="s6">Neo (NEO) has recently taken measures to expand its universe, and protect its price from falling. The price of Neo (NEO) has been on a free fall for the last few weeks, and has plummeted by 10% in the past 7 days. As a result, the trading price of Neo (NEO) has come down to $10.82, which is about 95% below its peak price of $196.85. </p>
<p class="s6">To break this bearish momentum, Neo (NEO) recently announced that Neo Compounder has been made live. According to the project developers, Neo Compounder will auto-compound users&rsquo; GAS rewards into more NEO tokens. Analysts believe that this development will incentivize users to increase their activity on the Neo (NEO) network. </p>
<p class="s6">This, in turn, can help the Neo (NEO) network register a positive growth rate in the coming weeks. </p>
Polkadot (DOT) Tops GitHub Commit Rankings
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) recently bagged the top spot in GitHub commit rankings. According to data from Santiment, Polkadot was ranked first in the list of the top 20 fastest-developed crypto assets. The top position on the list indicates that the level of development activity on the Polkadot network has been higher than other blockchains. </p>
<p class="s6">As per experts, high development activity can boost investors&rsquo; confidence in the Polkadotnetwork, as it hints about an upcoming surge in the value of DOT tokens. In another event, the social network, MeWe, recently integrated with the Polkadot ecosystem. This can also increase the user base of Polkadot. Currently, Polkadot is trading at $5.91, after suffering a fall of 7% in the last week. </p>
