					<description><![CDATA[Crypto exchange Binance has been the subject of intense regulatory scrutiny over the last few months and BNB has suffered as a result. Even now, as it seems the crypto exchange is beginning to find its footing once more amid regulatory wolves circling, its native token is still under immense selling pressure. This is evidenced by the BNB open interest, which has now skyrocketed to new all-time highs. BNB Open Interest Reaches New All-Time High In an interesting turn of events, BNB shorts are ramping up even at a time when the crypto market seems to be on a recovery trend. According to a Twitter post by analyst Dylan LeClair, this has caused the open interest in the digital asset to rise exponentially. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million Amid Massive Market Recovery The chart shared by LeClair shows that BNB&#8217;s open interest is now sitting at $400 million. This is over four times higher than the previous all-time high for the digital asset which was $50 million back in 2020. And unlike then, the surge in open interest right now is more bearish than it is bullish. Hmmm, some interesting flow in $BNB futures: &#8211; Perpetual futures open interest is seeing new highs as funding rates have gone deeply negative (-200% APR for next funding period) (Chart #1) &#8211; looks as if someone is getting ahead of some bad news flow. &#8211; The last time BNB‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/1B27OkjvPx ‚Äî Dylan LeClair üü† (@DylanLeClair_) July 17, 2023 This current increase has seen funding rates move above negative 200% and yet traders continue to short the altcoin. The fact that traders are choosing this route despite the high cost to do so points to the expectations of a massive crash coming for the digital asset. As LeClair points out, this could mean that the United States Department of Justice (DoJ) is finally leveling charges against the crypto exchange. ‚ÄúAnd people in the know are positioning accordingly.‚Äù Will The Altcoin Survive a DoJ Lawsuit? As already demonstrated by the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) lawsuit against the Binance crypto exchange, a lawsuit from regulators would have an adverse impact on the price of BNB. When the SEC sued the exchange in early June, the price of BNB plummeted by over 20% over a few days period. ¬†BNB price continues to hold above $240 &#124; Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com Given such a response, a lawsuit from the DoJ would be even worse because of its implications. And if this were to happen this week, then another 20% decline from here would see the digital asset lose its footing above $200. Related Reading: Polygon Upgrade Proposal Pushes Price Over 5%, Is It Too Late To Buy? For right now, the price of BNB is still holding up nicely above $240. One reason for this could be the Arkham sale being carried out on the Binance launchpad. As this sale requires BNB for subscriptions to participate, it has provided temporary buy pressure for investors to participate. However, once the sale ends on July 18, this temporary plug would be eliminated and the cryptocurrency will likely fall back to the $230 territory.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is pulling back after a strong finish in the crypto market last week. However, this past Sunday night‚Äôs weekend close was also the close of the 4-week BTCUSD chart, which has potentially confirmed a high timeframe continuation pattern. If the continuation pattern is indeed valid, it could point to 3-6 months of an extended uptrend, making 2023 an extremely bullish year in the end. Here is everything you need to know about the bullish continuation pattern and what it could mean for the crypto market. Bullish Candlestick Continuation Pattern To Light Up Second Half Of 2023 2023 has been an interesting year in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has been mostly bullish, but nothing compared to what we‚Äôve witnessed in the past ‚Äî as recently as 2020. Meanwhile, altcoins have been long suffering an onslaught from the US SEC. This has kept Bitcoin further at bay against the US Dollar, while eating up altcoin capital on the BTC pair. Despite an important week for the industry and BTCUSD setting a new high for the year, Bitcoin lost some momentum and is now trading below $30,000 per coin. However, before the correction happened, the 4-week BTCUSD candle also closed on Sunday night. Related Reading: Perfect Storm: Why Bitcoin &#38; Crypto Are Poised For A Dramatic Recovery The 4-week timeframe is slightly more sensitive than the monthly at between 2 to 3 days less, sometimes offering unique signals from the 1-month. Sunday night‚Äôs close forever marked the chart with the last candle necessary for a completed Rising Three Method pattern. The Rising Three Method is a bullish Japanese candlesticks continuation pattern. It consists of a large white candle, followed by three small-bodied candles in a row. After the period of consolidation, a large white candle closes above the trio of black candles, engulfing them all. The Rising Three Method pattern &#124; BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bitcoin Buyers Make A Statement: Rising Three Method Pattern Completes The pattern shows that after a pause, buyers resume control. By making this statement, bulls could gain control of Bitcoin over the next 3 to 6 months. The reason for the timing, is due to the length of each candle‚Äôs session. After a Japanese candlestick pattern confirms, its expected results should appear within the next 3-5 candlesticks. 3-5 sessions of 4 weeks total, equals roughly 12 to 20 weeks, or around 3-5 months. That timing would take any potential bull rally through the end of the year. For further validation of the fact upside should appear within 3-5 candles after a confirmed signal, we can see that a morning star pattern completed during the first candlestick close of the year. The second candle of the year was a doji, then this bullish continuation pattern formed. All of this combined tells a possible story of a continued bull market for the rest of the calendar year. Related Reading: The One Ingredient Missing From A Full-Bore Bitcoin Bull Run The Japanese candlestick continuation pattern also comes with plenty of confluence through a confirmed bullish crossover of the LMACD.

					<description><![CDATA[Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX), has announced the launch of UniswapX, a permissionless and open-source protocol for trading across automated market makers (AMMs) and other liquidity sources.¬† According to the announcement, UniswapX aims to improve self-custody swapping and grow on-chain trading by offering better prices through the aggregation of liquidity sources, gas-free swapping, protection against maximal extractable value (MEV), and no cost for failed transactions.¬† Uniswap Latest Protocol Launch¬† UniswapX addresses the growing complexity of on-chain routing and the fragmentation of liquidity pools resulting from the increasing number of customized pool designs.¬† The protocol outsources routing complexity to a network of third-party fillers who compete to fill swaps using on-chain liquidity like AMM pools or their private inventory. This allows swappers to use the Uniswap interface without worrying about getting the best price and ensures that transactions are always transparently recorded and settled on-chain. Related Reading: zkSync Unveils Boojum Upgrade: The Ultimate Solution For Scalability And Security? Per the announcement, gas-free swapping is a key feature of UniswapX. Swappers sign a unique off-chain order, which is then submitted on-chain by fillers who pay gas on the swappers&#8217; behalf.¬† This eliminates the need for swappers to pay gas or hold a chain&#8217;s native network token to trade. MEV protection is also provided by UniswapX, which returns MEV that would be left on the table to be captured by an arbitrage transaction to swappers through improved prices. UniswapX also has plans to launch a cross-chain version later this year that combines swapping and bridging into one seamless action.¬† This will provide users with the ability to exchange between different blockchain networks in a seamless and trustless manner. This is made possible through the use of bridges, which are specialized smart contracts that enable the transfer of assets between different blockchain networks. In addition, instead of receiving a bridge-specific token, users can choose which assets to receive on the destination chain.¬† Strong Resistance Causes UNI To Retract After the announcement of the launch of the UniswapX protocol, the price of Uniswap&#8217;s native token, UNI, experienced a surge of around 3%. UNI reached a high of $6.152, a level not seen since April 2023. The excitement generated by the launch of this new protocol led to a surge in demand for UNI, as traders anticipated improved user experience and better prices for on-chain trading. Related Reading: XRP Crosses 1 Million Trades Per Minute Following Court Ruling However, UNI faced a strong resistance line at this same level, causing the token to retrace and lose all the gains generated by the announcement. At present, UNI is trading at $5.738, down by 1.4% in the last 24 hours. Despite this recent dip, UNI has posted significant gains in the 30-day timeframe, with a staggering 28% profit. On the flip side, according to Token Terminal data, Uniswap&#8217;s market cap (circulating) currently stands at $4.76 billion, representing a 28.3% increase over the past 30 days. The market cap (fully diluted) is $5.77 billion, up 26.01% over the same period. Uniswap&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) is currently $3.67 billion, a decrease of 0.54% over the past 30 days. The price fees (P/F) ratio (fully diluted) stands at 17.50x, indicating that the market values Uniswap&#8217;s future earnings potential at a premium. Uniswap&#8217;s trading volume (annualized) is $349.19 billion, representing a decrease of 8.05%. In terms of user activity, Uniswap has had an average of 69.640 daily active users over the past 30 days, representing an increase of 2.7%.¬† Featured image from Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com¬†]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[zkSync, a blockchain network that aims to make digital self-ownership universally accessible, has announced a major cryptographic upgrade to its proof system.¬† The upgrade involves transitioning to a new STARK-based proof system called Boojum, which, according to the announcement, offers world-class proving performance and reduces hardware requirements for decentralization. zkSync Era Moves To Boojum Boojum is a Rust-based arithmetization and constraint library that implements the upgraded version of the ZK circuits for zkSync Era and the ZK Stack. The library offers several compelling properties, including PLONK-style arithmetization. PLONK-style arithmetization refers to the use of PLONK (Permutation-based Linear-based SNARKs for transparent, universal, and upgradable proofs) as the underlying zero-knowledge proof system.¬† PLONK is a relatively new proof system that provides several advantages over previous systems, such as Sonic and Halo. Specifically, PLONK is designed to be more transparent, universal, and upgradeable, making it a good choice for zkSync&#8217;s upgraded proof system. Related Reading: Celsius Is Selling, More Pain For BNB, LINK, And SNX? According to the announcement, the move to a STARK-based proof system represents a dramatic performance improvement and will help ensure low latency for finality and support for increased levels of activity on zkSync Era and other ZK Stack-based systems.¬† The GPU provers used for Boojum require just 16 GB (GygaByte) of RAM, a significant reduction from the hundreds of GBs of RAM needed by prevalent proof systems.¬† By reducing the amount of RAM required to run the GPU provers from hundreds of GBs to just 16 GB, zkSync will be able to use cheaper machines for increased horizontal scalability. This will likely have a positive impact on the cost of using zkSync. This means that more people will be able to participate in the network and contribute to its decentralization, ultimately leading to a healthier and more robust network. Furthermore, to ensure a smooth transition, zkSync is running the new proof system alongside the existing one in a testing phase called mainnet shadow mode.¬† The network is generating and verifying &#8220;shadow proofs&#8221; for Mainnet blocks to further test and optimize the system with real production data from zkSync Era&#8217;s user activity. This testing is being done off-chain to find edge cases and bugs, and to continue reviewing the implementation. zkSync is also open-sourcing the Boojum codebase to allow anyone to use the new proofs and verify them using a command-line interface (CLI) tool.¬† Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Price Momentum Builds As Open Interest Climbs ‚Äì Details The network is confident that Boojum and its commitment to innovation and user-first design are the next steps forward for a more secure, scalable, and efficient zkEVM. However, according to the announcement, the migration to the new proof system will only happen after further audits and security reviews are completed. Overall, the move to Boojum is a significant step towards a future of user-powered, decentralized proof generation. The increased performance and reduced hardware requirements will help zkSync and other ZK Stack-based systems achieve greater scalability and accessibility, making digital self-ownership more accessible to everyone.

<p>zkSync is also open-sourcing the Boojum codebase to allow anyone to use the new proofs and verify them using a command-line interface (CLI) tool.¬†</p>

<p>The network is confident that Boojum and its commitment to innovation and user-first design are the next steps forward for a more secure, scalable, and efficient zkEVM. </p>
<p>However, according to the announcement, the migration to the new proof system will only happen after further audits and security reviews are completed.</p>
<p>Overall, the move to Boojum is a significant step towards a future of user-powered, decentralized proof generation. The increased performance and reduced hardware requirements will help zkSync and other ZK Stack-based systems achieve greater scalability and accessibility, making digital self-ownership more accessible to everyone.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners may have once again been participating in selling recently, something that could lead to the asset declining. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Been Declining In The Last Two Weeks As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the BTC miner reserve has been observing outflows recently. The &#8220;miner reserve&#8221; here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that the miners as a whole are holding in their wallets right now. When the value of this metric goes up, it means that these chain validators are transferring coins into their addresses currently. This kind of trend can be a sign that the miners are accumulating, and hence, can be bullish for the price of the asset. On the other hand, the indicator trending down suggests the miners are taking BTC out of their wallets at the moment. Generally, these investors withdraw coins from their reserve for selling-related purposes, so such a trend can have bearish consequences for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value. In the context of the current discussion, the miner reserve itself isn&#8217;t of interest, but rather its &#8220;rate of change&#8221; (ROC) is. This metric keeps track of the percentage changes in the miner reserve over a specific period. Here, the relevant period is the 14-day one.

Now, below is a chart that shows the trend in the 14-day ROC of the Bitcoin miner reserves over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric seems to have been negative in recent days &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the 14-day ROC of the miner reserve had been green last month as Bitcoin had rallied above the $30,000 level. These positive values of the indicator imply that the miner reserve had been rapidly going up. The timing of these positive ROC values could suggest that the accumulation from the miners might have provided support for the surge in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Remain Low, What Does It Mean For Bitcoin? In the first week of this month, though, the metric turned negative, implying that the miner reserve started to decline. The miners look to have continued to withdraw coins from their wallets since then, as the indicator&#8217;s value has remained red. The Bitcoin price has been struggling in this period, as it hasn&#8217;t been able to mount up any significant moves. It would appear that this selling from the miners (if the withdrawals are indeed happening for selling) might be one of the factors behind the asset stalling in the past couple of weeks. Since the 14-day ROC of the miner reserve has continued to be at notable red values recently, it&#8217;s possible that these chain validators aren&#8217;t letting up their selling just yet. So far, the price has continued to hold on above the $30,000 level, implying that there may be enough demand in the market to absorb any selling from the miners for now. However, if the miners continue to sell into the near future, it&#8217;s possible the asset may buckle and the price could face a drawdown.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the stablecoin exchange deposits have remained low recently. Here&#8217;s what this may mean for Bitcoin. Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Stay Low, While Withdrawals Jump As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the fact that the stablecoin exchange withdrawals have spiked while deposits have stayed low may be slightly alarming for BTC. There are two indicators of relevance here: the &#8220;stablecoin exchange withdrawing transactions&#8221; and the &#8220;stablecoin exchange depositing transactions.&#8221; As their names already imply, these metrics track the total number of withdrawals and deposit transfers, respectively, that investors of the ERC-20 stables are making right now. Generally, investors seek the safety of these fiat-tied tokens whenever they want to escape the volatility associated with the other assets in the sector. Eventually, when these holders think that the prices are right to jump back into the volatile markets, they swap their stables back for their desired cryptocurrency. These investors usually make use of centralized exchanges for this purpose. So, when the exchange withdrawing transactions are high, it can be a sign that holders are exchanging coins like Bitcoin for stablecoins right now. Related Reading: Here‚Äôs What On-Chain Data Reveals About XRP Rally On the other hand, the deposits being high can imply these investors are looking to buy volatile assets using their stables. Naturally, in the former case, Bitcoin and others may feel a bearish effect from the selling, while in the latter case, the prices might see a bullish boost. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the stablecoin exchange withdrawing and depositing transactions over the past couple of years: Looks like only one of these two metrics has had a high value recently &#124; Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the stablecoin exchange depositing transactions metric has been relatively low for a while now. This would suggest that there may not be enough demand for converting stables into other assets right now. From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the last time the indicator spiked was back in March of this year. Following the deposits back then, Bitcoin observed a sharp rebound in its price as the rally saw a revival. The timing of these inflows might mean that it was the buying from these stablecoin holders that had provided the fuel for the BTC surge. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Level: Will A Break Happen? In the graph, the quant has marked other similar past instances as well. It looks like the BTC price generally observes a rise after stablecoin deposits spike, given that the withdrawals are low at the same time. Recently, however, only the stablecoin withdrawals have observed a spike, implying that investors are taking these tokens away from exchanges, likely to hold onto them for extended periods in self-custody. As there aren&#8217;t any deposits happening to counteract this, the BTC price has been struggling recently. If the trend continues and more stablecoin withdrawals continue to take place, it&#8217;s possible that the cryptocurrency could take a hit in the short term.

					<description><![CDATA[Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lender, has started selling its non-Bitcoin and non-Ethereum crypto assets, records on July 17 indicate. According to on-chain data from Lookonchain, Celsius has transferred approximately $23.5 million of various cryptocurrencies, including BNB, ZRX, LINK, BONE, and SNX, to FalconX and OKX, respectively. Different amounts of these tokens were transferred by Celsius, a move that, while it could be positive for creditors, may impact the token valuations of those projects. Celsius Selling Altcoins¬† Lookonchain¬†revealed that Celsius moved $8.5 million worth of LINK, the native currency of Chainlink, a middleware protocol linking on-chain smart contracts to external but verified data. At the same time, it also moved $7.84 million worth of SNX, the native token of Synthetix, a protocol allowing users to trade derivatives called synths, was transferred. Celsius also went on to move $3 million worth of BNB, the coin behind the sprawling Binance ecosystem, $2.26 million worth of 1INCH, the token aggregator, and $1.9 million worth of ZRX, the token behind one of the first decentralized finance platforms, Ox Protocol. The bankrupt lender also moved $709,678 worth of FTT, the token behind the collapsed FTX exchange, to FalconX. In response, FalconX has started¬†depositing these tokens to Binance for selling.

The only token moved to a different exchange was BONE, where Celsius moved $235,000 of the meme token to the popular cryptocurrency exchange, OKX. While OKX caters to retail and institutional investors, FalconX serves institutional investors, offering diverse services, including liquidity provision and risk management. So far, a large tranche of tokens held by Celsius has moved through FalconX. In late June, Judge Martin Glenn of the Southern District of New York¬†allowed Celsius to start converting all their tokens to either Bitcoin or Ethereum, the two currencies that would be allowed to pay back creditors.
