Putin also rejected predictions about the “total collapse” of the Russian economy.</strong></p>
<h2>Russia &#8216;Actively&#8217; Cooperating With BRICS, SCO, ASEAN</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke at the plenary session of the Eurasian Economic Forum on Wednesday. Among the topics he discussed were the state of Russia’s economy, the effects of Western sanctions, and cooperation with major international organizations, including the BRICS bloc and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (<a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCO</a>). The BRICS group comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider the theme of the forum &#8216;Eurasian integration in a multipolar world,'&#8221; Putin described the annual forum of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). The Russian president said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We see that really profound, fundamental changes are taking place in the global arena. More and more states are taking a course towards strengthening national sovereignty, pursuing independent domestic and foreign policies, and adhering to their own development model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noting that these countries support the creation of a new, more just international economic order, Putin detailed that they are committed to constructively influencing global affairs and expanding the network of partnerships that are based on “mutual benefit, respect and consideration of each other&#8217;s interests.”</p>
<p>He added that countries that do not think and act this way are only exacerbating the downward trend of their own development, stating that they are shooting themselves in the foot. Emphasizing the importance of solidarity among countries globally, Putin said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We actively cooperate with major international associations such as BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization [SCO], the Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN], the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC], and multilateral organizations in Latin America and Africa.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Putin Insists Russian Economy Will Not Collapse</h2>
<p>Putin also discussed predictions regarding the potential collapse of the Russian economy. The Wall Street Journal, for example, published an article in March claiming that &#8220;Russia&#8217;s economy is starting to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-economy-is-starting-to-come-undone-431a2878">come undone</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Russian leader opined: “The numbers speak for themselves: despite the large-scale crisis in the global economy and trade, considerable geopolitical risks and uncertainties, the total GDP of the Eurasian Union states for 2022 decreased, but decreased by 1.6 percent.&#8221; He added that some experts &#8220;predicted a completely different scenario, a collapse scenario.” Putin stressed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nothing like this is happening and has not happened and clearly will not happen again.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Let me remind you that both our experts and international experts for Russia already show GDP growth. At first, they talked about 0.7 percent. Let me remind you that in the leading economies of the European Union experts show a minus for the current year. At first, we were talking about plus 0.7%, now they say plus 1.5%, and maybe up to two percent. And that says a lot,” he detailed.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) raised Russia&#8217;s GDP forecast in April to growth of 0.7% from 0.3% but lowered its 2024 forecast to 1.3% from 2.1%. The IMF expects labor shortages and the exodus of Western companies to harm Russia&#8217;s economy.</p>

The IMF chief does not expect the U.S. to default on its debt obligations.</strong></p>
<h2>US Dollar’s Reserve Currency Status Not at Risk, According to IMF</h2>
<p>The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, expressed her confidence Wednesday at the Qatar Economic Forum in Doha, organized by Bloomberg, that the U.S. dollar will maintain its world&#8217;s reserve currency status.</p>
<p>Georgieva explained that despite growing de-dollarization discussions by various countries to decrease their dependence on the USD:</p>
<blockquote><p>We don&#8217;t expect a rapid shift in (dollar) reserves because the reason the dollar is a reserve currency is because of the strength of the U.S. economy and the depth of its capital markets … Don&#8217;t kiss your dollars goodbye just yet.</p></blockquote>
<p>A growing number of countries are ramping up their de-dollarization efforts. The BRICS economic bloc is pushing for the use of national currencies, instead of the USD, and is discussing creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> that will help member nations reduce reliance on the US dollar. The BRICS comprises Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>The proposal of a common currency is expected to be discussed by the BRICS leaders at their <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-set-to-discuss-common-currency-to-challenge-us-dollar-dominance-in-upcoming-summit/">upcoming summit</a>. In addition, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/10-southeast-asian-nations-challenge-dollar-dominance-with-push-for-local-currencies/">10 Southeast Asian countries</a>, members of ASEAN, also recently agreed to encourage the use of national currencies. This week, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/9-asian-countries-discuss-de-dollarization-measures-in-meeting-hosted-by-iran/">nine Asian countries</a> discussed de-dollarization measures in Tehran.</p>

<h2>US Default Unlikely, Says IMF Chief</h2>
<p>Commenting on the U.S. debt crisis, the IMF managing director said she is confident the United States would avoid a default.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-warns-us-could-default-on-its-debt-by-june-1/">Janet Yellen</a> has warned repeatedly that the Treasury may not be able to pay all of the government&#8217;s bills as early as June 1 “if Congress does not raise or suspend the debt limit before that time.” The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) similarly predicted that a U.S. default could occur in the first two weeks of June. Meanwhile, global investment bank <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/treasury-secretary-yellen-insists-us-could-default-on-june-1-goldman-sachs-estimates-real-deadline-is-a-week-later/">Goldman Sachs</a> said that the “real deadline” for a U.S. default is more like June 8-9.</p>
<p>Georgieva opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>History tells us that the U.S. would wrestle with this notion of default &#8230; but come the 11th hour it gets resolved and I have confidence we will see that play again.</p></blockquote>
<p>The IMF, however, recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/imf-warns-of-very-serious-repercussions-if-us-defaults-on-debt-obligations/">warned</a> of “very serious repercussions” on both the American and global economies if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations.</p>

Officials of Maduro&#8217;s government appealed to the London Court of Appeals that the destitution of Juan Guaido, the former interim president, could affect the considerations London makes on access to the gold.</strong></p>
<h2>Venezuela Seeks to Regain Control of Its Gold Stash in UK</h2>
<p>Venezuela is again appealing the decision of the U.K. High Court on the ownership and management of more than $1.8 billion in gold that is currently held in the vaults of the Bank of England. This judicial battle has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/banks-refusal-to-release-1-2b-of-venezuelan-gold-strengthens-the-case-for-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ongoing</a> since January 2019, when the U.K. High Court declined to transfer the gold to the government of Nicolas Maduro, on the basis of the U.K. government&#8217;s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-recognises-juan-guaido-as-interim-president-of-venezuela" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recognition</a> of then interim president Juan Guaido.</p>
<p>Guaido was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disputed-venezuelan-gold-worth-1-8b-in-bank-of-england-vaults-remains-uncertain-after-dissolution-of-interim-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deposed</a> from his position as interim president in December 2022, when the Legislative Assembly, elected back in 2015, voted to disintegrate the interim government and establish a board to protect Venezuelan assets abroad.</p>
<p>This dissolution is key for the appeal presented by Richard Lissack, attorney of the Central Bank of Venezuela&#8217;s board managed by Maduro, who <a href="https://efectococuyo.com/politica/bcv-de-maduro-pide-tener-en-cuenta-destitucion-de-guaido-en-recurso-del-oro-venezolano-en-londres/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged</a> the London court should reconsider its posture due to the new political reality in Venezuela.</p>
<p>To Lissack, the &#8220;One Voice&#8221; doctrine, that determined the recognition of Guaido over Maduro, does not apply now that his government has been dissolved. Now, in his view, the government must recognize the decisions that Venezuelan courts enacted, disregarding the validity of the interim ad-hoc board of the Central Bank of Venezuela.</p>

<h2>Opposition and More Lawsuits</h2>
<p>Andrew Fulton, attorney of the &#8220;ad-hoc&#8221; board of the Central Bank of Venezuela, stated that these new developments don&#8217;t affect the outcome of the earlier decision of the court, given that Guaido was recognized as interim president of Venezuela when it took place.</p>
<p>A letter was <a href="https://twitter.com/planwac/status/1661002444992573442/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> that certifies that the U.K. government recognized and respected the disbandment of Guaido&#8217;s interim government on January 5, effectively changing the consideration of the U.K. government towards Guaido. On this, Fulton <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/spa/venezuela-oro_concluye-el-recurso-de-maduro-al-fallo-judicial-que-daba-a-la-oposici%C3%B3n-acceso-al-oro/48537976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>

Since then, Lido&#x2019;s market dominance has significantly increased over the last 12 months to its current 26.18% share.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Lido&#x2019;s Market Share in Liquid Staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> Derivatives Stands at 73%</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The liquid staking protocol Lido Finance holds a prominent position in the world of DeFi. As of May 25, 2023, there is <a href="https://defillama.com">$46.6 billion locked</a> into defi applications and protocols, with Lido&#x2019;s total value locked (TVL) representing 26.18% of that amount. At the time of writing, 11:45 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, Lido&#x2019;s TVL stands at approximately $12.2 billion, according to metrics from defillama.com.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
According to Lido&#x2019;s <a href="https://lido.fi">website</a>, the current value locked in the protocol is $12.27 billion, with $12.11 billion representing ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>). The remaining portion of value held in Lido originates from networks such as Polkadot, Solana, Polygon, and Kusama. Lido&#x2019;s dominance of 26.18% is significantly greater than last year when the TVL in DeFi amounted to $111.11 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220524145414/https://defillama.com/">Back then</a>, Lido&#x2019;s TVL amounted to $8.28 billion, accounting for 7.45% of the total value locked in DeFi on that day. A year ago, MakerDAO held the position as the most dominant DeFi protocol in terms of TVL, with 8.87% of the DeFi economy&#x2019;s value and $9.86 billion locked. Lido&#x2019;s dominance began to gain momentum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230101205522/https://defillama.com/">at the start of 2023</a>, a time when the TVL in DeFi was merely $38.72 billion.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Archived data indicates that when the TVL in DeFi reached $38.72 billion, Lido&#x2019;s dominance stood at 15.24%. During that period, Lido&#x2019;s TVL amounted to only $5.9 billion. According to statistics from defillama.com, Lido commands a market share of 73.26% in liquid staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> derivatives, representing 9,128,624 locked ether. Out of the total 9.12 million ether, current statistics show that Lido holds 6,687,554 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
During the past 30 days, Lido <a href="https://defillama.com/lsd">experienced</a> an 8.91% change, whereas competitors in the liquid staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> derivative space such as Rocket Pool and Frax Ether saw double-digit gains. Rocket Pool recorded an increase of 32.18%, while Frax witnessed a rise of 42.25% over the past month. Coinbase&#x2019;s liquid staking <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a> derivative stands as the second largest, with 1,128,662 ether locked, but it has experienced a reduction of 1.47% over the same period.&#13;<br />

DeSantis will confront the reigning president Joe Biden in addition to the existing presidential candidates: Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>DeSantis Reveals Presidential Aspirations</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Florida&#x2019;s incumbent Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has set his sights on the presidency, announcing his candidacy for the next U.S. election. Challenging the current Democratic leader, Joe Biden, DeSantis <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1661498079386931206?s=20">revealed</a> his political ambitions during a Twitter Spaces event alongside <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/elon-musk-discusses-creating-ai-giant-to-challenge-google-microsoft-suggests-twitter-and-tesla-could-play-a-role/">Elon Musk</a>. Taking to Twitter, DeSantis further <a href="https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis/status/1661491799393964034?t=JoJrUROG7sJt3AfR8XSyMg&s=19">emphasized</a> his intentions, declaring, &#x201C;I&#x2019;m running for president to lead our great American comeback.&#x201D; The Florida governor also shared a video that says:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>Our border is a disaster. Crime infests our cities. The federal government makes it harder for families to make ends meet. And the president flounders.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Unsurprisingly, DeSantis&#x2019; decision to unveil his presidential aspirations alongside Elon Musk on Twitter Spaces drew its fair share of criticism. To make matters worse, technical hiccups and sudden livestream disruptions plagued the event, rendering parts of the announcement nearly unbearable to endure. Addressing Musk, the determined candidate asserted, &#x201C;American decline is not inevitable, it is a choice, we should choose a new direction &#x2014; a path that will lead to American revitalization.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Republican&#x2019;s Twitter event with Musk follows the footsteps of Democratic contender Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Republican hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, both <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/clash-of-presidential-contenders-bitcoin-gains-prominence-as-2024-us-election-approaches/">announcing</a> their acceptance of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) for campaign contributions. While DeSantis currently does not accept bitcoin, he has expressed positive sentiments toward the technology, setting him apart from Biden and Trump. In fact, he has voiced his support for implementing a Florida-based system that harnesses the potential of cryptocurrency assets for paying state fees on two separate occasions.&#13;<br />

&#13;<br />
At the end of December 2021, DeSantis <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-proposes-creating-a-cryptocurrency-payment-system-for-state-fees/">introduced</a> his &#x201C;Freedom First Budget,&#x201D; outlining plans to establish a dedicated department in Florida for handling state fees using cryptocurrency assets. By March 2022, DeSantis provided an update, expressing his team&#x2019;s efforts in exploring avenues to enable businesses to settle their tax obligations with bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>). At that time, DeSantis <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/florida-governor-ron-desantis-says-state-is-figuring-out-ways-to-allow-businesses-to-pay-taxes-in-bitcoin/">asserted</a>:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#x2019;s a difference between a decentralized digital cryptocurrency like bitcoin and what some are talking about doing at the federal level to convert U.S. dollars into basically a digital currency.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;</p>
<h2>Another Four Years of Biden Could End up Killing Bitcoin, Says DeSantis</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In addition to his comments about bitcoin, the governor of Florida has taken a bold stance by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-ron-desantis-signs-bill-prohibiting-use-of-central-bank-digital-currencies-in-florida/">prohibiting</a> the use of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) within the state. Defending this decision, DeSantis highlighted the potential risks associated with CBDCs, emphasizing concerns about invasions of privacy and centralized control over individuals&#x2019; financial transactions. The legislation enacting Florida&#x2019;s CBDC ban is set to go into effect on July 1, 2023, as outlined in the legislation&#x2019;s summary. <span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Twitter Spaces conversation, DeSantis said that he would fight against a CBDC on the national level if he was president.</span>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">DeSantis promised to protect people&#x2019;s rights to use bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) and he believes another four years of Biden will hurt the leading crypto asset. &#x201C;Bitcoin represents a threat to them,&#x201D; DeSantis said. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re trying to regulate it out of existence. The current regime they have it out for bitcoin. And if it continues for another four years, they&#x2019;ll probably end up killing it.&#x201D; The politician from Florida continued by asserting that America was veering off course and heading down a misguided path.</span>&#13;<br />

This came despite the global cryptocurrency market cap mostly trading lower, falling by 1% as of writing. Polygon also rebounded today.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Tron (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a>) was marginally higher on Thursday, as the token moved back towards a one-year high.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $0.07651 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $0.07819 earlier today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move came as prices rebounded following a drop which took place yesterday, which came as a result of profit taking.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, the bounce occurred as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) found a support point.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This aforementioned floor was at the 70.00 level, which is already deep in overbought territory&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Price strength is now tracking at 70.42, with bears likely to attempt to send the token lower in the coming days.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Polygon (MATIC) was another notable mover on Thursday, as the token also rebounded today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
MATIC/USD hit a peak of $0.8895 earlier in the day, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $0.8591.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of today&#x2019;s surge, MATIC rose by as much as 3%, moving away from a recent floor at $0.8390 in the process&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Earlier gains have somewhat eased however, which comes as the RSI collided with a ceiling at 45.00&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index has since slipped, and as of writing, is tracking at 44.06, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/TRX" 312021  target="_blank">TRX</a> at $0.07758.&#13;<br />

<h2>Silver&#8217;s Value Poised to Surge to $30 per Unit in 6-12 Months, Citigroup Analysts Foresee</h2>
<p>On Thursday, May 25, 2023, the price of silver per ounce lingers just above the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SILVER/">$23 mark</a> after experiencing nearly a 4% decline over the past week. Nevertheless, half-year data reveals that silver has risen 6% against the U.S. dollar. Despite recent setbacks in precious metal valuations, market experts forecast strong performances from silver and gold in 2023 and beyond. A <a href="https://schiffgold.com/key-gold-news/citigroup-projects-30-silver-in-the-next-6-to-12-months/">Citigroup report</a> highlights that their analysts project silver to climb to $30 within the coming 6-12 months.</p>
<p>“We think recent price weakness offers a strong dip-buying opportunity, reiterating our call for $30/oz silver over the next 6-12 months as U.S. growth rolls over, even if emerging markets growth stagnates,” stated Citi&#8217;s market strategists.</p>

<p>The financial specialists at Citi are not alone in their optimism toward precious metals. Last month, a Bank of America (BOFA) commodity strategist <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bank-of-america-strategist-predicts-gold-could-reach-2500-per-ounce-in-2023/">suggested</a> gold could soar to $2,500 an ounce this year. A fortnight ago, BOFA analysts further <a href="https://www.northernminer.com/subscribe-login/?id=1003855020">implied</a> that reduced mining supplies could contribute to potential gains for silver. Global investment bank UBS also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ubs-offers-3-reasons-to-buy-gold-now-forecasts-all-time-high-this-year/">predicts</a> a record-breaking high for gold this year, while other commodity strategists have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/analysts-suspect-banking-crisis-triggered-resting-bull-market-in-gold-silver-could-print-much-higher-gains/">hinted at substantial gains</a> for both gold and silver owing to the recent banking crisis.</p>
<p>In Citi&#8217;s most recent report on silver, their analysts declared that “silver would rally in anticipation of the fall in U.S. interest rates and real yields that will likely accompany an anticipated rollover in U.S. growth.” Previously estimating that silver might reach the $30 range is not new for Citigroup — the bank&#8217;s analysts <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/citi-analysts-predict-near-perfect-conditions-for-silvers-ongoing-bull-market-experts-suggest-30-an-ounce-a-possibility/">spoke</a> of a &#8220;distinct possibility&#8221; in late April that silver could hit $34 per ounce within 6-12 months. The latest Citi evaluation for May&#8217;s end notes that “weaker competition for investment capital from other asset classes should also support silver pricing as markets increasingly price U.S. recession risks.”</p>
<p>Currently at just above <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SILVER/">$23 per ounce</a>, silver will need more than a 30% boost to reach Citi&#8217;s projected price target.</p>

Prices briefly fell below the $26,000 mark earlier in the day, before rebounding. Ethereum continues to trade below $1,800.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) slipped below the $26,000 level during today&#x2019;s trading session, as bears continued to apply pressure to crypto markets.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $25,890.59 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes after peaking at $26,703.88 on Wednesday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of today&#x2019;s decline, bitcoin fell to its weakest point since May 12, when it was at a bottom of $25,810.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Looking at the chart, the decline came following a breakout at a recent support point of $26,300.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has since rebounded, and as of writing is once again hovering above this point of support.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) found a floor of its own at the 39.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved lower for a second consecutive session, dropping below the $1,800 level in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a high of $1,817.97 on Wednesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD edged to a low of $1,763.37 today.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move saw ethereum fall below its own support point at $1,790, hitting a two-week low in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, earlier declines have somewhat eased, as a floor of 43.00 on the RSI has helped stem the bleeding.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Despite the decline, the 10-day (red), and 25-day (blue) moving averages are now close to a cross, which could lead to a reversal in price.&#13;<br />

<h2>The Crypto Industry&#8217;s &#8216;Deteriorating Conditions&#8217;</h2>
<p>The Asian cryptocurrency exchange, Hotbit, recently said it was shutting down the platform due to what it characterized as &#8220;deteriorating conditions&#8221; in the crypto industry. According to a statement issued by the exchange on May 22, these conditions have, in turn, resulted in the &#8220;continuous outflows of funds from cex [centralized exchange] users, including Hotbit, and deteriorating cash flow.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to dealing with capital outflows and reduced cash flow, the Hotbit team claimed in the statement that the constant upheavals in the crypto industry are making it more difficult to operate a cex. The Hotibit team <a href="https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823-It-s-time-to-take-a-bow">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The successive collapse of large centralized institutions has led the industry to gradually in two ways: either embrace the regulation or become more decentralized. The Hotbit team believes that centralized exchanges (cex) are becoming increasingly cumbersome, with highly complex and interconnected businesses that are difficult to comply with, whether for compliance or decentralization and are unlikely to meet long-term trends.</p></blockquote>
<h2>An Unsustainable Business Model</h2>
<p>Despite being one of the first exchanges to list emerging assets such as SHIB and GRIN, the Hotbit management team claimed in the statement that cyber attacks suffered in the past and the exploitation &#8220;of project defects by malicious users&#8221; made its business model an unsustainable one. According to the team, such incidents are some of the reasons why the crypto exchange has incurred &#8220;significant losses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the statement also noted that Hotbit&#8217;s decision to halt cex operations came less than a year after the exchange&#8217;s management team was forced to &#8220;suspend operations for several weeks due to the investigation in August 2022.&#8221; As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-hotbit-suspends-service-after-law-enforcement-seizes-its-funds-subpoenas-senior-managers/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in 2022, Hotbit was forced to make this decision after seeing law enforcement freeze the crypto exchange&#8217;s funds.</p>
