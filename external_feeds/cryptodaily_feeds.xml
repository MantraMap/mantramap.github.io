			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Head Chef Jared Grey has proposed that the 100% of xSUSHI revenue be allocated to the treasury wallet for the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
Head Chef Calls For Immediate Remedy
<p>The decentralized exchange is discussing this proposal to provide financing for its operations and extend its runway beyond the next year and a half. It proposes directing all the fees paid to the xSushi holders into the treasury wallet for the next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange has been facing a severe funding crisis and other indications of declining fortunes. Newly appointed Head chef, Jared Grey, is attempting to turn the company&rsquo;s fortunes around and extend its lifespan, which according to him, has been reduced to just 1.5 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His proposal states,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose setting Kanpai to 100% of fees diverted to the Treasury multisig, for one year or until new tokenomics are implemented, helping return Sushi&rsquo;s fiscal resources to a competitive level.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Grey, the company needs $5 million to remain operational in the bear market. While putting his plan forward, he stated that the significant deficit in the Treasury was the biggest threat to SushiSwap&rsquo;s operational viability and needed an immediate remedy to ensure proper funding.&nbsp;</p>
No Rewards For xSUSHI Holders
<p>The crux of the plan is to take all the funds generated by trading fees on the exchange. Now let&rsquo;s understand how that would work. One of the methods of earning rewards on the SushiSwap platform is by staking the sushi token and receiving the xSushi in return. For each swap, xSushi holders receive 0.05% of the transaction fees, 10% of which is directed to the SushiSwap treasury wallet. Now according to Grey&rsquo;s proposal, the percentage of funds allocated to the treasury should be increased from 10% to 100%. This would mean no more token rewards for the xSushi holders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A core developer at SushiSwap, Matthew Lilley, believes this could be a temporary solution to help the exchange. He said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The timeline is 12 months, if nothing has changed after 12 months it will default back to the original model. Hopefully it can be ended early if tokenomics revamp is concluded before.&rdquo;</p>

SushiSwap Community Not Pleased
<p>The proposal has been put up for voting in front of the DAO. 75% of the 28 members who voted at the time of writing supported the proposal. However, there has been some pushback from the community otherwise. Many users believe that if the reward fee for xSushi holders is taken away, they will not have any incentive to hold on to the SUSHI tokens. Some users have claimed that the reward fee was one of the reasons to hold on to the SUSHI tokens even in a bear market. Without the incentive to do so, many users might just dump the token. These speculations might have some value, as the SUSHI token had dropped by 6% in the 24 hours following the news.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">Cryptocurrencies are experiencing unprecedented volatility as of late, with Ethereum (ETH) and Algorand (ALGO) both seeing notable price fluctuations. With so much invested in these digital assets, it&rsquo;s crucial to have a solid understanding of the current volatility, and what tokens like Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) have to offer, and what might make it a better investment option, such as ORBN&rsquo;s forecasted 6000% growth. In this article, we will discuss the status of Algorand (ALGO), Ethereum (ETH), and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), and what their future might look like.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Ethereum (ETH) down by over 70% in a year</p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH), like most other cryptocurrencies, is a volatile asset. After reaching approximately $4,800 in November 2021, the price of Ethereum (ETH) has since dropped by nearly 75%. The price of Ethereum (ETH) hit its recent low on June 18 at $880. </p>
<p class="s7">Since then, the value of Ethereum (ETH) has fluctuated widely, reaching a recent high of a little over $2,000 in August. Nonetheless, it is still 58% lower than Ethereum's (ETH) all-time high set in November of 2021. A recent report, where Binance's CEO is offering to buy a key operating unit of crypto exchange FTX, likely contributed to Ethereum's (ETH) decline. </p>
<p class="s7">Due to concerns over FTX's liquidity and its capacity to pay debts, users began making withdrawals, resulting in a massive liquidation of cryptocurrencies throughout the exchange, which added to Ethereum&rsquo;s (ETH) lows. Though Ethereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies, it is a risky investment and investors must be careful before they invest.</p>
<p class="s10">Algorand (ALGO) drops despite its FIFA collaboration</p>
<p class="s7">After a high of $0.27, the price of Algorand (ALGO) has fallen steadily in recent days, reaching a current level of approximately $0.24. This denotes Algorand's (ALGO) drop of nearly 10% in just one week and over 85% in a year. Despite Algorand's (ALGO) recent role as FIFA's technical partner for FIFA+ Collect, its price has fallen. </p>
<p class="s7">As the day progresses, Algorand (ALGO) has maintained a largely flat price pattern, with the token lingering just above the crucial support level of $0.240. This month, there was some buying interest in Algorand (ALGO), and the price rose to a session high of $0.46. But a further drop of 26% followed Algorand (ALGO) shortly after. According to Algorand's(ALGO) price research, traders need to exercise extreme caution in the near term as the market continues to trade sideways. Algorand (ALGO) is now experiencing a downward trend.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s10">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN): A profitable investment for long-term and short-term</p>
<p class="s7">A growing number of people are getting in on the rising popularity of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN). Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a new entrant to the world of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. With Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), even a $1 can be used to make an investment in a promising startup. </p>
<p class="s7">As a decentralized investment platform, Orbeon Protocol allows startups to mint and issue fractionalized, equity-backed NFTs for as little as $1. Everyday investors can purchase these as a form of investment in the growing startup. This allows anyone to access the previously-gated venture capital industry.</p>
<p class="s7">At the time of writing, ORBN can be purchased for $0.021. Investors of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) can anticipate a return of around 6000% if the token's price reaches $0.24 by the time of launch. Those looking for high returns, both short-term and long-term, should invest in Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) to make the most out of their investments.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Southington, United States, 7th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Bulls &amp; Apes Project LLC (B.A.P.) introduces Community Tokenization, an industry-changing initiative.</p>
<p>B.A.P., a web3 company with a vision to create a world of infinite opportunities, launched its inaugural collection on May 31, featuring an industry-first 6-Month ETH-Back Guarantee, and has defied bear market conditions by continually delivering value and building a robust community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many NFT projects provide utility for holders of their native NFTs. &nbsp;Community Tokenization, on the other hand, leverages the public nature of the blockchain to provide B.A.P. utility to individuals who hold NFTs from other projects. Through this initiative B.A.P. will be rewarding holders of an ever-growing list of Tokenized Communities with their erc20 token, Methane, simply for holding NFTs from those projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>B.A.P. plans to tokenize larger projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gutter Cat Gang and Cool Cats, but also smaller projects with thriving communities such as Bubble Gum Kids, Nonconformist Ducks, and more. Shortly after acquiring Bulls On The Block, B.A.P. tokenized that community and is already seeing great levels of adoption and engagement.</p>
"When we started the Bulls &amp; Apes Project we wanted to build a project we would be proud to be a member of, but we also wanted to build something bigger than ourselves and bigger than B.A.P." said Anthony Mongiello, CEO of Bulls &amp; Apes Project. "Community Tokenization is the next step for us to realize our vision. &nbsp;We are building the web3 way, decentralized, permissionless, removing gatekeepers and intermediaries to provide opportunity to individual holders. &nbsp;This is web3."
<p>A huge part of the success of B.A.P. is the robust and scalable tokenomics structure backed by their in-game utility token, Methane. &nbsp;B.AP. invested heavily in the technology and gamification design to provide a simple, fun, and rewarding own-to-earn model where holders receive rewards simply for holding and engaging. Additionally, B.A.P. funded five layers of audits and ongoing legal consultation to ensure a safe, secure, and sustainable framework the community can trust and rely on.&nbsp;</p>
"We are proud of the tokenomic structure we have built," said Mongiello. "And now we are excited to share that structure with communities beyond our own holders. &nbsp;We have big plans for Methane and creating a robust environment for 100&rsquo;s and maybe 1000&rsquo;s of communities to engage with. &nbsp;Stay tuned for big announcements coming very very soon."

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The CEO of JP Morgan says that Crypto is a sideshow and its tokens are like pet rocks.</p>
<p>Ever ready to launch digs at the cryptocurrency industry, Jamie Dimon, CEO of the second largest bank in the world was scornful of crypto when asked about it in a video on CNBC.</p>
<p>He told the CNBC interviewers that they &ldquo;spent too much time on it&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;crypto tokens are like pet rocks&rdquo;. Even though his bank provides crypto services to some of its customers, Dimon has always continued to criticise the sector. He said that crypto has:</p>

<p>&ldquo;$20 to $30 billion of ransomware that we know about, $20 to $30 billion of exchange costs that we know about, lots of AML, anti-terrorism financing, tax avoidance, trafficking - why do we allow this stuff to take place?&rdquo;</p>

Opinion
<p>He added that maybe the regulators should &ldquo;stop beating up on banks and focus more on crypto&rdquo;. With this comment Dimon appeared to be saying don&rsquo;t look at us, look at this industry over here.</p>
<p>It does seem a bit rich that Dimon should be trying to divert the public and watchdog gaze from his bank, when so many of JP Morgan&rsquo;s nefarious practices over the last few years have been caught and fined extremely heavily.&nbsp;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The CEO of JP Morgan says that Crypto is a sideshow and its tokens are like pet rocks.</p>
<p>Ever ready to launch digs at the cryptocurrency industry, Jamie Dimon, CEO of the second largest bank in the world was scornful of crypto when asked about it in a video on CNBC.</p>
<p>He told the CNBC interviewers that they &ldquo;spent too much time on it&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;crypto tokens are like pet rocks&rdquo;. Even though his bank provides crypto services to some of its customers, Dimon has always continued to criticise the sector. He said that crypto has:</p>

<p>&ldquo;$20 to $30 billion of ransomware that we know about, $20 to $30 billion of exchange costs that we know about, lots of AML, anti-terrorism financing, tax avoidance, trafficking - why do we allow this stuff to take place?&rdquo;</p>

Opinion
<p>He added that maybe the regulators should &ldquo;stop beating up on banks and focus more on crypto&rdquo;. With this comment Dimon appeared to be saying don&rsquo;t look at us, look at this industry over here.</p>
<p>It does seem a bit rich that Dimon should be trying to divert the public and watchdog gaze from his bank, when so many of JP Morgan&rsquo;s nefarious practices over the last few years have been caught and fined extremely heavily.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The new hardware wallet, Ledger Stax, comes at a time when trust in centralized exchanges is at an all-time low in the aftermath of the FTX crash.&nbsp;</p>
FTX Crash Pushes Wallet Demand
<p>French crypto security firm Ledger unveiled its latest hardware wallet, the Ledger Stax, at the company&rsquo;s annual Ledger Op3n event on Tuesday. The gadget resembles a smartphone but is much smaller and lighter. It is roughly the size of a credit card and weighs lighter than a regular iPhone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier spoke about the company&rsquo;s previous crypto security devices, saying,</p>

<p>&ldquo;With the Ledger Nano&trade; series, we created the most successful digital asset security hardware of all time&mdash;with over 5 million sold and none ever hacked. Digital assets are increasingly about identity and digital ownership, not just crypto like Bitcoin. The time is now for a device for more mainstream users. We must not compromise on security.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crash of the FTX exchange and the attacks on multiple crypto firms during October have disillusioned investors about centralized platforms. As a result, there has been an increase in demand for hardware wallets where funds can be stored safely away from external threats.&nbsp;</p>
iPod Of Crypto
<p>In order to design the new device, the Ledger team partnered with Tony Fadell, the original creator of the iPod. This is another reason why the Ledger Stax is being dubbed the iPod of crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fadell spoke about designing the Ledger Stax and his thought process behind it,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Digging into Ledger&rsquo;s proven security technology and trying all the &lsquo;best&rsquo; hardware wallets out there convinced me to build a next-gen device with Pascal, Ian and the amazing Ledger team. We need a user-friendly&hellip;no! A &lsquo;user-delightful&rsquo; tool, to bring digital asset security to the rest of us, not just the geeks.&rdquo;</p>

Ledger Stax Product Design&nbsp;
<p>Users will be able to deposit most crypto tokens on the Ledger Stax, including Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, and Solana. The wallet even supports NFTs. The device has a high-resolution E-ink screen that allows users to manage and monitor their funds and display digital art.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, because of its magnetic nature, users can easily stack multiple devices on top of each other, which is a reference to the product name &ldquo;Stax.&rdquo; This stackable feature would come in handy for users who prefer to own multiple devices in order to maintain separation between their digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief Experience Officer at Ledger, Ian Rogers, spoke about the product design,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have fused the uncompromising security and self-custody culture of Ledger, with the equally uncompromising user-experience-focused culture of Tony and his team. The result is the first true, secure consumer hardware device for the revolution of value brought by blockchain technology.&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">1) More FUD targeting https://t.co/pFc4Pz9nFR is coming, this time about a business failure I had very early in my career. I have nothing to hide, and am proud of my battle scars, so here&rsquo;s the unfiltered story 🧵</p>
&mdash; Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) December 7, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>In a series of tweets this morning, Kris Marszalek laid out all his dirty laundry on Twitter for all to see. The CEO said he was proud of his &ldquo;scar tissue&rdquo; from the adversities that beset him in a past business start up failure.</p>
<p>Marszalek tells of a consumer electronics business called Starline, which he co-founded back in 2004. The business manufacturing was based in China, and exports were made across the world.</p>
<p>After 3 years, the business had nearly 400 employees and a revenue of around $81 million. The business had become a size to be reckoned with, but when the 2008 financial crisis hit, the business started to tumble.</p>
<p>Customers began to default on their payments and so the banks closed in and the company was forced into liquidation in 2009, owing around $2.5 million. As Marszalek was a co-founder, the banks went after him for the debt owed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marszelek says that it was quite a chastening experience to be bankrupt as he turned 30. He said it was so painful that it is a lesson that he carries with him to this day. One of his tweets carries advice for others:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">10) To aspiring entrepreneurs, I have this to say:Startups are hard. You will fail over and over again. Learn from your mistakes and do not repeat them.Never compromise on your values, even when things get tough.Act ethically, do the right thing and people will support you.</p>
&mdash; Kris | Crypto.com (@kris) December 7, 2022
<p>

</p>
<p>He was eventually able to start an e-commerce business and repay his debts in full to the bank. This in turn enabled him to clear his name through the courts.</p>
<p>The founder of Crypto.com says that he learnt humility, not to overextend, tenacity, and to never give up. His final message in the thread reads:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Startups are hard&hellip;</p>
<p>but there is no better way to live.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Smart contract insurance platform Nexus Mutual has revealed that it expects to take a significant loss on its investment in a Maple Finance Credit Pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also revealed that the smart contract auditing platform Sherlock would also be taking a considerable hit.&nbsp;</p>
A Sizable Loss&nbsp;
<p>Nexus Mutual has stated that it is expecting a significant loss on its investment in a Maple Finance credit pool. Nexus revealed the loss in a statement released on Monday, where the platform warned of a potential loss of around 2461 ETH, worth around $3 million, resulting from Orthogonal trading&rsquo;s recent default to Maple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nexus is a peer-to-peer, risk-sharing protocol that offers alternatives to insurance against risks such as DAO hacks and smart contract bugs in decentralized finance governed by NXM token holders. Nexus had, back in August, deposited 15,463 ETH, worth around $19.3 million at current prices, into a wrapped ETH (wETH) credit pool on Maple Finance, prompting some observers to speculate that the final loss could be significantly more.&nbsp;</p>
More Trouble Brewing?
<p>Pseudo Anonymous Twitter user DeFiyst speculated that over 69% of the deposited ETH remains in the M11 wETH pool. Recent defaulter Orthogonal Trading makes up around 17.6% of the M!! wETH pool&rsquo;s loans, while Auros makes up just over 37% of the pool&rsquo;s loans. Auros has already been given two loan extensions but has failed to make payments for a 2400 wETH loan and a 6000 wETH loan from the wETH pool. Some speculation has been that the protocol has been entangled with the FTX fiasco. A Twitter user speculated,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auros is like 15-20% of Maple&rsquo;s active loans. Auros are skirting the brink of default on Clearpool as well. Maple delegates have extended Auros loans twice now with no comms from Maven, Maple, or Auros. Auros has not tweeted since Nov 8 when FTX turned off withdrawals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Maple Credit&rsquo;s dashboard, the troubled debt represents around 56% of the $27.8 million debt in the wETH credit pool. Additionally, only $3.1 million in cash deposits are not tied up with loans, severely limiting Nexus&rsquo; ability to withdraw funds.&nbsp;</p>
Nexus Provides Update On Auros&nbsp;
<p>In its statement, Nexus also provided an update on the situation with Auros and Orthogonal Trading. In the statement, the platform mentioned that it had been made aware of short-term liquidity issues at Auros, which had impacted their ability to make repayments in the immediate future. The statement added that M11 Credit had reviewed Auros&rsquo; financial statements and given them a short-term extension based on their path to recovery. Based on this, Nexus stated it believes it can expect a high recovery on the loans disbursed to Auros. According to the statement, the losses from Auros are expected to be much smaller than those from Orthogonal Trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Orthogonal Trading, Maple stated that it expected the firm to default on all outstanding loans. Maple stated that as a result of Orthogonal misrepresenting its financial position, the company was severing all ties with the parent entity and would take appropriate legal action.&nbsp;</p>
Sherlock Also Reveals Losses&nbsp;
<p>Sherlock allows DeFi users to stake USDC and insure protocols audited by the team, earning yield in the process. However, some of the yield generated was derived from Maple Finance yield strategies, some of which had exposure to the M11 Credit USDC pool. According to Jack Sanford, co-founder of Sherlock, the platform is anticipating a $4 million loss due to the Orthogonal default. Sanford added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am truly sorry on behalf of Sherlock for the loss in the Maple pool. And I think Sherlock will need to take drastic action to create a better staking pool setup in the future that doesn&rsquo;t rely on competing with the highest APY of the day.&rdquo;</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart contract insurance platform Nexus Mutual has revealed that it expects to take a significant loss on its investment in a Maple Finance Credit Pool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was also revealed that the smart contract auditing platform Sherlock would also be taking a considerable hit.&nbsp;</p>
A Sizable Loss&nbsp;
<p>Nexus Mutual has stated that it is expecting a significant loss on its investment in a Maple Finance credit pool. Nexus revealed the loss in a statement released on Monday, where the platform warned of a potential loss of around 2461 ETH, worth around $3 million, resulting from Orthogonal trading&rsquo;s recent default to Maple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nexus is a peer-to-peer, risk-sharing protocol that offers alternatives to insurance against risks such as DAO hacks and smart contract bugs in decentralized finance governed by NXM token holders. Nexus had, back in August, deposited 15,463 ETH, worth around $19.3 million at current prices, into a wrapped ETH (wETH) credit pool on Maple Finance, prompting some observers to speculate that the final loss could be significantly more.&nbsp;</p>
More Trouble Brewing?
<p>Pseudo Anonymous Twitter user DeFiyst speculated that over 69% of the deposited ETH remains in the M11 wETH pool. Recent defaulter Orthogonal Trading makes up around 17.6% of the M!! wETH pool&rsquo;s loans, while Auros makes up just over 37% of the pool&rsquo;s loans. Auros has already been given two loan extensions but has failed to make payments for a 2400 wETH loan and a 6000 wETH loan from the wETH pool. Some speculation has been that the protocol has been entangled with the FTX fiasco. A Twitter user speculated,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Auros is like 15-20% of Maple&rsquo;s active loans. Auros are skirting the brink of default on Clearpool as well. Maple delegates have extended Auros loans twice now with no comms from Maven, Maple, or Auros. Auros has not tweeted since Nov 8 when FTX turned off withdrawals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to Maple Credit&rsquo;s dashboard, the troubled debt represents around 56% of the $27.8 million debt in the wETH credit pool. Additionally, only $3.1 million in cash deposits are not tied up with loans, severely limiting Nexus&rsquo; ability to withdraw funds.&nbsp;</p>
Nexus Provides Update On Auros&nbsp;
<p>In its statement, Nexus also provided an update on the situation with Auros and Orthogonal Trading. In the statement, the platform mentioned that it had been made aware of short-term liquidity issues at Auros, which had impacted their ability to make repayments in the immediate future. The statement added that M11 Credit had reviewed Auros&rsquo; financial statements and given them a short-term extension based on their path to recovery. Based on this, Nexus stated it believes it can expect a high recovery on the loans disbursed to Auros. According to the statement, the losses from Auros are expected to be much smaller than those from Orthogonal Trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Orthogonal Trading, Maple stated that it expected the firm to default on all outstanding loans. Maple stated that as a result of Orthogonal misrepresenting its financial position, the company was severing all ties with the parent entity and would take appropriate legal action.&nbsp;</p>
Sherlock Also Reveals Losses&nbsp;
<p>Sherlock allows DeFi users to stake USDC and insure protocols audited by the team, earning yield in the process. However, some of the yield generated was derived from Maple Finance yield strategies, some of which had exposure to the M11 Credit USDC pool. According to Jack Sanford, co-founder of Sherlock, the platform is anticipating a $4 million loss due to the Orthogonal default. Sanford added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am truly sorry on behalf of Sherlock for the loss in the Maple pool. And I think Sherlock will need to take drastic action to create a better staking pool setup in the future that doesn&rsquo;t rely on competing with the highest APY of the day.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">IoTeX has joined the Eclipse Foundation, one of the world's largest open-source software organizations, and will contribute to the Oniro Project working group to develop a distributed open-source operating system for all consumer devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s7">IoTeX is not only the first Layer 1 blockchain project to join the EF but also the first one which explores how to integrate Web3 components into the operating system layer of IoT devices as additional services and modules. And by contributing to the Oniro Project, it now becomes possible for IoT devices to interact with blockchains using these advanced operating system features.</p>

<p class="s7">"The Eclipse Foundation is thrilled to welcome IoTeX and its team of scientists, engineers, and cryptographers, and we are excited to see the Web3 open-source technology they bring to our community," said Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. "We will provide a vendor-neutral governance framework within the Oniro working group for open collaboration with IoTeX."</p>

<p class="s7">The EU-based Eclipse Foundation has over 300 strategic members and dozens of associate members, including IBM, Microsoft, Google, Oracle, Bosch, Siemens, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Volkswagen, BMW, and many others.</p>
<p class="s7">The Foundation provides its global community of individuals and organizations with a mature, scalable, and business-friendly environment for open-source software collaboration and innovation. </p>

<p class="s7">"We are extremely honored to become one of the Eclipse Foundation's most recent members and bring a Web3 perspective to the EF that connects the physical world to the metaverse," said IoTeX CEO and Co-Founder Raullen Chai. "Our main focus is collaborating with the foundation's Oniro Working Group."</p>

<p>Supercharging customer loyalty</p>
<p>Among the infinite number of consumer-facing and industrial use cases, W3bstream enables supercharging customer engagement and loyalty with intelligent devices that range from tiny sensors to carsand large home appliances.Simply put, W3bstream integration in Oniro OS turns any IoT sensor into a blockchain-enabled device, making it benefiting instantaneously from all web3 technologies such as data ownership, data monetization, automated transactions through smart contracts, &nbsp;and X-to-earn models.</p>
<p>Bosch, for example, manufactures smart washing machines and refrigerators. This year's global smart refrigerator market was worth just over $5.2 billion and is expected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2025, according to a Report Linker report. In the US, large, intelligent appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines are present in 13% of households, Statista reported.</p>
<p>Smart refrigerators have cameras and sensors that gather loads of data, namely all of their users' consumer habits, including where and how often they shop for groceries. All that data has tremendous marketing value and could also have social and medical research applications.</p>
<p>With W3bstream, Bosch could quickly and inexpensively develop a Web3 application integrated into each smart refrigerator to reward users for their data which could be enough to pay back the appliance over time.</p>
<p>At the same time,Bosch &nbsp;would also generate revenue from transactional costs derived from the users' data sharing..</p>
<p>Car knows you better than you believe</p>
<p>Car data could already be worth more than the vehicle itself, according to a 2017 report. Mashable wrote that newer cars are similar to smartphones, only they have wheels. Many are WiFi-enabled, come with over a hundred CPUs, and have Bluetooth embedded. It knows, just like your smartphone, whether you are a churchgoer, attend AA or visit Planned Parenthood. Because of nearly 200 or so sensors throughout the vehicles, it has data points that can build a complete profile of you and your passengers.</p>
<p>According to a McKinsey report, car data monetization will be worth $750 billion by 2030. In 2021, there were about 230 million connected cars globally and 84 million on the roads in the United States, according to a Statista report. By 2030, that number is expected to triple to 630 million worldwide and 235 million in the United States, meaning the data of each car is worth at least $1,000 annually. </p>
<p>So again, what if Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, BMW, and Volkswagen, members of the Eclipse Foundation, built their Web3 dApp on W3bstream, allowing their consumers to earn at least $1,000 back each year from their cars to enhance consumer experience and loyalty. On average gaining a new customer costs five times more than holding onto a current customer. Improving customer loyalty is one of the main battles for marketing departments. Being able to offer customers rewards for their data is a powerful weapon in their customer loyalty armory.</p>
<p>These are just two examples out of thousands that IoTeX's open-source technology makes possible for businesses seeking new ways to increase customer engagement and generate new revenue streams.</p>
<p>Collaboration toward innovation</p>
<p>The Canada-based Eclipse Foundation has over 300 members and dozens of associate members. It provides its global community of individuals and organizations with a mature, scalable, and business-friendly environment for open-source software collaboration and innovation. </p>
<p class="s7">IoTeX is an open-source platform at the intersection of blockchain and the Internet of Things. Coining its vision MachineFi, it is on a mission to enable the future decentralized machine economy. It seeks to build a connected world where machines, humans, businesses, and decentralized applications (dApps) can interact with trust and privacy. IoTeX combines blockchain, its off-chain compute infrastructure called W3bstream, and open hardware to connect billions of devices and dApps across the physical and digital world.</p>
<p class="s7">The Oniro Group and IoTeX are a perfect match as they are both IoT agnostic and are keen on building a global community of developers. Designed with modularity, Oniro offers more significant levels of flexibility and application portability across the broad spectrum of consumer and IoT devices &mdash; from tiny embedded sensors and actuators to feature-rich smart appliances and mobile companions.</p>
<p>By enabling any Oniro-powered device to interact and transact on the blockchain, IoT and &nbsp;device manufacturers, OEMs and integrators, and any IoT-related project are reaching a new frontier where disruptive business models such as Sensor as a service, pay per use, data monetization are now easily accessible and implementable seamlessly.</p>
<p class="s7">With this membership, IoTeX expands its collaboration to new spheres as it heads into 2023. More remarkable development and growth are expected as it achieves and delivers massive technological advancements in Web3.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has begun a probe on a number of crypto firms on the matter of possible ad misconduct for public materials which may have misrepresented facts and claims about cryptocurrencies and digital assets.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to a report from Bloomberg, FTC spokeswoman Juliana Gruenwald has disclosed that the financial regulator has indeed begun an investigation that involves several crypto firms "for possible misconduct concerning digital assets."</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">No further detail has been provided by the spokesperson, and no specific crypto firm has been named as a subject of the investigation. It is likely, though, that the investigations have been spurred by the recent controversies and current legal proceedings being done towards FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto exchange which has been mired with internal conflicts for its management, as well as being the subject of regulatory difficulties for failing to disclose full details of its operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Recent misleading advertising materials and paid promotions in the crypto space have been the subject of crypto investor backlash, and of course the prying eye of U.S. financial regulators such as the FTC.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Most recently, Kim Kardashian, a celebrity entrepreneur, was served with a fine by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over her actions on social media promoting EthereumMax ($EMAX), a crypto token project. Kardashian, an influencer, was paid to promote the token, but she failed to disclose such a transaction. A similar vein of investigation was also began by the FTC concerning two athletes, NFL star Tom Brady and NBA great Stephen Curry. This is in relation to their involvement with the promotion of FTX in 2022.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The FTC is not alone in this initiative, though, as it has been reported by CryptoDaily. In mid-2021, the U.K. Advertising Standards Authority flagged crypto ads, and later issued an enforcement notice to at least 50 firms advertising crypto or working alongside crypto firms as agencies to produce advertising materials. A similar initiative was also done by Truth in Advertising, a U.S.-based consumer rights group which called out celebrities such as Floyd Mayweather, rappers Eminem and Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These probes and the intent they are pushed forward from are nothing new, with financial regulators now wary in the aftermath of 2018's ICO scam wave. The SEC, in particular, even issued a notice dating back to 2017, in which it warned the public of celebrity investments, crypto or otherwise.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">"Investors should note that celebrity endorsements may appear unbiased, but instead may be part of a paid promotion. Investment decisions should not be based solely on an endorsement by a promoter or other individual," the SEC said.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Speculations have been rampant about an upcoming Twitter Coin that could potentially take over Dogecoin&rsquo;s current mantle as the native currency of the social media platform.&nbsp;</p>
Online Sleuths Uncover &ldquo;Twitter Coin&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>Several self-appointed online technical sleuths have pointed out that a new native crypto token is in the works at Twitter. The crypto is being dubbed Twitter Coin, and word around the blockchain is that it could push out Dogecoin from the position of the native currency of the social media platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security researcher Jane Manchun Wong was the first to bring the possible new coin into the public eye. She extracted a code from a recent version of the Twitter web app, which featured a vector image of the &ldquo;Twitter Coin.&rdquo; She shared the image on her Twitter account along with an image of the Coins tab within Twitter&rsquo;s Tips feature. Granted, Wong clarified that the Twitter Coin icon might not represent a native token necessarily, instead just be a visual representation of the platform&rsquo;s crypto tipping feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, soon after, Wong&rsquo;s Twitter and LinkedIn profiles were disabled. This added more fuel to the rumors about Twitter Coin, with some users claiming that she had been kicked off of Twitter because of what she shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter user Nima Owji, who runs an app-focused information leak account, also posted a screenshot of what appears to be a prototype Twitter interface showing a &ldquo;Coins&rdquo; option for tipping, along with a vector image showing a coin bearing Twitter&rsquo;s logo.</p>
DOGE Accounts Suspended
<p>Other incidents on Twitter have also raised suspicion among the community. For instance, on December 3, Dogecoin CEO Billy Markus pointed out several DOGE-related accounts have been banned from the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He tweeted,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A whole bunch of accounts of people who, as far as I know, generally don't do anything but tweet memes and positivity are being suspended.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk responded to the tweet that he was looking into it. He soon tweeted back that the matter was resolved and that the accounts were reinstated. He claimed that the error happened because the Twitter team had been eliminating spam or bot accounts.&nbsp;</p>
Could This Mean Trouble For DOGE?
<p>Some Twitter users and DOGE supporters are holding on to the belief that this could be an instance of the platform formally recognizing DOGE as Twitter&rsquo;s official currency and that Twitter Coin is just another moniker for DOGE. However, if Twitter Coin turns out to be a standalone cryptocurrency, it could spell trouble for DOGE and even BTC. DOGE, especially, has always benefitted from Elon Musk&rsquo;s open advocacy for it. If it were dethroned by a different crypto, that could spell a major blow to the memecoin, which owes a lot of its success to Twitter and Musk&rsquo;s advocacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elon Musk responded to the tweet that he was looking into it. He soon tweeted back that the matter was resolved and that the accounts were reinstated. He claimed that the error happened because the Twitter team had been eliminating spam or bot accounts.&nbsp;</p>
Could This Mean Trouble For DOGE?
<p>Some Twitter users and DOGE supporters are holding on to the belief that this could be an instance of the platform formally recognizing DOGE as Twitter&rsquo;s official currency and that Twitter Coin is just another moniker for DOGE. However, if Twitter Coin turns out to be a standalone cryptocurrency, it could spell trouble for DOGE and even BTC. DOGE, especially, has always benefitted from Elon Musk&rsquo;s open advocacy for it. If it were dethroned by a different crypto, that could spell a major blow to the memecoin, which owes a lot of its success to Twitter and Musk&rsquo;s advocacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Hugging 16882 Level:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 7 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to trade closely to the 16882 area early in the Asian session as the pair encountered technical resistance around the 17102 level, right around the 50-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; Traders had previously pushed BTC/USD lower to the 16865 level, representing another test of the 16882 area that represents a downside price objective related to selling pressure that commenced around the 52100 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;If BTC/USD is able to extend its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; If recent upside momentum reverses, traders may test recent two-year lows around the 15460 level established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area, a previous relative low that represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas. Following the recent appreciation from 15992.64, technical support and buying pressure are possible around the 16811, 16655, 16498, 16305, and 16276 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16853.23 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 17036.51.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Circle and its planned special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) partner Concord have mutually decided not to go public.&nbsp;</p>
Business Combination Terminated
<p>On Monday, Circle Internet Financial and Concord Acquisition Corp (NYSE:CND) mutually decided to terminate the proposed business combination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking on the dissolution of the partnership agreement, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are disappointed the proposed transaction timed out, however, becoming a public company remains part of Circle&rsquo;s core strategy to enhance trust and transparency, which has never been more important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The crypto company and the publicly traded SPAC company first announced their partnership in July 2021. The partnership agreement was amended in February 2022, which set a December 10, 2022, deadline to consummate the business combination. According to the now-nullified agreement, Concord was also liable to a shareholder vote that could extend the deadline till January of next year.&nbsp;</p>
No Approval From SEC
<p>A SPAC is a company that has no business operations. It is just a &ldquo;blank check company&rdquo; created to raise capital through an Initial Public Offering or by merging with another firm. In this case, the Concord Acquisition Company formed this SPAC to merge with Circle and go public.</p>
<p>However, the combination would only have been feasible if the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had declared the S-4 registration statement effective. Without the SEC&rsquo;s approval, the two companies could not move forward with their initial business plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allaire tweeted about the SEC&rsquo;s role in the situation,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From my perspective, I believe that the SEC has been rigorous and thorough in understanding our business and many novel aspects of this industry. This kind of review is necessary to ultimately provide trust, transparency and accountability for major companies in crypto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As of now, the boards of directors from both companies have signed off on the termination of the proposed business combination.&nbsp;</p>
Executives Address Termination
<p>Circle&rsquo;s CFO, Jeremy Fox-Green, had been anticipating a 2022 date for the listing. Earlier in a July 2022 interview, he had explicitly stated that the process would be completed by the end of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CEO Allaire has expressed his disappointment over the business proposal not panning out. He also claimed that Circle is still determined to become a public company, focusing heavily on trust and transparency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Chairman of the Concord Acquisition Corp, Bob Diamond, stated&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Circle plays a key role in the blockchain's disruption of financial services. I remain confident in Circle's regulatory-first approach to building trust and transparency in the financial industry, which has never been more important, and I will continue being an advocate for the company as it continues to grow."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">With the market downturn, investors are out searching for cryptocurrency projects they can invest in and hopefully use to increase their portfolios. But, most times, emotions and fear can blind an investor to making a panic decision.</p>
<p class="s3">This is why investors must make intelligent decisions, as those with assets in Fantom (FTM) and Mina Protocol (MINA) are currently watching as their assets are dropping due to market struggle. Consequently, it leads investors to alternatives like Sparklo, which is currently performing well in its presale.</p>
<p class="s3">Fantom (FTM) Investors Searching For Alternatives</p>
<p class="s3">The price movement of Fantom (FTM) hasn't been outstanding recently, as it shows no sign or little sign of its price changing from its downtrend position. With Bitcoin (BTC) dropping below $16,500, this indicates an inflation increase affecting the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and other altcoins. </p>
<p class="s3">Looking at the charts, over the past seven days, Fantom (FTM) has had a price decline of -26.01%, and even in the past month, it has continued to decline, as seen in its -1.7% price decrease. </p>
<p class="s3">Fantom currently trades at $0.20, and though Fantom (FTM) is one of the top cryptocurrency projects, it is still presently struggling in the market, and analysts predict that it might not have a reversal in the short term. As a result, investors will have to look at other alternatives if they need to boost their portfolios. </p>
<p class="s3">Mina Protocol (MINA) Price Fluctuates As The Market Downturn Continues</p>
<p class="s3">Mina Protocol (MINA) was launched in early 2021, and by June 1st, 2021, it was worth $9.90. After the launch, the market thought the price was overvalued, and it soon fell to a low of $2.76 before it recovered to trade at $3.24. By 2022, analysts valued Mina Protocol (MINA) at $3.59, and just like most cryptocurrencies, Mina Protocol (MINA) was no exception as it struggled with the crypto winter. </p>
<p class="s3">By January's end, Mina Protocol (MINA) was trading at $2.21, and this downtrend continued till it hit an all-time low of $1.76 on February 24th. After the general market crash, Mina Protocol (MINA) also hit an all-time low by May 12th and was pegged at $0.83. </p>
<p class="s3">Though the market recovered slightly, the other market crash, which saw the total value of the entire crypto market dip below $1trn, also affected the Mina Protocol (MINA). Nevertheless, Mina Protocol (MINA) has witnessed some recovery of 7.72% in the past 30 days. Analysts predict that since there are no solid fundamentals to back it up, it might only last for a while. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (Sprk) Presale Records Success</p>
<p class="s3">With the success of Sparklo&rsquo;s presale, investors have recognized the high growth potential of the token. Fantom (FTM) and Mina Protocol (MINA) are struggling amidst market uncertainty. </p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo will be the first alternative investment that would allow investors to invest in fractionalized NFTs, backed by real-world assets in the form of gold, silver, or platinum. Sparklo passed its audit from Interfi Network, and to ensure that the project remains safe, the developers will lock its liquidity for 100 years. </p>
<p class="s3">Additionally, the team&rsquo;s token will be locked for 1,000 days. Sparklo currently goes for a price of $0.013, and analysts predict that the price will increase by more than 100x in the coming months. Investing early in a project ensures that investors get maximum gains. So this might be the best time to get in on Sparklo.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vitalik Buterin has outlined his ideas on what kinds of projects inside the Ethereum ecosystem may operate as critical cornerstones of what Ethereum's future might look like.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a blog post, Buterin shares that he's excited about Ethereum-based projects that are working on DAO-governed stablecoins with a focus on real-world assets and zero-knowledge decentralized identities. According to to the Ethereum co-founder, the recent collapse of FTX has had a benign impact on the crypto market and its wide array of users, to the extent that the very idea of decentralization might be put to question and rendered uncertain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To Buterin's mind, stablecoins issued with a strong decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forming a pillar behind its governance would provide users with better benefits in terms of utility as a currency, for the longer term. In terms of the use of crypto as a replacement or subsumption of traditional fiat currency, this Buterin argues that using crypto for transactions instead of using cards that link one's personal identity through banks actually echoes what cash transactions have long preserved: privacy.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">In terms of the interoperability of decentralized identity, Buterin believes that digital identity is essential to allow for multiple blockchain-based identities to co-exist, with more heft place on the value of interoperability as a principle for essentially binding together all possible platforms into a shared, commonly usable space.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Vitalik Buterin has outlined his ideas on what kinds of projects inside the Ethereum ecosystem may operate as critical cornerstones of what Ethereum's future might look like.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In a blog post, Buterin shares that he's excited about Ethereum-based projects that are working on DAO-governed stablecoins with a focus on real-world assets and zero-knowledge decentralized identities. According to to the Ethereum co-founder, the recent collapse of FTX has had a benign impact on the crypto market and its wide array of users, to the extent that the very idea of decentralization might be put to question and rendered uncertain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">To Buterin's mind, stablecoins issued with a strong decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forming a pillar behind its governance would provide users with better benefits in terms of utility as a currency, for the longer term. In terms of the use of crypto as a replacement or subsumption of traditional fiat currency, this Buterin argues that using crypto for transactions instead of using cards that link one's personal identity through banks actually echoes what cash transactions have long preserved: privacy.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"There is also the important broader philosophical case for cryptocurrency as private money: the transition to a "cashless society" is being taken advantage of by many governments as an opportunity to introduce levels of financial surveillance that would be unimaginable 100 years ago.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum and Solana are two of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies. In 2021 both hit all-time highs but had since decreased exponentially during the start of the 2022 bear market. </p>
<p>While these popular options decrease in value, Orbeon Protocol thrives, securing over a 260% price increase during its presale. This article will examine why Orbeon Protocol succeeds and traditional investments decline. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Solana Is Down 93.41% In 12 months</p>
<p>Solana was created by the Solana Foundation to speed up the adoption of decentralized finance. Launched in 2020, Solana combines a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus with an underlying proof-of-stake consensus to improve DeFi scalability and speed. </p>
<p>Solana was one of the most popular investment options in 2021, rising from $0.95 at launch to an all-time high of $259.96 in November. Solana is currently valued at $14.29, down 93.41% from its all-time high. Although hit by the current bear run, Solana is still expected to bounce back due to its numerous applications. </p>
<p class="s9">Ethereum is Down 76% in 12 Months</p>
<p>Ethereum is a DeFi technology used to build financial applications. Ethereum lets programmers write code that controls the money, holds assets, and completes transactions without needing a central governing authority. </p>
<p>Ethereum&rsquo;s native cryptocurrency is Ether (ETH), which is used to make transactions on the Ethereum Network. Ethereum&rsquo;s current price is $1,232.64, down 70.23% in the past 12 months. Despite this decrease, investors remain optimistic about Ethereum, with ETH making up 76% of all NFT trade volume.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol Is On Track For A 6,000% Increase </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is making headlines for its innovative approach to startup funding and a successful presale phase. The project aims to disrupt the $13.5 Billion crowdfunding market by allowing everyday investors to buy equity in startups. </p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol is powered by multiple blockchains and lets retail investors fractionally invest in startups without needing significant starting capital. These investors were previously shut out of early-stage investing, which was only accessible to venture capitalists. </p>
<p>Startups mint equity-based fractionalized NFTs through Orbeon Protocol. Investors can then buy a stake in the startup, with prices as low as $1. Once purchased, NFTs are then stored in a dedicated Orbeon wallet. </p>
<p>To prevent low-quality startups from entering the ecosystem, all startups are vetted by the Orbeon team before being able to create NFTs. To add an additional layer of protection, investors are also protected by Orbeon Protocols (ORBN) smart contract code. The code uses a &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; security mechanism that automatically refunds investors if their chosen startup fails to meet its funding target. </p>
<p>This exciting concept has the potential to revolutionize the early-stage investment market, which is why Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) investors are now buying Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) tokens during its presale. Experts predict that the price of ORBN could increase by over 6,000%, rising from $0.014 to $0.24. </p>
<p>ORBN investors are also rewarded with access to early funding rounds, voting rights, staking rewards, and access to exclusive investor groups. This, alongside a whole Orbeon Protocol ecosystem, makes ORBN one of the most exciting new projects going into 2023. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>There has been a lot of buzz in the crypto community about a new project called The Hideaways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to the success of the Hideaways (HDWY) presale, eager buyers are snapping up the token before it even hits the market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investors in Polkadot (DOT) are the most likely to be considering incorporating The Hideaways (HDWY) into their holdings.</p>
Polkadot (DOT) Is The Standard For DeFi
<p>The cryptocurrency industry has recently experienced unprecedented growth. Yet now it's a network of thousands of isolated initiatives that don't share any resources. This is where Polkadot (DOT) comes in.</p>
<p>Polkadot aims to establish a unified decentralized market through its cryptocurrency token. It aspires to facilitate communication and cooperation amongst autonomous blockchain networks. With this capability, value and data can be transferred between networks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having a standardized system like Polkadot is great news for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. Polkadot is now being used in a number of different projects. The value of this blockchain will rise as more and more applications begin using it.</p>
<p>The need for cryptocurrency projects with real-world applications is high right now. Polkadot's (DOT) meteoric rise to fashion stardom is largely attributed to this.&nbsp; Experts in the cryptocurrency industry are optimistic about the long-term viability of Polkadot (DOT).</p>
The Hideaways (HDWY) Project Deliver A Solid Use Case
<p>If you are trying to diversify your crypto holdings, The Hideaways is a great option (HDWY). The Hideaways (HDWY) is a very new and highly profitable cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is a platform for trading non-fungible tokens (NFTs) backed by luxury real estates such as private villas, mansions, and penthouses. The Hideaways (HDWY) is predicted to develop into a top-tier "Blue Chip" crypto protocol.</p>
<p>The Solidproof evaluation of this new venture was positive, and industry analysts predict rapid expansion in 2023.</p>
<p>The innovative idea of The Hideaways has garnered a lot of praise. In addition, as per the analysis of crypto experts, The Hideaways (HDWY) price will climb by a factor of more than a hundred in the future months.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s8">The Musiverse team is pleased to announce to the crypto community that it has launched its project with a focus on bridging the gap between the music industry and Web3. Musiverse NFT's mission is to build a sustainable, decentralized ecosystem based on common interests to connect the two markets.</p>
<p class="s8">The project is kicking off with a bang on 14 December launching its 5000-unit Genesis NFT Collection on the Ethereum network, with a strong focus on real-life utility: the NFT Collection gives its owners lifetime VIP access to a series of music and Web3 events worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s8">And it is just the beginning; the Music Tokenization Marketplace and DAO Token, launching in 2023, will enable musicians, music fans and Web3 enthusiasts to benefit together in a decentralised system of shared interests.</p>
<p class="s8">But what is Musiverse and how does it plan to connect the music industry with web3?</p>
<p class="s8">Barnab&aacute;s S&aacute;ra, Co-Founder &amp; CEO at Musiverse NFT says:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="s8">&ldquo;We believe that Web3 is not only a technological and financial revolution, but a social one as well. We follow the rule of thinking global - acting local. Our mission is to educate, to form community and to open the gate of Web3 to the music industry. We know that both markets are suffering from serious problems and we realised the opportunity of solving them by introducing the 2 to each other. The mass adoption of crypto assets will only come when traditional markets start to integrate them to their business models.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s8">Musiverse launched its international event series this year, positioning it all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">Events include private NFT parties for holders only, community meet-ups with partners, open-to-public parties and music concerts, as well as conferences and festivals.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">While the project is still in its early stages, it has already gained traction within the music and Web3 communities, which shows the potential to become a major player in the space.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">Musiverse's wide-ranging events have been highly attended in New York and Hungary with a Web3 Conference and NTF Parties, as well as a Web3 meet-up in Amsterdam in collaboration with Polkadot &amp; W3b Lab.</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s8">M&aacute;ri&oacute; V&aacute;nyi, co-founder &amp; CEO, says of the upcoming NFT collection:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s8">&ldquo;The NFT collection is called 'Keys to the Musiverse'. The collection consists of unique 3D Keys whose main uses include free entry to any concert, party, community event or conference organised by us, our musicians or our partners. The Key NFTs will provide more &amp; more social, artistic and financial utilities to the holders, being gradually unlocked as the ecosystem expands &amp; evolves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="s8">The project further aims to raise the general awareness about what Web3 really means and realise mass adoption of the Web3-music market in the future. The current innovations are steps towards a longer-term plan that includes the gradual transformation into a DAO with the aforementioned community-governeddecentralised musical NFT marketplace and music tokenisation in its most sustainable forms.</p>
<p class="s8"></p>
<p class="s5">The project has a strong vision and big plans, but it is also focused on delivering real-world value from the very beginning. This focus makes Musiverse unique and provides a great opportunity for those who are interested in the potential of Web3.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Heavy regulation is on the horizon for the crypto industry. However, is this going to help the innovations that can change everything for finance?</p>
Crypto to zero?
<p>According to leaders from the banking industry, world financial agencies, and government watchdogs, the crypto industry is one that is just too dangerous for the financial system to tolerate, or for the average Joe to invest in.</p>
<p>All the &lsquo;centralised&rsquo; crypto exchanges are on the verge of collapse if they haven&rsquo;t already done so, and the ensuing contagion is likely to cause most cryptocurrencies to go to zero, and for Bitcoin to head well under $10,000.</p>
Heavy regulation and intermediaries
<p>That will then be that. Or will it? Surely it cannot be argued that the financial system we have in place is fit for service? Inflation is rampant, debt is at the highest level it has ever been in monetary history, and it will probably only take the odd bank or two to go down to bring the rest of the pack of cards down as well - just like the legacy finance leaders are saying about crypto.</p>
<p>Gary Gensler is the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He says that he wants to insert intermediaries in between every DeFi platform and those who want to transact with them.</p>
<p>The MiCA regulation that is about to be passed into law in Europe would inflict onerous requirements upon all crypto platforms that would probably see them leaving European shores in droves.</p>
<p>It all seems to be about regulation aimed at squashing the life out of crypto. It could be asked though, has regulation, no matter how heavy and demanding, done a great deal to stop banks carrying out nefarious activities that have done massive harm to the economy and investors alike?</p>
Crypto vs CBDCs
<p>We are at a junction. The road favoured by governments, banks, and the major world financial agencies is one where the legacy, fiat-backed monetary system persists, and where within a couple of years or so, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are phased in in order to assert total monetary power over citizens.</p>
<p>The other road is being prepared by entrepreneurs, builders and thinkers from around the world. On this road the way forward is not about onerous regulation, harsh enforcement, and total control, it is about code.</p>
<p>The code is all about doing away with intermediaries in any shape or form. All regulations and requirements can be built in at the beginning so there just isn&rsquo;t any need for huge government watchdog agencies.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is built on code. It doesn&rsquo;t need entities like the Federal Reserve with its teams of economists to ease or tighten monetary policy, it just does what the code tells it to do, and therefore it provides a system which has the strongest network the world has ever seen, totally secure, and allowing anyone to interact with anyone else in the world without any intermediary saying yay or nay.</p>
<p>Governments and banks do not like this. It eats into their power and control because it has no political leanings, no racial prejudices, and isn&rsquo;t controlled by anyone.</p>
<p>When CBDCs come into being and the world&rsquo;s population finally understands what is at stake, code will be the answer. A trustless system is what the human race needs, and out of the innovation in crypto will come such a system. Bitcoin is already here, we just need that fair and trustless monetary exchange system to go with it.</p>
