<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) sought to retain its recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 17000 figure after recently peaking around the 17317.80 area.&nbsp; A subsequent pullback to the 16791.02 area saw BTC/USD test the 38.2% retracement of the recent appreciating range from 15992.64 to 17317.80.&nbsp; Traders are monitoring upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure including the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; If recent upside momentum reverses, traders may test recent two-year lows around the 15460 level established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area, a previous relative low that represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Associated downside price objectives below current price activity include the 13369, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Technicians continue to eye the 14500.15 and 10432.73 areas as major downside targets, and additional downside price objectives include the 14613, 10727, and 9682 levels, areas that are related to selling pressure that intensified around the 20894.96 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 200-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;100-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
