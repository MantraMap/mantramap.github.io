Coinbase alleges that the institution lacks &#8220;any powers to regulate&#8221; cryptocurrency exchanges and that this enforcement action &#8220;offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Coinbase Contests SEC Powers to Regulate Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2>
<p>Paul Grewal, CLO of Coinbase, the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1674271484263661569?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the filing of an answer to the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-becomes-the-latest-target-of-sec-accused-of-unregistered-brokerage-and-securities-violations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complaint</a> presented by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), where the institution accuses the Coinbase of unregistered securities brokerage.</p>
<p>In the 177-page <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/4oVJN5EioULD0QnSyg01b8/2b1f34594a800c727fb61a384f37e74a/SEC_v._Coinbase__Coinbase_Answer_to_Complaint__As-Filed_.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">document</a>, Coinbase explains that in April 2021, the SEC approved its registration to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/coinbase-ipo-reference-price-250-nasdaq-listing-watershed-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">go public</a> through an IPO on Nasdaq, &#8220;allowing Coinbase&#8217;s shares to be sold to millions of retail and institutional investors.&#8221; However, the recent filing of this enforcement action against the exchange contradicts the prior approval of its business model.</p>
<p>Coinbase criticizes the newfound position of the institution regarding cryptocurrency exchanges, stating that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No statute enacted since April 2021 gives the SEC any powers to regulate digital asset exchanges, much less retroactively. The only change is in the SEC’s position regarding its powers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the filing claims that this enforcement action, based on the SEC&#8217;s change of face, &#8220;offends due process and the constitutional separation of powers.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Gensler vs. Gensler</h2>
<p>The document also presents a timeline of how the views of SEC Chair Gary Gensler changed on the SEC&#8217;s faculties in the cryptocurrency space. Coinbase explains that in May 2021, Gensler testified before Congress stating the SEC &#8220;lacked statutory authority to regulate businesses like Coinbase,&#8221; putting the responsibilities of this task on Congress, citing a &#8220;regulatory gap.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Gensler&#8217;s positions changed over time, and according to Coinbase, by the end of 2022, he stated: &#8220;I feel that we have enough authority, I really do, in this space,&#8221; for requiring crypto companies to register as securities exchanges.</p>
<p>About this, Coinbase&#8217;s filing declares:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The SEC also now asserts the authority to extract punitive retroactive penalties from companies for failure to recognize powers its own Chair was disclaiming two years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coinbase concluded that even if the SEC&#8217;s changes regarding securities were &#8220;colorable,&#8221; the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF12077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">major questions doctrine</a>, a U.S. legal principle that states courts will presume that Congress does not delegate to executive agencies issues of major political or economic significance, would require courts to reject this construction.</p>

The injunction also requires Ackerman to pay $27 million in restitution to defrauded victims and a civil monetary penalty of $27 million.</strong></p>
<h2>Only $10 Million Was Used to Trade Digital Commodity Assets</h2>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced on June 28 that a default judgment granting a permanent injunction has been issued against Michael Ackerman, the operator of a fraudulent digital asset trading scheme. According to the commission, the injunction granted by Naomi Reice Buchwald, a judge with a U.S. District Court, bars Ackerman from trading on regulated markets and registering with the CFTC.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8732-23?utm_source=govdelivery">statement</a> also revealed that Ackerman, who was sentenced to five years of probation with a year of home confinement in Feb. 2022, will also be required to &#8220;pay $27 million in restitution to defrauded victims.&#8221; Ackerman was further hit with a civil monetary penalty of $27 million for operating the fraudulent scheme.</p>
<p>As per the CFTC statement, the case against Ackerman stems from his alleged role in operating a fraudulent scheme which &#8220;solicited and misappropriated funds to purportedly trade digital commodity assets.&#8221; Although he managed to successfully extract an estimated $33 million from some 150 individuals and entities, Ackerman only used $10 million to trade. According to the Commission, Ackerman is thought to have used the remaining funds for &#8220;personal use or to prolong the fraudulent trading scheme.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1">
<h2>Injunction Orders May Not Lead to Recovery of Funds</h2>
<p>The CFTC also accused Ackerman of lying to his victims about the monthly returns he was generating via the fraudulent trading scheme. In order to hide the fraud, Ackerman allegedly provided his customers with &#8220;false accounting statements, newsletters containing false trading returns, and fictitious screenshots of the amount of money under management.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the CFTC also used the announcement to warn victims of fraudulent digital asset scams that injunction orders may not lead to the recovery of funds.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CFTC cautions that orders requiring payment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable,&#8221; the CFTC said.</p>

Revix said the move to block customers&#8217; access to 24% of their crypto assets was made after one of its primary service providers Haru Invest suspended deposits and withdrawals. </strong></p>
<h2>Impact of Haru Invest&#8217;s Abrupt Suspension of Deposits and Withdrawals</h2>
<p>Revix, the South African crypto investment platform, said on June 28 that it has rendered &#8220;24% of crypto asset balances held on the Revix platform as of Tuesday, 13th June, at 02:00 GMT+2 as reserved.&#8221; The decision means Revix customers can only withdraw 76% of their crypto assets which are stored on the platform.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://revix.com/blog/post/important-update">statement</a> explaining the rationale behind the move, Revix said the unexpected suspension of deposits and withdrawals by one of its primary service providers Haru Invest prompted the decision to reserve 24% of customers’ crypto assets. The statement revealed that &#8220;Haru is part of this system and holds a portion of Revix-controlled customer assets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Announcing its own decision to suspend deposit and withdrawals services, Haru Invest <a href="https://support.haruinvest.com/hc/en-us/articles/19582168987289">said</a> the recent discovery of irregularities in management reports submitted by B&amp;S Holdings had compelled it to act. Haru Invest also told its investors and customers on June 14 that it has since filed a criminal complaint against B&amp;S Holdings (formerly Aventus) and would soon follow up with a civil action.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://thebittimes.com/korean-authorities-ban-travel-for-haru-invest-delio-b-s-holdings-execs-tbt52896.html">reports</a> in South Korean media, Haru Invest’s decision to suspend services has also affected another digital exchange platform Delio. In addition, Korean authorities have imposed travel bans on some executives of B&amp;S Holdings, Delio, and Haru Invest.</p>
<h2>Customers Still Have Access to 100% of Fiat Deposits</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, in its statement, Revix characterized the decision to suspend the withdrawal of a portion of the customers’ crypto funds as the &#8220;most appropriate course of action to best mitigate the obvious adverse impact of this matter.&#8221; The exchange platform added:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have taken rigorous measures to protect them by securely moving all of our customers’ assets into protected internal custody. Customer assets — comprising 76% of their crypto holdings and 100% of their fiat cash balances — are fully accessible to customers whenever needed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Revix added that the discussions it has had with the Haru Invest team have given it hope that the crypto assets held by the South Korean platform will eventually be recovered.</p>

<h2>Accommodating Digital Assets as They Evolve</h2>
<p>The United Kingdom independent body, the Law Commission of England and Wales, has published its &#8220;recommendations for reform and development of the law on digital assets.&#8221; In a <a href="https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/new-recommendations-for-reform-and-development-of-the-law-on-digital-assets-to-secure-uks-position-as-global-crypto-hub/">statement</a>, the statutory body added that the recommendations, which seek to help secure the U.K.’s position as a global crypto hub, are intended &#8220;to provide a comprehensive legal foundation for digital assets which will allow these new technologies to flourish.&#8221;</p>
<p>The recommendations also supposedly seek to enable &#8220;a diverse range of market participants to interact with and benefit from&#8221; the tech and digital assets.</p>
<p>The Law Commission’s latest statement on digital assets came just under a year after it released a consultation paper proposing to reform the law relating to digital assets. As <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-law-commission-publishes-proposals-to-reform-laws-relating-to-digital-assets-says-reforms-must-not-stifle-development/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News in late July 2022, the commission’s publication of the consultation paper followed a request by the government asking it &#8220;to review the law on digital assets, to ensure that it can accommodate them as they continue to evolve and expand.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<h2>Ensuring the Law Remains &#8216;a Flexible Tool That Enables Further Technological Innovation&#8217;</h2>
<p>Commenting on the Commission’s digital asset regulation recommendations, Sarah Green, Law Commissioner for commercial and common law, said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Our recommendations for reform and development of the law, therefore, seek to solidify the legal foundation for digital assets. We also aim to ensure that the private law in England and Wales remains a dynamic, globally competitive and flexible tool that enables further technological innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mike Freer, the U.K. justice minister, said the findings of the consultation process show the strength of English and Welsh law &#8220;in responding to the fast-paced changes caused by emerging technologies in the law sector.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among some of the recommendations is the commission&#8217;s call for the enactment of &#8220;legislation to confirm the existence of a distinct third category of personal property under the law.&#8221; The commission also recommended the creation of a panel of experts &#8220;to provide non-binding advice to courts on complex legal issues relating to digital assets.&#8221; The creation of a tailor-made framework for facilitating the &#8220;operation and enforcement of collateral arrangements relating to crypto-tokens and crypto-assets&#8221; is also described.</p>

Milei noted that his team had signed an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with unknown third parties that would provide the liquidity needed to close the Central Bank of Argentina.</strong></p>
<h2>Javier Milei Develops Dollarization Proposal in Argentina</h2>
<p>Javier Milei, a liberal presidential candidate in Argentina, has advanced his government plan to eliminate inflation in the country if elected. He stated he already has the funds to dollarize the economy at current market prices.</p>
<p>Milei, who has made dollarization a pivotal part of his government plan, <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei/status/1673814833328791554?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While they attack, defame, operate, etc., we have been advancing in negotiations and we have already obtained the dollars to dollarize the economy at the value of the market dollar. We continue working to solve a big problem in Argentina, which is inflation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Milei <a href="https://twitter.com/MJMendezCasarie/status/1674016062738759680" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that he and his team had signed a confidentiality agreement with undisclosed third parties to provide the means necessary for the dollarization process. He estimated that the nation could collect <a href="https://twitter.com/ElPelucaMilei/status/1674199176433762305?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">double</a> the dollars needed to withdraw all the Argentine pesos from circulation, closing the Central Bank of Argentina.</p>
<p>Milei is also <a href="https://www.infobae.com/politica/2023/06/27/javier-milei-aseguro-que-ya-consiguio-los-fondos-para-dolarizar-al-valor-del-mercado/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1687908059" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing</a> the law project that will be presented to the Argentine congress and estimating the time for the implementation of this initiative. Milei noted that his first proposal required at least two and a half years to be adopted, while new dollarization formats currently being designed demand less time to be put into practice.</p>

<h2>Numbers and Feasibility</h2>
<p>The dollarization idea, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/argentina-debates-dollarization-in-the-midst-of-rampant-devaluation-and-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presented</a> to the public in April as a way out of the inflationary and devaluation crisis, has faced criticism from all angles of the political spectrum. Some economists have spoken against it, stating that it would be impossible to cement during the current economic reality of the country.</p>
<p>However, Milei believes economists have greatly overestimated the numbers associated with this process. He <a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei/status/1674027904827523072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They said that [dollarization] was crazy impossible, $70 billion was needed. After, it was $50 billion. Someone close to them told them that although it was difficult, it was feasible. Now it&#8217;s about $35 billion. If they knew about finance a long time ago, they would have realized that it is possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Milei&#8217;s position on polls has fallen, now <a href="https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/como-saldra-milei-en-agosto-segun-las-ultimas-encuestas-con-los-candidatos-confirmados/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing</a> him in the third position after Sergio Massa, the economy minister of Argentina and a key figure in the current economic establishment, announced he would join the presidential race.</p>

The stock has been viewed as a source of funds that can be used to compensate customers who suffered losses as a result of the coin trading platform’s collapse. </strong></p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchange FTX Postpones Sale of Anthropic Shares</h2>
<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has decided to hold off the sale of its stake in the AI company Anthropic. The stock, worth $500 million, has been among the exchange’s most sought-after assets, Bloomberg noted in a report.</p>
<p>According to sources who chose to remain anonymous, bidders have been informed this month about the pause by Perella Weinberg Partners, the financial services firm acting as an advisor in FTX’s bankruptcy which was looking to sell the Anthropic shares.</p>
<p>The AI startup was established in 2021 by former employees of Openai, the developer of the chatbot <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/over-100000-compromised-chatgpt-accounts-discovered-on-darknet-markets/">Chatgpt</a>. In May of this year, Anthropic announced it had raised $450 million to support the development of its AI bot named ‘Claude.’</p>
<p>Anthropic has been recently valued at $4.6 billion and secondary market buyers have been seeking to acquire shares of the company. FTX’s stake in the AI firm is one of the biggest investments made by what was one the largest digital asset exchanges.</p>
<p>FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection amid liquidity issues in November 2022. The sale of the Anthropic stake was halted a day after FTX’s new CEO, John J Ray III, accused the former management of the crypto company of misappropriating assets, Forbes remarked in an article.</p>
<p>Some of the political donations and venture capital investments made by FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), its founder and former chief executive, have been partially funded by commingled customer deposits, according to a report published by the exchange’s new management this week.</p>
<p>FTX and SBF’s crypto trading firm Alameda Research made the $500 million investment in Anthropic, according to the internal documents seen by Bloomberg. At this point, it remains unclear how long the sale of the stake in the AI startup will be delayed.</p>

The news comes when the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange finds itself under pressure from regulators and banking partners in Europe and elsewhere.</strong></p>
<h2>Paysafe to Stop Euro Deposits and Withdrawals for Binance</h2>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance, the global leader in terms of daily trading volume, will lose access to payments in the common European currency, another setback for its operations on the Old Continent that comes amid regulatory crackdown in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“Following a strategic review, we have taken the decision to cease offering our embedded wallet solution to Binance across the region,” its U.K.-based payment processor, Paysafe, said in a statement, quoted by Bloomberg. The company added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paysafe and Binance are now working to mutually implement an orderly and fair process to terminate this service over the next few months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paysafe will no longer support bank transfers of euros to and from Binance via the Single Euro Payments Area (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEPA</a>) network, starting from Sept. 25, a spokesperson for the exchange confirmed. Binance “will be changing the provider,” the representative pointed out and emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>All methods of depositing and withdrawing other fiat currencies as well as buying and selling crypto on Binance.com remain unaffected.</p></blockquote>
<p>The development coincides with increased pressure on Binance in some EU member states. The exchange was recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-ordered-to-cease-all-crypto-services-in-belgium/">ordered</a> to cease all crypto services in Belgium while French prosecutors are <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/french-investigation-targets-binance-allegations-of-money-laundering-and-regulatory-violations/">investigating</a> it for money laundering violations.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Binance <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-pulls-out-of-netherlands-seeks-to-deregister-cyprus-unit/">pulled out</a> of the Dutch market, after failing to obtain registration as a crypto service provider in the Netherlands, applied for deregistration in Cyprus as such, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-unit-in-britain-cancels-uk-regulatory-authorization/">cancelled</a> its U.K. authorization to focus on fewer regulated entities in Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform’s share of euro-denominated crypto trading has dropped to 13% this year, according to data from research firm Kaiko. The market share of Binance’s subsidiary in the in the U.S., where the exchange is engaged in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-cz-agree-to-repatriate-us-customer-assets-sec-secures-court-order/">legal battle</a> with the securities regulator, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-us-market-share-shrinks-amid-legal-battle-with-sec/">fell</a> to 1.5%.</p>
<p>In March, Paysafe announced it would stop supporting withdrawals and deposits for  in the United Kingdom and did so in May, which resulted in a subsequent drop of crypto trading volume denominated in the British pound across multiple platforms. At the time, the London-headquartered company said it would continue to support transfers for Binance in Europe and Latin America.</p>

<h2>Mastercard Unveils Multi-Token Network</h2>
<p>Raj Dhamodharan, Mastercard&#8217;s head of crypto and blockchain, announced in a blog post on Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, we are taking the next step on our journey with the introduction of Mastercard Multi-Token Network, a tailor-made solution for the industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Our vision for MTN is to provide a set of foundational capabilities designed to make transactions within the digital asset and blockchain ecosystems secure, scalable, and interoperable — ultimately enabling more efficient payment and commerce applications,” he explained.</p>
<p>The new Multi-Token Network is an “app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications,” the executive told Fortune. The platform will provide developers with access to a range of tools that Mastercard has been developing in recent months, the publication conveyed, adding that these tools include a private version of the Ethereum blockchain, which Mastercard will promote for developers to build innovative applications.</p>
<p>The beta version of MTN will be released in the U.K. this summer, which will serve as a testing platform “for developing live pilot applications and use cases with financial institutions, fintechs, and central banks,” Dhamodharan&#8217;s blog post adds.</p>
<p>“The first phase of the applications will be powered by tokenized bank deposits. Over time, we plan to make MTN available in additional markets around the world,” the executive noted, emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>MTN represents one of Mastercard’s most ambitious projects in the digital asset space to date … Our goal is to support the wider digital asset industry and interested parties to help fortify confidence in its future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dhamodharan explained that Mastercard believes that one day, digital asset and blockchain technologies will become &#8220;critical infrastructure for storing and moving value.&#8221;</p>
<p>The payment giant has actively engaged in multiple crypto, blockchain, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) projects, including crypto cards, CBDC pilots, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mastercard-debuts-blockchain-surveillance-tool-for-banks-and-crypto-centric-card-issuers/">Crypto Secure</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/mastercard-to-help-banks-offer-crypto-trading-executive-says-crypto-is-on-the-cusp-of-really-going-mainstream/">Crypto Source</a>, and <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/latin-america/en/newsroom/press-releases/pr-en/2023/april/mastercard-launches-mastercard-crypto-credential-bringing-more-trust-to-the-blockchain-ecosystem/">Crypto Credential</a>. The company also recently filed a new <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hsbc-mastercard-file-more-crypto-related-trademark-applications/">trademark application</a> covering a range of crypto products and services.</p>

The bill appropriates $50,000 from the state’s general fund to study three areas, including “The process of acquiring, securely storing, insuring, and liquidating … virtual currency, such as bitcoin, that may be held on behalf of the state.”</strong></p>
<h2>North Carolina Explores Holding Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The U.S. state of North Carolina has advanced House Bill 721 (HB721) titled “State Precious Metals Depository Study.” The bill appropriates $50,000 from the state’s general fund, which is made up of tax revenues, excluding transportation, to the state treasurer to conduct a study that examines three key areas. The first area involves:</p>
<blockquote><p>The process of acquiring, securely storing, insuring, and liquidating … virtual currency, such as bitcoin, that may be held on behalf of the state.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second area is the “expected impact of allocating a portion of the general fund” to “virtual currency to hedge against inflation and systemic credit risks, reduce overall portfolio volatility, and increase portfolio returns over time.”</p>
<p>The third is the “costs, benefits, and security of utilizing a privately managed depository or another state&#8217;s depository or creating a state-administered depository in North Carolina to serve as the custodian, guardian, and administrator of … virtual currency that may be transferred to or otherwise acquired by this state or an agency, a political subdivision, or another instrumentality of this state and to provide a repository for investors to use for such assets.”</p>
<p>Dan Spuller, senior director of Industry Affairs at Blockchain Association, <a href="https://twitter.com/DanSpuller/status/1674136730847399943">tweeted</a> Wednesday:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a very important step to a more formal acknowledgement of bitcoin in North Carolina.</p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, HB721 did not include digital assets or bitcoin. Spuller <a href="https://twitter.com/DanSpuller/status/1669335062821629952">tweeted</a> on June 15 that he testified at the NC House Standing Committee in support of adding digital assets custody and bitcoin to the bill.</p>
<p>HB721 requires the NC Department of State Treasurer to report on the results of the study and provide recommendations to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations by Jan. 1, 2024. The NC House passed the bill on the third reading on Wednesday. On Thursday, the bill passed the NC Senate&#8217;s first reading and is now referred to the Committee on Rules and Operations of the Senate.</p>

On social media, it has called out companies like Fidelity, Blackrock, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs, stating their actions propping up climate-destroying technologies are &#x201C;unacceptable.&#x201D;</strong></p>&#13;
<h2>Change the Code Rails Against Wall Street Incumbents</h2>&#13;
<p>Change The Code, a campaign that seeks to change Bitcoin&#x2019;s consensus algorithm to &#x201C;fix&#x201D; its energy consumption, has called out Wall Street companies for their support of Bitcoin activities. The initiative, backed by Greenpeace and EWG, has criticized the recent push of financial incumbents toward Bitcoin-related investments.</p>&#13;
<p>Change The Code <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1674106138877411330?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> that Fidelity, Blackrock, Vanguard, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citi held shares in 24 mining companies valued at over $1.35 billion, <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1674106138877411330?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accusing</a> Wall Street of &#x201C;going all in on Bitcoin&#x201D; and directly supporting these activities.</p>&#13;
<p>It <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1673474473150885888?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>The climate movement has worked to hold financial institutions and banks accountable for their fossil fuel investments. Propping up and profiting from industries destroying our climate is unacceptable.</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>Furthermore, Change the Code called on these incumbents to <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanUpBitcoin/status/1673836859754164224?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answer</a> for their &#x201C;dirty investments&#x201D; and &#x201C;support a code change to help <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> achieve near 100% efficiency.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<h2>Change the Code Objectives</h2>&#13;
<p>The campaign to change the code of Bitcoin was launched in March when a group of so-called green organizations and crypto groups started to create awareness of the energy requirements of the Bitcoin network and its possible effects on the environment.</p>&#13;
<p>However, the recent barrage of bitcoin-related projects backed by established financial companies, including the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-citadel-launches-with-trading-of-4-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of EDX, a cryptocurrency exchange backed by Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Paradigm, Sequoia Capital, and Virtu Financial, and the filing of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ran-neuner-believes-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-could-double-price-next-year-dismisses-malicious-intent-speculations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several</a> ETF proposals by more incumbents, has taken the campaign to the offensive, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/sharing-in-climate-chaos-asset-managers-and-banks-investment-prop-up-climate-polluting-bitcoin-mining-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that &#x201C;these companies are turning a blind eye to these investments like other fossil fuel investments perpetuating climate chaos.&#x201D;</p>&#13;
<p>The campaign advocates for Bitcoin to switch to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus that would reduce its energy consumption by almost 100%.</p>&#13;
<p>Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, completed a similar change in September as part of an update event called &#x201C;The Merge,&#x201D; which changed its network dynamics, leaving some miners out of business. The energy footprint of the protocol&#x2019;s entire operation was reduced by 99.99%, going from an <a href="https://zerocap.com/insights/articles/ethereum-energy-consumption-reduced/#:~:text=verify%20the%20transaction.-,Why%20Ethereum%20Energy%20Consumption%20Dropped%20by%2099.9%25,this%20falls%20to%20just%202%2C600." target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> 23 million megawatts of energy per year to just 2,600.</p>&#13;
