<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LBank Exchange, the global digital asset trading platform, has listed Ordinal Pepe (OPEPE). The OPEPE/USDT trading pair went live on LBank on May 26. Ordinal Pepe (OPEPE) is the first Pepe token to be issued on the Bitcoin blockchain. This dynamic fusion combines the famous Pepe frog meme with the unrivaled security of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Pepe and Ordinals are already making waves in their respective domains.

<p>OPEPE, powered by its community, seeks to replicate the joy and rewards that Pepe brought to its fans. The vision for OPEPE is to dominate the meme space and achieve deep liquidity through becoming available on leading exchanges. Backed by an innovative strategy and a tight-knit community, the Ordinals Pepe team firmly believe they can realize this ambition.</p>
