			  <description><![CDATA[<p>San Francisco, California, 18th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Today, Coinbase has listed Kava and will launch a massive Learning Rewards Campaign to educate its user base about how Kava is leading the world to Web3.</p>
<p>Kava is a decentralized layer-1 blockchain that combines the speed and interoperability of Cosmos with the developer power of Ethereum. Kava has spent the last year building a deep integration with Coinbase that optimizes the process for Cosmos SDK chains to integrate with Coinbase helping to drive new liquidity to the Cosmos ecosystem.</p>
<p>Unlocking Cosmos Liquidity
Coinbase's native integration with Kava allows for easy listing of Kava ecosystem projects, KAVA staking on Coinbase, and unlocks DeFi usage for Coinbase users on Kava. Additionally, Kava worked with the Coinbase team to make it significantly easier for Cosmos chains to list on the exchange, unlocking access to liquidity for Cosmos projects and further driving the adoption and growth of the entire Cosmos ecosystem. The entire process whittles the timeline for integrating Cosmos SDK chains to Coinbase from 12-18 months to a single month. Cosmos chains can now be integrated as easily as ERC-20 tokens. A major step forward to increasing liquidity within the Cosmos Ecosystem</p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to see Kava listed on the largest US-regulated exchange. Coinbase sets the standard as the most important on-ramp for new users and capital into the blockchain ecosystem. I look forward to growing Kava&rsquo;s exposure to new users, which will have downstream effects for all protocols in the Kava Rise program and the Cosmos ecosystem.&rdquo; &mdash; Scott Stuart, CEO of Kava Labs
<p>Fueling Protocol Growth with Kava Rise</p>
<p>Kava was built from the ground up to optimize its resources for protocol growth, strengthened by its Cosmos-EVM technology that enables maximum scalability, speed, security, and developer support. In 2022, Kava combined on-chain and off-chain growth mechanisms into a single developer incentive program called Kava Rise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kava Rise aims to set a new standard for enabling growth and demand for thousands of Web3 protocols. Builders earn a share of Kava Rise's $750M developer incentive fund via the program's blockchain-based distribution method, designed to reward the top protocols every month based on usage. More than 50 protocols like Curve Finance, Sushi, and Beefy Finance have collectively brought more than $15M TVL into the ecosystem, showcasing the program&rsquo;s ability to enable protocols to grow and thrive regardless of market conditions.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The United States Treasury Department and Department of Justice (DOJ) today announced that they have arrested the founder and majority owner of crypto exchange Bitzlato and have shut down the exchange. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Bitzlato Limited, has been designated as a primary money-laundering concern by U.S. authorities and has arrested its founder, Anatoly Legkodymov. Legkodymov has been charged for allegedly facilitating money laundering for criminals. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Treasury Department designated Bitzlato under a section of the USA Patriot Act, a law aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing, for allegedly laundering illicit funds for Russian-based ransomware actors.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, The Hong Kong-based exchange operates globally and has allegedly exchanged more than $700 million in cryptocurrency with Hydra Market, a darknet marketplace that was shut down in 2022. The DOJ added that Bitzlato received more than $15 million of ransomware proceeds.</p>
<p>U.S Attorney Breon Peace commented:</p>

<p>Institutions that trade in cryptocurrency are not above the law and their owners are not beyond our reach. As alleged, Bitzlato sold itself to criminals as a no-questions-asked cryptocurrency exchange, and reaped hundreds of millions of dollars&rsquo; worth of deposits as a result. The defendant is now paying the price for the malign role that his company played in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<p>Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said:</p>

<p>Today the Department of Justice dealt a significant blow to the cryptocrime ecosystem. Adding, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s actions send the clear message: Whether you break our laws from China or Europe&mdash;or abuse our financial system from a tropical island&mdash;you can expect to answer for your crimes inside a United States courtroom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Legkodymov, the founder and majority owner of the exchange, was arrested on Tuesday evening in Miami, Florida, and is a 40-year-old Russian national living in Shenzhen, China. Legkodymov is scheduled to appear in a federal court in Miami on Wednesday.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Maintains Upward Bias:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 19 January 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) maintained positive technical sentiment early in the Asian session as the pair established a new multi-month high around the 21650.21 level after Stops were elected above the 21478.80 area, a relative high from early November 2022.&nbsp; The latest push higher was supported by buying pressure around the 20844.73 level, representing a test of the 38.2% retracement of the depreciating range from 25214.57 to 18131.&nbsp; BTC/USD recently absorbed the 21465.62 area before giving back some gains, representing a test of the 61.8% retracement of the depreciating range from 25214.57 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;Major Stops were recently elected above the 19856.70 and 20947.28 areas en route to the ongoing relative highs, upside price objectives related to buying pressure that emerged around the 16326.16 and 17315.08 areas.&nbsp; Stops were also triggered above the 20190.78 area during the ascent, representing the 78.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460, and this level recently served as technical support during a pullback.</p>
<p>BTC/USD bulls are eyeing the 21920, 23127.09, and 23196.08 levels as areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure, related to historical selling pressure that emerged around the 25214.57, 32371, and 48240 levels.&nbsp; Stops were also recently elected above the 19260.93 area, an important upside price objective related to buying pressure that emerged around the 15460 and 16273.40 levels.&nbsp; Following the recent move higher to multi-month highs, technical support levels and areas of potential buying pressure are around the 20026, 19153, 18448, 17743, 16870, and 16739 levels.&nbsp; Below current price activity, technically significant areas include the 15900, 15512, 15313, 14500, 14364, 13369, 10727, 10432, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 19519.21 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 21185.37.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18390.99/ 16714.46/ 14500.15 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;21870.79/ 22912.49/ 23127.09 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bearishly below MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bullishly above MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Decentralised finance, or DeFi, is quickly gaining traction as a new way to access financial services. However, some experts argue that the DeFi movement should not be viewed as a direct attack on traditional finance, but rather as a complementary addition to it.</p>
<p>One of those experts is Ava Labs CEO Emin G&uuml;n Sirer, who recently spoke in an interview with CoinTelegraph at the World Economic Forum in Davos about the role of DeFi in the financial ecosystem. According to Sirer, DeFi should be seen as a way to provide access to financial services to those who are currently underserved by traditional institutions.</p>
<p>"DeFi is about inclusion, not exclusion," Sirer said. "It's about providing financial services to people who have been overlooked by traditional financial institutions."</p>
<p>Sirer went on to explain that DeFi can play a crucial role in helping to bridge the gap between the "have" and "have-nots" in the financial world. He argued that DeFi can provide access to financial services to people in developing countries and other underserved communities, allowing them to participate in the global economy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Sirer emphasised that DeFi can also benefit traditional finance by providing new opportunities for innovation and increased competition. He noted that DeFi can help to spur innovation in the financial industry by providing new ways to access and use financial services.</p>
<p>"DeFi is not a threat to traditional finance," Sirer said. "It's an opportunity to create a more inclusive and innovative financial system."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>2023 has started with a win for the crypto market. As many fan-favorite cryptocurrencies have increased in price, new projects like Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) have taken the market by storm with regular price increases since October 2022. </p>
<p>With the market bouncing back, investors are asking which investment options will be the best for the new year. Here&rsquo;s why Tron (TRON) and Orbeon Protocol are must-haves for 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol Forecasted For a 6000% Increase During Presale</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) first made headlines in October 2022 after a strong first-round presale, despite the declining crypto market. 3 months later and Orbeon Protocol has continued to rise in price, with one ORBN being worth $0.0435. </p>
<p>So how is Orbeon Protocol beating market trends?</p>
<p>Firstly, Orbeon Protocol has a unique use case. Unlike many new projects which build on the hype of the market, Orbeon Protocol has created its own path, looking to tackle issues in the crowdfunding industry.</p>
<p>The crowdfunding market is currently monopolized by venture capitalists, who demand huge percentages of startups for funding. Orbeon Protocol offers a funding alternative with its multi-chain DeFi launchpad. </p>
<p>With the Orbeon Launchpad, startups can raise funds using NFTs. Here&rsquo;s how it works. </p>
<p>A vetted business starts by creating equity-backed NFTs representing shares in their business (for example, 1 NFT = 1 share.) These NFTs are sold directly to investors and held in decentralized Orbeon Wallets. </p>
<p>Startups are required to set funding targets before selling NFTs, which are used as part of OrbeonProtocols' &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; security mechanism. If a startup hits its target, the contract is &ldquo;Filled,&rdquo; and funds are released. However, if targets are missed, the contract is &ldquo;Killed,&rdquo; and investors are refunded. This creates a solution that supports startups while protecting investors. </p>
<p>To guarantee investor safety, Orbeon Protocol has locked ORBN liquidity for a decade and team tokens are locked for one year to prevent any risk of a rug pull. The Orbeon Protocol smart contract has also been audited by Solid Proof to guarantee the legitimacy of the project. </p>
<p>ORBN has a total supply of 888 million, and 40% of its supply will be sold to the public during the presale. The additional supply will be used for exchange listings, team tokens, reserve tokens, marketing, legal advice, and the Orbeon foundation.</p>
<p>Investors who get in early will have access to a number of bonuses, including staking rewards, governance rights, priority access to funding rounds, and access to an exclusive VIP investor group known as the &ldquo;Winners Circle.&rdquo; With so much to offer, experts speculate Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) could surge 6000% from its initial price of $0.004, hitting highs of $0.24 before the end of its presale.</p>
<p class="s9">Tron Community Rallies After Price Stabilization</p>
<p>Tron is a unique blockchain-based project in that it didn&rsquo;t bring anything new to the market upon release in 2017. Instead, Tron combined the best tried and tested features to enhance user experience and design. </p>
<p>Predominantly focused on the Asia market, Tron heavily advertised its founder, Justin Sun, to build a community of supporters with great success. So much so that in 2018, the Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer content-based platform. </p>
<p>Tron's native token, TRON, remained stable over the past month with a 0.24% price increase. Now, investors speculate that TRON could bounce back in price in 2023, reaching its previous all-time high of $0.2317. </p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Kyiv, Ukraine, 18th January, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Cross-chain prime brokerage protocol Primex Finance rolls out a major update to its application. Launching in two stages, Beta 0.3.0 introduces a variety of new features, as well as improvements and fixes of existing functionalities.</p>
<p>Starting on January 12th, 2023, Phase 1 was exclusively available for Primex Early Users, who could be the first to have a hands-on experience with Beta 0.3.0. From now on, Early Users will get privileged access to all major protocol updates in the future (beginning from Beta 0.3.0). In addition to the chance to test new releases before other community members, participants of the program also enjoy further benefits, such as direct communication with the Primex team and fellow Early Users via Discord, as well as the ability to participate in private challenges and earn exclusive prizes.</p>
<p>On January 18th, 2023, the Primex team will open access for the public to Beta 0.3.0, allowing anyone to launch the application and test the new release without restrictions.</p>
<p>Beta 0.3.0 introduces four new core features. As the first and the most important, Primex now deploys to two new blockchains: the Polygon Mumbai and Polygon zkEVM testnets. Consequently, users can now test Primex by trading and lending digital assets on DEXs across four different blockchains (Ethereum Goerli, zkSync 2.0 testnet, Polygon Mumbai, and Polygon zkEVM testnet). With the new multi-chain functionality, traders and lenders can now swap between different networks via a single interface.</p>
<p>"When we asked our community which chains we should deploy Primex on, Polygon was by far the top choice among voters. While we were happy about the results, they didn't come as a surprise for our team. Mumbai is the testnet of Polygon PoS, the Layer 2 blockchain with the highest DeFi TVL that can achieve up to 7,000 TPS. On the other hand, zkEVM is a newer solution that uses ZK-rollups via the ultra-fast Polygon Zero technology to achieve a 90% fee reduction for users on Ethereum's L2. For these reasons, it makes great sense to deploy Primex on the testnets of these two blockchains," said Vlad Kostanda, Primex Finance's Co-Founder.</p>
<p>Besides the above core features, the Primex team introduced additional changes to the protocol as part of the Beta 0.3.0 update, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Support for the OKX Wallet, which users can now utilize to connect their wallets to Primex alongside MetaMask and WalletConnect</li>
  <li>The integration of the QuickSwap v2 DEX on Polygon Mumbai</li>
  <li>Enhanced trading experience via a new bot that periodically synchronizes asset prices on the testnet with the mainnet</li>
  <li>Improved UX for downloading trading history</li>
  <li>The ability to see the date and time when an order or position was created on the trading page</li>
  <li>Bug fixes related to the translation of the Primex application's certain components and translation delays after a user switches between languages</li>
  <li>Additional optimizations and bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<p>About Primex Finance</p>
<p>Founded in 2021, Primex Finance is the first-ever cross-chain prime brokerage protocol that seeks to solve the DeFi market&rsquo;s liquidity fragmentation issue by enabling spot margin trading backed by lenders across numerous DEXs and blockchains with a totally decentralized trade execution mechanism. In September 2022, the team advanced to the next stage of its roadmap by launching the platform&rsquo;s Beta release. Recently, the project rolled out Beta 0.3.0, a major update to the protocol introducing a wide range of important features, functionalities, and fixes.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency giant, Digital Currency Group (DCG) has halted its quarterly dividend payments in an effort to conserve cash and improve its balance sheet. </p>
<p>DCG, parent company to the struggling cryptocurrency trading firm Genesis, and headed by Barry Silbert, has suspended the payout of its quarterly dividends according to a letter to shareholders seen by CoinDesk. DCG said in the shareholder letter:</p>

<p>In response to the current market environment, DCG has been focused on strengthening our balance sheet by reducing operating expenses and preserving liquidity. As such, we have made the decision to suspend DCG's quarterly dividend distribution until further notice.</p>

<p>DCG owns numerous crypto companies including Genesis, CoinDesk, and others.</p>
DCG Under Severe Pressure
<p>The company&rsquo;s financial issues stem from the woes of one of its subsidiaries &ndash; crypto broker Genesis Global Trading, which reportedly owes its creditors over $3 billion. Early in January, Genesis laid off 30% of its workforce and is considering bankruptcy. Customer withdrawals are currently suspended after Genesis halted withdrawals on November 16. DCG CEO Barry Silbert, has been embroiled in negotiations with entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose crypto exchange Gemini offered a lending product called &ldquo;Earn&rdquo; in partnership with Genesis, but which has since fallen apart because Genesis halted withdrawals. Genesis halting withdrawals has prompted Cameron Winklevoss to call on the board of directors of DCG to remove Silbert as CEO of the firm. DCG is also reportedly under investigation by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and SEC for internal transfers between DCG and Genesis.</p>
Genesis and Gemini Charged by the SEC
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week charged Genesis and Gemini for allegedly selling unregistered securities. The charges relate to &ldquo;Earn,&rdquo; the high-yield product that promised customers yields of up to 8%. The SEC claims that Genesis loaned Gemini users&rsquo; cryptocurrencies and sent a portion of the profits back to Gemini, which then deducted an agent fee, sometimes over 4%, and returned the remaining profits to its users. &nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Global-focused crypto fund HashKey Capital, is considered one of the most prominent VC firms in crypto circles, per The Block's Digital Asset Funding Landscape report.</p>
<p>The growth of cryptocurrency as an industry has attracted substantial attention from venture firms. In the report by The Block, over 6,300 funding deals have been tracked over the past six years. Throughout the analysis, HashKey Capital pops up regularly, making them one of the biggest contributors to cryptocurrency projects.</p>
<p>To date, the group has invested in 321 different cryptocurrency projects. That puts HashKey Capital on even footing with Animoca Brands, Polygon Studios, Shima Capital, and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, there is clear support from venture capitalists concerning digital assets. In addition, there is strong attention to ongoing developments and projects that can make a long-term impact. More importantly, the digital asset industry represents roughly 8% of all VC-based tech investments throughout 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite industry setbacks and ongoing market volatility, VCs remain keen on digital assets. The potential to upend the current status quo and ongoing technological developments create an attractive situation. That momentum has resulted in over $73.8 billion invested by VCs, primarily through pre-Series A and late-stage deals.</p>

<p>"Venture Capital has been a major driving force behind the rapid development of digital assets. In the last six years alone, over 6,000 VC deals were closed. We believe that this trend will continue and despite the bear market, significant capital (from around the globe) will gather here and when the next cycle comes, these investments will pay off. The Block's report provides a comprehensive analysis of these deals and a reference to understanding the crypto industry over the past six years." said Deng Chao, CEO of HashKey Capital.</p>

<p>Like other venture capitalists, HashKey Capital pays close attention to NFTs, blockchain gaming, infrastructure, DeFi, Crypto Financial Services, and Web3. Especially the latter sector notes a healthy influx of VC funding over the past three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the findings by The Block confirm overall investments in crypto and blockchain don't always correlate with asset prices. Whether in a bull or bear market, dedicated teams will continue to build protocols, products, and services. While 2022 was a bad year for crypto prices, it also noted the most VC deals by Q3 of that year, setting a new record.</p>
<p>As VCs like HashKey Capital continue to double down on crypto and blockchain, the landscape has become a bit more competitive. Projects based in the United States raise the most money through the highest number of deals. However, Europe has made a strong push and continues to note healthy growth in VC deals since 2019, primarily thanks to a shift in regulatory attitude. Asia is the go-to hub for NFT and gaming projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Venture capitalists have also contributed to scaling solutions, providers of Bitcoin products, and multichain projects. Multichain solutions are a prominent trend in decentralized finance, where almost half of the top 100 projects work across two or more blockchains.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>22,000 monthly active developers are building in the crypto sector, and their numbers are increasing 5% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The 2022 Electric Capital Developer Report is a comprehensive examination of the current state of the crypto developer community. Using data from 250 million code commits across open-source repositories, the report provides a detailed snapshot of the growth and activity of crypto developers over the past seven years.</p>
<p>The report's executive summary highlights that, 14 years into the creation of open-source crypto, the number of monthly active developers has grown significantly. In the first seven years, just 1,000 monthly active developers wrote code. In the last seven years, however, that number has grown to over 22,000.</p>
<p>As of December 2022, the report states that there are now 23,343 crypto monthly active developers. Despite a 70%+ decline in prices, monthly active developers grew by 5% year-over-year. Additionally, there are 471,000+ monthly code commits made towards open-source crypto, with an 8% YoY growth in full-time developers.</p>
<p>The report also notes that the crypto network value is back to January 2018 levels, but monthly active developers have increased by 297% since 2018. Comparing the previous crypto winter to today, the report shows that the number of Bitcoin monthly active developers has grown from 372 to 946, and Ethereum monthly active developers have grown from 1,084 to 5,819. Other ecosystems such as Solana, Polkadot, Cosmos, and Polygon have also seen significant growth, going from fewer than 200 developers to over 1,000.</p>
<p>The report also highlights the emergence of major ecosystems beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. 72% of monthly active developers now work outside of these ecosystems, with Solana, NEAR, and Polygon growing 40% YoY and having over 500 total monthly active developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other ecosystems such as Sui, Aptos, Starknet, Mina, Osmosis, Hedera, Optimism, and Arbitrum have also grown by 50%+ YoY and have 100+ total monthly active developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, 3,901 developers work in DeFi every month across multiple chains, a 240% increase since DeFi summer. 50% of DeFi developers are now outside of Ethereum.</p>
<p>The report also notes that 900+ developers now write code monthly in NFTs across chains, a 299% increase since 2021.</p>
<p>The report concludes by stressing that developer engagement is an early and leading indicator of value creation in emerging platforms. As crypto is significantly open source, the report argues that understanding the crypto developer community is crucial in understanding an emerging industry that may be worth many trillions.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Since it is distributed and unchangeable, a blockchain-based ledger makes it difficult to falsify transactions without alerting all stakeholders. Using the built-in capabilities of distributed ledger technology, the whole transaction history may be accessed with relative ease.</p>
<p>Further, the aforementioned commodities trade procedures benefit from blockchain's inherent capacity to generate and transfer digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smart contracts have the ability to eliminate delays and automate tedious operations thanks to the real-time transactions and data they enable. Businesses suffer financial losses and missed opportunities as a result of widespread inefficiencies in the commodities trade industry. Here the amalgamation of trading and blockchain technology cone to the rescue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses, investors, and everyone else involved in the commodities trading process can benefit from blockchain technology as it becomes more widely used.</p>
Trading And Blockchain Technology: Shedding Some Light To Trade Finance
<p>Banks, financial firms, institutional investors, and funds receive an estimated 30 percent of the gain from trade financing on the $4.4 trillion commodities markets. Specifically for trade inflows to and from emerging nations, the $1.6 trillion gap between demand and supply for trade finance was highlighted by the Asian Development Bank as a key development area for the global trade finance sector.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This gap originates through know-your-customer (KYC) and regulatory difficulties as well as declining margins due to labor-intensive expenditures (operational, KYC, proper research).</p>
<p>Problems with the Know Your Customer (KYC) and compliance requirements process can be solved with the help of distributed ledger technology, such as Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple parties can track transactions in near real-time because of blockchain networks' transparent ledger and historical record. Permissioned blockchain consortiums can help regulatory authorities with anti-money laundering and audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last but not least, blockchain could improve supply (alternative financiers) and demand (businesses) for trade finance.</p>
The Advances In International Trade&nbsp;
<p>The global market for international trade is estimated to be about $16 trillion, including all cross-border purchases and sales of products and services. Basically, it may be broken down into two groups:</p>
<p>75% percent of all items are transported by transport and warehousing or the ground.</p>
<p>In terms of percentage, commodities make up 25%.</p>
<p>Lack of trust and cooperation between both exporters and importers, especially between emerging to developed markets, is a major problem for the trade and financial business from the perspective of the shipping and transportation sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the intricate nature of business procedures involved in the global exchange of products and commodities, the industry as a whole continues to suffer from a number of operational inefficiencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples include the shipping and trade industries, which continue to rely primarily on human labor and are impacted by manual, paper-based operations that are expensive, time-consuming, and prone to error.</p>
<p>The inability of exporters and importers to get financing or guarantees for their transactions stunts development and reduces the advantages of globalization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although some technologies, such as Commodities Trading &amp; Risk Management (CTRM) systems, have proven effective, this sector has historically been particularly resistant to improvements in technology and digitization.</p>
What Kind Of An Effect Will Blockchain Have On Track And Trace?
<p>Participants who use supply chain networks can benefit from increased transparency afforded by blockchain technology as well as a centralized truth repository.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sending and receiving of goods could be sped up with the help of blockchain technology, which enables the intelligent tracing and tracking of orders, commodities, and delays.</p>
<p>The interlinking of trading and blockchain technology has the following progressive charms;&nbsp;</p>
Digitization
<p>The majority of supply chains that are not integrated still rely on physical operations that are both insecure and wasteful. Stakeholders are able to digitize physical processes using smart contracts through the use of blockchain technology, which helps them handle these difficulties and boost efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the birth of trade assistance bots like bitcoin traders to a greater extent helped businesses in leveling up their game.&nbsp;</p>
Authenticity
<p>There are challenges involved in authenticating the goods for everyone involved: the producers, the manufacturers, the retailers, and the customers. This encourages the making of fake goods. Using blockchain technology, the instant a product is created, it is possible to link it with a non-fungible token. After that, these tokens might be used in place of digital certificates.</p>
Administration of Distribution
<p>The vast majority of brands and merchants are unable to exert any control over distribution that occurs outside of their internal channels. They will be able to utilize smart contracts, which are enabled by blockchain technology, to create precise rules for managing distribution across numerous channels.</p>
Post-Sale Services
<p>Because they do not have access to information on the origin of a product, many retailers are unable to provide complete after-sales services to their customers. These services include product recalls, warranties, and maintenance. Using blockchain technology, they are able to build extra after-sales services by utilizing product life-cycle information that is protected by smart contracts.</p>
Transparency
<p>Customers have come to demand that information regarding the products' manufacturing methods and the raw materials used in their production be open and accessible. Each participant in the supply chain is able to offer information that has been verified thanks to blockchain technology.</p>
Ownership That Can Be Backed Up
<p>Customers typically have a tough time demonstrating ownership of goods. Theft and counterfeiting both benefit from this. Customers are able to gather and maintain non-fungible tokens that are associated with actual objects, and use these coins to establish product legitimacy and ownership, hence permitting safe secondary markets. This is made possible by blockchain technology.</p>
The Bottom Line&nbsp;
<p>It is anticipated that the total cost of utilizing the system will reduce as an increasing number of firms start to utilize the technology behind blockchains. Those that are interested in streamlining their processes relating to international trade may now find blockchain to be a more viable alternative as a result of this.</p>
<p>The application of cryptocurrency technology has the capability to bring about a sea change in the way that international commerce is conducted. Blockchain is a technology to revolutionize international commerce by making it more effective and open to public scrutiny thanks to its capacity to expedite operations and cut expenses.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The commissioner of the CFTC, Caroline Pham, recently gave an interview in which she said that there are advanced discussions and meetings regarding global crypto standards happening outside of the U.S. </p>
<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Caroline Pham, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has called on global regulators to provide clearer guidance on digital assets in 2023. Pham said that discussions with global players regarding crypto regulation are ongoing, adding that many foreign discussions are taking place at the moment about global industry standards for crypto regulation.</p>
<p>Pham said:</p>

<p>[I&rsquo;ve been] going out there and talking to international policy makers on what kinds of standards can we have at a global level, how do we close gaps?&hellip;I&rsquo;ve had over 75 meetings and there&rsquo;s a very advanced discussion happening outside the United States about this.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether these meetings involved policymakers in a different jurisdiction or whether some took place within the jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Bloomberg naturally asked Pham about current events in the crypto industry, specifically mentioning Genesis and Gemini, to which she responded the issue &ldquo;is a concern.&rdquo; Pham said that regulators must think about how to &ldquo;use existing authorities to provide the clarity that&rsquo;s needed now.&rdquo; The commissioner clarified that this means identifying a crypto financial instrument and holding it to the same standards as other financial instruments. Beyond that, Pham added that it is necessary to identify frameworks that apply to non-financial crypto activities and blockchain technology to explore.</p>
<p>Above calling for global standards in crypto regulation, she added that she hopes for more guidance from U.S.-based regulators in 2023:</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is to see the CFTC and other regulators provide more guidance this year and I&rsquo;m very hopeful that perhaps we will see more clarity in the United States.</p>

<p>[I&rsquo;ve been] going out there and talking to international policy makers on what kinds of standards can we have at a global level, how do we close gaps?&hellip;I&rsquo;ve had over 75 meetings and there&rsquo;s a very advanced discussion happening outside the United States about this.</p>

<p>It is unclear whether these meetings involved policymakers in a different jurisdiction or whether some took place within the jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Bloomberg naturally asked Pham about current events in the crypto industry, specifically mentioning Genesis and Gemini, to which she responded the issue &ldquo;is a concern.&rdquo; Pham said that regulators must think about how to &ldquo;use existing authorities to provide the clarity that&rsquo;s needed now.&rdquo; The commissioner clarified that this means identifying a crypto financial instrument and holding it to the same standards as other financial instruments. Beyond that, Pham added that it is necessary to identify frameworks that apply to non-financial crypto activities and blockchain technology to explore.</p>
<p>Above calling for global standards in crypto regulation, she added that she hopes for more guidance from U.S.-based regulators in 2023:</p>

<p>What I&rsquo;d like to do is to see the CFTC and other regulators provide more guidance this year and I&rsquo;m very hopeful that perhaps we will see more clarity in the United States.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>$323 million from FTX and $90 million from FTX US have been classified as &ldquo;unauthorised third party transactions&rdquo; since the bankruptcy petition.</p>
<p>In a Press Release published on Tuesday, FTX Trading Ltd. and its affiliated debtors announced that they have identified approximately $5.5 billion of liquid assets in the wake of their recent chapter 11 filing. This includes $1.7 billion of cash, $3.5 billion of crypto assets and $0.3 billion of securities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement came after a meeting with the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, during which a presentation was shared outlining the details of the assets and property of the FTX Debtors.</p>
<p>However, the FTX Debtors also confirmed that there is a substantial shortfall of digital assets at both the FTX.com and FTX US exchanges. To make matters worse, $323 million was identified as &ldquo;unauthorised transactions&rdquo; from FTX since the bankruptcy filing, and $90 million disappeared from FTX US in the same manner.</p>
<p>At FTX.com, the FTX Debtors have identified approximately $1.6 billion of digital assets associated with the exchange as of the petition date, which is substantially less than the aggregate third-party customer balances suggested by the electronic ledger for the exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, at the FTX US exchange, the FTX Debtors have identified approximately $181 million of digital assets, also substantially less than the aggregate third-party customer balances suggested by the electronic ledger.</p>
<p>The FTX Debtors have also confirmed that some of the digital assets have been transferred to third parties, while others have been transferred to cold storage under the control of various entities such as The Securities Commission of The Bahamas and the FTX Debtors themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FTX Debtors are continuing their efforts to secure assets that may be associated with the exchanges and to trace digital assets back to the exchanges wherever possible. John J. Ray III, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Restructuring Officer of the FTX Debtors said:</p>

<p>"We are making important progress in our efforts to maximize recoveries, and it has taken a Herculean investigative effort from our team to uncover this preliminary information,"&nbsp;</p>

<p>He added:</p>

<p>"We ask our stakeholders to understand that this information is still preliminary and subject to change. We will provide additional information as soon as we are able to do so."</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Embattled crypto lender Vauld has been granted an extension on the period of creditor protection by a Singapore court to February 28, 2023. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency lending platform, Vauld&rsquo;s period of creditor protection has been extended by a court in Singapore to give it more time to work on its restructuring plan. The court extended the period of protection to February 28 after it initially had until January 20 to present a restricting plan. Vauld halted customer withdrawals in July and approached a Singapore court seeking temporary protection from its creditors so that it can work on the business and put it in a better shape to withstand the harsh market conditions. As of July, last year, Vauld owed its creditors $402 million, 90% of which originated from individual retail investor deposits.</p>
<p>In August 2022, the company was granted a three-month reprieve from creditors after it initially requested a six-month moratorium.</p>
<p>After freezing customer withdrawals and hiring advisers to explore its restructuring, it received bids from two digital-asset fund managers to take over management of the tokens stuck on its platform. Vauld has also been in talks with London-based crypto lender Nexo, which has offered to acquire 100% of Vauld so that it can expand its reach in the Asian markets. According to reports by Bloomberg, Vauld said that will not proceed with any deal with Nexo as the lender said the deal would not be in its creditors&rsquo; best interest.</p>
<p>Vauld was dealt another blow in August when the Indian Enforcement Directorate (ED) froze the crypto and bank assets of the company to the tune of $46 million.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced that it will be suspending all its operations in Japan due to volatile market conditions.</p>
<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase Global Inc. announced on Wednesday via a blog post that it will halt its operations in Japan due to a volatile and unpredictable market. According to the company&rsquo;s announcement, all Coinbase Japan customers have until February 16, 2023, to withdraw their cryptocurrency and fiat holdings. Coinbase added that the fiat deposit functionality will be removed on January 20, 2023.</p>

<p>Due to market conditions, our company has made the difficult decision to halt operations in Japan and to conduct a complete review of our business in the country. However, we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for our valued customers.</p>

<p>Coinbase said that customers can choose to withdraw their crypto holdings to any other Virtual Asset Service Provider, Coinbase Wallet, or any other self-hosted wallet of their choosing. The firm also said customers can alternatively choose to liquidate their portfolio and withdraw their JPY to a domestic bank account. Coinbase added that any remaining crypto holdings held on Coinbase on or after February 17, will be converted to JPY. Coinbase will after a month following February 17, send any remaining JPY to a Guaranty Account at the Legal Affairs Bureau per legal requirements. Customers who do not act before February 16, will have to coordinate with the Legal Affairs Bureau to claim their JPY balance.</p>
Kraken Withdraws from Japan
<p>Coinbase is not the first exchange to suspend its operations in Japan. In late December, crypto exchange Kraken decided to close its operations in Japan and deregister from the Financial Services Agency (FSA), citing weak market conditions. Kraken said it made the decision as part of its efforts to focus on areas that align with its strategy and that would put Kraken in the best position for long-term success.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum-based Layer-2 protocol, Optimism has outperformed Arbitrum in transaction volume since mid-December.&nbsp;</p>
Optimism Token Takes The Win
<p>The transaction volume on both protocols has undergone a distinct divergence since last month. Even though both had been on a steady upward climb since the beginning of last year, Arbitrum had always maintained its lead in transaction activity. However, this changed towards the end of the year, when Optimism outpaced Arbitrum and that too quite significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason behind this divergence and the increased transactions is the Optimism token, which has been one of the leading performing tokens across Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols. With liquid staking derivatives such as Lido and Rocket Pool performing well, investors are looking at more ways of gaining exposure to Ethereum. Since Arbitrum does not have its own token, it got left behind in the race. Other tokens in the Optimism ecosystem have also benefited from this increased interest and experienced gains of over 200% since the beginning of the year.</p>
GMX Drops, Synthetix Grows
<p>Furthermore, another factor contributing to the increase in Optimism transaction volumes is the drop in the use of GMX. This decentralized perpetual futures exchange is built on Arbitrum and has experienced a 30% drop in use since December 10. On the other hand, there has been an increase in activity on the Synthetix perpetual exchange, which is built on Optimism, since December 20. Additional protocols like Kwenta that are built using Synthetix on Optimism have also experienced a sudden spike in transaction volume.&nbsp;</p>
L2 Protocols Need Reinvention
<p>Experts have opined that both the L2 protocols of Arbitrum and Optimism are some of the most important actors in the Ethereum ecosystem as they pave the way for scalability and increased throughput while maintaining the integrity of the Ethereum chain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Marom Yigy, the VP of Blockchain at LEAP (Web3-based sports-discovery and endorsement platform), the future of Layer-2 protocols depends on how well they reinvent themselves.</p>
<p>She said,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Layer 2 solutions are most often workarounds to bottlenecks on the Ethereum network; they won't disappear at this step of the merge because gas prices aren't expected to drop. That will likely change once sharding is introduced, because sharding itself solves the issue L2s were created to fix. By then, L2s might be less popular&mdash;though the big ones will find new ways of reinventing themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arbitrum&rsquo;s last significant upgrade took place on August 31, 2022, when the protocol launched its Nitro upgrade. Since then, Optimism has understood the challenge and raised the bar by introducing its own tokens. Arbitrum needs to step up the reinvention game if it wants to regain its former lead.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Polygon has announced that it has successfully completed its highly anticipated hard fork, designed to boost performance and reduce spiking gas fees and disruptive chain reorganizations.</p>
<p>The hard fork went live on Tuesday and included two proposals, which Polygon validator teams voted to approve.&nbsp;</p>
Highly Anticipated Hard Fork&nbsp;
<p>Ethereum Layer-2 scaling solution Polygon has announced that its highly anticipated hard fork has gone live. The upgrade took place on Tuesday at 10:45 UTC, according to a tweet put out by Polygon Labs. The proposals included in the upgrade were put forth in December, with 87% of Polygon validator teams participating and voting for approval. However, only 15 validator teams participated in the voting process, a relatively low number given the number of active validators at a time is limited to 100.&nbsp;</p>
The Proposals&nbsp;
<p>The upgrade, called the Polygon Delhi Fork, aims to achieve two key goals: reducing gas fee spikes during transactions and improving finality by reducing disruptive chain reorganizations. It aims to do this through two proposals. The first proposal adjusts a mechanism that sets gas fees used when transacting on the blockchain. The mechanism hopes to keep gas prices low during periods of substantial transaction activity on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second proposal reduces the time to complete a data block, preventing frequent and disruptive chain reorganizations. These reorganizations occur when validator nodes receive information that temporarily creates a new version of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a blog post published last week, the team dwelled on both proposals. The team noted that the update would change the base fee from 8 to 16. The base fee is the minimum gas fee required to include a transaction in a new block. While gas prices generally function normally, base gas fees are prone to experiencing significant spikes during periods of increased activity. The Polygon team stated in its blog post,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The expectation is that the rate of change for the base gas fee will fall to 6.25% from the current 12.5% to smooth severe fluctuations in gas prices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While gas prices will still increase during periods of intense demand, the increase will be in line with how Ethereum gas price dynamics function. The team added,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The goal is smooth out spikes and ensure a more seamless experience when interacting with the chain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Addressing the issue of chain reorganizations, the team stated that addressing chain reorgs would reduce sprint lengths from 64 to 16 blocks. Consequently, a single block producer will be able to produce blocks continuously for far less time (around 35 seconds) than the current time of around 128 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
A Much-Needed Scaling Solution
<p>Polygon was launched in 2017 as a much-needed scaling solution to Ethereum, enabling users to experience significantly faster throughput and low fees. The scaling solution has processed over 2.3 billion transactions. It has over 200 million unique addresses, along with thousands of decentralized applications (dApps) and some of the most prominent Web3 projects, including Uniswap and Aave, building on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, the upgrade assumes significance, as it greatly improves the chain&rsquo;s predictability and performance. Meanwhile, the platform&rsquo;s native MATIC token has not made any drastic change in valuation following the upgrade, although it continues its push toward the $2 mark, having seen a 20% increase over the past 7 days. Currently, the token is trading at around $1, according to data from CoinMarketCap.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The European Parliament&rsquo;s final vote on the European Union&rsquo;s (EU) landmark Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation has been delayed until April 2023 reportedly due to &ldquo;technical issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The European Parliament will have to wait until April to take its final vote on the EU&rsquo;s landmark MiCA regulation, stalling the implementation process. The vote was set to take place in February but has been delayed due to &ldquo;technical issues&rdquo; most likely related to the translation of the almost 400-page documents into the 24 official languages of the EU according to The Block. The delay means that the process for the new rules to be enforced is stalled. MiCA is not the only regulation to be impacted as the Transfer of Funds Regulations (TFR) will also be postponed to the same date. The TFR, which is meant to be implemented in tandem with MiCA, is part of the EU&rsquo;s efforts to improve its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures.</p>
<p>This is the second vote postponement. The initial vote in Parliament&rsquo;s plenary session was expected to take place by the end of 2022 but was delayed to February due to issues with translation. The delay means that the European financial regulators need to wait longer before beginning to draft implementation rules. Regulators such as the European Securities and Market Authority and the Banking Authority have 12 to 18 months to draft the technical specifications of the landmark bill once it receives final approval.</p>
<p>Many countries, most notably France, are pushing for stricter crypto regulation ahead of MiCA given the market turmoil caused by the bankruptcy of various major industry heavyweights. French policymakers and central bankers are rather desperately calling for the implementation of mandatory crypto firm licensing in 2023. Most recently, the governor of the Bank of France called for stricter and more comprehensive licensing requirements for crypto companies in France given the chaos caused by the fall of FTX. He added that France should not wait for the upcoming MiCA regulation to enact obligatory licensing for local digital asset service providers.</p>
