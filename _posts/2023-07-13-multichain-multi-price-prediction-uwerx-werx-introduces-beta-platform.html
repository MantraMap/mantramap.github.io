<p>Multichain (MULTI) may become only three years old this July, but crypto analysts predict profitable growth for Multichain (MULTI) in the coming years. </p>
<p>This article explores Multichain&rsquo;s (MULTI) unique features while exploring a new token, Uwerx, and learning about its exploding presale. </p>
Multichain (MULTI): The Ultimate Web3 Router
<p>Multichain (MULTI) is predicted to become the main router for Web3 soon. Multichain (MULTI) was launched in 2020 on the 20th of July to provide solutions for various blockchains, especially regarding their communication needs. </p>
<p>With &nbsp;Mulltichain (MULTI), every blockchain has its community, unique services, and development ecosystem. </p>
<p>Multichain (MULTI) is selling at $4.33 and is predicted to reach $7.42 by 2024 if its community grows at the current pace.</p>
Uwerx (WERX): â€‹The Freelancers&rsquo; Community
<p>Uwerx is set to be launched on the 4th of August, 2023. Over the months, and during its presale, Uwerx has released several mouthwatering updates about the platform and its launching, leaving freelancers and crypto investors eagerly anticipating.</p>
<p>Uwerx is an upcoming freelancing platform that will provide freelancers with a perfect virtual world to work in and provide crypto investors with a stable and profitable investment choice. For freelancers, the Uwerx team has emphasized that Uwerx is to become the freelancer&rsquo;s first choice. With its 1% flat fee, unlike the ludicrous 10% and 20% fees offered by other freelancing platforms, Uwerx is ready to put its money where its mouth&rsquo;s at.</p>
<p>A blaring green light for crypto investors about Uwerx is its successful audit approval by both InterFi Network and SolidProof. This audit approval alone shows interested crypto investors that Uwerx is that token! Uwerx will be renouncing its contract ownership once it&rsquo;s launched on the 4th of August, 2023, and this will be done to ensure the prevention of all cryptocurrency-related scams and frauds. </p>
<p>Perhaps these positive updates about the upcoming platform are the secrets behind Uwerx&rsquo;sgrowing numbers. Uwerx is making great steps to ensure that these figures have extra zeroes at their end before Q4 2024. Uwerx has already been listed on CoinSniper and will soon be listed on Uniswap by the 1st of August, 2023. </p>
<p>Also, to ensure that the WERX tokens are protected, Uwerx will implement a 25-year liquidity lock before the end of its presale. Uwerx will also be launching a Test Airdrop for its users before the 31st of July, 2023, the scheduled date for the end of Uwerx&rsquo;s hard cap presale. To further provide Uwerx users with extra security, the Uwerx Vault has now been unveiled. Storing your WERX tokens in the Uwerx Vault works just like staking, and you can store your tokens for different periods and earn rewards depending on Uwerx&rsquo;s variables. </p>
<p>The Uwerx team is working on releasing the Alpha platform in phases. The PDF Version of these pages has now been released: the Signing-Up Page, the Logging-In page, and the job creation process, amongst others. Soon, Uwerx will be transitioning from the Alpha platform to the Beta platform, so users can try out the platform for themselves while sharing their observations with the Uwerx team at feedback@uwerx.network. </p>
Uwerx&rsquo;s (WERX) Presale Shoots Higher
<p>The Uwerx Presale has not stopped soaring since its start. The presale stages 1 to 4 were sold out in record time, showing crypto investors that the demand for Uwerx is truly high. The Uwerxteam has had to make key token modifications due to increased Uwerx demand.</p>
