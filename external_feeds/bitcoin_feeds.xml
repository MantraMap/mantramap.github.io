<h2>Binance Leads But Not Without Contenders, Says Coingecko&#8217;s Mid-Year Crypto Study</h2>
<p>According to the Coingecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/centralized-crypto-exchanges-market-share">research report</a>, Binance continues to dominate the centralized cryptocurrency exchange market with a 51.7% share, boasting a spot trading volume of $235.3 billion in June 2023. However, researchers noted a significant drop from its March peak of $559.8 billion, suggesting possible weaknesses.</p>
<p>The research spotlighted Upbit&#8217;s perseverance, holding firm as the second-largest exchange. Despite a dip to a 6% market share in May 2023, Upbit rebounded with an 8.1% share by June, backed by a $36.8 billion trading volume. Still, data shows the exchange experienced a 43.4% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) volume decrease.</p>

<p>The report underscored the rise of Bybit and Bitget in the second quarter. Bybit, celebrating a 26.7% QoQ growth, clinched the fifth spot among centralized crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, Bitget made notable strides to secure the seventh position. Both exchanges notably dethroned industry stalwarts Crypto.com and Huobi. The analysis also highlighted Binance&#8217;s declining trajectory.</p>
<p>Between Q1 and Q2 2023, Binance&#8217;s trading volume plummeted by 52.4%, which translates to a $823.9 billion decrease. The report said this decline starkly contrasts with the combined $270.8 billion drop of its nine closest competitors, suggesting regulatory pressures might be denting its dominance. Beyond the big players, the Coingecko report paints a vivid picture of a fiercely contested market.</p>

<p>Okx, holding the third position with a 7% market share, is closely trailed by contenders like Coinbase, Bybit, and Kucoin. With each commanding less than 7% of the market, the battle among the top ten continues to be intense. The study leveraged data from the top ten exchanges by recording the centralized trading platforms’ spot trade volumes between January 1, 2023 and June 30, 2023.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) extended recent declines on Wednesday, as traders began to anticipate the upcoming FOMC minutes report.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to an intraday low of $29,061.95 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes after a high of $29,439.12 the day prior.</p>
<p>This drop sent bitcoin to its lowest point since August 7, when the price fell to a bottom of $28,660.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#x2019;s decline comes despite an upward crossover taking place between the 10-day (red) and 25-day (blue) moving averages.</p>
<p>The relative strength index (RSI) did provide a bearish signal however, slipping towards a floor of 42.00</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 44.49, which is also a seven-day low.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) edged lower for a second straight session, as the cryptocurrency moved towards a floor of its own.</p>
<p>Following a high at $1,842.95 on Tuesday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD dropped to an intraday low of $1,816.33 earlier today.</p>
<p>Like with bitcoin above, this plunge saw the world&#x2019;s second largest cryptocurrency record a one-week low.</p>

<p>The index moved below a support level at 41.00, and is now tracking at 40.83, with the next visible point of support at 39.00.</p>
<p>Should this target be reached, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> will likely be trading around the $1,780 mark.</p>

However, according to a Mybroadband <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/cryptocurrency/504222-boss-of-south-africas-biggest-pyramid-scheme-in-history-found-guilty-in-brazil-fined-r595000.html">report</a>, Steynberg, who was sentenced to three and a half years in prison, is unlikely to serve the jail time after the court reportedly ordered him to pay a fine instead.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mirror-trading-international-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-arrested-in-brazil/">reported</a> by Bitcoin.com News, Steynberg, who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ceo-of-mti-bitcoin-ponzi-scheme-flees-south-africa-in-a-possible-exit-scam-funds-blocked/">fled</a> South Africa in late 2020, was arrested by Brazilian law enforcement in December 2021. At the time of his arrest, Steynberg was found to be in possession of a forged Brazilian identity document. Following his arrest, South African authorities reportedly kickstarted the process to have the MTI boss extradited.</p>
<p>Steynberg’s subsequent attempt to block the extradition proceedings was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brazilian-judge-dismisses-bitcoin-scam-masterminds-attempt-to-block-his-extradition-to-south-africa/">rebuffed</a> by a Brazilian judge in 2022. Since then, the MTI mastermind has seemingly remained in &#8220;precautionary detention.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"></p>
<h2>Steynberg Appeals Against &#8216;Harsh&#8217; Sentence</h2>
<p>On why the Brazilian court commuted Steynberg’s jail sentence to a total fine of just over $31,100, the report cited the South American country’s penal code which states that jail terms of four years or lower for non-violent crimes can be converted to fines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the report said Steynberg’s lawyers have signaled their intention to appeal the court’s decision. The lawyers have said Steynberg’s alleged offense warrants a less harsh sentence than the three and a half years handed down by the court. The prosecution team, which is also appealing the court&#8217;s verdict, suggested that the punishment given to Steynberg is not commensurate with the offense.</p>

Under the new rules, issuers that want their fiat-pegged tokens to be labeled as “MAS-regulated” will have to meet certain requirements. </strong></p>
<h2>Singapore to Require Stablecoin Issuers to Maintain Minimum Base Capital and Liquid Assets</h2>
<p>Singapore’s central banking institution has finalized its new regulatory framework for stablecoins issued in the country. On Tuesday, the monetary authority said its features seek to ensure a high degree of value stability for the stablecoins it will regulate.</p>
<p>MAS emphasized that feedback from the public consultation launched in October 2022 has been taken into account. “Stablecoins are digital payment tokens designed to maintain a constant value against one or more specified fiat currencies,” the regulator noted in a press release and elaborated:</p>
<blockquote><p>When well-regulated to preserve such value stability, stablecoins can serve as a trusted medium of exchange to support innovation, including the &#8216;on-chain&#8217; purchase and sale of digital assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The financial authority also pointed out that the framework will apply to single-currency stablecoins (SCS) pegged to the Singapore dollar or any of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G10_currencies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G10 currencies</a>, the world’s most traded fiat currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>SCS issuers will have to fulfill some key requirements in order to apply for and obtain a “MAS-regulated stablecoins” label for their digital currencies. These cover several important areas such as value stability, capital, and redemption.</p>

<p>Reserve assets for the stablecoins will be subject to requirements relating to their composition, valuation, custody and audit, to ensure value stability, the MAS explained. Issuers will be obliged to maintain minimum base capital and liquid assets to limit insolvency risks.</p>
<p>They must also return the par value of SCS to holders within five business days from a redemption request and appropriately disclose to users information about the implemented value stabilizing mechanism, the rights of stablecoin holders, as well as the results from audits of reserve assets.</p>
<p>This label will allow users to distinguish MAS-regulated stablecoins from other digital payment tokens, the central bank emphasized. Its Deputy Managing Director for Financial Supervision, Ho Hern Shin, urged issuers that want their stablecoins to be recognized as such to prepare early for compliance.</p>
<p>She also highlighted that the regulatory framework aims to facilitate the use of stablecoins as a “credible digital medium of exchange” and a bridge between the fiat and digital asset ecosystems. It’s being introduced over a year after the collapse of stablecoin terrausd and cryptocurrency luna issued by the Singapore-registered company Terraform Labs. The stablecoin rules also follow the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/singapore-implements-new-crypto-regulations-targeting-custody-lending-staking/">implementation</a> of new regulations for crypto service providers in July.</p>

Davidson explained that many people wrongly conflate cryptocurrencies with CBDC when these are two different concepts.</strong></p>
<h2>Congressman Warren Davidson: &#8216;CBDC Is Evil&#8217;</h2>
<p>Congressman Warren Davidson has warned about the dangers that issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) represents for the financial technology industry in America. Davidson vocally criticized the use of these tools, reaffirming his opposition to CBDC by <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691050354283048963?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> on social media that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At least most agree that CBDC is evil &#8211; the financial equivalent of the Death Star. Don’t become an accomplice to anyone designing, building, testing, developing, or establishing CBDC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davidson, part of the House Financial Services Committee, emphasized that many people wrongly conflated the concept of CBDC with Bitcoin and that banning the existence of a CBDC in America would be &#8220;essential&#8221; to America&#8217;s fintech future.</p>
<p>Davidson&#8217;s opposition to CBDC is not new, as the representative has railed against the concept before, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-representative-warren-davidson-cbdc-corrupts-money-into-a-tool-for-coercion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a> that &#8220;central bank digital currency (CBDC) corrupts money into a tool for coercion &amp; control,&#8221; explaining that there was no way of implementing CBDCs in America without legislation.</p>

<h2>People, Not Tokens</h2>
<p>The congressman noted that the tech behind these tools was not the problem, as he pinned responsibility on the human resource behind CBDC projects. Davidson <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691050987014782976?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tokenized assets are not the problem. It’s the people. Entities (including the Federal Reserve, Ripple, Consensys) and influencers are actively working on CBDC projects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Davison concluded by <a href="https://twitter.com/WarrenDavidson/status/1691051791339638785?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcing</a> that he was working on passing a regulation that would &#8220;criminalize designing, building, testing, developing, or establishing a central bank digital currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the Federal Reserve is now openly <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/cbdc-faqs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">considering</a> a digital dollar as &#8220;a means to expand safe payment options, not to reduce or replace them,&#8221; it recognizes that it has taken &#8220;no decision on issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) and would only proceed with the issuance of a CBDC with an authorizing law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several bills have been introduced to stop the hypothetical issuance of a digital dollar. In February, Representative Tom Emmer <a href="https://emmer.house.gov/2023/2/emmer-leads-effort-to-squash-financial-surveillance-state-initiatives" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act to &#8220;halt efforts of unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) that strips Americans of their right to financial privacy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in March, Senator Ted Cruz <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-introduces-legislation-to-prohibit-the-fed-from-establishing-a-central-bank-digital-currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> a bill to stop the Federal Reserve from developing a CBDC.</p>

After the May 15, 2023 <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/cashtokens-take-center-stage-following-bitcoin-cash-upgrade-over-26000-tokens-created/">Bitcoin Cash upgrade</a>, which effectively <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-smart-contracts-comparable-to-those-on-ethereum-possible-via-may-upgrade-1000x-efficiency-advantage-dev-jason-dreyzehner/">enables smart contracts onchain for BCH</a> by utilizing unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs), much development has been ongoing on the network surrounding Cashtokens, a feature that has inspired the creation of numerous non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and marketplaces like <a href="https://tapswap.cash/">tapswap.cash</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade">NFT sales</a> and trading activity are still modest compared to other networks, with marketplaces in their nascent stages, and decentralized exchanges (dexs) in <a href="https://app.cauldron.quest/#/">test phases</a>. That notwithstanding, development has been occurring at an industrious pace in the background, as advocates of Cashtokens point to the power of the upgraded chain to enable even more types of <a href="https://www.bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf">permissionless peer-to-peer exchange directly onchain</a>, for lower fees than other leading protocols. Some NFT collections of note include <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/180f0db4465c2af5ef9363f46bacde732fa6ffb3bfe65844452078085b2e7c93">Emerald DAO</a>, <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/07275f68d14780c737279898e730cec3a7b189a761caf43b4197b60a7c891a97">Bitcats Heroes Club</a>, and <a href="https://tapswap.cash/trade/f54ce0297a4017cc922aacde5f7abe7a8397a1058b879f5eb9e2a643d4ec2301">BCH Gurus</a>.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As developer Jason Dreyzehner mentioned to Bitcoin.com News back in May: &#x201C;Suddenly it was possible to build very efficient, UTXO-based decentralized applications while preserving important features of Bitcoin Cash: stateless transaction validation (low fees) and zero-delay re-spending (fast transactions).&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Paytaca, creator of the Cashtokens-friendly Paytaca wallet, is now working on a tool to enable anyone to create their own NFTs via a project called Cashtokens Studio. CEO of Paytaca Joemar Taganna is also involved with the Bitcats Heroes Club NFTs. Taganna told Bitcoin.com news:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a need now for a tool for the general public that will allow anyone to create tokens using the Cashtokens protocol. Currently, the process is largely manual, so it is tedious and error-prone. That&#x2019;s why we are building Cashtokens Studio.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
One popular NFT project springing up after the May upgrade has been the <a href="https://nfts.bch.guru/">BCH Gurus</a>. This project is a multi-dimensional NFT endeavor which is currently building price prediction games fueled by NFTs and other tokens on the new protocol.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The Cashtokens upgrade has allowed for an entirely new ecosystem to develop directly on Bitcoin Cash mainchain,&#x201D; the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Guru Team told Bitcoin.com News via Telegram, elaborating: &#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> Guru combines the fun and addictive element of a uniquely designed NFT collection, along with a fungible token (Furu), allowing users to play price prediction games onchain through a Cashtokens smart contract.&#x201D;&#13;</p>
<p class="p1">
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Community and Tech Developments, Crypto Custody Ethos</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Noting that Cashtokens&#x2019; simple token primitives &#x201C;that can allow you to create most (if not all) of defi applications you see in other chains&#x201D; will require some tooling developed from scratch, Taganna says his group is &#x201C;happy to take on part of that huge challenge.&#x201D; Speaking of Bitcoin Cash development over the last few years, the Paytaca CEO notes:&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;The <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> community is becoming more vibrant and productive, a breath of fresh air from the prior years of political conflict leading to splits. We now have individuals, dev teams, and entrepreneurs, supported by well-aligned donors / investors, all working together to make the peer-to-peer cash revolution happen.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Part and parcel of refusing to compromise on <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/decade-old-wisdom-unpacking-satoshi-nakamotos-definitive-quote-on-bitcoin-transaction-challenges-13-years-on/">Satoshi Nakamoto&#x2019;s</a> vision for a money which can&#x2019;t be censored and can be traded with no need for a financial institution &#x2014; an ethos enthusiastically championed by many in <a href="https://t.me/bchchannel">Bitcoin Cash communities</a> &#x2014; is keeping complete control over one&#x2019;s crypto. Non-custodial bitcoin cash wallets supporting the Cashtokens upgrade include <a href="https://www.paytaca.com/">Paytaca</a>, <a href="https://electroncash.org/#download">Electron Cash</a>, <a href="https://cashonize.com">Cashonize</a>, and <a href="https://www.zapit.io/">Zapit</a>.&#13;<br />

<h2>Xi and Putin Advancing China-Russia Cooperation</h2>
<p>Chinese foreign ministry&#8217;s spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a press conference Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are advancing the strategic partnership between China and Russia. Putin is scheduled to visit China in October.</p>
<p>&#8220;The presidents of China and Russia have maintained strategic communication in various ways,&#8221; Wang explained. &#8220;Their discussions cover a rich and comprehensive range of topics. High-level exchanges have proceeded in an orderly manner with extensive exchange of views on bilateral cooperation and issues of mutual interest.” The Chinese official emphasized:</p>
<blockquote><p>The two sides will continue to advance the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era under the strategic guidance of the presidents of the two countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both Xi and Putin are expected to participate in the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-leaders-to-talk-expansion-at-august-summit-host-confirms/">BRICS summit</a> that will take place in Johannesburg on Aug. 22-24. However, Putin <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/historic-brics-summit-to-be-held-without-putin-in-person/">will not attend in person</a>. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>South African Foreign Minister Naledi Pandor has revealed that the BRICS summit&#8217;s agenda will include discussions about the expansion of the economic bloc. South Africa is the host of the BRICS summit this year.</p>
<p>A total of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">23 countries</a> have applied for BRICS membership: Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bahrain, Belarus, Bolivia, Venezuela, Vietnam, Cuba, Honduras, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Morocco, Nigeria, State of Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/23-countries-apply-for-brics-membership-as-leaders-prepare-to-convene-at-summit/">invited</a> 67 leaders of countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the Caribbean to the summit. In addition, 20 representatives of major international organizations have been invited, including the secretary-general of the United Nations, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, and the president of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank.</p>

The changes could include a Republican president being elected, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resigning, and &#8220;crypto mom&#8221; Hester Peirce being appointed as the acting SEC Chair.</strong></p>
<h2>Possible Changes at SEC That Could Benefit Crypto Industry</h2>
<p>Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark highlighted potential changes that could benefit the crypto industry, including the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in a lengthy tweet on Sunday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years.</p>
<p>A number of companies in the U.S. are seeking SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, including <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-trust-analyst-calls-it-a-real-deal-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing/">Blackrock</a>, the world’s largest asset manager. However, the SEC has not approved any spot crypto ETFs so far. Stark opined:</p>
<blockquote><p>My take is that the current SEC will NOT approve a bitcoin spot ETF application for a range of compelling reasons.</p></blockquote>
<p>The former SEC official referenced Better Markets, a non-partisan independent nonprofit organization advocating for economic security, which <a href="https://bettermarkets.org/newsroom/sec-should-reject-bitcoin-etf-filings-because-they-will-expose-investors-to-fraud-manipulation-and-other-investor-harms/">outlined</a> on Aug. 9 why the SEC should reject spot bitcoin ETF filings.</p>
<p>However, Stark believes that the SEC could undergo changes that benefit the crypto industry if a Republican is elected president of the United States in 2024. The 2024 U.S. elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The crypto-regulatory tides could shift exponentially after Election Day.</p></blockquote>
<p>He explained that under a Republican U.S. president, the SEC&#8217;s crypto-enforcement efforts would likely &#8220;decrease significantly.&#8221; He clarified that this could involve focusing more on fraud cases, &#8220;shifting efforts away from charging pure registration violations (such as the failure of a crypto-trading platform to register as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm).&#8221; In addition, Stark expects the new SEC to “become far more receptive to approving a bitcoin spot ETF and far more likely to take other significant crypto-friendly regulatory actions.”</p>
<p>The former SEC enforcement official proceeded to explain that when a new U.S. president is elected, the SEC chairman typically resigns and the new chairman position is usually confirmed and filled in a span of three to four months after Inauguration Day. He continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hence, should a Republican get elected President, Chair Gensler would likely resign and the senior Republican appointed SEC Commissioner (in this case famed ‘crypto-mom’ Hester Peirce) would possibly become acting Chair.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stark noted that if Peirce “becomes acting Chair of the SEC, given her lengthy track record of dissent and opposition to most crypto-related SEC actions, the world should expect that most U.S. SEC crypto-related enforcement and most crypto-related SEC disruption would grind to a screeching halt.”</p>
<p>Last week, Stark warned that the crypto regulatory onslaught will <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-sec-official-warns-crypto-regulatory-onslaught-will-never-end/">never end</a> under the current SEC.</p>

The bank does not expect the widespread adoption of PYUSD to occur in the near future, noting that the introduction of Paypal&#x2019;s stablecoin will not lead to &#x201C;accelerated regulatory clarity.&#x201D; Nonetheless, </strong><strong>Bank of America believes that stablecoins have the potential to provide a more efficient payment solution.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bank of America on Paypal&#x2019;s US Dollar Stablecoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bank of America published a Global Digital Asset Strategy report last week covering its view on Paypal&#x2019;s U.S. dollar stablecoin and the Fednow payments system. The report was written by Alkesh Shah, head of global crypto and digital assets strategy at Bank of America Global Research, and Andrew Moss, the bank&#x2019;s global digital asset strategist.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Paypal (Nasdaq: PYPL) is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/payments-giant-paypal-launches-dollar-backed-stablecoin-pyusd/">launching</a> a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, called Paypal USD (PYUSD), which will be available to U.S.-based Paypal customers. According to the payments giant, the stablecoin will be compatible with select third-party digital asset wallets and backed by traditional assets, including the U.S. dollar, short-term Treasuries, and cash equivalents.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Noting that Paypal, with 435 million users, is the first global company &#x201C;to launch a stablecoin with regulatory approval,&#x201D; Bank of America stated:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We expect PYPL&#x2019;s PYUSD launch to drive payments efficiencies and an improved customer experience over time, but PYUSD adoption is unlikely to be significant in the near term, given lack of wallet compatibility, exchange trading pairs or new functionality.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#x201C;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] and yield-bearing stablecoins increases,&#x201D; Bank of America continued. &#x201C;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield-bearing stablecoins, such as <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a> and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Regarding crypto regulations, Bank of America stressed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We do not expect PYUSD&#x2019;s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin&#x2019;s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Bank of America on Fednow</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
The Bank of America report also provides an analysis of the Fednow service, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/federal-reserve-launches-fednow-for-instant-payments-jpmorgan-wells-fargo-and-33-banks-onboard/">went live</a> on July 20 to &#x201C;enable financial institutions, specifically banks and credit unions, to facilitate bank account-to-bank account transfers of customer funds in (near) real-time,&#x201D; the bank described. Shah and Moss detailed:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>We view Fednow as a needed and innovative solution to a problem &#x2013; inefficient domestic payments and transfers &#x2013; that other countries have already solved.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
The analysts explained that Fednow&#x2019;s infrastructure does not leverage blockchain technology, stating: &#x201C;Instead, Fednow uses traditional payment rails to produce an interbank settlement system.&#x201D;&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
They emphasized: &#x201C;As the digital asset ecosystem evolves, we see the potential for stablecoins and, ultimately, CBDCs to provide an even better solution that would be faster and cheaper, especially for cross-border payments and transfers, which Fednow does not support &#x2026; We note that the efficiencies Fednow enables are unlikely to be fully captured without financial institution adoption and resulting network effects, as well as development of end-user interfaces and applications.&#x201D;&#13;<br />

In light of these allegations against SBF, Ryan Salame, FTX Digital Markets&#8217; former co-CEO, has expressed his intent to plead the Fifth if summoned, thus becoming &#8220;unavailable as a witness.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Former FTX Co-CEO Ryan Salame to Plead the Fifth</h2>
<p>Merely a week prior, insiders hinted at <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-odd-relationship-with-vertical-farming-firms-a-look-at-exchange-boss-ryan-salames-and-bahamian-pm-philip-davis-trip-to-80-acres/">Ryan Salame</a>, ex-co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, navigating a plea agreement. These sources <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-ftx-co-ceo-ryan-salame-in-plea-deal-talks-private-jet-may-be-forfeited/">claimed</a> that part of the deal might involve Salame parting with his private jet. Yet, with the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-boss-sam-bankman-fried-in-custody-bail-revoked-remanded-to-jail/">re-arrest of SBF</a> and new campaign financing allegations surfacing, Salame&#8217;s potential contribution to the case seems limited.</p>
<p>The authorities have pushed for the inclusion of specific evidence during the trial, while sidelining other bits presented by SBF’s defense. The evidence in question encompasses SBF&#8217;s supposed bank deception, unlawful campaign contributions, international bribery, crypto price manipulation, and the implementation of auto-delete protocols within his firms.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prosecution is attempting to remove certain defense-related evidence and arguments, deeming them either irrelevant or unjustly biased. These include claims about the victims&#8217; lack of due diligence, the negative impact of the bankruptcy process on clients, the rapidity of the charges indicating ulterior motives, the idea that virtuous deeds signify innocence, and details about potential penalties. The government&#8217;s stance is that such evidence might muddle the issues, misguide the jury, lead to unnecessary delays, or provoke jury nullification.</p>
<p>In a pivotal move, the authorities <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.204.0.pdf">aim to present alleged remarks</a> by the former FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame, now an &#8220;unavailable witness,&#8221; about his supposed pact with SBF to illicitly fund political endeavors. Salame&#8217;s legal counsel has indicated that Salame would assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if asked to testify. However, the prosecution posits that Salame&#8217;s remarks on being a conduit for donations remain valid under the exception to the hearsay rule in Rule 804(b)(3), given they are statements against his interests.</p>
<p>Prosecutors emphasize the credibility of Salame&#8217;s alleged comments, pointing to the trail of corporate funds channeled through his accounts for political contributions. Despite his absence, the government maintains that these purported remarks can be treated as statements against Salame&#8217;s legal interests. Reports have recurrently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-execs-gave-70-million-to-both-democrats-and-republicans-heading-into-the-2022-us-midterms/">suggested</a> that Salame funneled a whopping $24 million to GOP candidates before FTX&#8217;s unraveling.</p>
