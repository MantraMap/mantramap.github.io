<li>There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0935 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start a recovery wave if it clears the $0.095 resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading below $0.0950 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-extend-losses-below-27000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XLM price could extend losses if it stays below $0.0950.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After a close below $0.100, Stellar Lumen price moved into a bearish zone against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair even settled below the $0.095 support zone as the bears took control.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a spike below the $0.090 level. A low is formed near $0.0896 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is still trading below $0.0950 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.0935 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.0922 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.0948 swing high to the $0.0896 low.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.0932 zone and the trend line. It is close to the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-could-recover-if-it-clears-0-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a> and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.0948 swing high to the $0.0896 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.095 level.</p>
<p>A clear upside break above the $0.095 zone might send the price toward $0.0980. Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.1020 level or even $0.1050.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near the $0.0895 level. The main support is near the $0.088 zone. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.0850 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.0820.</p>

<p><em>Ripple price is struggling below $0.480 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-could-extend-losses-below-27000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Bitcoin</a>. XRP price could decline further if it settles below the $0.440 support in the near term.</em></p>
<h2>Ripple Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ripple price attempted an upside break above the $0.484 zone against the US Dollar. The XRP/USD pair failed to gain bullish momentum and declined below $0.472.</p>
<p>The price started a fresh bearish wave and declined below the $0.4650 support. It even traded below the 55 simple moving average (4 hours) and spiked below the $0.440 support. A low is formed near $0.4252 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave.</p>
<p>XRP is now trading below $0.465 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ripple-price-analysis-xrp-could-dive-below-0-44/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. Besides, there is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.456 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>On the upside, the price is facing resistance near $0.440. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4868 swing high to the $0.4252 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.4560 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.4868 swing high to the $0.4252 low. A clear move above the trend line resistance might start a fresh increase. In the stated case, the price could even surpass the $0.4650 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.500 resistance.</p>
<p>Initial support on the downside is near $0.432. The next major support is near the $0.425 level. Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.400 level, below which the price might even test $0.388.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent poll, Colorado ranks <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/colorado-ranks-highly-for-interest-in-cryptocurrency-trading/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">amongst the highest states when</a> it comes to crypto activity.</p>
<h2>Colorado Ranks High When It Comes to Crypto Activity</h2>
<p>The study was conducted by Cryptobetting.org. The platform looked at all the crypto activity occurring within the 50 states of the American union, and as it turns out, Colorado placed eighth. The state is amongst the youngest regions of the country, and it’s also one <a href="https://kdvr.com/news/data/study-colorado-one-of-the-top-states-for-tech-workers/?ipid=promo-link-block1" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">of the most tech-friendly</a> according to a separate poll.</p>
<p>All this makes sense in many ways given how the region has fallen victim to a wide array of digital currency scams in recent months. According to a statement by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), several residents have fallen victim to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/fbi-report-shows-colorado-residents-getting-duped-by-crypto-scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">crypto scams in Colorado</a> centering around USDC, a prominent stable currency. The statement also provided advice for how to avoid falling victim to a scam. It read:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a common scenario, the victim is approached on a social media platform, dating app, or discussion forum with a cryptocurrency investment opportunity. The victim is directed to a link or phone number to set up the investment account. This is a scam. The link or phone number is controlled by the fraudster, who has set up a fictitious support site. Once the victim transfers the funds, the fraudster disappears with the money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Naturally, a lot of crypto activity is going to give rise to a few bad actors here and there, so it seems accurate that the digital currency trading occurring within Colorado has grown in recent weeks to earn it a place on this poll’s list. The study also suggests that for every 100,000 people in the state, approximately 1,710 crypto-related searches occurred online. The state presently ties in this department with regions like Virginia and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Despite Colorado’s high rank, it does not beat Nevada, which currently (as <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/study-nevada-is-the-most-crypto-friendly-state/" data-wpel-link="internal">it did last year</a>) lists as the top state for digital currency friendliness. That state saw close to 2,000 crypto-related searches online for every 100K people, thus beating out the Centennial State by a hefty margin. Among the lowest activity states was Mississippi, which only saw about 686 searches for every 100,000 residents.</p>
<p>The top five top crypto states were Nevada as number one, followed by California, New York, New Jersey, and Washington in that order.</p>
<h2>New York Is Crypto Friendly?!</h2>
<p>The inclusion of New York in the top five is a surprise given just how non-friendly the region’s regulators have been over the past several years. Things got off to a negative start in 2015 when the state introduced the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/bitlicense/" data-wpel-link="internal">BitLicense</a>, a document that proved so rigid and expensive it caused many digital currency companies to exit the Empire State for good.</p>
<p>NY attorney general Leticia James has <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/leticia-james-sues-coin-ex-alleging-crypto-fraud/" data-wpel-link="internal">also developed a habit</a> of going after several crypto firms in court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gary Gensler – the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/gensler-urges-congress-to-increase-funding-for-sec-to-investigate-cryptocurrency-issues/ar-AA19ferY" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">asking Congress to grant</a> the agency even more funding so he and his fellow agents can continue their investigations into the crypto arena.</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler and the SEC Want More Money</h2>
<p>In a recent conference, Gensler described the crypto scene as the “Wild West” (how original – nobody’s <em>ever</em> used that term before) and asked that he be given the funds to hire more employees so that they can examine more digital currency firms, which he described as “rife” with non-compliance.</p>
<p>The conference occurred before the Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government. Gensler discussed the ongoing changes and rapid growth of certain markets, a big one being digital currency. He said there are more people participating in the space than ever before. This puts them all at risk given how many of the enterprises allegedly don’t follow present financial rules and securities laws.</p>
<p>Right now, according to the SEC head, the Division of Enforcement and Examinations makes up roughly half of the agency’s staff. As it stands, the Division garnered more than 35,000 separate tips, referrals, and complaints from whistleblowers in 2022 alone.</p>
<p>Gensler has no doubt this will get worse over time if the SEC is not permitted to do all it can in the coming months and weeks to prevent further bad actors from having a hand in the growing digital currency industry. He said the Division brought more than 750 unique actions against crypto companies last year, but that this was not enough to get everyone that needed to be investigated. Overall, these actions led to nearly $6.5 million in penalty fees.</p>
<p>When asked by Wisconsin Democrat Rep. Mark Pocan if the SEC has adequate research to investigate the present crypto issues making their way to the top of the SEC’s priorities list, Gensler answered:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re stretched thin, sir. This is a field that has [a] significant amount of non-compliance in it. We’ve increased our resources there, but we could always use more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The funding that Gensler is now suggesting would arrive as early as 2024 and permit the agency to fill another 170 separate positions. It would also grant full-year funding to all the people hired by the agency in 2023.</p>
<h2>Going After Every Company</h2>
<p>The SEC has developed a big goal to go after and persecute practically every single digital currency company in the last few weeks. For example, leading US digital currency exchange Coinbase has recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">received a Wells notice</a> from the SEC, suggesting the company could face legal action relatively soon.</p>
<p>The agency has also gone after Kraken, another Northern California-based digital trading platform. The enterprise was forced to part <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/" data-wpel-link="internal">with a $30 million penalty</a> fee and end all its staking services and activities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin bull and hedge fund manager Mike Novogratz has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/mike-novogratz-challenges-steve-hanke-after-the-top-economist-bashes-bitcoin-as-a-fool-s-game/ar-AA19dE50" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gotten into a bit of a battle</a> with top economist Steve Hanke over bitcoin. The latter is against it, while the former is practically willing to bet everything he has on the asset.</p>
<h2>Mike Novogratz Comes to Bitcoin&#8217;s Aid</h2>
<p>In a recent tweet, Hanke took aim at bitcoin, calling it a “fool’s game.” He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin is a highly speculative asset, not a currency. Unreliability, lack of stability, and susceptibility to fraud will continue to plague this cryptocurrency. Don&#8217;t be tricked; buying bitcoin is a fool&#8217;s game.</p></blockquote>
<p>In retaliation, Novogratz commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Steve, it has outperformed all assets [year to date] over two years and three years on a risk adjusted weighting (sharpe ratio). It&#8217;s been safer than JPM and Google. Run the numbers yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Novogratz has always been there to support bitcoin, even when nobody else is. He’s commented in the past that he thinks the price of BTC could potentially rise to $500,000 as we get closer to 2030, though frankly, if the asset simply <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/mike-novogratz-will-be-happy-if-btc-reaches-30k-at-the-end-of-the-year/" data-wpel-link="internal">reaches a price of about</a> $30,000 by the end of the year, he’ll be happy with that considering the terrible bear run it had during 2022 and how hard it’s been for the asset to pull itself out of the doldrums.</p>
<p>2022 was arguably the worst year on record for bitcoin. The token lost more than 70 percent of its value over the course of 12 short months. Initially, the asset was trading at a new all-time high of about $68,000 per unit. This was in November of 2021. From there, it incurred a series of losses that ultimately brought it down into the mid-$16K range by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>Now, however, the asset appears to be picking itself back up as at the time of writing, the currency is trading at $28,000. This is nowhere near where it was just a year and a half ago, but we’re certainly getting there.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot of room for healing, but the fact that BTC has the initiative to be pushing itself the way it is seems to be giving a lot of fans and investors hope that perhaps the negativity of the previous year can finally be put behind them. That $28,000 price shows that the currency has managed to add roughly $12,000 to its value in just a few months.</p>
<h2>Some, Like the SEC, Don&#8217;t Think Assets Like BTC Are Reliable</h2>
<p>Sadly, while there are certainly people out there who would agree with Novogratz that bitcoin is something unique, there are other parties that will probably side with Hanke like the SEC. In a recent statement, the agency said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The only money you should put at risk with any speculative investment is money you can afford to lose entirely.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michigan has become a state where crypto <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/ag-nessel-and-michigan-state-police-issue-warning-on-the-dangers-of-cryptocurrency-and-bitcoin-scams/ar-AA19etOm" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">fraud runs rampant</a>, and the region’s attorney general Dana Nessel is warning citizens about what they can do to ensure they never fall victim to digital currency <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scams/" data-wpel-link="internal">scammers</a> or fraud.</p>
<h2>Dana Nessel on How to Avoid Crypto Fraud</h2>
<p>In a statement, Nessel said older adults are often targeted by bad actors as they assume they’ll be unfamiliar with new technology waves or how applications work. Thus, they feel they’re the most vulnerable and can be convinced that a scam is, in fact, legitimate. Nessel said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cryptocurrency is a new, complex market that causes confusion among even seasoned investors, and bad actors are exploiting this arena to victimize people of all ages.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a press release, Nessel as well as the Michigan State Police said nobody should withdraw cash at branches they often use or go to. This is the easiest way to get caught in something you’ll wind up regretting later. Also, never lie to branch tellers or other bank employees about why you’re withdrawing money. Sometimes, telling them the truth is all that’s needed to get authorities in play and ensure scammers are taken down.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone receives a phone call that offers instructions on how to get money out of an ATM, that call should be ignored. If a person does wind up answering the call, never leave it open or let the cell phone lie around. Nessel said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Residents should be wary of unsolicited requests from strangers on the phone or internet and especially requests to make bank withdrawals or deposits at cryptocurrency kiosks or bitcoin ATMs.</p></blockquote>
<p>In conclusion, legitimate crypto investment opportunities will never come from people you know, nor will they be delivered via social media pages. Thus, if you’re told to send someone money through Facebook or a similar platform, these words shouldn’t be adhered to. Also, be sure to inform authorities right away if you receive such communication.</p>
<p>Detective First Lt. James Ellis – commander of the MSP Cyber Section – said Michigan is becoming a hotbed of crypto crime, and that the wave is increasing across the country. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Online exchanges are being exploited more frequently with the account holders’ crypto being stolen, like a bank robber stealing funds from your bank&#8217;s safe, but much easier. Bad actors are also calling and emailing victims directly, duping them out of their crypto and cash with get rich schemes, romance scams, or by creating false emergencies that must be dealt with immediately, playing on the victim&#8217;s emotions.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Never Trust Someone You Don&#8217;t Know</h2>
<p>He concluded by saying you should never let someone you don’t know access your computer or accounts. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Never allow anyone you don&#8217;t know remote access to your computer or accounts when they offer assistance to help.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, it was announced that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had filed a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/" data-wpel-link="internal">lawsuit against Binance</a>, the biggest and most popular digital currency trading platform in the world. There are many Ripple fans out there who are concerned that the suit <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/28/new-fears-ripples-xrp-braces-after-bitcoin-and-ethereum-binance-shock-triggers-crypto-price-chaos/?sh=3853bc5a380f" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="follow noopener">could have drastic</a> effects on XRP, the platform’s native token, and that the asset could experience volatility like never before.</p>
<h2>How Will Ripple Be Classified?</h2>
<p>Ripple has added about 40 percent to its price since the beginning of the year, suggesting that while it has certainly enjoyed the effects of the bull run, it hasn’t witnessed its price or value expand as much as bitcoin or Ethereum have. However, there are many analysts out there that are continuing to argue in favor of it, and they believe the currency has what it takes to completely revamp the digital currency arena in ways nobody thought possible.</p>
<p>Genevieve Roch-Decter, the chief executive of capital market advisory company Grit Capital, explained in a recently emailed statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite new fears arising from the CFTC filing against Binance that XRP tokens could be considered commodities, XRP has surged over the last 24 hours in stark contrast to broader crypto markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the reasons the present CFTC lawsuit against Binance is bringing so much attention to Ripple has to do with the latter’s present case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Not long ago, the SEC <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-sec-is-looking-to-file-legal-action-against-ripple/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed a lawsuit against</a> Ripple, claiming it violated numerous securities laws. Ripple has vowed to fight the lawsuit and at the time of writing, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-secs-case-against-ripple-could-result-in-a-massive-win-for-the-crypto-company/" data-wpel-link="internal">appears to be on the verge</a> of winning its case after gaining steam in a U.S. courtroom.</p>
<p>Many executives of Ripple – including chief technology officer David Schwartz – believe Ripple is more of a commodity, and thus shouldn’t fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. This is why he and his team have agreed to fight the suit with all their might. On Twitter, Schwartz stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>XRP is a raw good that trades in commerce, and one XRP is treated as equivalent to every other XRP. That&#8217;s pretty much the definition of a commodity. No part of XRP&#8217;s value comes from anyone else&#8217;s legal obligations to XRP holders.</p></blockquote>
<h2>So Many Poorly Classified Tokens Out There</h2>
<p>The lawsuit between both the CFTC and Binance alleges that several digital assets in circulation right now – including bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Binance’s USD token – are all commodities, and thus should be regulated by the agency. Schwartz is clearly of the opinion that Ripple also falls into this category, and thus the SEC needs to butt out and mind its own business.</p>
<p>The SEC has been in the process of bullying several digital currency companies as of late including Coinbase, which recently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/" data-wpel-link="internal">received a Wells notice</a> from the agency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rajeev Chandrasekhar – the minister of state for IT and electronics – <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/news/cryptocurrency-presents-a-legitimate-case-of-macroeconomic-risk-says-rajeev-chandrasekhar/ar-AA19cMAK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said crypto could present</a> a “legitimate case of macroeconomic risks,” in a recent report. He also said that a world without crypto regulation is a dangerous one.</p>
<h2>Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Crypto in India</h2>
<p>Chandrasekhar commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a very legit case that crypto represents macroeconomic risks. It represents many other types of risks. FTX and other cases reaffirm that crypto is not business as usual and crypto is not innovation. In India, crypto is not illegal if you buy them through legitimate channels of LRS (liberalized remittances scheme) which are RBI-approved dispensation on foreign exchange. It is your choice to lose money or make money, and the government does not get in the business of where you invest in and what you invest in, but we certainly have the obligation to explain to the Indian citizens that you can&#8217;t exchange rupee for crypto.</p></blockquote>
<p>He further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>RBI is very clear on this and we should respect their views on how they chart out the crypto course and crypto roadmap. They have said CBDC (central bank digital currency) is the route, and I have no problem with that. It is the best way to do that without creating any downside risk to the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Chandrasekhar also said that he’s not concerned about the lack of funding going to tech startups and crypto companies as of late. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peaks and troughs and ups and downs and business cycles are very inherent in startups. We are seeing a cycle that would&#8217;ve played anyway… Also, people are getting smart about where value lies and where IP is. Certainly, COVID and over stimulus in [the] U.S. and European economies and [the] Russia-Ukraine war have caused some significant headwinds in risk aversion… People are a lot more careful and prudent, which is causing valuation corrections.</p></blockquote>
<p>His thoughts towards regulation are concerning in many ways given how many people working in a regulatory capacity today are not fit to be doing so. Look at the U.S., for example, where virtually everyone in the federal government that’s now voicing support for crypto regulation accepted bribes and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sam-bankman-fried-gave-a-lot-of-money-to-democrats-what-will-they-do-with-it/" data-wpel-link="internal">campaign donation funds</a> from Sam Bankman-Fried, the man behind FTX.</p>
<h2>The Mystery Behind FTX</h2>
<p>It does not seem possible that these individuals could <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-did-the-ftx-fall-expose-a-government-conspiracy/" data-wpel-link="internal">have had such close</a> ties to a criminal and not seen the kind of shady practices occurring behind the closed doors of his exchange. The idea could be that FTX was a setup of sorts. That the exchange would collapse after everyone had their chance to benefit from it and then they could swoop in and make their mark by taking away everyone’s financial freedom.</p>
