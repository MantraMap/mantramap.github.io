<p>The Hideaways (HDWY), Stellar (XLM), and Bitcoin (BTC) are three promising cryptocurrencies that can help you diversify your cryptocurrency portfolio. Stellar and Bitcoin have recently dropped in value, whereas The Hideaways (HDWY) has remained stable.</p>
<p>Discover why Stellar (XLM) and Bitcoin (BTC) investors are making the switch to The Hideaways (HDWY), a newcomer in the crypto industry that has seen a rise of 800% in a short amount of time.</p>
Stellar (XLM) Price Falls 72% In One Year
<p>Stella (XLM) holders had a difficult year as the token's value has continued to decrease throughout the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts question what will happen to Stellar (XLM) when over 25 billion tokens have been distributed. Stellar (XLM) is a novel coin that enables value transfer between assets, and it has several potential use cases.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM) tokens enable smart contracts and facilitate the transfer of a wide variety of assets across the Stellar network. Unlike Bitcoin, XLM cannot be mined since it does not use the proof-of-work algorithm.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, one unit of Stellar (XLM) costs $0.09 and had a 24-hour trading volume of $53,669,096.</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Price Struggling
<p>On Friday, cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin (BTC), fell. There are signs of widespread pessimism among market participants as the digital asset field continues to feel the effects of the repercussions of the bankruptcy of the crypto exchange FTX.</p>
<p>Bitcoin's value was decreasing, down to roughly $16,500, or less than 1% in the preceding 24 hours. Even while the entire repercussions of FTX's bankruptcy are likely still unknown, the largest crypto has maintained above its two-year lows near $15,550, which were recorded during peaks of selling over fears over instability at FTX and eventually its bankruptcy. However, Bitcoin has still lost over 20% of its value in the past few weeks and is currently selling for less than 25% of its record-high price of around $69,000 from a year ago.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) investors are looking elsewhere, and The Hideaways (HDWY) are the latest hot ticket.</p>
