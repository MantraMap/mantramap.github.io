<p>Within the economic monetary system, continuous printing of fiat currency means that the purchasing power of the dollar is always falling. Bitcoin is scarce with a fixed supply. Do the Maths.</p>
Purchasing power is dwindling fast
<p>For the average Joe and Jane, finding enough money (currency) to pay the bills always seems to get more and more difficult with each passing year. Both of them probably work, unlike their parents or grandparents who seemed to get along on just one wage.</p>
<p>The last few years had seemed much worse. Since the Pandemic, when bank accounts were pretty flush with government handouts, things have begun to get more problematic. Now, many families are not able to save, and if they had to find just a few hundred dollars for an unexpected shortfall, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t be able to produce it.</p>
<p>What has happened is that governments have printed their way out of the Pandemic, and if we are really being factual, they have been printing more and more currency for many decades because that is the only way this debt-based system stays afloat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The countries of the world all use a fiat monetary system, and since the US dollar came off of its gold backing in 1971, they have remained pegged to a currency that is being printed with gay abandon at the expense of the purchasing power of all citizens.</p>
<p>There is only one destination for all fiat currencies and that is zero, just like every fiat currency in the history of the world. The average lifespan of a fiat currency is only 27 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the creation of the US Federal Reserve system in 1913, the dollar has fallen in purchasing power. One dollar at the time of the Pandemic in 2020 was worth more than $26 back in 1913.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With trillions being added since the outbreak of Covid in 2020, that figure has become far worse. Also, with the Federal Reserve probably loosening its monetary policy as the US heads towards recession, and given that the debt ceiling has no ceiling for the next 2 years, at least another $4 trillion will be added to the debt pile, and will further eat away at the purchasing power of all.</p>
Bitcoin is the way out
<p>Bitcoin will only ever have a supply of 21 million coins. It is hugely decentralised, incredibly secure, and well out of the reach of any government to confiscate or manipulate.</p>
<p>The average Joe and Jane have a way to get any savings out of failing banks and into Bitcoin. The mainstream narrative on Bitcoin is a cover to prevent people from doing the obvious thing. Education is the only way to help people protect themselves from what is to come.</p>
