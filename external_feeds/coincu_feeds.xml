<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flare, an EVM-based Layer 1 blockchain, aims to extend the utility of blockchains by providing decentralized access services to high-integrity data from other chains and Web2. Let&#8217;s take a closer look at what the Flare Network is, how it works, its key features, tokens, and mission.</strong></h5>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">What is Flare Network?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-371.png"><img decoding="async" width="1170" height="607" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-371.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186390" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 2"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159122-flare-network-has-officially-launched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flare Network</a> is an interoperable Layer 1 proof-of-stake blockchain, using the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM). Flare (FLR) was created in 2020. Basically the EVM converts smart contracts into instructions that a computer can read. This allows the network to run Turing-complete smart contracts. Turing-completeness means that it can run almost any computational task, as long as there is enough memory to run it.</p>



<p>It can combine several powerful properties to create an ecosystem of decentralized applications. In a nutshell, Flare aims to bring smart contracts and interoperability to blockchains.</p>



<p>The Ripple blockchain powered by XRP is one of the main goals and inspirations of the Flare Network. Flare proposes to scale PoS blockchains without compromising their security. It does this by ensuring that the security of the network is not tied only to its native tokens, as is the case with most, if not all, PoS networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Who is behind Flare Networks?</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="390" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186389" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370-300x130.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370-768x333.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-370-750x325.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 3"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Flare Network&#8217;s CEO and co-founder is Hugo Philion. Before creating Flare, he was the founder of the modular building system, Future Generations. His expertise is in investing and he holds a Bachelor of Science in Investment and Financial Risk Management from Cass Business School.</p>



<p>He later received a Master of Science in Machine Learning from UCL. He also has experience working as a commodity derivatives portfolio manager at two funds valued at over $1 billion.</p>



<p>Sean Rowan is the second co-founder and CTO of Flare. Sean has been active in the blockchain community since he and colleagues at UCLA and TCD developed safe communication protocols for automobiles that use blockchain-based public key infrastructure in 2015. Prior to that, he graduated from Trinity College Dublin with a combined BA in Mathematics and a BE in Electronic and Computer Engineering.</p>



<p>Then he continued on to University College London to acquire a Master of Science in Machine Learning, most likely where he first met Hugo Philion. Additionally, Sean worked as an R&amp;D Engineer at RAIL in Dublin, Ireland, where he created backend networking software for robot medical assistants. In November 2019, TIME magazine&#8217;s cover showed the most recent iteration of this robot from RAIL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">How does Flare Network work?</h2>



<p>The Flare Network acts as a Turing Complete Byzantine Agreement Network, using the Flare Consensus Protocol. Turing complete means that the Flare network can run Turing complete smart contracts, which can emulate any computer algorithm. This makes it easier for any developer or computer using any coding language to run smart contracts on the network.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Flare uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine to deploy this smart contract. EVM makes it easier for Ethereum developers to build applications on Flare.</p>



<p>To promote interoperability between different blockchains, the Flare network uses two protocols. The first is a State Connector and the second is an Oracle Time Series Outbreak (FTSO). State Connectors help collect external data from other blockchains. This data is processed on-chain to provide consensus on the state of any blockchain Flare connects to.</p>



<p>That way, the Flare Network can recreate whatever is happening on the blockchain it connects to. On the other hand, Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) enables decentralized time series data collection. They are collected over a consistent period of time across other blockchains. Data can include things like data metrics, asset prices, and more.</p>



<p>The Flare network can communicate and exchange data across multiple blockchains through both protocols. This promotes interoperability, especially in building and using applications across different networks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Features of Flare Network</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong></h3>



<p>Software that aids in deploying and executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain is known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Additionally, it offers a setting in which programmers may create decentralized apps (DApps) on the network. EVM performs a comparable function in Flare Network by hosting DApps and executing smart contracts. Because of this, Ethereum developers may profit from the network.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Flare State Connector Protocol</strong></h3>



<p>A smart contract called the Flare State Connector protocol enables the Flare Network to gather information from any linked blockchain. By utilizing separate attestation providers, it does this in a decentralized and safe manner. These service providers independently glean information from a relevant blockchain. When there is adequate agreement, The Flare Network releases this information.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oracle Protocol Outbreak Time Series (FTSO)</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-368.png"><img decoding="async" width="804" height="318" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-368.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186385" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 4"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FTSO workflow </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Flare Time Series Oracle Protocol (FTSO) is another cross-chain data collection and authentication feature on the Flare Network. In contrast to Stateful Connection Protocol, FTSO collects time-specific data. FTSO uses independent data providers to ensure data collection is decentralized and secure. Time-specific data can come from places like cryptocurrency exchanges. It is then automatically weighted depending on the information provider&#8217;s voting power. The average is calculated to give an estimate that can be used on Flare after the data is weighted.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Songbird</strong></h3>



<p>Songbird is Flare&#8217;s &#8216;Canary&#8217; network. This is a test/test net with the exact same features and functionality as Flare. Here, independent developers and teams from Flare can perform real tests on the test network. They do this to see how their changes will affect the Flare network. This makes it easier and more secure to test and deploy the proposed changes without the risk of jeopardizing the main network.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">FLR token</h2>



<p>FLR is the native token of Flare Network. Its basic use case is similar to other native tokens – to prevent spam attacks. If transactions were free, then spamming and clogging the network with useless transactions would also be free.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the FLR token used for?</strong></h3>



<p>FLR can be used for the following functions:</p>



<ul>
<li>As collateral in decentralized applications (DApps)</li>



<li>To provide data to an on-chain oracle</li>



<li>Participate in protocol governance</li>
</ul>



<p>These three components aim to enable an ecosystem of Spark-based applications called Spark Dependent Applications (SDA). SDA may also allow for unreliable representation of tokens on other networks. Even networks that don&#8217;t support smart contracts.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Token Allocation</strong></h3>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-369.png"><img decoding="async" width="1622" height="672" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-369.png" alt="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential" class="wp-image-186388" title="Flare Network Review: Blockchain Using EVM With Breakthrough Potential 5"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Initial token distribution: Macro view of total FLR allocation</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There are 100 billion FLR tokens available for distribution among the network&#8217;s key stakeholders. 58% of tokens will go to Flare community through airdrops. Then, 19% is allocated to the development team, advocates and advisors. Finally, Flare spends 22.5% of its tokens on investment and product development.</p>



<p>The first token distribution event was scheduled for 2020. Due to the aforementioned Ripple lawsuit, the first airdrop instead happened during a token distribution event on May 9th. 1, 2023. Eligible XRP holders received 4.28 billion FLR through centralized exchanges like Binance, Kraken, Kucoin, and OKX.</p>



<p>The 4.28 billion FLR airdrop represents 15% of the tokens allocated to the community. The remaining 85% of tokens will be distributed depending on the votes of current holders who are expected to wrap their FLR tokens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Pros and Cons</h2>



<p>The first advantage of the Flare network is its ability to make blockchains interoperable. This is an advantage for blockchain developers and users when trading; Flare&#8217;s technology allows the transfer of information between multiple blockchains.</p>



<p>Second, Flare networks help PoS blockchains grow without jeopardizing their security. Flare supports this by allowing smart contract platforms to scale without just linking the security of the network to their native token. The network also provides an environment to build DApps without worrying about code incompatibilities due to Turing completion. Finally, by integrating the Ethereum Virtual Machine, Flare continues to act to scale the smart contract network.</p>



<p>Although there are many advantages, there are still some disadvantages to the network. The main and biggest limitation is Flare&#8217;s dependence on the Ripple network. The network delayed its launch and broadcast for two years due to Ripple&#8217;s lawsuit. The network will be at a disadvantage in the long run if it continues to be profoundly affected by the functions of a blockchain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Overall, Flare Network is a layer 1 blockchain ecosystem and decentralized oracle network. The protocol incorporates a unique stack and token generation system built to enable programmability and cross-chain communication. The goal of the project is to enable HODLer to unlock liquidity and expand DeFi adoption.</p>



<p>There are many benefits obtained by Flare users. Firstly, the network improves interoperability across the entire market which improves liquidity. Users can gain access to DeFi features with deep liquidity pool by using Flare. This structure also supports scalable EVM-based smart contracts, which makes it an ideal solution for Ethereum developers looking for lower fees.</p>



<p>Another thing to remember is that Flare started with Ripple, but it could theoretically add smart contract functionality and interoperability to any blockchain. Considering that three-quarters of the value in public blockchain tokens cannot be used with smart contracts in a trustless manner, Flare currently has a huge potential growth curve ahead.</p>

<p>The digital assets mined by the ADGM Entity will be distributed twice each month and in line with Zero Two and Marathon&#8217;s equity ownership, respectively.</p>



<p>The companies said that they launched a pilot operation in Abu Dhabi to explore the feasibility of immersion mining. In hot areas, immersion mining, which includes immersing mining gear in a liquid coolant, is challenging. Nonetheless, two businesses were able to develop their own immersion solution and discovered that this strategy was practical.</p>



<p>The news of the prospective mining facility comes as officials from the US-based crypto exchange Coinbase visit the UAE to assess the region&#8217;s potential as a strategic hub for its worldwide operations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>OKX sends $60M to bankrupt Alameda Research wallet in 16 transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>Alameda Research&#8217;s wallet holds $285.86M in crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX creditors try to recover assets, while speculation surrounds FTX&#8217;s relaunch.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to data from Arkham Intelligence, OKX sent over $60 million worth of crypto assets to the wallet of bankrupt Alameda Research in the last five hours. </strong></h5>

<p>This was accomplished through 16 transactions, which included 10 deposits of $5 million USDT and 337,859 MASK (roughly $1.30 million). It&#8217;s worth noting that OKX has promised to cooperate with FTX debtors and law enforcement officials to return any funds linked to the bankrupt firm on its platform.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538.jpeg"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="488" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1024x488.jpeg" alt="Screenshot 2023 05 09 145538" class="wp-image-186386" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1024x488.jpeg 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-300x143.jpeg 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-768x366.jpeg 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-750x358.jpeg 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538-1140x544.jpeg 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-09-145538.jpeg 1516w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="OKX Transfers Whopping $60M To Alameda&#039;s Crypto Wallet 13"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Source: Arkham Intelligence</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Moreover, during the last seven days, the Alameda wallet has received over 1 million Stargate tokens (STG) and over 5 billion units of the GPEPE meme coin from an unknown wallet. This is quite interesting considering that Alameda&#8217;s largest crypto holding was $61.40 million USDT, with other top holdings being 100 million BitDAO tokens worth $48.61 million, 19,292 Ethereum (ETH) worth $26.5 million, $12.35 million USDC, 28.9 million Stargate tokens worth $18.43 million, and 16.39 million Polygon tokens worth $14.63 million. The firm also holds altcoins like Lido (LDO), FTX Token (FTT), Serum (SRM), among others. Overall, its crypto assets are worth $285.86 million.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that FTX creditors have continued efforts to recover the exchange’s assets. The bankrupt firm has moved to claw back $3.9 billion from Genesis and has been involved in selling several assets belonging to the company.</p>



<p>There is increased speculation that suggests the possibility of FTX restarting operations. A recent court filing confirmed plans to restart FTX’s Japanese subsidiary.</p>

<p>The macro backdrop has changed little in the past few weeks, but market watchers will be focusing on “Binance and whether people are seriously storing cryptos in cold wallets,” according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, in a <a href="https://www.marketpulse.com/newsfeed/oil-gets-bullish-alongside-gold-bitcoin-wavers/emoya" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tuesday note</a>.</p>



<p>As for Bitcoin, it appears to be stuck in a trading range, but if we have a de-risking moment on Wall Street, that will be enough to send cryptos toward the lows seen in mid-March, Moya wrote. Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was off roughly 0.4% on Tuesday to change hands at around $1,844. Despite this, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) jumped over 9% for the day to trade at around $121.29, while Lido&#8217;s governance token (LDO) recently rose by 6% to $1.85.</p>



<p>As measured by the Market Index (CMI), the overall crypto market performance was up roughly half a percentage point for the day. However, equity markets turned mixed ahead of Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for April, with the S&amp;P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closing down 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) slid 0.1%.</p>



<p>In bond markets, the note on the 2-year Treasury yield rose 2 basis points to sit around 4.02%, while the 10-year Treasury yield remained almost flat from Monday, same time, to reach 3.52%.</p>



<p>Investors across the board will be watching the CPI for clues about how the U.S. Federal Reserve will act at its next policy meeting in June. The Fed approved a 25 basis points (bps) increase earlier this month to push the Federal Funds rate to its highest level in 16 years. This development has sparked debate about how the economy will develop in the coming months, with some analysts predicting a strong rebound while others are more cautious. As such, there is a great deal of uncertainly at present, and investors are keeping a close eye on the latest developments to inform their decision-making.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Transactions on the Litecoin network have reached all-time highs as a result of the meme coin craze.</em></li>



<li><em>The consequent high costs on the Bitcoin network sent crypto users seeking for alternatives, contributing to the network&#8217;s rise in transactions.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) has lately seen a large increase in whale transactions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png"><img decoding="async" width="900" height="506" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png" alt="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction" class="wp-image-186370" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366.png 900w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-300x169.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-768x432.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-366-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Litecoin Transactions Surge Over 450% Thanks To BRC-20&#039;s Attraction 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>With a 450% rise since early May, this surge in big transactions might be related to the forthcoming release of LTC-20, a significant improvement to the Litecoin ecosystem.</p>



<p>Transactions on the Litecoin blockchain have <a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-ltc.html#3m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached</a> all-time highs as the meme coin craze and consequent high fees on the Bitcoin network drive crypto consumers to seek alternatives.</p>



<p>According to BitInfoCharts blockchain statistics, Litecoin conducted more than 576,000 transactions in a single day on May 9, approaching Bitcoin&#8217;s 598,000 daily transactions. That is five times the average amount of transactions on the Litecoin blockchain compared to earlier this year, and it is more than twice the previous all-time high around the bull market&#8217;s top in January 2018.</p>

<p>The LTC-20 standard, which has a total supply of 84 million, is being created on top of the Litecoin Ordinals Protocols. The BRC-20 token, an experimental fungible token produced using Ordinals and inscriptions and kept on the Bitcoin base chain, is the goal of this new standard. BRC-20 is a token standard that allows users to generate and transfer tokens over the Bitcoin network using the Ordinals Protocol.</p>



<p>The news comes as the Bitcoin network, which is home to Bitcoin (BTC), the biggest cryptocurrency by market value, is facing high congestion as a result of a flurry of new Bitcoin-based BRC-20 tokens.</p>

<p>The creation of LTC-20 and the BRC-20 tokens is intended to bring considerable innovation and growth to the Litecoin ecosystem, perhaps increasing interest from both retail and institutional investors.</p>



<p>Because of Bitcoin&#8217;s congestion, consumers are looking for cheaper alternatives to transferring value through blockchain, such as stablecoins and the Lightning network.</p>



<p>Litecoin has also seen a surge in activity. According to Glassnode statistics, in addition to a record number of transactions, the number of active wallet addresses reached a new high of 718,000 on Monday. Recently, crypto users produced around 500,000 new addresses in a single day, according to the Litecoin Foundation, citing Glassnode.</p>



<p>The current uptick in Litecoin whale transactions might be attributed to investors awaiting the release of the LTC-20 standard and positioning themselves to profit from any possible price increase after the upgrade. Since the cryptocurrency market often sees price variations as a result of news and events, this spike in whale activity may indicate increased market interest in the imminent LTC-20 release.</p>

<p>Sweeney, the billionaire creator of Unreal Engine and Fortnite, took to Twitter on May 9th to poke fun at the PR firm CEO Ed Zitron&#8217;s piece titled “RIP Metaverse, we hardly knew ye.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The metaverse is dead! Let&#39;s organize an online wake so that we 600,000,000 monthly active users in Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, Sandbox, and VRChat can mourn its passing together in real-time 3D.<a href="https://t.co/tRpFHsdZLw" target="_blank">https://t.co/tRpFHsdZLw</a></p>&mdash; Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1655995809270202392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The article claimed that the &#8220;once-buzzy technology&#8221; had &#8220;died after being abandoned by the business world.&#8221; It specifically mentions Meta&#8217;s virtual reality (VR) platform Horizon Worlds, which Zitron claims has failed to live up to its &#8220;grand promise&#8221; of becoming the future of the internet. The article also cites Decentraland and Yuga Labs’ Otherside as examples of Metaverses that have failed to live up to their hype and suggests that investors have turned their attention to the next big tech fad &#8211; generative AI.</p>



<p>However, Sweeney&#8217;s view on the matter differs greatly. He suggests that there are already 600 million users across virtual world platforms such as Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, The Sandbox, and VR Chat. To mock the article, he jokingly suggested that they organize an online wake so that the 600,000,000 monthly active users can mourn the passing of the Metaverse in real-time 3D.</p>



<p>In a recent move to accelerate the company&#8217;s plans for the Metaverse, Epic Games announced a $2 billion funding round. The investment included a $1 billion investment from Sony Group and KIRKBI, the holding company behind the LEGO Group. This came not long after LEGO Group and Epic Games announced a long-term partnership to build a &#8220;family-friendly&#8221; Metaverse. The details of the collaboration have not yet been revealed, but Lego Group&#8217;s CEO Niels Christiansen has hinted that more details will be announced soon.</p>

<p>He has pled guilty to multiple cybercrime offenses, including conducting a complex SIM swap attack to steal large amounts of cryptocurrency, hacking Twitter, conducting computer intrusions to take over social media accounts, and even cyberstalking two victims, including a minor victim. The U.S. Attorney’s Office Southern District of New York announced Tuesday the charges against O&#8217;Connor.</p>



<p>The 2020 Twitter hack was a major event that resulted in the takeover of multiple high-profile Twitter accounts and used to promote a bitcoin giveaway scam. The attackers managed to hide scam warning responses, including from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, and amassed approximately 11.3 BTC ($103,960) from the fraudulent activity. Despite multi-factor authentication being enabled on some of the accounts, the attackers still managed to take over the accounts and conduct their fraudulent activity.</p>



<p>Florida resident Graham Ivan Clark, an associate of O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s who also participated in the attack, was arrested in March 2021 and tried as a young offender, as he was 17 at the time of the hack. O&#8217;Connor, 23, was also charged by the SDNY and pled guilty for his role in SIM-swapping attacks targeting high-profile executives in the cryptocurrency industry. These attacks resulted in the theft of $794,000 in digital assets.</p>



<p>The SDNY declined to name the company, only stating that it “provided wallet infrastructure and related software to cryptocurrency”, but there have been numerous cases of targeted crypto companies using this same technique. Telecoms such as AT&amp;T and T-Mobile have also been sued by victims over the lack of internal security measures that have allowed these attacks to take place.</p>



<p>It is clear that cybercrime is a major issue, and it is important for companies to take steps to protect themselves and their customers. Cybersecurity measures such as multi-factor authentication and internal security protocols can go a long way in preventing attacks like the 2020 Twitter hack.

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US President Joe Biden called for an end to the tax loophole in favor of crypto investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Such cuts are expected to save $18 billion, he said.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the comments expressed displeasure because Biden has not indicated any remaining tax loopholes.</em></li>
</ul>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US President <a href="https://news.coincu.com/144584-joe-biden-calls-stricter-crypto-regulations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Biden</a> has called for an end to unspecified crypto tax regulations that can be used to circumvent the law by wealthy crypto investors. On Twitter, Biden posted an infographic that reads: &#8220;We think Congress should cut tax loopholes to make crypto investors rich.&#8221;</strong></h5>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We don’t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They’re telling us. <a href="https://t.co/BM6JGMEFeq" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/BM6JGMEFeq</a></p>&mdash; President Biden (@POTUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1655988502079602690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>According to the infographic, such cuts are expected to save $18 billion. However, Joe Biden did not specify which tax loopholes exist where the reforms would generate those savings. It was this that led to comments that disagreed with his opinion.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;what loopholes ser? i gave y&#8217;all more money than i made off this stuff, while taking all the risk. You also realize most american crypto users aren&#8217;t rich, but are using crypto cuz they don&#8217;t feel like they have enough to make ends meet &#8211; because of you guys?&#8221;</p>
<cite>Dogecoin co-founder Bill Markus tweeted about the hype.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Biden also considers opponents of his plan to be Republican supporters.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to guess what MAGA House Republicans value. They&#8217;re telling us.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Initial accounts of Joe Biden&#8217;s tax plan, released in March, suggest that the government could raise $24 billion through crypto tax regulations focused on wash trading.</p>



<p>The Biden administration also proposed a 30% tax on cryptocurrency mining, which was raised again on May 2. However, it remains to be seen how much money this tax could generate. This funding and regulation seem to target miners rather than investors. He wants the government to research ways to make crypto innovation more &#8220;responsible,&#8221; minimizing any negative impacts on the climate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="614" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1024x614.png" alt="US President Calls To Eliminate Tax Loopholes For Wealthy Crypto Investors" class="wp-image-186347" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1024x614.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-300x180.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-768x461.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-750x450.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364-1140x684.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-364.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="US President Calls To Eliminate Tax Loopholes For Wealthy Crypto Investors 31"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>That has set off alarm bells for policymakers worldwide, with China even banning cryptocurrency mining last year. That move led to an exodus of cryptocurrency miners from the country to the United States and other countries, such as Kazakhstan.</p>



<p>Before that, in early March, Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday calling on the government to consider the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. It is a long-awaited directive that has plagued the crypto industry, primarily due to growing regulatory concerns around the world surrounding the nascent digital asset market. The measures focus on six key areas: consumer protection, financial stability, illicit activity, US competitiveness, financial inclusion, and responsible innovation.</p>

The event aims to showcase the latest industry trends, innovations, and technologies while exploring how these subjects change the fintech industry and their impact on the ecosystem. AI has the potential to revolutionise the financial sector by making it more efficient, personalised, and secure. As AI technology advances, we will likely see even more innovative uses of AI in fintech, from risk management, customer service, and investment management to compliance.</h2>
