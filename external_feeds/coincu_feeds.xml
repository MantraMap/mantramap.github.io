<p>In addition to more sophisticated dashboards for trading bitcoin spots and futures, BitMart now provides users with <strong>an easy-to-use buy/sell cryptocurrency tool </strong>as well as a variety of possibilities to earn cryptocurrency. This platform may provide both novice and expert traders with the opportunity to find what they&#8217;re looking for. However, <strong>in the year 2021</strong>, it was the target of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/116650-ftc-investigates-bitmart-exchange/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/116650-ftc-investigates-bitmart-exchange/">a significant hacking attempt</a>.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Introduction of Bitmart</strong></h2>



<p><strong>BitMart was formed in 2017 </strong>with the goal of providing worldwide customers with digital asset trading and investing services. It is registered in<strong> the Cayman Islands.</strong> BitMart exchange, <strong>founded by Sheldon Xia</strong>, is a top-tier trading platform for exchanging, buying, and selling crypto (digital assets), with over <strong>5.5 million users worldwide</strong>. This Cayman Islands-based cryptocurrency exchange has been ranked among the top ten exchanges by CoinMarketCap. Today, the platform is<strong> available in 180 countries and on 123 platforms.</strong> BitMart is now based in the Cayman Islands, with offices in China, South Korea, and the United States. This business is now prospering and has surpassed its competition. The reason for this is exciting features that reduce unnecessary inconveniences.</p>



<p><strong>The platform released the BitMart Token (BMX) in 2018</strong>, which grants token holders trading discounts and other privileges on the exchange. Over the years, the exchange has also incorporated various additional services, such as staking, lending, savings products, and derivatives trading.<strong> The exchange had a security breach in December 2021</strong>, resulting in the loss of <strong>$196 million in cryptocurrencies </strong>after private keys for two of the trading platform&#8217;s hot wallets were hacked. Following the event, the company&#8217;s CEO, Sheldon Xia, said on Twitter that BitMart will pay all impacted users.</p>



<p>Today, the worldwide cryptocurrency exchange has over <strong>9 million users from 180 countries. </strong>You may use BitMart to purchase, sell, trade, and earn bitcoin. BitMart presents offers from its third-party partners when you use the buy and sell tool:</p>



<ul>
<li>Legend Buying and Selling (accepts ACH bank account transfers)</li>



<li>MoonPay (accepts debit cards, credit cards, and Apple Pay) (accepts debit cards, credit cards, and Apple Pay)</li>



<li>Simplex (accepts debit cards, credit cards, and Apple Pay) (accepts debit cards, credit cards, and Apple Pay)</li>
</ul>



<p>After you choose an offer, you must complete the purchase on the website of that partner. The exchange offers a variety of cryptocurrency trading possibilities. It provides a basic trade tool that is easier to use, as well as an advanced trade tool that includes all trading functions. Margin trading and futures trading are also offered.</p>



<p><strong>BitMart Savings and BitMart Staking</strong> allow you to earn interest/rewards on your bitcoin balances. It should be noted that BitMart Savings is not available to residents of the United States, but the staking program is. BitMart Token is the company&#8217;s own cryptocurrency (BMX). Lower trading costs are available if you have a significant amount of BMX tokens. Standard users can<strong> additionally save 25% on trading costs when they pay using BMX tokens.</strong></p>

<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Bitmart Functions</strong></h2>



<h3>BitMart Offers Cryptocurrencies</h3>



<p>This platform allows you to trade<strong> over 1,000 digital currencies and tokens.</strong> Some of the most popular cryptocurrencies available for purchase and sale on the exchange include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Avalanche (AVAX), Axie Infinity (AXS), Binance Coin (BNB), BitMart Token (BMX), Dash (DASH), Decentraland (MANA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Sandbox (SAND), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Solana (SOL) (ZIL).</p>



<p>China, Afghanistan, Congo (Brazzaville), Congo (Kinshasa), Cuba, Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Iraq, Iran, Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, and South Sudan are among<strong> the nations that prohibit its residents from using BitMart</strong>.</p>



<h3>Earn Money By Staking Your Cryptocurrency</h3>



<p>The platform provides crypto staking, which allows you to <strong>lock up assets for 30 to 90 days in order to earn interest</strong> on them. It&#8217;s only accessible with a subset of the cryptocurrencies BitMart offers, but it&#8217;s a straightforward method to increase your holdings. <strong>BitMart Savings</strong> is a savings product that pays interest on different forms of cryptocurrencies. However, it is not available to investors in the United States.</p>



<h3>Security</h3>



<p>The website mentions an &#8220;<strong>advanced risk control system</strong>,&#8221; a hybrid hot and cold wallet system, and the use of multi-signature technology.</p>



<p>However,<strong> the exchange&#8217;s $196 million attack in December 2021</strong> reveals that BitMart&#8217;s security might require some improvement. While many top exchanges keep all client monies in cold storage, BitMart&#8217;s hybrid hot and cold wallet technology has allowed hackers to steal almost $200 million in BitMart customers&#8217; assets. While the exchange has said that it would repay all impacted consumers, a compromise of this magnitude indicates that the exchange&#8217;s security procedures might be improved.</p>



<h3>Trading In Futures And Margin</h3>



<p>BitMart is one of the few exchanges that offers crypto futures trading as well as margin trading, both of which<strong> allow you to leverage your crypto investment</strong>s. Remember that these are already dangerous investment techniques, and adding bitcoin to the mix makes them considerably worse. Because it is possible to lose a significant amount of money in this manner, futures and margin are not advised for most crypto investors.</p>



<p>The features <strong>a tiered trading fee system that begins at 0.25% for ordinary users</strong>. Your level is determined by the quantity of BMX tokens you own; the more tokens you own, the cheaper your trading costs will be. If you pay your trading expenses with BMX tokens, you will receive a 25% discount.</p>



<p>The exchange operates on a maker-taker basis. Ones that are filled quickly are charged taker fees, whereas orders that are not are charged maker fees. The following is the whole trading cost structure for BitMart basic users:</p>

<p><strong>Maker costs begin at 0.04% and taker fees begin at 0.06% for professional users who trade at least 150 BTC per month.</strong> The highest volume traders may potentially qualify for negative trading costs, which means BitMart will pay them a portion of the deal. Professional customers, unlike normal users, do not receive a discount for buying with BMX tokens. The BitMart cost structure for professional users is as follows:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p><strong>Maker costs in futures trading are 0.04%, while taker fees are 0.06%</strong>. There is no discount for using BMX tokens. Deposit fees are not charged by BitMart. Withdrawal costs differ according on the kind of cryptocurrency.</p>



<h3>Launchpad</h3>



<p>The exchange promotes their new project shooting star program. It is classified as <strong>a hybrid of regular listings and IEO</strong>, with a streamlined approach and favorable rules. NULS is their first production on Shooting Stars.</p>



<p><strong>The Mission X2 </strong>initiative is another opportunity to start a new business. It was created for investors who wish to help companies while receiving premiums from them. The investors must bank transfer a particular amount of BMX into the startup of their choice. When the total number of BMX exceeds one million, the project token will be able to enter the BMX market and be associated with BMX. According to our BitMart assessment,<strong> the BMX market transaction fees are distributed to supporters in accordance with their part of the entire daily investment.</strong></p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Pros and Cons</strong></h2>



<h3>Pros&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>Users are able to purchase and sell more than 1,000 different digital currencies and tokens thanks to the platform&#8217;s extensive support for cryptocurrencies.</li>



<li>Users have the opportunity to earn cryptocurrency through the use of staking and savings programs.</li>



<li>Provides a straightforward buy and sell cryptocurrency option the exchange provides a straightforward buy and sell cryptocurrency option, which enables inexperienced users to purchase Bitcoin and other digital currencies using a variety of payment options with only a few clicks.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Cons&nbsp;</h3>



<ul>
<li>In 2021, the following were compromised by a large-scale hack: It was discovered in December 2021 that the private keys of BitMart&#8217;s hot wallets had been accessed, which led to the theft of cryptocurrencies worth a total of $196 million. This indicates that the security procedures used by the exchange were insufficient.</li>



<li>Negative consumer feedback: Several people have posted critical reviews about BitMart on customer review websites and social media platforms.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Is it safe to use Bitmart?</strong></h2>



<p>Right now, there is no way to be entirely confident in BitMart&#8217;s security. They have previously discussed the huge hack, which occurred not long ago. To be fair, BitMart indicated that it will reimburse victims in full, although it is unclear whether the exchange followed through. BitMart isn&#8217;t the first exchange to be hacked, and in response, <strong>it almost certainly updated its security architecture.</strong> What&#8217;s more troubling is the paucity of security information.</p>



<p>Many cryptocurrency exchanges have dedicated web sites that detail their security measures. There isn&#8217;t much information accessible about BitMart, except from a brief snippet on<strong> its webpage about how it employs hybrid hot/cold wallet systems and multi-signature technology.</strong> That&#8217;s a start, but BitMart could go into more information, especially since its reputation isn&#8217;t great.</p>



<p>Transferring the cryptocurrency you purchase to your personal crypto wallet is a wonderful strategy to limit your risk with any crypto exchange. It will then be in your hands and will not be compromised if the exchange is hacked. If you want to trade on this platform but are concerned about the security of your cryptocurrency, this might be a viable solution.</p>



<h2 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p>BitMart is one of the youngest and greatest crypto exchanges, and it has established a significant reputation for itself in the industry in a relatively short amount of time. This is mostly due to the fact that it has an interface that is simple to use, and it also provides a basic trading view. BitMart is accessible through a web browser as well as a mobile browser, which enables its traders to roam about while trading. BitMart functions on a variety of platforms, including mobile, PC, and Mac computers. BitMart is a comprehensive offering that includes a high-quality user experience as well as dependability, and its layout is faultless.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Blockchain data shows that Binance transferred nearly $346 million in Bitcoin to the encryption exchange Bitzlato.</em></li>



<li><em>Prior to the news on January 19, the US Department of Justice will take law enforcement action against the Russian trading platform Bitzlato, and the founder has been arrested.</em></li>



<li><em>The Justice Department and the U.S. Treasury will pay close attention to Binance&#8217;s compliance checks with Bitzlato because it is one of the key counterparties.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>Blockchain data suggests that Binance exchanged around $346 million in Bitcoin for the encryption exchange Bitzlato, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/binance-moved-346-mln-seized-crypto-exchange-bitzlato-data-show-2023-01-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a>.</strong></h5>

<p>On January 18, the Justice Department announced that it had charged <strong>Anatoly Legkodymov</strong>, a Russian citizen living in China and the majority shareholder of Bitzlato, with running an unlicensed money exchange business that fueled a high-tech axis of cryptocrime by processing <strong>$700 million </strong>in illegal funds.</p>



<p>According to the Justice Department, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161343-doj-files-action-against-bitzlato/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitzlato</a> had bragged about how lightly it conducted customer background checks and that when the exchange did request users&#8217; ID information, it frequently let them supply information belonging to straw man registrants.</p>



<p><strong>LocalBitcoins</strong>, situated in Finland, said that it has never collaborated or interacted in any way with <strong>Bitzlato</strong>. There have essentially been no transactions between <strong>LocalBitcoins</strong> and <strong>BitZlato</strong> since <strong>October 2022</strong>, according to the statement. Some <strong>peer-to-peer (P2P) traders</strong> at LocalBitcoins would also have been trading in BitZlato&#8217;s P2P market, it said.</p>



<p>But according to a former American financial regulator and a former law enforcement official, the Justice Department and the U.S. Treasury will <strong>pay close attention to Binance&#8217;s compliance checks with Bitzlato because it is one of the key counterparties.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ross</strong> <strong>Delston</strong>, an independent American lawyer and former banking regulator who is also an expert witness on anti-money laundering issues, referring to FinCEN&#8217;s citing of Binance and LocalBitcoins, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call it a warning shot over the bow, I would call it a guided missile.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The founder of the Russian trading platform Bitzlato has been detained, and the US Department of Justice will pursue legal action against it.</p>



<p>A spokeswoman for Binance <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-19/binance-named-counterparty-to-firm-facing-illicit-fund-charges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> the following comment in response to Bloomberg&#8217;s story that US FinCEN has named Binance as one of Bitzlato&#8217;s primary fund receivers.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Binance provided substantial assistance to international law enforcement partners in support of this investigation. This exemplifies Binance’s commitment to working collaboratively with law enforcement partners worldwide.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>zkRouter, a zero-knowledge proof-based cross-chain infrastructure launched by the cross-chain interoperability protocol Multichain, plans to release a testnet in early February, which will allow cross-chain between Ethereum and Fantom.</em></li>



<li><em>It is reported that zkRouter can be used to support cross-chain bridges, trusted on-chain oracles, smart contract interoperability, cross-chain transactions, multi-chain tokens and NFT, etc.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to the official blog, the zero-knowledge-based cross-chain infrastructure zKRouter, a cross-chain-based interoperability agreement Multichain, is launched in early February, which will allow cross-chain between Ethereum and Fantom</strong>.</h5>

<p>The <strong>zkRouter</strong> from <strong>Multichain</strong> is a strong tool that helps developers connect two distinct blockchains securely using zero-knowledge proofs, which are quick to generate and simple to verify, making them effective and scalable. This enables developers to include the same interoperability offered by <strong>Router</strong> into their dApps while placing a stronger emphasis on security, trustlessness, and decentralization.</p>



<p><strong>Zero-knowledge proofs</strong> enable one party to demonstrate to another the veracity of a transactional statement or information. The main notion behind this is that it is feasible to demonstrate ownership of particular information, such as the beginning of a cross-chain transfer, without disclosing the actual information itself.</p>



<p>When compared to current cross-chain bridge models, the use of ZKP as a component of bridging protocols may be developed to promote trustlessness and decentralization.</p>

<p>The zkRouter is a potent tool for blockchain interoperability since it also <strong>makes it simple for developers to incorporate new features and protocols</strong>. The following are a few potential applications that may be created using zkRouter:</p>



<ul>
<li>Asset cross-chain bridge</li>



<li>On-chain Oracle</li>



<li>Multi-chain contract interoperability</li>



<li>Cross-chain Swap</li>



<li>Multi-chain issuance of tokens and NFTs</li>
</ul>



<p>zkRouter would enable the protocol to handle these different scenarios and also access existing proofs of previous transactions in order to support current transactions. An example of this could be to utilize an earlier lending position on <a href="https://news.coincu.com/161877-vitalik-buterin-researches-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a> in order to back a current borrowing position on Fantom.</p>



<p>With the launch of zkRouter, our partner developers have additional options and are better equipped to create apps that meet customer demands.</p>

<p>According to Reuters, an amendment to a measure governing financial capital requirements for traditional institutions was sneaked in before<strong> the vote and suggested that banks apply a risk-weighting of 1,250% to exposures to crypto-assets</strong>. This means that banks will need to be able to cover a shortfall with capital reserves and not be able to develop leverage when the laws take effect. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which establishes global banking regulations, advocated the % as the highest level of securitization. Basel III changes.</p>



<p>According to the draft report, the bill also specifies that the European Commission should <strong>&#8220;examine whether a dedicated prudential approach for crypto assets would be needed and to develop, if suitable, a legislative proposal to this purpose.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>The organization, which is based in Switzerland, published a report in December that included fresh recommendations for how banks should handle their exposure to digital assets.</p>



<p>The Basel Committee&#8217;s work will continue to be mentioned by EU politicians.</p>

<p>Jared Grey, the head sushi chef, had originally proposed allocating<strong> 100% of xSUSHI sales to support the protocol&#8217;s runway for the following 12 months.</strong></p>



<p>The proposal received 99.9% of the overall vote after being given proper consideration by the DAO.</p>



<p>Future xSushi holders won&#8217;t receive any compensation because all fees will go directly to the Sushi Treasury.</p>

<p>The amount of USDC in circulation increased from $0 to $45 billion in four years, according to Circle&#8217;s<strong> &#8220;State of the USDC Economy&#8221;</strong> study, which was released on January 17. It is supported by wallets from 190 different countries, is the native currency of eight blockchains, and has more than 200 linked protocols.</p>



<p>In February 2022, almost a year ago, <strong>USDC began to increase its stablecoin market share and pose a threat to Tether&#8217;s (USDT) hegemony. </strong>According to study from CryptoSlate published on January 10, 2023, USDC kept expanding its market share among stablecoins despite the bad market. According to data from January 10, USDC presently has a higher transfer volume, while USDT continues to be the market&#8217;s largest stablecoin.</p>

<p>According to QuickNode, <strong>the round was led by Dan Tapiero&#8217;s 10T Holdings and included participation from Tiger Global, Protocol Labs, QED Investors, Alexis Ohanian&#8217;s Seven Seven Six, and others</strong>. According to the agreement, Alex Nabutovsky, CEO and co-founder of QuickNode, Tapiero will be a member of the company&#8217;s board of directors.</p>



<p>During the fallout from FTX, QuickNode was able to raise money. According to Nabutovsky, the company started gathering money for the Series B round in September and completed it in December. Nabutovsky stated that this was made possible by <strong>QN&#8217;s expanding clientele and rising demand for its services.</strong></p>



<p>He claimed that Q3 and Q4 of 2022 were also record quarters for <strong>QN</strong>. <strong>&#8220;Demand and growth were astronomically high. Nearly the previous year, our revenue increased by over 300%.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Web2 and Web3 clients of the business include BNY Mellon, Samsung, LG, Coinbase, Chainalysis, and 1inch Network.</p>



<p>The 3x increase in <strong>QN</strong>&#8216;s sales also resulted in a rise in valuation from its previous fundraising round. According to Nabutovsky, the company had a $250 million market value when it raised<strong> $35 million in Series A funding in October 2021.</strong> To put things in perspective, Alchemy, QuickNode&#8217;s closest rival, was valued at $10.2 billion in February 2022.</p>



<p>According to Nabutovsky, <strong>QN</strong> will mostly hire engineers as it wants to increase its existing workforce of about 120 employees to roughly 180 in the near future with the help of fresh funding. According to Nabutovsky, Miami-based QuickNode also intends to expand its global reach into Asia and Australia.</p>



<p>Future decentralization of QuickNode&#8217;s operations is another goal. To achieve this, it might introduce a native<strong> &#8220;governance token,&#8221;</strong> according to Nabutovsky. However, the business also has future intentions for a public listing. Nabutovsky stated, &#8220;We are very much geared towards an IPO.&#8221; If tokenization ever becomes necessary, it will use a non-security token.</p>



<p>According to Nabutovsky, <strong>QN</strong> might raise a Series C investment before filing for an IPO.</p>

<p>According to BNB&#8217;s website, reserves for over half of the 94 tokens it has issued, known as<strong> &#8220;B-Tokens,&#8221; are kept in a single wallet dubbed &#8220;Binance 8.&#8221; </strong>The wallet has more assets in reserve than are needed to serve as collateral for the B-Tokens that have been issued.</p>



<p>For instance, as of January 23,<strong> Binance 8 has a reserve of about 22,700% for OriginToken&#8217;s OGN. This suggests that user assets from the exchange are also included in the wallet.</strong></p>



<p>To enable their use on other blockchains, such as the BNB Smart Chain, BNB releases its own version of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), USD Coin (USDC), and others. These<strong> B-Tokens, which are backed by 1:1 reserves of the currencies they are based on, are known as Binance-pegged tokens.</strong></p>



<p>Contrary to BNB&#8217;s own policies, B-Token collaterals should never be combined with client assets. a representative for BNB told Bloomberg:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“‘Binance 8’ is an exchange cold wallet. Collateral assets have previously been moved into this wallet in error and referenced accordingly on the B-Token Proof of Collateral page.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It is challenging to determine whether BNB has sufficient reserves to support the B-Tokens it has issued because B-Token collateral and user cash are mixed together.</p>



<p>According to the spokesperson for BNB, all user assets held by the exchange are always &#8220;<strong>backed 1:1.</strong>&#8221; The representative blamed &#8220;past operational oversights&#8221; for the aforementioned &#8220;error,&#8221; but she did not specify when the problem was discovered.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg, the<strong> 41 B-Tokens that Binance owns as collateral are worth approximately $539 million and are stored in the Binance 8 wallet. </strong>According to the research, BNB 8 has more than $16.5 billion in various crypto assets, including $1.8 billion in B-Token-related assets.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange, is eliminating 10% of its workforce, the third wave of layoffs in the past eight months.</em></li>



<li><em>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the company&#8217;s founders and identical twins, announced the announcement in a memo to employees on Monday.</em></li>



<li><em>In July, the business made more worker reductions after cutting 10% of its workforce in June.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/gemini-is-laying-off-10-of-staff-marking-latest-blow-for-winklevoss-crypto-startup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Information</a></em>, internal information shows that the encryption exchange Gemini will lay off 10% of its staff.</strong></h5>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;It was our hope to avoid further reductions after this summer, however, persistent negative macroeconomic conditions and unprecedented fraud perpetuated by bad actors in our industry have left us with no other choice but to revise our outlook and further reduce headcount,&#8221; Winklevoss was quoted as saying.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The layoffs are the third round of layoffs Gemini has made in the past eight months. The Information earlier claimed that from 1,100 employees at the beginning of the year, there were only between <strong>650</strong> and <strong>700 workers </strong>by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The second round of layoffs at <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159390-gemini-has-ended-earn-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a> began in July of last year. In the second round, the corporation fired <strong>68 workers</strong> or <strong>7% of its workforce</strong>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the exchange is engaged in legal proceedings with the<strong> US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</strong> regarding an alleged unregistered offering and sale of securities in conjunction with its collaboration with the cryptocurrency broker <strong>Genesis</strong>.</p>



<p>The year 2023 is off to a tough start for the cryptocurrency industry, with big businesses like<strong> Coinbase Global</strong> slashing staff and <strong>Genesis Global Capital</strong>, the lending arm of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/162145-genesis-owes-38-bil-largest-50-creditors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis</a>, filing for bankruptcy. Due to the collapse of the <strong>FTX</strong> exchange, <strong>Genesis</strong> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week.</p>
