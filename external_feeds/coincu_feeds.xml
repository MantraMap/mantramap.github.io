					<description><![CDATA[Damus received approval to stay in the Apple App Store on Wednesday following a consensus to remove the zaps functionality.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Apple has given the Bitcoin-friendly app Damus permission to continue operating after the throttling.</em></li>



<li><em>The new version of Damus will no longer have zaps, a functionality deemed infringing by the App Store, but will still allow users to send zaps to each other at the profile level.</em></li>



<li><em>The deal follows a two-week battle on June 13 when the tech giant threatened to remove it from the App Store for violating the company&#8217;s in-app purchase regulations.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin-friendly social media app Damus received approval to stay in the Apple App Store on Wednesday following a consensus to remove the zaps functionality.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136-1024x576.png" alt="Damus Adjusts Zaps Function To Avoid Being Removed From Apple App Store" class="wp-image-198713" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2136.png 1312w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Damus Adjusts Zaps Function To Avoid Being Removed From Apple App Store 1"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>According to the app developer, the new version of Damus will no longer support using zaps in posts. This unique feature of Damus allows users to send small amounts of bitcoins to content creators through the Lightning Network, similar to Twitter&#8217;s &#8220;tipping&#8221; feature. Guide by allowing tips or &#8220;amounts&#8221; for content to be paid for in Bitcoin (BTC) instead of Apple Pay.</p>



<p>&#8220;Had to remove the tip button to stay on the app store. I will still build Damus on iOS as a vanilla Nostr client, but it you want to zap posts, apple says nah.&#8221; Damus App developer William Casarin.</p>



<p>This is also the reason why Apple wants the application to remove because Apple thinks of it as the equivalent of selling digital content but still allowing users to tip each other on a profile.</p>



<p>It started on June 13 when the tech giant threatened to remove it from the App Store for violating the company&#8217;s in-app purchase regulations.</p>

<p>Apple has been criticized by the Bitcoin community &#8211; among them former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &#8211; with complaints that it is hindering Bitcoin adoption by imposing overly rigid guidelines regarding Bitcoin-friendly apps on the App Store.</p>



<p>Not only that, but Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong <a href="https://coincu.com/198327-coinbase-ceo-criticizes-apple-damus-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also criticized</a> Apple for being disrespectful to its customers and damaging the brand&#8217;s image by removing the app from the App Store shelves.</p>



<p>However, some Damus supporters see the approval as a small victory despite the compromise to limit posts.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The current selloff in BAYC NFT, as the poster child of the NFT market, has the community seeking for methods to drive value to the assets in a down market.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BAYC is experiencing a selloff, prompting the community to find ways to drive value during a market downturn.</em></li>



<li><em>The slump in BAYC&#8217;s value is attributed to various factors, including general market pessimism, decreased media attention, and high-profile sales by collector Jeffrey Huang.</em></li>



<li><em>While there are indications of a potential recovery, the current price level is still considered insufficient for short-term speculators.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The current selloff in Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT and related digital assets, as the poster child of the NFT market, has the community seeking for methods to drive value to the assets in a down market.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134-1024x576.png" alt="BAYC Floor Price Has Dropped Over 76% Since All-Time High, What&#039;s Next?" class="wp-image-198705" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2134.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BAYC Floor Price Has Dropped Over 76% Since All-Time High, What&#039;s Next? 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>Bored Ape Yacht Club has been on an emotional rollercoaster over the last several days. Several investors sold their prized blue-chip NFTs, triggering a wave of Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD).</p>



<p>BAYC has had a difficult time recently as the bear market has finally taken its toll. Because of the slump, several holders have sold their NFTs, lowering the NFT&#8217;s total value.</p>



<p>The Bored Ape Yacht Club has seen steeper losses in recent weeks, with the floor price plummeting over 19% in the previous 30 days when measured in ETH. A Bored Ape costs 36.5 ETH.</p>



<p>The BAYC collection&#8217;s fortunes have changed due to a multitude of fundamental issues. General market pessimism, the apparent end of usefulness, whale sell-offs, and diminished media attention are among them. But, many in the know believe that recent action in the Blur ecosystem has had the greatest overall influence.</p>



<p>Famous NFT collector Jeffrey Huang, also known as <a href="https://coincu.com/196939-machi-big-brother-stated-zachxbt-framed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Machi Big Brother</a>, sparked a frenzy over BAYC NFTs. Huang&#8217;s succession of sales and subsequent acquisitions from the collection caused significant instability in the NFT&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>Huang sold approximately 50 Apes, according to statistics from Blur, a well-known NFT marketplace. He completed a single transaction last Saturday, selling 19 Apes for 651 ETH, which equated to almost $1.2 million at the time of the sale.</p>



<p>ApeCoin (APE), marketed as the core of the world&#8217;s most valuable NFT ecosystem, reached an all-time low of $1.936 on June 19, down more than 90% from its all-time high, before recovering.</p>

<p>Studying BAYC&#8217;s OpenSea statistics revealed an intriguing pattern. From May through roughly June 18, the NFT maintained a consistent floor price, averaging around 45 ETH. At this writing, the floor price was hanging around 38.6 ETH, indicating that a recovery was underway.</p>

<p>This development revealed a favorable relationship between increasing social interaction and price attempts to correct higher, signaling a possible value recovery.</p>



<p>However, according to the current assessment based on the market situation, this recovery level is still not worth it for speculators to consider short-term holding, a rally to the 40 ETH price level could be held by players waiting for a bullish signal while the current price level still does not satisfy the above requirements.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin's price, the main cryptocurrency, is now at a crossroads as it defends the important $30,000 mark. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Bitcoin&#8217;s price is currently hovering around the crucial $30,000 mark and facing speculation about its future direction.</em></li>



<li><em>Recent remarks by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell regarding tightening inflation through interest rate rises have made BTC hesitant.</em></li>



<li><em>Market analysts are optimistic about BlackRock&#8217;s registration for a spot Bitcoin Spot ETF and anticipate SEC approval.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s price, the main cryptocurrency, is now at a crossroads as it defends the important $30,000 mark. Recent events in the cryptocurrency industry have heightened speculation over Bitcoin&#8217;s future trajectory.</strong></h5>



<p>In the latest news, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the Fed&#8217;s next rate rise would be used to tighten inflation to 2%.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2131.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="960" height="540" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2131.png" alt="Bitcoin Is Waiting To Bounce Out Of The $30,000 Price Zone" class="wp-image-198698" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2131.png 960w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2131-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2131-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2131-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" title="Bitcoin Is Waiting To Bounce Out Of The $30,000 Price Zone 6"></a></figure></div>


<p>Powell <a href="https://coincu.com/198636-feds-jerome-powell-hints-upcoming-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maintained</a> the Fed&#8217;s consensus for more interest rate rises this year during a two-day conversation with fellow central bank leaders at the European Central Bank Conference on Central Banking 2023 in Sintra, Portugal.</p>



<p>As a consequence, Bitcoin looked reluctant, erasing the previous day&#8217;s gains to avoid a further assault on annual highs of around $31,000.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has remained stable despite a 25% increase since June 15. After its recent rise, Bitcoin has established a new high of $31,400, surpassing the previous local high of $30,960.</p>



<p>BTC is currently priced at $30,192, with a 24-hour trading volume of $14.2 billion. It has witnessed a slight downtick of less than 1.8% during this timeframe.</p>



<p>The price of BTC is also approaching the Fib 23.6% level, and this is also the $30,000 round price zone. This shows that this price is being defended very well by the bulls, if there is a break below the $29,800 price area and a strong move up, it shows that the bulls are still waiting patiently.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>In addition, the good resistance level is also the peak it created recently, which is very solid. A breakout above the $31,400 price area is the money for BTC to rally to new highs this year.</p>



<p>Moreover, the fact that BlackRock went ahead and registered for the spot BTC Exchange Traded Fund seems to be having a good impact on Bitcoin at this time.</p>



<p>Market analysts are unanimous in their belief that BlackRock will triumph this time. The US SEC is anticipated to approve the application since its concerns have been resolved to a large extent. This decision might be very beneficial to the crypto business, helping it recoup from recent losses.</p>

<p>The US SEC has been rejecting applications for spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing the danger of market fraud and manipulation. The commission, however, only permitted ETFs based on Bitcoin futures contracts to function in the market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Ark Invest and BlackRock are incorporating surveillance-sharing in their Bitcoin ETF proposals to deter fraud and market manipulation.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Ark Invest and BlackRock are incorporating surveillance-sharing in their Bitcoin ETF proposals to deter fraud and market manipulation.</em></li>



<li><em>The agreements involve sharing information on trading activity, clearing, and client identity.</em></li>



<li><em>Both companies are vying for the first approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF, but the SEC&#8217;s historical concerns about fraud and manipulation cast uncertainty on the decision&#8217;s timing and outcome.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest has agreed to incorporate a surveillance-sharing agreement in its proposal for a spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) similar to BlackRock.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2126.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="929" height="523" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2126.png" alt="Battle For Bitcoin ETF Dominance: Ark Invest and BlackRock Locked In Showdown" class="wp-image-198686" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2126.png 929w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2126-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2126-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2126-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px" title="Battle For Bitcoin ETF Dominance: Ark Invest and BlackRock Locked In Showdown 9"></a></figure></div>


<p>According to ARK&#8217;s revised <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-028-Amendment-No-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19b-4 filing</a>, the deal would be between the Cboe BZX Exchange, where the ETF would be listed, and a U.S.-based spot Bitcoin trading platform.</p>



<p>The new petition, in particular, contains a surveillance-sharing agreement to discourage fraud and market manipulation. Surveillance-sharing agreements include the exchange of information on market trading activity, clearing activity, and client identity in order to defend against market manipulation.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The Exchange is proposing to take additional steps to those described above to supplement its ability to obtain information that would be helpful in detecting, investigating, and deterring fraud and market manipulation in the Commodity-Based Trust Shares,&#8221; Cboe BZX stated in an amended filing.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With Ark CEO Cathie Wood&#8217;s stakes in Coinbase shares, many speculated that the acquisition would include Coinbase. Cathie Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest just acquired $21 million in Coinbase shares to their portfolio on June 7, 2023.</p>



<p>As a result, if the Ark Bitcoin ETF also intends to employ Coinbase services, there may be a conflict of interest from a partnership standpoint. In any case, this might be a pleasant issue for the US-based crypto exchange.</p>

<p>The application might place ARK in competition with <a href="https://coincu.com/197722-blackrocks-bitcoin-etf-bid-could-ignite-15t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a> for the first approval of a spot bitcoin ETF, given the fund&#8217;s first submission occurred months before BlackRock&#8217;s. The inclusion of the agreement in BlackRock&#8217;s application was seen as a possible breakthrough for the listing of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States; nonetheless, the SEC has never authorized one previously, citing worries about fraud and manipulation over the years.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2128.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="900" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2128.png" alt="Battle For Bitcoin ETF Dominance: Ark Invest and BlackRock Locked In Showdown" class="wp-image-198690" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2128.png 900w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2128-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2128-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2128-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" title="Battle For Bitcoin ETF Dominance: Ark Invest and BlackRock Locked In Showdown 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Wood is one of the Bitcoin advocates who believes the top cryptocurrency will hit the $1 million mark by 2023. Nevertheless, Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas wonders whether the Ark ETF decision will be postponed and the Blackrock file will be granted.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Grayscale's Bitcoin Trust product, GBTC, saw a significant increase of almost 80% in its trading volume. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) trading volume increased by almost 80% in June, reaching $45 million, maintaining its position as the most traded trust product in the industry, accounting for 74% of the volumes. (Data from CCData).</em></li>



<li><em>This surge in GBTC&#8217;s volumes coincides with the growing positive sentiment towards bitcoin and comes as multiple high-profile institutions, including BlackRock, Invesco, and WisdomTree, filed for bitcoin exchange-traded-funds (ETFs) in June. </em></li>



<li><em>Compared to Grayscale&#8217;s ETHE trust, GBTC significantly outperformed in trading volume, capturing 74% of the total trading volume for trust products, while ETHE&#8217;s volumes declined. </em></li>
</ul>

<p>This increase came as BlackRock, one of the largest financial services firms, applied to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a spot bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF), along with two other high-profile institutions, Invesco and WisdomTree, also filing for ETFs. The volume of GBTC increased to $45 million in June 2023, maintaining its position as the industry&#8217;s most traded trust product, accounting for 74% of the volumes, according to CCData.</p>

<p>This surge in GBTC&#8217;s volumes and market share aligns with the growing positive sentiment towards the underlying asset. CCData reported that the surge in BTC&#8217;s volumes and market share aligns with the growing positive sentiment towards the underlying asset. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that compared with Grayscale&#8217;s ETHE trust, GBTC&#8217;s volume significantly outperformed in trading volume. Since September, BTC&#8217;s trading volume rose from $35.6 million to $45 million in June 2023, capturing 74% of the total trading volume for trust products, compared to 50.9% in September. In contrast, ETHE&#8217;s volumes declined from $31 million in September to $14.4 million in June 2023, and from 44.4% to 23.6% market share.</p>



<p>GBTC also witnessed its share price surge to a one-year high after a report about investment asset manager Fidelity Investments preparing to follow BlackRock&#8217;s application for a spot bitcoin ETF with its own. This surge in GBTC&#8217;s share price may indicate a growing interest in bitcoin investment products in the market. It will be interesting to see how this trend develops over the next few months.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Michael Ackerman, a former New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) broker, has been caught operating a fraudulent crypto trading scheme. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYSE-Broker-Settles-54M-CFTC-Charges-for-Crypto-Scam-2.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="800" height="600" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYSE-Broker-Settles-54M-CFTC-Charges-for-Crypto-Scam-2.jpg" alt="NYSE Broker Settles 54M CFTC Charges for Crypto Scam 2" class="wp-image-198676" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYSE-Broker-Settles-54M-CFTC-Charges-for-Crypto-Scam-2.jpg 800w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYSE-Broker-Settles-54M-CFTC-Charges-for-Crypto-Scam-2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYSE-Broker-Settles-54M-CFTC-Charges-for-Crypto-Scam-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/NYSE-Broker-Settles-54M-CFTC-Charges-for-Crypto-Scam-2-750x563.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" title="NYSE Broker Settles $54M CFTC Charges For Crypto Scam 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ackerman was charged in 2020 with defrauding some 150 investors and raising $33 million by promising &#8220;extraordinary profits.&#8221; The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) revealed that Ohio resident Ackerman has been ordered to pay $54 million in damages and penalties by a federal court.</p>



<p>Initially, Ackerman pleaded not guilty to running the scheme. However, he changed his plea to guilty in September 2021. This means that he is now banned from trading in any markets supervised by the watchdog by a judge at the Southern District of New York court.</p>



<p>The final order, signed on June 13, closes the CFTC enforcement case against Ackerman, according to a notice from the regulator. It requires him to pay $27 million in restitution to defrauded victims and a $27 million civil monetary penalty in connection with a fraudulent digital asset trading scheme.</p>

<p>The case against Ackerman is a clear warning to those who engage in fraudulent activity in the crypto trading world. The CFTC is taking steps to protect investors from these schemes, and it is important for traders to be aware of the risks involved when investing in digital assets.</p>



<p>&#8220;It also requires him to pay $27 million in restitution to defrauded victims and a $27 million civil monetary penalty in connection with a fraudulent digital asset trading scheme,&#8221; the notice said.</p>

<p>This development is expected to bring about a significant change in the DeFi ecosystem by creating more opportunities for developers to create innovative solutions. Furthermore, the integration of Chainlink data feeds to Celo&#8217;s blockchain will enhance the security of the platform by ensuring that data is transmitted directly to the blockchain in a secure manner.</p>



<p>“Chainlink data feeds will empower Celo developers, providing critical access to oracle data and services and bolster Celo’s dApps to drive real-world impact and solutions,” Xochitl Cazador, Head of Ecosystem Growth at the Celo Foundation, said. This means that the integration of Chainlink data feeds to Celo&#8217;s blockchain will not only enhance the security of the platform but also provide developers with a powerful tool to create innovative solutions that can be used to solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>The mobile-first blockchain Celo also joined Chainlink Scale in April, a program that gives Celo access to the data provider’s oracle services at a relatively low cost by paying with its own CELO token. The Celo community voted in favor of joining. This means that Celo will have access to a wider range of data and services, which will help to enhance the capabilities of the platform. With the integration of LINK data feeds and access to Chainlink&#8217;s oracle services, Celo is poised to become a major player in the DeFi ecosystem, offering developers a powerful platform to create innovative solutions that can drive real-world impact and solutions.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[KuCoin's decision to enforce know-your-customer verification is in response to the changing regulatory landscape. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>KuCoin and Binance make KYC verification mandatory to comply with regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>Non-KYC users can only use limited features like sell orders, withdrawals still available.</em></li>



<li><em>KuCoin&#8217;s new KYC registration goes into effect on July 15.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>KuCoin&#8217;s decision to enforce know-your-customer verification is in response to the changing regulatory landscape. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation-1024x576.jpg" alt="KuCoin Introduces Compulsory KYC in Move to Embrace Regulation" class="wp-image-198651" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation-300x169.jpg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation-768x432.jpg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation-750x422.jpg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/KuCoin-Introduces-Compulsory-KYC-in-Move-to-Embrace-Regulation.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="KuCoin Takes Security To The Next Level With Mandatory KYC Verification 18"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The exchange will now restrict access to certain features to non-KYC users. According to a press release, these users will be limited to &#8220;spot trading sell orders, futures trading deleveraging, margin trading deleveraging, KuCoin Earn redemption, and ETF redemption.&#8221; This move is aimed at enhancing the security of on-chain assets, which has become a growing concern with the rise of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Starting July 15, KuCoin will require all users to undergo KYC registration. This will be similar to the intermediate verification process that Binance implemented in 2021. Users will need to verify their country of residence and nationality, and provide a government-issued ID. This is in line with the industry&#8217;s efforts to increase transparency and mitigate the risks of illegal activities.</p>

<p>Although withdrawals will still be available, deposit services will be limited to KYC-registered users. This means that users who do not comply with the new policy will not be able to fully utilize KuCoin&#8217;s services.</p>



<p>KC&#8217;s move to enforce KYC registration follows legal action taken against the exchange by various countries. In March of this year, New York Attorney General Letitia James sued KuCoin for operating in New York without registering as a securities and commodities broker-dealer. This is part of a larger crackdown on crypto fraud by the NYAG, which has targeted several other companies as well.</p>



<p>KuCoin&#8217;s decision to enforce KYC registration is a step towards strengthening the security of the exchange&#8217;s platform and complying with regulatory requirements. While it may inconvenience some users, it is a necessary measure to ensure the safety of on-chain assets and prevent illicit activities in the crypto industry.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell hints at further rate rises during a speech at the ECB symposium, aligning with the Fed&#8217;s hawkish stance on inflation.</em></li>



<li><em>ECB President Christine Lagarde also expresses support for additional rate hikes.</em></li>



<li><em>Market expectations anticipate another 0.25 percentage point rate increase at the upcoming July meeting.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On June 28, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell clearly hinted at the likelihood of more rate rises, reiterating the Fed&#8217;s hawkish position on inflation.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Powell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf3M7Quc08E&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke</a> at the European Central Bank (ECB) symposium in Sintra, Portugal, and stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“What we’re aiming for is a stance of policy that’s sufficiently restrictive to bring inflation down to 2% over time. As you get closer to that, you get closer to the place where the risks become more in balance.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Powell&#8217;s words on the day are consistent with the Fed&#8217;s June meeting economic outlook, which <a href="https://coincu.com/197227-jerome-powell-raise-interest-rates-2-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forecasted</a> two further rate rises of 25 basis points this year, as well as Powell&#8217;s testimony to Congress last week.</p>



<p>During a question-and-answer session chaired by Sara Eisen on CNBC, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that a series of rate rises would not be &#8220;taken off the table&#8221; at the Fed meeting. The interview was also attended by ECB President Christine Lagarde, Bank of England (BOE) Governor Andrew Bailey, and Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda.</p>



<p>Considering this projection, the Fed is unlikely to decrease interest rates anytime soon.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We will be restrictive as long as we need to be. If inflation is coming down sharply and we’re confident that it’s on a path to 2%, that would be a different situation—you would begin to think about loosening policy, but we’re a long way from that,” Powell said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ECB President Lagarde also indicated strongly additional rate rises.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;We are not seeing enough tangible evidence of falling underlying inflation,&#8221; she said, adding that she was not thinking about slowing rate hikes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The conference comes two weeks after Powell and his Fed colleagues announced a temporary pause in a sequence of ten consecutive interest rate hikes that started in March 2022. Other central banks, on the other hand, have remained active in their battle against inflation, with both the ECB and the Bank of England recently announcing rate rises.</p>



<p>Markets anticipate that the Fed will approve another 0.25 percentage point hike at its July meeting, then remain on hold as policymakers assess the effect of the increases on the economy. But, in the June meeting, Fed policymakers planned two more rate rises.</p>



<p>Following Jerome Powell’s speech, Bitcoin is currently still trading above the $30,000 mark.</p>

<p> The collection was so popular that it sold out in just fifteen minutes, netting the company a whopping $38 million. The virtual shelves were emptied so fast that the digital assets didn&#8217;t even get a chance to go to a public sale. Only prior holders of Azukis and the BEANZ collection who put down a deposit of 2 ETH were able to purchase the NFTs.</p>

<p>However, not everyone was happy with the new collection. Shortly after its release, community members began to complain that the Elementals collection was too similar to the original January 2022 Azuki collection. Both collections feature characters looking to the left, and one user even joked that the next batch of Azuki NFTs would have them facing to the right.</p>

<p>Another user alleged that Azuki’s latest move has done significant damage to the main collection. According to Blur, Azukis’ floor has plummeted over 30% in the last 24 hours at the time of publication. This may be a cause for concern for the company, as a significant drop in price can cause holders to sell their NFTs in a panic, further depressing the price.</p>

<p>Azuki admitted fault on Twitter on Wednesday, saying “This time, we missed the mark,” and acknowledging that “the [profile picture NFTs] feel similar and, even worse, dilutive to Azuki.” The company recognizes that building a decentralized brand requires great communication and execution, both of which were lacking with the Elementals sale. While the company may have lost some trust from its fans, it is determined to make things right and regain their support.</p>
