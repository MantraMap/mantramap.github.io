<p>In a major development for the crypto community, Shibarium Beta Bridge has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">launched for public testing</a>, bringing Shibarium mainnet closer to launch.</p>



<p>The news, which was announced late Wednesday by LUCIE, Shiba Inu&#8217;s top marketing strategist, has been generating a wave of excitement among cryptocurrency enthusiasts as the revolutionary layer 2 solution inches closer.</p>



<p>“<em>Shibarium Beta Bridge has gone live for public testing! Be among the first to try out this revolutionary cross-chain solution,”</em> wrote LUCIE on the X platform, formerly Twitter.</p>



<p>LUCIE, however, urged users to be cautious and verify authenticity before connecting their wallets to any website, emphasizing that they should not use their real assets during the testing phase. Instead, only faucets, which distribute small amounts of cryptocurrencies as rewards for easy tasks, should be used during testing.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">Shibarium</a> interface displayed in the images shared by the pundit reveals that the layer two protocol will allow staking, enabling users to send and receive crypto assets on the Shibarium network. The protocol also includes a bridge that facilitates deposits and withdrawals between different networks. Additionally, users can test moving their assets from the Ethereum blockchain to Shibarium during the beta testing phase, although the process may take 20-30 minutes.</p>



<p>Reports from users who jumped into testing within an hour of the announcement indicated a successful and positive experience. Many testers expressed excitement and satisfaction with the Shibarium bridge, citing its security and ease of use.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>The Shibarium bridge test is amazingly good, safe and easy to use, between Shibarium and Ethereum. It&#8217;s unbelievably great, especially the security, congratulations to the whole team and UnificationUND,&#8221;</em> wrote one Shib enthusiast &#8220;Cryptolight.&#8221;</p>



<p>The team behind Shibarium has been <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-core-dev-teases-shibarium-launch-timeline-amid-super-bullish-strategy-for-shib/">dropping hints</a> about the imminent mainnet launch of the layer 2 solution for the Shiba Inu network, further fueling anticipation in the crypto community.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, the team launched a YouTube channel for Shibarium and released a video highlighting some of the upcoming network&#8217;s benefits, including increased security, transparency, and improved decentralization for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>The video also sheds light on using the Shibarium bridge for cross-network deposits and withdrawals, as well as the ability to stake holdings and earn rewards on the network. Additionally, it revealed that the Ethereum (ETH) network and Shibarium would mint the same number of tokens, ensuring a seamless transition between the two networks.</p>



<p>However, despite the growing excitement, the exact launch date for Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet remains unknown. While speculation points to the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference in Toronto in August as a possible launch platform, the team has not made any official announcements yet.</p>

<p>Popular blockchain platform <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/cardano">Cardano</a> has achieved a remarkable milestone which sets it apart from other blockchains. Cardano has demonstrated resilience and reliability with an unprecedented uptime of over 2,130 days, translating to an impressive 5.83 years.</p>



<p>While some networks suffer from occasional to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-apple-of-crypto-solana-sol-aims-for-crypto-crown-undeterred-by-network-outages/">frequent outages</a>, Cardano stands out with its perfect track record of zero downtime since its launch in 2017. This makes Cardano one of the most stable blockchain networks in the market, giving users constant, frictionless access to its services.</p>



<p>One of the key factors contributing to Cardano&#8217;s longevity and flawless performance is its design philosophy. Built to last, Cardano&#8217;s infrastructure is one of the few well-researched and peer-reviewed, which its founder Charles Hoskinson has always highlighted as one of its major strengths. Some have in the past criticized the approach, and it has meant that Cardano makes slower progress, albeit being steady.</p>



<p>The constant uptime and resilience of Cardano seem to win over people and increase user engagement. As of last Friday, the network recorded over 72,000 daily transactions, indicating a solid interest in Cardano&#8217;s capabilities.</p>



<p>With 3,182 active stake pools and nearly 23 billion ADA (Cardano&#8217;s native cryptocurrency) staked, community participation in the network remains vital. Stake pools play a critical role in the Cardano ecosystem, contributing to its decentralization and ensuring the security and efficiency of the blockchain. The substantial amount of ADA staked reflects the community&#8217;s confidence in the platform and its potential for long-term growth.</p>



<p>Charles Hoskinson made an interesting statement amid ongoing discussions among blockchain entrepreneurs over staking. Hoskinson said he stakes all of his ADA, illustrating his strong belief in the platform&#8217;s future.</p>



<p>In contrast, Ethereum&#8217;s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently shared his reservations about staking all his ETH holdings due to concerns about security implications. He said: <em>“If you stake your ETH, the keys that access it have to be public on some system that is unwind.”</em></p>



<p>Reacting to Buterin&#8217;s statement, Hoskinson expressed his surprise and disbelief, stating, “I had to listen to this a few times. I’m just at a loss for words,” Hoskinson said.</p>



<p>His dedication to the network&#8217;s success underscores the commitment of the Cardano team to deliver a cutting-edge platform that prioritizes security and user experience.</p>



<p>With a growing community and attracting more developers to the platform, Cardano will continue to improve and strengthen its network. As the crypto industry evolves, it will be interesting to see if Cardano can remain at the forefront of innovation and keep its spot in the top ten of crypto while adding more real-world use cases.</p>

<p>Stuart Alderoty, the Chief Legal Officer of Ripple Labs, has expressed strong confidence in the Court of Appeal, reaffirming the District Court&#8217;s ruling that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">XRP is not a security</a> if the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decides to challenge the decision.</p>



<p>Speaking during TechCrunch&#8217;s Chain Reaction podcast Tuesday, the lawyer discussed the significance of the recent court ruling by New York District Judge Analisa Torres on July 13. In the landmark decision, the judge declared that the XRP token does not fall under the category of securities when sold to the general public. However, she also stipulated that it can be deemed a security in the context of past sales to institutional clients.</p>



<p>The case outcome was hailed as a significant &#8220;win&#8221; by both Ripple Labs and the crypto community, offering a sense of regulatory direction for the much-debated digital asset.</p>



<p>Notably, while the verdict brought relief to Ripple, Alderoty asserted that the search for complete regulatory clarity is far from over.&nbsp; He further noted that despite the SEC&#8217;s persistence in claiming that the initial decision was &#8220;wrongly decided,&#8221; Ripple Labs remains resolute and ready to face any potential appeals.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“We don’t shy away from an appeal and I think the judge got that right and we think that was a faithful application of the law and I think a court of appeal will not only affirm that but maybe even amplify that to even a greater extent.”</em> Said Alderoty.</p>



<p>The possibility of the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/potential-sec-appeal-in-ripple-lawsuit-not-a-blow-to-xrp-legal-expert-reveals-why/">SEC appealing</a> the XRP decision was hinted at last week in legal documents from a separate case involving Terraform Labs. These documents mentioned the agency&#8217;s intention to explore alternative avenues for further review, indicating the possibility of further legal action regarding the classification of XRP.</p>



<p>That said, with the implications of this legal battle extending beyond Ripple&#8217;s immediate interests, industry experts have been sharing their perspectives on the possibility of an appeal, emphasizing the need for regulatory certainty to foster innovation in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space.</p>



<p>According to pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, however, the SEC is likely to abandon the appeal route owing to differences between senior members of the agency, with some arguing against appealing, citing XRP&#8217;s uniqueness, while others advocate appealing to influence other judges. </p>



<p>“<em>Some will say don’t appeal, and the SEC can argue “facts and circumstances” and that XRP is a unique story, one not shared by other tokens,</em> “Deaton said on Tuesday. On the other hand, “<em>not appealing could signal acceptance of the Torres ruling,” </em>he added.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with CNBC, Rebecca Rettig, the Chief Legal Officer at Polygon Labs, revealed exciting developments for Polygon 2.0 that are bound to shake up the blockchain space. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/polygon-2-0-community-members-propose-new-and-improved-governance-framework/">Polygon 2.0</a> aims to integrate various chains, including ZK-EVM and other forward-thinking technologies that Polygon Labs developed to create a unified platform for the entire blockchain industry. This advancement is expected to pave the way for a blockchain-based internet and establish a value layer for the digital world.</p>



<p>Rettig talked about Polygon’s “value prop”, which was recently launched and has attracted interest from various industries, including policymakers, governments, and the general public. Value Prop is an open-source database showcasing blockchain use cases and innovations worldwide. Rettig said many had told her there was an &#8220;aha moment&#8221; when they realised that blockchain-based applications are already happening daily. Major brands like Starbucks, Disney, Sports Illustrated, and Ticketmaster are already integrating blockchain-based internet applications into their operations.</p>



<p>The value prop is an interactive resource with over 430 featured applications across various sectors, such as finance, healthcare, AI, and social media. Users can explore different use cases, including surprising applications like a blockchain-based solution for the California DMV. Notably, the platform has recently introduced &#8220;Impact Locale,&#8221; which showcases how certain blockchain applications are making positive social impacts worldwide.</p>



<p>Polygon Labs is also working on exciting updates for the value prop, incorporating video testimonials from developers explaining why blockchain technology is essential for their projects. In addition, people from all backgrounds will describe how blockchain-based apps have contributed to their lives. This effort intends to show that blockchain can be a force for good by highlighting real-world application cases.</p>



<p>Ms Rettig touched on regulatory questions and expressed her satisfaction with the recent Ripple court decision, which distinguished between securities and transactions in securities. Judge Torres had determined that XRP, as a software token, is not a security. The ruling highlights the importance of comprehensive legislation to manage the crypto asset market in the United States. Rettig said she believes that Congress must work on a broad-scale regulatory framework incorporating agencies such as the SEC and CFTC in ensuring clarity and consistency in the young but growing crypto market.</p>



<p>Rettig said: <em>“And I do think a comprehensive regime can be put together for the crypto asset markets in the United States that will bring the US in line with major other jurisdictions in the world such as the EU and Japan and the UK.”</em></p>



<p>As Polygon 2.0 continues its development and the value prop gains traction as a valuable educational resource, Polygon Labs seems to be in a good position to drive blockchain technology forward and empower the world with innovative solutions already reshaping various industries.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) continues to display a robust <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-btc-signal-sec-formally-accepts-valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-for-review/">bullish outlook</a>, with long-term holders demonstrating a notable absence of selling pressure.</p>



<p>On July 26, Ki Young Ju, the CEO of crypto data analysis firm CryptoQuant, took to X to share insights on BTC&#8217;s current market behaviour, reaffirming the ongoing bullish sentiment.</p>



<p>According to Ki Young Ju, approximately 71% of the realized capitalization of Bitcoin remained unmoved for over six months. This data indicates that long-term holders are not rushing to sell their BTC holdings, contributing to the reduced selling pressure in the market. While low selling pressure doesn&#8217;t guarantee an immediate price increase, he noted that it does suggest that BTC is less likely to be at its cyclic top, providing a positive sign for investors and enthusiasts alike.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/FO9nlrbC3bWZfkfqYSDsqX9M1UGhcAIZ2rKmeFaZz6sSHTJUUb5j0Dm0vnk9QGLsribF_pGVN7DaBsz1WSl9pdTvLZfyr_ZrEnT6iWiEunkZnNArGHkFKSuueosWCb8FIlEXfwKopGxvxPDHPofBmw" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Young&#8217;s findings align with those of on-chain analysis firm Glassnode, which recently reported that the Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Supply had achieved a new all-time high of 14.52 million BTC, equivalent to 75% of the circulating supply.<em> “This suggests HODLing is the preferred market dynamic amongst mature investors,”</em> Glassnode wrote on July 24.</p>



<p>Notably, data by the firm shows that long-term holders, or addresses that hold coins for 155 days or more, currently control roughly three-quarters of the total bitcoin in circulation (19.43BTC).</p>



<p>Elsewhere, another analyst at Cryptoquant, “IT Tech”, has recently offered valuable input on BTC&#8217;s behaviour during bull and bear markets. On Monday, the pundit highlighted the Long Term Holder SOPR (SMA 30) metric, emphasizing the significance of &#8220;level 1&#8221; as a key indicator in distinguishing between the two market phases. According to him, in a bear market, level 1 (Circled in yellow) acts as resistance, while in a bull market, it transforms into solid support.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sw6Dq97oCqOsJ8Z8687S9ehVhdgon1DnSa9ToFDwUYuaLO6WQo1yjmqrvlD7nhec-hUCO-Mo3esX8W0ZydnR0OdG1P3-8DeMQXKb3sa_q24ZxglAvFzcl317uXPD_9r5y8W8Ls3k1PWzI2oqX91cMA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Historic data from 2016 and 2020 showed that after crossing and holding level 1, Bitcoin entered the early bull market phase. The one exception was the period between 2019 and 2020, marred by the black swan event. The 30 SMA has since moved above the level, signalling the early phases of a bull market.</p>



<p>Despite positive indicators, Bitcoin&#8217;s price remains just below $30,000, with the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s upcoming decision on a 25-basis point rate increase creating market uncertainty. Last month the price attempted to push higher following numerous ETF applications led by BlackRock fueling hopes of institutional investments before falling back into the current range. Nevertheless, experts remain confident that the ongoing weakness will be shortlived, with analyst Plan B <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1683807027171139586">predicting</a> massive institutional buying, which will further prop up Bitcoin’s price.</p>



<p>Bitcoin was trading at $29,358 at press time, reflecting a 0.26% growth in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency established by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attracted some attention <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sam-altmans-crypto-project-worldcoin-targets-2-billion-users-with-worldwide-launch/">during its launch</a> this week. According to a report by Reuters, the UK&#8217;s privacy authority, the Information Commission Office (ICO), is looking into the launch stating that it has taken notice of the Worldcoin launch in the UK and will be conducting more research.</p>



<p>Additionally, it emphasized that organizations are required to conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment before processing any data that could be potentially harmful to the public, such as special category biometric data.</p>



<p>The Information Commission Office (ICO) is an independent organization that oversees data protection in the United Kingdom. It is tasked with protecting information rights and ensuring compliance with data protection legislation such as the Data Protection Act (DPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>



<p>The Information Commissioner&#8217;s Office can and has handed out hefty fines like the £20m ($25m) it fined British Airways for breaching data protection laws and processing the personal information of 400,000 customers without proper security procedures.</p>



<p>Worldcoin, the crypto project initiated by Open AI CEO Sam Altman, allows users to provide retina scans to receive digital identification and free cryptocurrency through their service. Worldcoin was launched on July 24 after an initial 2 million people joined the project in the beta phase.</p>



<p>However, it has received criticism, notably <a href="https://zycrypto.com/vitalik-buterin-raises-alarm-over-worldcoin-as-binance-and-other-crypto-exchanges-list-newly-launched-token/">from individuals like Vitalik Buterin</a>, who expressed concerns about the potential privacy implications of sharing personal information by scanning a person’s iris. Buterin makes the case that iris scanning can unintentionally reveal more information than is intended.</p>



<p>The Ethereum founder argues that anyone may check the Worldcoin database to determine if a World ID holder is in the system by scanning their iris and comparing the results.</p>



<p>Buterin is also concerned about the difficulty of obtaining an &#8220;Orb&#8221; device; as such World IDs won&#8217;t be available to everyone but mainly people living in larger cities.</p>



<p>Worldcoin said in a statement to CNBC that they would <em>“comply with all laws and regulations governing the processing of personal data in the markets where Worldcoin is available, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the UK Data Protection Act. From its inception, Worldcoin was designed to protect individual privacy.” </em></p>



<p>According to Worldcoin, the project has built a solid privacy program and deployed a privacy-centric design. They said they had carried out an exhaustive Data Protection Impact Assessment and were immediately addressing requests from people to delete their data.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Worldcoin is trading at $2.19 according to data from CoinGecko, a long way off from the $3.30 it had reached after its launch just days ago.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, he expressed immense satisfaction over the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">partial victory in the court</a>. He called Judge Torres&#8217; decision a significant triumph for both Ripple and the crypto industry in the United States. The decision made public on July 13th, represented a turning point in the continuing lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020 against Ripple.</p>



<p>The main aim of the court&#8217;s decision was to make it clear that a digital token like XRP is not, by definition, an investment contract. Alderoty emphasized that evaluating the circumstances of the token&#8217;s sale and the relationship between the seller and the buyer is essential. He noted that a digital token does not represent a right, title, or interest in the company it is bought from, making it distinct from traditional stocks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-s-outlook-and-future-steps"><strong>Ripple&#8217;s Outlook and Future Steps</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s potential plan to appeal the ruling, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-sec-appeal-could-actually-amplify-ripples-landmark-victory-clo-asserts/">Ripple remains unwavering</a> in its resolve to fight for its legal victory. Alderoty expressed confidence that a Court of Appeal would not only affirm the ruling but could strengthen it further.</p>



<p>Regarding the following steps, Alderoty outlined some unresolved issues concerning sales to institutional buyers. The court is yet to determine whether Ripple&#8217;s executives played any role in aiding and abetting those sales. However, the recent ruling&#8217;s findings and legal opinions remain unchanged and establish the law of the land, according to Alderoty.</p>



<p>Throughout the interview, Alderoty highlighted the importance of a comprehensive regulatory framework for the crypto industry in the United States. He stated that the SEC&#8217;s approach of labelling everything as a security is misguided and leads to uncertainty in the market. Instead, he emphasized the need for rational and understandable regulations that protect consumers, foster innovation, and ensure market integrity.</p>



<p>Alderoty pointed out that the lack of a clear and supportive regulatory environment has pushed Ripple to establish offices in various countries, including Singapore, the UK, Dubai, Brazil, and Ireland. He asserted that the U.S. must work on a comprehensive policy solution to prevent further lagging behind other countries in adopting crypto-friendly regulations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-looking-ahead-the-impact-of-the-court-s-ruling"><strong>Looking Ahead: The Impact of the Court&#8217;s Ruling</strong></h2>



<p>The court&#8217;s decision gave Ripple cause to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/u-s-banks-could-be-exploring-xrp-for-cross-border-payments-following-ripples-legal-victory/">celebrate its triumph</a> and has wider ramifications for the U.S. crypto market. Alderoty thinks the decision makes it very apparent that an asset, such as a digital token, cannot be immediately regarded as a contract for investment. Instead, attention should be paid to who are the parties involved in the trade and the actual manner in which an asset is traded.</p>



<p>Alderoty suggested that this ruling may resonate well in other cases, such as the ongoing Coinbase and Binance cases, as it firmly establishes that the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction extends only to securities. He stressed that while retail purchasers of digital assets deserve protection, there are alternative mechanisms to provide such safeguards without making everything a security.</p>



<p>When asked about the primary regulator for the crypto industry, Alderoty acknowledged the complexity of the question. Rather than focusing on who holds power, he urged for a shift towards finding the best regulatory framework that ensures market integrity, consumer protection, and a conducive environment for crypto innovation.</p>

<p>The development team behind <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-ecosystem-developments-are-blowing-up-as-shib-whales-activity-soar-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shiba Inu</a> has announced a major advancement in the SHIB ecosystem. A bridge between the soon-to-be-launched Shiba Inu-based layer-2 solution Shibarium and Ethereum is now live for public testing.</p>



<p>This addition to the Shibarium network was first announced in April and has since progressed from being partially functional to being available for public use.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revolutionary-shibarium-bridge-is-now-online-for-testing"><strong>Revolutionary Shibarium Bridge Is Now Online For Testing</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1684252125704880131">According to</a> SHIB marketing specialist Lucie, the bridge between Shibarium and Ethereum has been launched in beta for public testing.</p>



<p>The Shibarium bridge, which uses both Plasma and proof-of-stake technology, will initially support testnet ETH and is expected to take up to 30 minutes for each transfer. The bridge is also envisioned to serve as a solution for scaling, an indispensable aspect for any blockchain network striving to handle huge transaction volumes without compromising speed or efficiency.</p>



<p><em>“Moving between two large-scale blockchain networks requires a secure and robust cross-chain bridge, and Shibarium has achieved this by utilizing both Plasma and PoS security to create a trustless and bi-directional transaction environment between Shibarium and Ethereum.”</em></p>



<p>As it is currently in Beta, Lucie has warned investors against using real tokens on the cross-chain bridge. Lucie also reminded users to always exercise caution and verify authenticity before connecting their crypto wallets to any website to avoid getting scammed and losing all their real digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shiba-inu-price-major-boom-ahead"><strong>Shiba Inu Price: Major Boom Ahead?</strong></h2>



<p>Lucie <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1674723004012544002">highlighted </a>the advantages of Shibarium last month, including its effect on the project’s gas fee token Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), as well as the SHIB token. The slashed gas fees on Shibarium could propel the prices of these tokens as demand and potential value increase.</p>



<p>Unlike another popular meme coin Dogecoin, which runs on its blockchain, Shiba Inu is an ERC-20 token built atop Ethereum. This implies the Dogecoin killer is also subject to the Ethereum network’s development decisions.</p>



<p>With a market cap of over $4.8 billion, Shiba Inu is currently the world’s 14th biggest cryptocurrency. The SHIB price is expected to blast off after <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">Shibarium goes live</a> on the mainnet as the layer-2 network will transform the meme coin into a comprehensive ecosystem. Shiba Inu bulls anticipate the day SHIB will see a meteoric rise to the elusive $0.001 mark and eventually topple Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Digital asset manager Grayscale’s lawyers have urged the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to give the green light to all spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications together.</p>



<p>The legal counsel made the call through a comment letter <a href="https://grayscale.com/grayscales-latest-gbtc-comment-letter/">submitted </a>on Thursday. This comes at a time when the company is locked in a lawsuit against the regulator over the rejection of its spot Bitcoin ETF application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-grayscale-calls-for-spot-etf-approval"><strong>Grayscale Calls For Spot ETF Approval</strong></h2>



<p>Grayscale has argued that the SEC should give the regulatory blessing to all spot Bitcoin ETF applications at the same time if it approves any.</p>



<p>“The SEC’s actions related to bitcoin ETFs should be done in a fair and orderly manner,” Grayscale’s Chief Legal Officer Craig Salm posited in a statement. “As a disclosure-based regulator, the SEC should not pick winners and losers.”</p>



<p>The SEC is currently examining applications for spot ETFs from prominent fund managers, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/approval-incoming-sec-officially-acknowledges-blackrocks-spot-bitcoin-etf-application/">BlackRock</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/11-1-trillion-giant-fidelity-renews-push-for-spot-bitcoin-etf/">Fidelity</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invest-gains-edge-in-spot-bitcoin-etf-race-with-epic-surveillance-sharing-maneuver/">Ark Invest</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bullish-btc-signal-sec-formally-accepts-valkyrie-spot-bitcoin-etf-filing-for-review/">Valkyrie</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-etfs-in-motion-an-analysis-of-open-spot-btc-etf-applications-in-the-market/">WisdomTree</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/vaneck-takes-another-shot-at-introducing-spot-bitcoin-etf/">VanEck</a>. The regulator has basically struck down all applications for more than a decade over concerns of potential fraud and manipulation.</p>



<p>It has also previously rejected a proposal from Grayscale to convert its flagship GBTC fund into a spot Bitcoin ETF but has approved a number of futures-based Bitcoin ETFs. The investment firm has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/grayscale-flips-the-script-and-sues-the-sec-after-spot-bitcoin-etf-plan-rejection/">taken the SEC to court</a> over repeated refusals to list a spot Bitcoin ETF, saying the regulator was acting arbitrarily by failing to apply consistent treatment to similar investment vehicles.</p>



<p><em>“The SEC is already in a position to approve spot BTC ETFs based on its previous approval of Bitcoin futures ETFs. BTC’s spot and futures markets are inextricably linked (as evidenced by third-party studies showing 99% correlation),” Salm postulated.</em></p>



<p>Grayscale indicated it is more than willing to work with regulators to get its spot ETF greenlighted. “We will also take any action necessary to convert GBTC to an ETF.”</p>



<p>Salm added that if it’s converted to an ETF, it will return billions in value to investors, noting there’s “simply no reason” the SEC should keep GBTC investors from a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-surveillance-sharing-agreements-with-coinbase-might-not-meet-sec-s-standards"><strong>Surveillance-Sharing Agreements With Coinbase Might Not Meet SEC’s Standards</strong></h2>



<p>BlackRock, ARK Invest, and other asset managers have since modified their applications to address the SEC’s concerns. These firms now have Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, as their surveillance-sharing partner.</p>



<p>Grayscale, however, poured cold water on the so-called surveillance-sharing agreements with Coinbase, arguing that it&#8217;s “not a new idea” and may not satisfy the SEC’s requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Without disputing the usefulness of information obtainable under a surveillance-sharing agreement with a spot bitcoin trading venue, we believe the Commission’s prior decisions have already determined that such an agreement with a venue lacking compulsory investigative authority and oversight by a comprehensive market regulator does not satisfy Section 6(b)(5) in the absence of a surveillance-sharing agreement with a market of significant size that, like the CME bitcoin futures market, the Commission deems sufficiently ‘regulated.’”</em></p>



<p>Whether the SEC’s ultimate approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF is prompted by a court order or “evolution in their position on the matter,” Salm asserted it should be done “in a way that’s fair for all investors and issuers.”</p>

<p>The Shiba Inu (SHIB) community is abuzz with excitement after the team behind the project launched an official YouTube channel for the upcoming layer two protocol Shibarium.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, “LUCIE”, a key member of the network&#8217;s marketing team, wrote on Twitter “, <em>We are cooking something”,</em> encouraging members to subscribe to the new channel. Notably, since the announcement on Monday, the channel has grown from around 500 subscribers to almost 2,500 at press time.</p>



<p>The channel features five brief videos illustrating concepts such as “Shibarium Basic Information” and “Shibarium Technology L2 with $BONE as gas fee token”. A fourth video even offers a more comprehensive insight into the workings of Shibarium. While not much has been revealed about the channel, the community is stoked at the development, indicating potential insights into the upcoming Shibarium launch.</p>



<p>This cryptic announcement aligns with previous promises made by Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer of Shiba Inu, who unveiled the Summer of Shibarium, assuring the community of strategic releases and updates in the pipeline. These initiatives are paving the way for the highly anticipated mainnet <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">launch of Shibarium</a>, scheduled to take place during the upcoming Blockchain Futurist Conference in August.</p>



<p>Notably, Lucie&#8217;s previous assurance that numerous projects will join the Shiba Inu ecosystem upon the L2 scaling solution&#8217;s integration into the mainnet has further fueled optimism among the community. These upcoming developments are expected to expand the project&#8217;s ecosystem beyond its current tokens, encompassing SHIB, BONE, and LEASH.</p>



<p>However, despite the positive sentiments and upcoming developments, SHIB&#8217;s price has not witnessed a significant rally lately. Since breaking crucial support at $0.000008 earlier last month, the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization has been trading in a consolidation. At the time of reporting, SHIB was trading at $0.000007801, up 1.06% in the past 24 hours and 1.48% in the past week.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the present market conditions, experts in the field are optimistic about the potential impact of Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet launch on SHIB and other ecosystem tokens, including BONE and LEASH. Notably, a newly launched metric by onchain data analysis firm IntoTheBlock shows SHIB is becoming more popular, especially to newcomers, with the growth leaping from 25% in mid-April to just over 60% this week.</p>



<p>SHIB whales have also been making moves ahead of the Shibarium launch. On Tuesday, several whales moved close to 50 billion SHIB between exchanges and wallets, with a single entity transferring almost just over 2.4 trillion SHIB (worth 18 million) in one transaction recently. While these types of transfers often cause anxiety among market participants due to the possibility of a dump, SHIB has remained fairly stable, signalling they are accumulating more or just holding, according to popular crypto analyst Austin Hilton.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inu-ecosystem-flares-with-massive-activity-ahead-of-shibarium-launch/">Shibarium&#8217;s mainnet launch drawing nearer</a>, Shibarium&#8217;s YouTube channel is set to serve as a vital platform for sharing information about upcoming developments.</p>

<p>After Elon Musk changed Twitter’s official name to X Holdings Corp in April, he decided that finally, the time had come to go all in and change the app’s name itself. In a productive weekend, Musk who had bought Twitter for $44bn in October 2022, announced that the X logo would go ahead.</p>



<p><em>“And soon we shall bid adieu to the Twitter brand and, gradually, all the birds.” Musk said.</em></p>



<p>Twitter’s advertisement money has been declining since Musk took over and he has since voiced plans for a complete revamp of the popular social media site into an everything app, including payments.</p>



<p>Twitter CEO, Linda Yaccarino confirmed the re-branding, stating “X will be the platform that can deliver, well … everything [a] global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities”.</p>



<p>Musk explained the move, saying that Twitter did not have the right ethos and therefore a reboot of the whole platform was needed.</p>



<p>Musk stated in an interview that X could eventually include &#8220;half of the global financial system&#8221; by providing banking, payment, and other financial services. The potential of X has been compared to WeChat and other apps in China. Since buying Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, Musk has pushed for the network to provide financial services.</p>



<p>This has led to some speculations as to how Musk and Yaccarino plan to accomplish financial services inclusion. As the name “X” suggests a connection to XRP or XLM, some have raised hopes that either one or perhaps both of these cryptocurrencies may be integrated into the platform.</p>



<p>XRP, which won clarity in a landmark decision by Judge Torres less than two weeks ago, is now the only cryptocurrency to have regulatory clarity. However, others believe that it will be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/dogecoin-jumps-past-cardano-amid-hopes-twitters-x-rebrand-will-introduce-a-doge-payment-option/">Dogecoin that will be used as payment on X</a>.</p>



<p>Incidentally, it was only last April that Musk temporarily changed the then-Twitter logo and replaced it with the Dogecoin symbol, which at that time caused the meme-coin to rise by 20%.</p>



<p>Well-known Real-Vision CEO and Investor Raoul Pal said <em>“Two things I’ve said when Elon bought &#8220;X&#8221;: Elon bought it for the AI, and the free speech angle is to give it an unbiased model. He needs the AI to train the Optimus robot. He will use crypto to be able to make global payments for creators etc. My guess is he uses Doge.”</em></p>



<p>Elon Musk has long been known for his affection for what he calls the “people’s crypto” and has caused price surges of Dogecoin in the past. While Dogecoin has rallied by 19% since the re-branding of Twitter into X, it remains to be seen how the story unfolds and whether X will incorporate Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency into its new payment rails.</p>

<p>A recent court verdict that Ripple’s XRP is not a security has drawn the ire of U.S. Congressman and crypto skeptic Brad Sherman.</p>



<p>Sherman, who is no stranger to controversy among crypto circles, called the ruling “ridiculous”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rep-sherman-labels-ripple-court-verdict-ridiculous"><strong>Rep Sherman Labels Ripple Court Verdict “Ridiculous”</strong></h2>



<p>A U.S. lawmaker has criticized the Ripple court decision, a stance that will ruffle the feathers of XRP enthusiasts.</p>



<p>On July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/major-ripple-victory-xrp-pops-in-ballistic-rally-as-judge-finally-rules-it-isnt-a-security/">ordered </a>that XRP should not be considered a security when sold on retail digital asset exchanges in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) case against Ripple. However, the Judge said the institutional sale of the XRP token did violate federal securities laws.</p>



<p>While the digital asset industry welcomed the partial victory, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) is not a fan of the landmark judgment. The California-based accountant turned politician said during a congressional hearing on Wednesday that XRP is always a security. This is contrary to the court’s interpretation of XRP’s complex nature as both a crypto asset and a technology for real-time, economical remittances.</p>



<p>Sherman, who currently serves as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Investor Protection and Capital Markets, also shared his view on the uses of cryptocurrencies, claiming that they mostly serve bad actors seeking to evade taxes or commit fraudulent activities. The Congressman further cautioned against the illegal uses of cryptocurrency, stressing concerns regarding human trafficking and sanction violations.</p>



<p>In Sherman’s view, the word &#8220;cryptocurrency&#8221; indicates hidden money, which becomes second-fiddle to even the Uruguayan peso once its hidden element is eliminated.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sherman-tackles-crypto"><strong>Sherman Tackles Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time Brad Sherman has taken a hard line on crypto.</p>



<p>The Congressman, who once said that all Bitcoin does is allow “a few dozen men in my district to sit in their pajamas on their couch all day and tell their wives they are going to be millionaires,&#8221; has previously drawn public criticism for some of his more audacious statements about crypto assets.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitter.com/BradSherman/status/1669076493861888002">Speaking </a>to <em>CNBC </em>recently, Sherman was questioned on whether the current regulatory enforcement actions suggested the end of cryptocurrencies in America. &#8220;I hope so, don&#8217;t think so,&#8221; was his concise answer.</p>



<p>In the Wednesday Congressional hearing, Sherman also likened the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to Charles Ponzi, the notorious Italian swindler famous for the Ponzi scheme.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the SEC is mulling <a href="https://zycrypto.com/potential-sec-appeal-in-ripple-lawsuit-not-a-blow-to-xrp-legal-expert-reveals-why/">launching an appeal </a>of the split-decision XRP ruling in the courts as it believes it was flawed.</p>

<p>Singapore’s High Court has ruled that crypto assets are considered property and can be held on trust in a case involving Seychelles-headquartered exchange Bybit and a former contractor. This marks a notable step in the legal classification of digital assets in Singapore.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-singapore-declares-crypto-is-property"><strong>Singapore Declares Crypto Is Property</strong></h2>



<p>Judge Philip Jeyaretnam of the High Court of Singapore ruled on Tuesday that cryptocurrency is a form of property.</p>



<p>The judge dismissed any differences between crypto, fiat money, or shells, noting that all those objects, physical or not, derive their value from mutual faith in them. Crypto assets, despite their lack of physical presence, were deemed “things in action,” a term in British common law describing a type of property over which personal rights are capable of being enforced in court.</p>



<p>“We identify what is going on as a particular digital token, somewhat like how we give a name to a river even though the water contained within its banks is constantly changing,” he observed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genesis-of-the-case"><strong>Genesis Of The Case</strong></h2>



<p>The judgment was made in a case involving the Bybit cryptocurrency exchange and a former employee who allegedly breached her employment contract by transferring more than 4.2 million Tether (USDT) to her personal addresses. It was believed that Ms. Ho went on a spending spree after receiving the funds, purchasing a freehold penthouse apartment with her husband, a brand-new car, and multiple Louis Vuitton products.</p>



<p>Like any other thing in action, USDT is capable of being held on trust,” Judge Jeyaretnam ruled.</p>



<p>The judge further dismissed the common belief that crypto assets have no “real” value, concluding that value is “a judgment made by an aggregate of human minds.”</p>



<p>Judge Jeyaretnam referenced the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/singapore-financial-regulator-seeks-stakeholder-input-on-proposals-for-digital-payments/">consultation paper</a> by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in her decision. The paper outlined potential requirements for segregation and custody of digital payment tokens, declaring that if digital assets can be practically identified and segregated, they could be legally held on trust.</p>



<p>The ruling also cites Order 22 of Singapore’s Rules of Court 2021, which includes crypto or other digital currency, cash, debt, a cash balance at a bank, bonds, shares, and other securities, in the definition of “movable property”.</p>



<p>The court has now ordered Ho, who accused a non-present cousin “Jason Teo” of gaining unauthorized access to her work laptop and controlling the relevant addresses, to return the assets to Bybit.</p>

<p>Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr has not shied away from controversy nor discussing views that might not be aligned with mainstream narratives. One such topic: Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<p>Kennedy has admitted he is a Bitcoin bag holder, contradicting his earlier denial during a Miami conference. He claimed he took the money from his Monsanto case check and acquired 2 Bitcoins for each of his 7 children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-rfk-jr-purchased-bitcoin-for-his-kids"><strong>RFK Jr. Purchased Bitcoin For His Kids</strong></h2>



<p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has finally confirmed owning Bitcoin.</p>



<p>The presidential candidate made the confirmation during a Twitter Spaces conversation with Scott Melker, a popular trader and podcast host known as “The Wolf of All Streets. Kennedy spoke in depth about how investments in crypto assets have the ability to pull the poor out of poverty.</p>



<p>In his opinion, Bitcoin lets small investors have an inflation-proof currency that is censorship-resistant and gives them freedom, unlike holding fiat currencies which are at the mercy of the system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Robert, whose family is political royalty, then dropped the bombshell. The 69-year-old said he had “decided to put my money where my mouth is and bought two bitcoin for each of my seven children” right after the Miami Bitcoin conference held in May this year.</p>



<p>Kennedy <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-presidential-candidate-robert-kennedy-jr-lauds-bitcoin-throws-shade-at-oppressive-cbdcs/">made history</a> in May 2023 by becoming the first presidential candidate to announce that his campaign would accept donations in Bitcoin. However, he told revelers in Miami that he did not have any exposure to the classic cryptocurrency and that his endorsement of the asset was not investment advice. Nonetheless, a financial <a href="https://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/editorialfiles/2023/07/07/Candidate_Report_RFK_Jr.pdf">document </a>obtained by <em>CNBC </em>showed that Kennedy held up to $250,000 worth of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>RFK Jr. recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/crypto-booster-robert-f-kennedy-jr-promises-to-use-bitcoin-to-stabilize-us-dollar-if-he-becomes-president/">announced a bold plan to back the U.S. dollar with Bitcoin </a>and exempt BTC from capital gains tax. The nephew of former president John F. Kennedy is among a cadre of pro-crypto hopefuls that spans Republican Senator <a href="https://zycrypto.com/u-s-senator-ted-cruz-bought-as-much-as-50000-bitcoin-during-the-latest-crypto-market-meltdown/">Ted Cruz</a> and other presidential candidates like Florida governor <a href="https://zycrypto.com/no-cbdc-in-florida-asserts-pro-crypto-governor/">Ron DeSantis</a>.</p>
