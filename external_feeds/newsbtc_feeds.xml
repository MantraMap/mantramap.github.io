					<description><![CDATA[GMX, the native token powering GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange for trading complex crypto derivatives, is under intense selling pressure when writing on August 11. Trackers show that the governance token is down 7% on the last trading day, pushing monthly losses to 24%. This downturn has seen prices tumble close to $40, a critical support level last printed in January and June 2023.  Whales Dumping, Prices Fall Despite this setback, DeFiLlama&#8217;s data is stable as GMX&#8217;s Total Value Locked (TVL) remains over $534 million. Most of the trading platform&#8217;s liquidity is locked in Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Additionally, another portion is locked on Avalanche, a fourth-generation Ethereum-compatible smart contract platform focused on decentralized finance (DeFi). The sell-off on August 11 coincides with actions by GMX &#8220;whales.&#8221; According to Lookonchain data, four whales sold 62,274 GMX worth $3 million. Address &#8220;0xb824&#8221; liquidated 19,786 GMX, translating to 514 ETH, and &#8220;0xa38a&#8221; sold 11,667 GMX for 305 ETH, losing $50,000 in the process. Meanwhile, &#8220;0X85b7&#8221; sold 20,000 GMX for 510 ETH, and &#8220;0x0b80&#8221; mirrored this move, dumping 10,820 GMX. Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon Whales are selling amid a constant decline in TVL in DeFi. This contraction can be traced to the general cool-off from late 2021, when crypto prices peaked before dropping in 2022, crashing on-chain activity, especially in DeFi. At spot rates, it is changing hands at $46, an almost 50% decline from $91 registered in Q2 of 2023. Even so, the token is up nearly 4X from its all-time low. Whales&#8217; action, nonetheless, could send ripples of uncertainty throughout the GMX and DeFi communities. Crypto traders actively keep track of whale activity. Usually, when they sell, as was the case today, it could sow fear, leading others to follow suit, heaping more pressure on prices. GMX Launches v2 Beta On August 6, GMX released the v2 version in beta on Arbitrum and Avalanche. The exchange said this version introduces several enhancements, including support for more assets, including XRP. With v2, users can also utilize diverse collateral types for trading positions while trading more quickly with reduced fees and lower slippage.  Related Reading: Did XRP Price Really Hit $50 On Gemini Exchange With v2, the exchange adds, is the introduction of isolated pools for liquidity providers to customize their exposure to preferred tokens. This version also incorporates augmented incentives for balancing open interest, offering a strategic avenue for hedging pools against trader profit fluctuations.  Feature image from Canva, chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA), the blockchain platform renowned for its scalability and technological approach, has made significant strides in the crypto market, as highlighted by the recently released Messari report.  The report provides valuable insights into Cardano&#8217;s achievements in Q2 2023, solidifying its position as a prominent player within the industry.  With a strong focus on fostering a robust ecosystem and pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cardano is poised to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology, according to Messari.  Cardano TVL Ranking Skyrockets, Climbs From 34th to 21st Per the report, Cardano experienced substantial growth in stablecoin value, with a 34.9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase and a significant 382.1% year-to-date (YTD) surge.  Indigo Protocol emerged as a frontrunner in stablecoin and synthetic asset issuance, solidifying its dominance in the space. Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a shift towards newer projects, as protocols created in the past six months accounted for 47.4% of TVL dominance in Q2.  Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon The TVL in USD rose by 9.7% QoQ and 198.6% YTD. Cardano&#8217;s TVL ranking climbed from 34th to 21st across all chains in 2023. On the other hand, average daily decentralized application (dapp) transactions on Cardano surged by 49% QoQ, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase. Moreover, Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM), showcased the largest absolute growth in transaction volume.  However, several new dapps also contributed to the overall surge. Minswap&#8217;s popularity soared in Q2, surpassing the leading NFT marketplace jpg.store regarding dapp transactions.  This trend aligned with the sectoral shift, as DeFi activity gained momentum while NFT activity experienced a decline. The overall increase in dapp transactions reached a substantial 49.0% QoQ, averaging 57,900 daily transactions. Q2 NFT Metrics Reflect Market Correction According to Messari, NFT metrics experienced a decline in Q2. Average daily NFT transactions dropped by 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, while the total quarterly trading volume fell by 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million.  This downward trend aligned with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices declined in 2023.  Notably, NFT sales volume remained concentrated primarily in jpg.store, which dominated the marketplace with a 98% market share. Nevertheless, unique buyers continued to drive NFT activity, while a relatively small number of sellers catered to this larger pool of buyers. Messari further highlights that Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem showcased expansion in multiple sectors, particularly in DeFi. Protocols for swaps, stablecoins, synthetics, and unique Cardano-centric services like lending staking power surfaced alongside the incumbents.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rides On Bullish Waves As Shibarium Launch Nears, Buy Now? Cardano&#8217;s second quarter showed substantial growth and diversification across various sectors, including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions.  Key statistics revealed a surge in stablecoin value, a shift in TVL dominance towards newer projects, and an impressive increase in average daily dapp transactions.  While NFT metrics experienced a decline, the ecosystem demonstrated resilience and competition among protocols.  In contrast, Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, has been experiencing a decline in line with the broader market trend since April 15, after reaching its yearly peak of $0.4620. ADA is trading at $0.2933, reflecting a 1.4% decrease in the past 24 hours. Over the last fourteen days, it has declined nearly 6%.

<p>According to Messari, NFT metrics experienced a decline in Q2. Average daily NFT transactions dropped by 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, while the total quarterly trading volume fell by 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million. </p>

<p>This downward trend aligned with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices declined in 2023. </p>
<p>Notably, NFT sales volume remained concentrated primarily in jpg.store, which dominated the marketplace with a 98% market share. Nevertheless, unique buyers continued to drive NFT activity, while a relatively small number of sellers catered to this larger pool of buyers.</p>
<p>Messari further highlights that Cardano&#8217;s ecosystem showcased expansion in multiple sectors, particularly in DeFi. Protocols for swaps, stablecoins, synthetics, and unique Cardano-centric services like lending staking power surfaced alongside the incumbents. </p>

<p>Cardano&#8217;s second quarter showed substantial growth and diversification across various sectors, including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions. </p>
<p>Key statistics revealed a surge in stablecoin value, a shift in TVL dominance towards newer projects, and an impressive increase in average daily dapp transactions. </p>
<p>While NFT metrics experienced a decline, the ecosystem demonstrated resilience and competition among protocols. </p>
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/DhUk63sa/" alt="Cardano " width="1815" height="858"/>
<p>In contrast, Cardano&#8217;s native token, ADA, has been experiencing a decline in line with the broader market trend since April 15, after reaching its yearly peak of $0.4620.</p>
<p>ADA is trading at $0.2933, reflecting a 1.4% decrease in the past 24 hours. Over the last fourteen days, it has declined nearly 6%.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Curve Finance (CRV), a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, announced significant progress in its recovery efforts following a recent hack that resulted in losing $73.5 million across several projects within its factory pools.  The attack on July 30 exploited a critical security flaw known as a &#8220;reentrancy vulnerability,&#8221; allowing malicious actors to drain funds from Curve&#8217;s smart contracts. Curve Finance Commits To Restitution Process For Hacked Funds In a significant effort, Curve Finance has successfully retrieved 70% of the funds affected by the hack. While this achievement marks an important milestone, an active investigation is underway to recover the remaining balance and hold the perpetrators accountable. Related Reading: Kraken Surges Ahead In Altcoin Liquidity To Overtake Coinbase In US: Kaiko Understanding the gravity of the situation, Curve Finance has also taken proactive measures to ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the recovered funds to affected users. The protocol is diligently working to measure the respective shares of each impacted account, aiming to facilitate an equitable restitution process that prioritizes user protection and trust restoration. Curve Finance&#8217;s recovery efforts are further bolstered by their recent announcement of a $1.85 million bounty. This generous reward will be granted to anyone who can provide accurate information leading to the identification and apprehension of the attackers holding the remaining funds.  By offering this substantial bounty, Curve Finance actively encourages community participation and collaboration to expedite the investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice. Curve’s Post-Hack Safety Report Following a thorough investigation, Curve Finance discovered that the exploit primarily targeted the aleth, peth, mseth, and crveth pools.  The vulnerability stemmed from a bug within the vyper 0.2.15-0.3.0 version, which the protocol promptly identified as the root cause of the breach. By swiftly pinpointing the issue, Curve Finance was able to take immediate action to mitigate any further risk to its users.

It is important to note that all other pools on Curve Finance have been confirmed as safe and unaffected by the exploit, according to Curve&#8217;s update. This assurance gives users the confidence to continue utilizing the platform, knowing that their funds remain secure within these pools. Alongside the technical remediation, Curve Finance collaborates with security experts, auditors, and the broader DeFi community to conduct thorough audits and implement additional security measures.  This collaborative approach aims to reinforce the protocol&#8217;s resilience and prevent similar incidents in the future. Overall, Curve Finance&#8217;s recovery of 70% of the hacked funds, coupled with its ongoing investigation and bounty initiative, underlines the protocol&#8217;s commitment to user protection and the broader DeFi community.  According to Token Terminal data, Curve Finance&#8217;s circulating market cap currently stands at $518.76 million, reflecting a decrease of 22.29% over the analyzed period.  The fully diluted market cap, which represents the potential future market value of the project, is estimated at $1.97 billion. Curve Finance&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), a crucial indicator of the protocol&#8217;s popularity and user engagement, currently amounts to $2.44 billion. Despite a decline of 35.19% over the analyzed period, Curve Finance maintains a substantial TVL, highlighting its significance within the DeFi landscape.

					<description><![CDATA[Curve DAO (CRV) has continued to decline recently. Here&#8217;s what on-chain data says regarding if a rebound is probable for the coin anytime soon. What Curve DAO Metrics Hint At Regarding Futures Price Action In a new insight post, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has recently discussed how the underlying metrics related to CRV have looked. The first relevant metric here is the &#8220;Supply Distribution,&#8221; which tells us the percentage of the Curve DAO supply each investor group holds. In particular, the cohort of interest here holds between 10,000 and 100 million tokens of the asset. This is an extensive range covering the likes of the sharks and whales. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the holdings of this CRV group over the past year: Looks like the value of the metric has sharply gone up recently &#124; Source: Santiment As displayed in the above graph, the indicator&#8217;s value has shot up recently, implying that sizeable Curve DAO investors, such as the sharks and whales, have sharply expanded their reserves. About two weeks back, these holders had been carrying a combined 33% of the circulating supply, but today that value has risen to 41%. &#8220;This is a massive ascension and is now the most by far that these sharks and whales have held in well over a year,&#8221; notes Santiment. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Volume Remains Extremely High, More Gains Ahead? This accumulation from these key investors has come right after the big plunge that Curve DAO observed, suggesting that they find the current levels a worthy buying opportunity. Naturally, this is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. The next indicator of interest here is the &#8220;whale transaction count,&#8221; which keeps track of the total number of CRV transfers happening on the chain carrying a value of more than $100,000. The value of this metric seems to have been relatively low recently &#124; Source: Santiment When Curve Dao had observed its plunge earlier, the value of this indicator had registered a sharp spike. This means that the whales had been actively making moves back then. Since then, however, the metric&#8217;s value has returned to normal, suggesting that these humongous investors aren&#8217;t showing any extraordinary activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Surges, Recovery Being Driven By US Investors? As these investors had made many transfers earlier for selling purposes, the indicator calming down could imply that this cohort has stopped applying selling pressure. &#8220;With prices still significantly lower than two weeks ago, a follow-up whale transaction spike may be a foreshadow to a quick recovery,&#8221; explains the on-chain analytics firm. CRV has been at relatively high levels recently in terms of the development activity (that is, the amount of work that the Curve DAO developers have been putting into the public GitHub repository). The indicator has seen some high values recently &#124; Source: Santiment Generally, a high development activity implies that the coin is still being backed by its developers, which can be one of the signs to look out for to know if a project is still alive and kicking. Santiment said: By no means is 10-14 notable GitHub submissions per day breaking any records, but it is indicative of a team that is still looking to innovate, improve, and move past the recent FUD news that negatively impacted the crowd&#8217;s perceptions of it. CRV Price Curve DAO is trading around $0.59 at the time of writing, down 3% in the last week. CRV has been declining recently &#124; Source: CRVUSD on TradingView Featured image from iStock.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net]]></description>

<p>When Curve Dao had observed its plunge earlier, the value of this indicator had registered a sharp spike. This means that the whales had been actively making moves back then.</p>
<p>Since then, however, the metric&#8217;s value has returned to normal, suggesting that these humongous investors aren&#8217;t showing any extraordinary activity.</p>

<p>As these investors had made many transfers earlier for selling purposes, the indicator calming down could imply that this cohort has stopped applying selling pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;With prices still significantly lower than two weeks ago, a follow-up whale transaction spike may be a foreshadow to a quick recovery,&#8221; explains the on-chain analytics firm.</p>
<p>CRV has been at relatively high levels recently in terms of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-development-activity-dropping-what-does-it-mean-for-ada-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">development activity</a> (that is, the amount of work that the Curve DAO developers have been putting into the public GitHub repository).</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="alignnone aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/production-sanbase-images.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/ad81d1bb19ddba69edd4613cbdbe398d762e226de02dc112d694c20f4194dcad_1691703505330_Screenshot%202023-08-10%20141651.png?resize=3108%2C1657&#038;ssl=1" alt="Curve DAO Development Activity" width="3108" height="1657"  data-recalc-dims="1"/></p>

<p>Generally, a high development activity implies that the coin is still being backed by its developers, which can be one of the signs to look out for to know if a project is still alive and kicking. Santiment said:</p>
<blockquote><p>By no means is 10-14 notable GitHub submissions per day breaking any records, but it is indicative of a team that is still looking to innovate, improve, and move past the recent FUD news that negatively impacted the crowd&#8217;s perceptions of it.</p></blockquote>
<h2>CRV Price</h2>
<p>Curve DAO is trading around $0.59 at the time of writing, down 3% in the last week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[On August 10, the price of XRP inexplicably spiked for a brief moment on the Gemini exchange. For a moment, the price of XRP reached an astounding $50 per coin before quickly crashing back down to the same level on spot markets on other exchanges. Brief Price Surge On Gemini According to various posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), it would seem that Gemini experienced a technical issue that caused the XRP price displayed on their exchange to show an erroneous price of $50.

However, the exchange has since updated its chart to make it look like the cryptocurrency only spiked to $1.50. Gemini updates XRP chart to reflect $1.50 spike &#124; Source: Gemini The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity.

Due to regulatory concerns, the token was initially delisted on various exchanges after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020.  However, US Judge Analisa Torress ruled in July that XRP sales to the general public are not in violation of federal laws, so many of these crypto exchanges have gone ahead to relist XRP on their platforms.

					<description><![CDATA[Worldcoin, the brainchild of OpenAI’s Sam Altman, made its official entrance into the world of cryptocurrencies in July. At first, things went smoothly as the euphoria from the launch grew. But this would only be short-lived because regulators began to pay close attention to Worldcoin’s data collection activities. In the last couple of weeks, regulators in various jurisdictions have brought Worldcoin under a microscope, significantly impacting the price of its native token, WLD. Regulatory Concerns Engulfs Worldcoin Not too long after its launch, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin first raised alarm about Worldcoin’s technology. According to Buterin, there were major privacy and security concerns, highlighting that user data collected using Worldcoin’s orbs could be prone to abuse. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Chances Of Revival Grow Slimmer, Here’s Why Following this, reports emerged of some people getting less technologically savvy residents to scan their iris at Kenyan orb locations and then paying them one-third of the 25 WLD token rewards for doing so. In light of this, the Kenyan government launched a crackdown on the firm, leading to a temporary pause of its activities in the country. Worldcoin’s problems didn’t end there as Germany’s Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) also launched an investigation. The regulator’s concern centered on Worldcoin’s data processing practices and how it was transferring information. Most recently, the company has come under fire in Argentina where regulators are currently investigating its operations in the country. This is in addition to regulators in the United Kingdom and France also questioning Worldcoin’s data handling practices. Can WLD Price Recover From This? In light of the increased regulatory scrutiny around Worldcoin, its native WLD token has naturally suffered. WLD’s price has been on a consistent decline following its initial price pump on launch day, falling double-digits in the last few weeks. With so many investigations into the activities of the company, it is likely that this downtrend will continue. And if lawsuits were to result from these investigations, then WLD price could suffer the same fate as XRP following the SEC lawsuit back in 2020. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Next In Line For A Rally Following Shark And Whale Buying Spree Interestingly, the daily trading volume of WLD is up 44% in the last day. This signals growing interest in the coin which could lead to a price recovery. But such a recovery would only be short-lived as long as the uncertainties surrounding Worldcoin remain. Over the last 24 hours, the price of WLD has fallen 6.79% to trade at 1.7 at the time of this writing. It is recording losses of 25.64% on the weekly chart, but meager gains of 1.72% on the 30-day chart.

					<description><![CDATA[This cryptocurrency, Shiba Inu dog-inspired logo, has garnered significant attention in the crypto community. As the highly anticipated Shibarium launch draws near, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is riding on bullish momentum.  In terms of the 7 days price gain, the meme coin is outperforming other notable assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), representing less than 1% price increase. Investors and enthusiasts are now considering whether to buy in as the project&#8217;s new development unfolds.  SHIB Price Gains Momentum As Shibarium Nears A recent examination of on-chain data by IntoTheBlock exposed a remarkable rise in transactions related to SHIB ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, demonstrating an astounding surge of 300% over the last month. The current upward movement can also be linked to a post by the main developer, Shytoshi Kusama, on July 31. Related Reading: Solana Cuts Saga Price By 40%, But Case For New SOL Yearly High Increases He stated that the launch of Shibarium is fast approaching, prompting the need to “mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the BONE contract.” Recall that the lead developer of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama, mentioned in a blog post on July 6 that the team plans to talk about and maybe launch Shibarium, the awaited layer 2 technology, at the ETHToronto and ETHWomen hackathons in Canada in August 2023.  He also shared a statement directly on the X application: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a math equation for those who like math. I won&#8217;t make it long: Shib &#62; X.&#8221; Going by his timeline, the eagerly anticipated release of the Layer 2 Shibarium will be on August 15-16 as part of the ETH Toronto event.  Launching the long-awaited Shibarium will likely boost investors&#8217; interest and hype within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After Shibarium is launched, more people could want to invest in the $SHIB token, as it might create a new wave of excitement. Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum As the Shibarium launch nears, the coin experienced bullish sentiment evident in the 4-green candles on the daily chart. According to the chart, SHIB/USDT has approached the upper Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a high bullish pressure.  The upper Bollinger Band is a resistance level, indicating that the coin&#8217;s price might be challenging to sustain further upward movement without a pullback. A breach of the upper Bollinger Band could signal a continuation of the uptrend, but if the price fails to break through and starts to decline, it might indicate the beginning of a retracement.  With the RSI level at 69, the coin&#8217;s price might hover in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential slowing down or a reversal. However, the MACD above the signal line indicates positive momentum and potential upward movement.  So the RSI indicates that the coin might be due for a corrective pullback, but the MACD suggests there is still buying interest.  Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case Considering the analysis, the coin could observe a period of consolidation or a minor dip before a potential continuation of the upward trend. Traders should closely monitor price action, especially around key support levels at $0.0000077, and be prepared for potential short-term volatility. As of today, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000105. According to CoinGecko statistics, it has advanced by 18% &#38; 24% over the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.

<p>A recent examination of on-chain data by IntoTheBlock <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/surge-large-shiba-inu-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener ">exposed</a> a remarkable rise in transactions related to SHIB ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, demonstrating an astounding surge of 300% over the last month. The current upward movement can also be linked to a <a href="https://blog.shib.io/bone-the-passport/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post by the main developer</a>, Shytoshi Kusama, on July 31.</p>

<p>He stated that the launch of Shibarium is fast approaching, prompting the need to “mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the BONE contract.”</p>
<p>Recall that the lead developer of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama, <a href="https://blog.shibaswap.com/mo-sui-sibainu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned in a blog post</a> on July 6 that the team plans to talk about and maybe launch Shibarium, the awaited layer 2 technology, at the ETHToronto and ETHWomen hackathons in Canada in August 2023. </p>
<p>He also shared a <a href="https://twitter.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1689366687613648896" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> directly on the X application: &#8220;Here&#8217;s a math equation for those who like math. I won&#8217;t make it long: Shib &gt; X.&#8221; Going by his timeline, the eagerly anticipated release of the Layer 2 Shibarium will be on August 15-16 as part of the ETH Toronto event. </p>
<p>Launching the long-awaited Shibarium will likely boost investors&#8217; interest and hype within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After Shibarium is launched, more people could want to invest in the $SHIB token, as it might create a new wave of excitement.</p>

<h2>Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum</h2>
<p>As the Shibarium launch nears, the coin experienced bullish sentiment evident in the 4-green candles on the daily chart. According to the chart, SHIB/USDT has approached the upper Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a high bullish pressure. </p>
<p>The upper Bollinger Band is a resistance level, indicating that the coin&#8217;s price might be challenging to sustain further upward movement without a pullback. A breach of the upper Bollinger Band could signal a continuation of the uptrend, but if the price fails to break through and starts to decline, it might indicate the beginning of a retracement. </p>
<p>With the RSI level at 69, the coin&#8217;s price might hover in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential slowing down or a reversal. However, the MACD above the signal line indicates positive momentum and potential upward movement. </p>
<p>So the RSI indicates that the coin might be due for a corrective pullback, but the MACD suggests there is still buying interest. </p>

<p>Considering the analysis, the coin could observe a period of consolidation or a minor dip before a potential continuation of the upward trend. Traders should closely monitor price action, especially around key support levels at $0.0000077, and be prepared for potential short-term volatility.</p>
<p>As of today, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000105. According to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CoinGecko statistics</a>, it has advanced by 18% &amp; 24% over the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The world of cryptocurrency exchanges, often clouded with volatility and competition, has recently been witnessing a distinct shift in dynamics, particularly as a Kraken is taking the lead in the US altcoin trading space. The latest data reveals Kraken, the California-based crypto exchange, is now dominating its rivals, specifically Coinbase, in the altcoin market. Dominating The Altcoin Trading Landscape Data analytics from crypto research firm Kaiko has highlighted Kraken&#8217;s emergence as the premier US crypto exchange for altcoin trading. With significant shifts in market depth percentages and a notable increase in market share, Kraken appears to be carving out a niche for itself in an otherwise volatile industry. 📈🤔In July, Kraken emerged as the most liquid platform for alts in the US. 👉 Its claiming almost half of the market depth for the top 10 alts. pic.twitter.com/2fumt7yi9a — Dessislava Ianeva (@DessislavaIane2) August 9, 2023 Related Reading: Gateway Issues Cause Withdrawal And Deposit Delays For Kraken Exchange Market depth is a crucial metric for crypto exchanges as it represents an exchange&#8217;s capability to manage large buy or sell orders without causing drastic price changes. And according to recent data from Kaiko, Kraken now commands roughly 47% of the market depth for the top 10 altcoins. This dominance, especially in the wake of the previous year&#8217;s price drop and the unfortunate collapse of FTX, underscores the resilience Kraken has brought to the altcoin trading sector. While the entire crypto trading industry has been grappling with declining trading volumes, Kraken has managed to hold its own. A steady uptick in its market share is evident as it jumped from 8.3% in August 2022 to 21.1% in July, according to data from The Block&#8217;s dashboard.  Behind Kraken Ascendancy Kraken reportedly attributes this upward trajectory to a few specific improvements in its offerings. Notably, the introduction of Kraken Pro, their advanced trading platform which rolled out in December, is believed to be a pivotal move. A spokesperson for the crypto exchange elaborated on the exchange&#8217;s recent performance, pointing out that their &#8220;share of total volumes has hit an 18-month high.&#8221; Furthermore, there&#8217;s been a significant surge in their share of EUR spot markets, rising from 35% to 53%, and the AUD spot markets have seen exponential growth, multiplying sixfold over the past year.
