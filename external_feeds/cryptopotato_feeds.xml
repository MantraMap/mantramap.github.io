			            <description><![CDATA[The CFTC alleged that thw defendants failed to use customer funds for bitcoin trading and did not deliver on its other promises.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has sued five individuals for falsely promoting bitcoin and crypto trading services, thereby swindling unsuspecting investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The defendants in the case, according to the CFTC, mainly targeted Spanish-speaking users.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Majority of Victims Were From Spanish-speaking Communities</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The CFTC alleged that five people — David Carmona, Juan Arellano Para, Moses Valdez, David Brend, and Marco A. Ruiz Ochoa — solicited funds from customers to help them trade bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies but ended up misappropriating users&#8217; funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The defendants jointly ran a business called Icomtech, which was supposedly a crypto trading venture. According to the CFTC, between 2018 and 2019, Icomtech stated that customers would receive 0.9% and 2.8% in daily returns from crypto trading. The fraudulent scheme also promised to double customers&#8217; investments between four and eight months.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the regulator alleged that Icomtech, along with the defendants mentioned, did not use the funds received for bitcoin or crypto trading, nor did the scheme deliver on the aforementioned promises.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Also, the CFTC stated that the Icomtech agents solicited funds worth &#8220;hundreds of thousands of dollars&#8221; from over 170 people in the United States and other countries. Furthermore, most of the customers came from Spanish-speaking communities.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In addition to the CFTC enforcement action, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) also charged the five defendants for wire fraud in October 2022 in connection with the Icomtech fraudulent venture.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">CFTC not More Crypto-Friendly Than the SEC</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The latest enforcement action comes shortly after the CFTC <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-african-ceo-ordered-to-pay-a-record-3-4-billion-penalty-in-cftc-bitcoin-fraud-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">recorded</a> its highest bitcoin fraud case involving a $3.4 billion penalty fee. The case involved a South African CEO who ran an unregistered commodity pool to solicit bitcoin from people and also embezzled customers&#8217; funds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, CFTC Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero recently said it was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/no-way-police-all-cryptocurrency-fraud-cftc-commissioner-says-2023-05-23/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">impossible to monitor</a> all the fraud going on in the cryptocurrency space, as it was a lot. According to Romero, 20% of the agency&#8217;s portfolio comprised crypto cases, including the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cz-addresses-the-cftc-in-house-trading-allegations/" data-wpel-link="internal">lawsuits</a> against crypto giant Binance and the bankrupt FTX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The CFTC Commissioner also stated that the regulatory agency should not be seen as a &#8220;friendlier regulator&#8221; towards the crypto sector, compared to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which has adopted a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-targets-bitcoin-miner-marathon-in-latest-action-against-the-industry/" data-wpel-link="internal">more aggressive approach</a> towards the industry in recent times.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following an explosive run, the Pepe meme coin has plummeted more than 60% from its May 5 all-time highs (ATH) to around $0.00000143.</p>
<p>Attention has shifted away from PEPE in recent weeks after its price soared following Binance announcing it would be listed in its “innovation zone.”</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://lunarcrush.com/coins/pepe/pepe?metric=close%2Csocial_score&amp;interval=1m" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Lunar Crush</a>, social engagement for Pepe is down 31.5% in the past week.</p>
<p>Moreover, relative to its price, social engagement has continued to fall below its price since reaching its ATH on May 5.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252770" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-4.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="218" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-4-50x18.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>A decrease in interest should be expected following a parabolic run like what Pepe experienced, but will investors ever return their confidence in the coin, or is it destined to drop even further?</p>
<p>A recent technical analysis from crypto trader <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1660682737500540929" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CryptoMichNL</a> on Twitter examined Pepe’s recent price action and stated that “every block resistance is an opportunity to short.”</p>
<p>The final price target for Pepe, based on the analysis, was $0.00000085 &#8211; a further 40% sell-off from its current price.</p>
<p>However, Pepe has achieved notoriety in the crypto space, with 290k Twitter followers, 116k holders, and a $600 million market cap.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will likely see the price recover at some point &#8211; however, one newly launched meme coin could steal a lot of its glory in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Launches with $100k Raised in 24 Hours</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a> has just launched its WSM token presale and has already raised more than $100,000 in its first 24 hours since going live.</p>
<p>Another meme coin that could quickly gain mass popularity, Wall Street Memes is the token for the popular social media account that boasts more than 500,000 followers across its channels and already has a lot of name recognition in the community.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252771" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-5.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="255" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-5-300x127.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-5-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Previously, the developers brought the NFT collection Wall St Bulls to the market, with that collection selling out in just 32 minutes when it launched in 2021.</p>
<p>The project remains healthy and has seen more than 1,800 ETH in trading volume &#8211; more than $3.3 million based on prices today.</p>
<p>Hype is also rapidly building around their <a href="https://twitter.com/wallstbullsNFT/status/1660757641357062144" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Bulls Ordinals</a> collection, which has a supply of just 420 to mint, which can be grabbed via whitelist on Discord and are expected to be taken up quickly.</p>
<p>The project already has a hyper-engaged community that has been around since the explosion of the Wall Street Bets Reddit, which shook the financial world when the likes of GameStop pumped exponentially.</p>

<p><a href="https://wallstmemes.com/en" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a> is a community-based meme coin with no private sale or team allocation &#8211; 50% of the 2 billion supply will be available to all in the presale, with the remaining tokens split between exchange liquidity (20%) and community rewards (30%).</p>
<p>There is also a $50,000 airdrop running to help promote the presale campaign.</p>
<p>WSM Tokens currently cost $0.025 in stage 1 of the presale and will rise to $0.0337 in the final stage. However, <a href="https://youtu.be/J2DTEOjOVxk" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">analysts believe WSM could see at least 10x gains</a> after its IEO.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[It is officially possible to transfer dollar-pegged assets on Bitcoin’s base layer. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stably – a stablecoin-as-a-service provider and fiat to crypto on-ramp – has launched the first-ever dollar-pegged stablecoin issued directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The token, Stably USD ($USD) is based on the emerging BRC-20 token standard around which many Bitcoin-based memecoins popularized earlier this month. </span></p>
<h2>Stably USD and the Meme Economy</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Per a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Stably_Official/status/1661757584934682626" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tweet</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Stably on Thursday, Stably USD is redeemable 1 to 1 for USD collateral managed by its custodian, Prime Trust, at FDIC-insured banks. The custodian is subject to external audits by The Network Firm, a digital asset accounting group, to ensure that circulating tokens are always backed 1 to 1.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The token may be issued and redeemed through dollar transfers over Fedwire and SWIFT, or through rival stablecoin transfers including Circle’s USDC, or Tether’s USDT. Direct issuance is available to KYC-verified users across 200 countries, including 44 U.S. states. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The top two stablecoins alone account for a $110 billion+ market cap, but neither of their issuers has announced compatibility with Bitcoin yet. As of May 24, Stably USD’s market cap was just $101,000, but the token’s total supply – including non-circulating coins – is humorously designed to be 69,420,000,000,000. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The meme number is reflective of the market upheld by the </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-fees-explode-amid-brc-20-memecoin-mania-miners-benefit/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BRC-20 token standard</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which was overwhelmingly used to launch speculative memecoins when it rose to prominence in early May. According to brc-20.io, tokens like ordi, piza, pepe, and others have created a cumulative BRC-20 market cap of over $447 million so far. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BRC-20 is an experimental standard for issuing fungible assets using Bitcoin </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-to-support-bitcoin-ordinals-in-its-ntf-marketplace/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ordinals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The latter protocol exploded in popularity earlier this year as a method of issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Bitcoin, and has already turned Bitcoin into the second most popular blockchain for such assets, according to sales data from </span><a href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptoslam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2>Stablecoins on Bitcoin</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stably co-founder and CEO, Kory Hoang, said in a press release that he met the creator of BRC-20, Domo, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, and told him about his stablecoin plans. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain… With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin,” said Hoang. “I’m still chuckling about it to this day, actually.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the Ethereum ecosystem, stablecoins are largely used to empower decentralized finance, providing the backbone for trading dollars through blockchain smart contracts for other crypto assets. However, a </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pros-and-cons-for-bitcoin-related-to-brc-20-token-standard-bitfinex-report/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from Bitfinex earlier this month noted that BRC-20 doesn’t support smart contracts, making the use case for Bitcoin-based stablecoins and tokens more limited. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When unveiling the token standard, Domo even </span><a href="https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">admitted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that issuing assets on Bitcoin is not a novel idea, and that </span><a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/taproot-assets" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taro</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a lightning network-based alternative – is “unequivocally a better solution.”</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Institutional investors own roughly $3 trillion worth of gold, which could be good news for BTC.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Should bitcoin start resembling more the price performance as well as the investment structure of gold, its price could skyrocket to $45,000, according to a note by JPMorgan&#8217;s analysts.</p>
<p>However, the multinational investment bank believes there&#8217;s a big catch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin&#8217;s YTD performance has been rather impressive, as the asset entered 2023 at under $17,000 following a turbulent 2022. However, it broke above that level in the first few weeks of the new year and skyrocketed to above $30,000 in the following months.</li>
<li>Despite its subsequent retracement to its current level of around $27,000, BTC still trades 60% higher now than it did at the start of 2023.</li>
<li>JPMorgan&#8217;s analysts <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/gold-prices-bitcoin-45-000-3b3c2a94" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">believe</a> the cryptocurrency could go up by another 75% soon. To do so, though, bitcoin needs to be accepted as a similar investment tool as gold, which many maxis have argued for in the past several years.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Investors are currently holding gold for investment purposes outside of central banks to the tune of around $3 trillion, which, if paralleled with Bitcoin, presents a $45,000 price. This projection is based on the assumption that Bitcoin&#8217;s value will match that of gold in private investors&#8217; portfolios, in terms of risk capital or volume,&#8221; &#8211; reads the note.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The precious metal has also been on the rise since the start of the year, albeit in a more modest fashion. It entered 2023 at around $1,830/oz and jumped above $2,000 in early May. However, it has dropped to $1,950/oz since then, meaning it&#8217;s around 6.2% up YTD.</li>
<li>JPM&#8217;s strategists also outlined the upcoming 2024 halving, which could be another factor that propels a price surge for BTC.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Historically, Bitcoin&#8217;s production cost has acted as an effective minimum limit. Past halving events in 2016 and 2020 triggered an uptick in bitcoin prices that gathered momentum post the halving event.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The popular AI chatbot &#8211; ChatGPT &#8211; also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-predicts-what-will-happen-with-btcs-price-during-and-after-the-2024-bitcoin-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">gave us its thoughts</a> on the fourth halving recently, scheduled to take place in 2024.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Beijing will be investing in Web3 as the country will aim to establish international dominance in the field.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>China seems to be opening up to some parts of the industry. Despite its hard stance on trading and owning cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the country is pushing for the development of Web3.</p>
<p>During the parallel forum of the 2023 Zhongguancun Forum called <em>Web3: Future Internet Industry Development, </em>the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, alongside the Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park Management Committee, released a joint paper called <em>Beijing Web3 Innovation and Development. </em></p>
<h2>Web3 at the Forefront of Innovation</h2>
<p>According to the white paper, Web3 represents a considerable breakthrough and is a technology described as an &#8220;inevitable trend in the future development of the Internet industry, and a three-dimensional space with highly immersive interactive experience and fusion of virtual and real.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition, local <a href="https://www.thepaper.cn/newsDetail_forward_23250778" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reports</a> claim that the US continues to lead the development of the global Web3 industry while the EU is paying attention to privacy protection policies. In addition, Japan and South Korea are aiming to become the leaders of Web3.</p>
<p>The white paper outlines that Beijing is in a leading position in terms of Web3 industry development, which brings us to the next point.</p>
<h2>Beijing Will Invest at Least $14M per Year in Web3</h2>
<p>The document says that the Chaoyang District plans to invest no less than 100 million yuan &#8220;in special funds every year to support the construction of the Web3 industrial ecosystem.&#8221; This is worth around $14 million.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the move comes despite China&#8217;s overall negative stance towards cryptocurrencies. The county has outright banned Bitcoin (on numerous occasions) and has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-happening-with-china-and-its-crypto-approach/" data-wpel-link="internal">demonstrated</a> its restrictive position plenty of times.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Pizza-related rug pulls dominated the 13th anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floridian programmer and an early Bitcoin miner named Laszlo Hanyecz&#8217;s purchase of two pizzas with Bitcoin in 2010 has been etched into history, marking a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Since then, Bitcoin Pizza Day is celebrated every year on May 22nd. However, scammers are lurking even on that day.</p>
<ul>
<li>In light of this historic event, several malicious entities have sprung up in action to dupe unsuspecting investors. Considering the current risk appetite of investors for memecoins, fraudsters have resorted to creating obscure pizza-related memecoins.</li>
<li>As per Dextools&#8217; <a href="https://www.dextools.io/app/en/ether/pool-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">data</a>, at least 14 such tokens were issued just a few days before the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoins-13th-pizza-day-reflecting-on-the-transaction-that-changed-crypto-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">event</a>, most of which turned out to be scams.</li>
<li>BTCPizza, BPizza, PizzaDay, and EthPizza were some of the tokens that were found to have been <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/05/24/bitcoin-pizza-day-leads-to-pizza-themed-crypto-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">created</a> three days before Bitcoin Pizza Day and reportedly accumulated over $300,000 in market cap.</li>
<li>The BPizza operator abruptly changed its sell tax to 100% rendering it unfeasible for investors to sell it. The team behind EthPizza, on the other hand, turned off transfers and sales for the token shortly after raking in a market cap of $38,000.</li>
<li>Scammers have continued to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/scammers-are-exploiting-pepe-memecoin-hysteria-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">exploit</a> the memecoin hysteria, with PEPE being the latest sensation that has piqued the interest of many degens.</li>
<li>Last week, blockchain security platform PeckShield <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1660914747070615558v" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">revealed</a> identifying a series of rug pulls involving the creation of nearly 24 scam memecoins.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[SOL, VET, ARB, NEAR, and SHIB are today's top performers from the larger-cap alts.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unlike the previous few weekends, this one is turning out to be more positive for bitcoin, which spiked to over $27,000 earlier today.</p>
<p>The altcoins also trade in the green today. SOL is among the most notable gainers, with a 5% surge that helped it reclaim $20.</p>
<h2>BTC Above $27K</h2>
<p>Last week didn&#8217;t go all that well for the primary cryptocurrency, especially after the latest rejection at $27,500 recorded on Tuesday. The bears took complete control of the market in the following few days and pushed it south to a<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumped-to-2-week-low-apecoin-nosedives-8-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal"> two-week low</a> at $25,900 by Thursday.</p>
<p>The landscape started to change as the working week came to an end, and BTC quickly reclaimed $26,000. It even <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/render-token-rndr-shoots-up-15-weekly-bitcoin-btc-eyes-27k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">spiked</a> to almost $27,000 by Saturday but was stopped there at first.</p>
<p>However, the bulls propelled a more impressive price increase on Sunday morning that drove the cryptocurrency to a multi-day high of $27,300. Despite retracing slightly since then, bitcoin is still almost 2% up on the day.</p>
<p>As such, its market capitalization has neared $530 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins has increased a bit to 46.4%.</p>

Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>SOL Jumps 5%</h2>
<p>The alternative coins have also headed higher during the weekend, which is in contrast with what happened in the past few ones.</p>
<p>Ethereum slipped below $1,800 during the week but has managed to reclaim and retrain that level. Another minor increase on a daily scale has pushed the second-largest crypto to $1,850. Binance Coin, Polygon, Dogecoin, Tron, Polkadot, Litecoin, and Avalanche are up by somewhere between 0.5% and 2% in a day.</p>
<p>More gains from the larger-cap alts come from Cardano, Shiba Inu, and today&#8217;s top performer &#8211; Solana. SOL has jumped by almost 5% and currently trades above $20.</p>
<p>With most lower- and mid-cap alts seeing green today, the total crypto market cap has added $15 billion and sits close to $1.140 trillion. The metric dipped below $1.1 trillion just a few days ago.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The two main factors for this are believed to be increased scrutiny, blacklisting, and increased attention from law enforcement.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good number of high-profile attacks on the crypto ecosystem took place last year, targeting everything and everyone from Phantom wallets to smart contracts themselves.</p>
<p>A common choice of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/random-numbers-dont-lie-a-closer-technical-look-into-recent-defi-hacks/" data-wpel-link="internal">target</a> was cross-chain bridges, which allowed hackers to make off with serious bounties, most notably in the case of Harmony.</p>
<h2>Sharp Decrease in Attacks</h2>
<p>However, times seem to be changing, according to a new report from cybersecurity researchers at TRMLabs.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/crypto-hacks-down-70-in-q1-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">paper</a>, the total value stolen via exploits and hacks has decreased by 70% year-over-year since Q1 2022. Although this may seem biased, considering that Q1 2022 was when the $600 million Ronin bridge <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/largest-crypto-hack-ever-ronin-bridge-exploited-for-600m-in-eth-and-usdc/" data-wpel-link="internal">attack</a> took place, the data holds up even when the rest of 2022 is taken into account. In total, almost $3.7 billion worth of funds were stolen by bad actors last year.</p>
<p>In fact, less value was stolen during Q1 2023 than in any quarter of 2022. In the previous quarter of 2023, the total value stolen only added up to about $400 million across nearly 40 separate attacks – about two-thirds were from the Ronin Bridge hack alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the victims of the attacks often manage to get back part of the stolen bounty, which is already, on average, a third of what it was a year ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The average hack size also took a hit in Q1 2023 – to USD 10.5 million from nearly USD 30 million in the same quarter of 2022, even as the number of incidents was similar (around 40). To date, hacking victims have recovered over half of all stolen funds in Q1 2023.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Increased Scrutiny Prevents Losses</h2>
<p>Although it is impossible to tell the exact reason for the decline in the scope of the attacks – which could be anything between better cybersecurity measures, sheer boredom, or a guilty conscience – the researchers at TRMLabs believe increased attention from law enforcement officials may be the main contributor here.</p>
<p>Even in cases where the exploit that took place did not violate hacking laws, regulators still took action for other reasons. For instance, Avraham Eisenberg’s “profitable trading strategy” has landed him in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-exploiter-avraham-eisenberg-wants-to-keep-47m-as-bounty/" data-wpel-link="internal">trouble</a> with the SEC, which charged him with manipulating securities.</p>
<p>Illegal exploits have also declined. Ever since Tornado Cash, the most well-known instrument for laundering dirty crypto, was sanctioned by the U.S., all addresses related to the mixer have been blacklisted, making it harder for cybercriminals to cash out the proceeds of their attacks.</p>
<p>However, the researchers warn that this lull in attacks may be temporary and urge crypto devs to remain alert.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The FBI noted that these types of scams often target Asia-based victims. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning on fake job ads that lure people to Southeast Asia, where &#8220;victims are held against their will and forced to commit international crypto scams on unsuspecting victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>These scam mills usually put up ads on social media and lure their victims by promising well-paid jobs. Upon arrival, however, victims have their passports taken and are forced to work by scamming innocent people. Furthermore, if workers were unsuccessful, they would reportedly face torture, abuse, murder, or be sold to another gang.</p>
<h2>FBI Issues Warning</h2>
<p>According to the press <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230522#fn2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">release</a>, the FBI warned US citizens and individuals living or traveling abroad to be cautious of false job advertisements linked to labor trafficking. The intelligence service said threat actors target victims, primarily in Asia, in employment fraud schemes by posting false job advertisements on social media and online employment sites.</p>
<p>The fake jobs could range from tech support, call center customer service, and beauty salon technicians, the FBI stated. Lucrative benefits, salaries, and accommodation are offered in order to lure victims.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Often throughout the process, the location for the position is shifted from the advertised location. Upon job seekers’ arrival in the foreign country, criminal actors use multiple means to coerce them to commit cryptocurrency investment schemes, such as confiscation of passports and travel documents, the threat of violence, and use of violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The victims are then forced to must pay off mounting debt &#8211; travel fees, room, and board. When the debt gets worse when they’re often sold to other criminal groups.</p>
<p>The FBI has detailed a few steps to avoid falling into such traps. This includes researching the advertised company before accepting a job offer, as well as keeping an eye out for &#8220;vague language&#8221; about the company or limited employment details. Job-seekers should also be wary of advertisements with unusually high salaries and many perks.</p>
<h2>Crypto Scam Rings</h2>
<p>The latest warning comes amidst numerous reports of crypto scam rings using enslaved individuals. In November last year, the Cambodian government found itself on the receiving end of severe backlash for allegedly turning a blind eye to Chinese crime rings that human trafficked almost 100,000 migrant workers and forced them to run online scams, including fraudulent crypto ICOs.</p>
<p>More recently, Philippine National Police (PNP) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/philippine-police-bust-crypto-scam-rescues-over-1000-human-trafficking-victims-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">rescued</a> 1,000 human trafficking victims who were forced to toil up to 18 hours a day for cryptocurrency scams earlier this month. After busting the scam ring, the authorities arrested 12 suspected ringleaders.</p>
