<ul><li>FTX CEO John Ray III has been reviewing plans to reboot the bankrupt crypto exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>Ray spent several hours last month finalizing the material related to the exchange’s reboot for distribution to investors.&nbsp;</li><li>A recent court filing revealed that there is a bidder list that likely contains investors interested in FTX 2.0.</li><li>The bankrupt exchange’s native token FTT surged by over 16% following the latest developments.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried’s defunct crypto exchange is likely going to be restarted by its new management under the leadership of current CEO John Ray III. A recent court filing of a monthly staffing report and compensation for Ray for the month of April 2023 revealed that the Chief Executive has been working on a reboot plan called FTX 2.0 to make the bankrupt exchange operational again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX CEO Billed $290k For His Services In April 2023</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://t.co/rcSIuyM2YX" rel="nofollow">filing</a> made earlier today with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, John Ray III charged FTX’s bankruptcy estate more than $290,000 for his services. While the majority of his services pertained to day-to-day administrative and legal work, a few activities mentioned in the filing revealed that the CEO had been working on the FTX 2.0 reboot plan. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FTX CEO John Ray III confirms FTX 2.0 plans. <a href="https://t.co/FeCXOvdrt0" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/FeCXOvdrt0</a></p>&mdash; FTX 2.0 Coalition (@AFTXcreditor) <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1660753728792584195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">May 22, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>These activities included consulting cybersecurity firm Sygnia to fortify the international crypto platform, reviewing a term sheet for the plan restructuring exchange, exploring the next steps for restarting the crypto exchange, as well as reviewing and finalizing the FTX 2.0 material for distribution to investors. Ray also reviewed a summary of steps sent by investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners LP regarding the 2.0 reboot plan. The CEO remained in constant communication with the investment bank to discuss the reboot plan. throughout the past weekend. </p>



<p>The court filing further revealed that John Ray III had reviewed a list of bidders for FTX 2.0. As previously reported, venture capital firm Tribe Capital <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftt-22-tribe-capital-interest-ftx-reboot/">expressed</a> interest in restarting the bankrupt crypto exchange. The latest development led to a 16% jump in the native token <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ftx-token/" rel="nofollow noopener">FTT</a> price, which reached as high as $1.16 before dropping to its current trading price of $1.08. </p>



<p>Plans regarding a potential restart of the crypto exchange were shared by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in the bankruptcy court last month. At the time, the law firm stated that customer funds would be employed to bring the reboot plan to fruition. Last week, a court filing shared by a creditor on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/AFTXcreditor/status/1659748127304286208" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed</a> that exchange was hiring new developers to work on the 2.0 project. </p>

<p>American crypto giant <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-subscription-service-zero-trading-fees-higher-staking-rewards/">Coinbase</a> has upped its lobbying efforts in the United States by launching a nationwide campaign called “Crypto: America Moving Forward”. The campaign entails a four-fold approach to highlight the importance of cryptocurrency as a technology that will play a key role in modernizing the global financial system. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase’s TV Ads Will Feature CEO Brian Armstrong</strong></h2>



<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/crypto-moving-america-forward" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Coinbase, the new national campaign will explain the critical role that crypto will play as an underlying technology that will update the global financial system. The crypto exchange highlighted the developments in the blockchain landscape of rival economies like China and how the lack of proper regulation in the United States will lead to unpleasant consequences. The new campaign will also inform the country’s leadership about the national security risk that stems from technology and innovation moving out of the country. </p>



<p>The campaign will begin with a series of four TV ads featuring CEO Brian Armstrong. These ads will air on popular Sunday shows. The crypto exchange will explain the importance of crypto to the viewers through four chapters set to air each weekend. Coinbase will also promote an educational program about the history of money. Additionally, the exchange’s campaign will include a wallscape campaign on Wall Street and a series of messages aired during the NBA playoffs on the need to update the financial system. The exchange will also have an armored truck turned into a mobile billboard, driven around New York to “show how inefficiently money moves today.”</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Most of the world is embracing this technology now, to update their financial system. And what I fear is that we’re gonna be sitting here in 5 or 10 years and we’re gonna come back to crypto and think about it like we did with 5G or semiconductors.” </p><cite>Brian Armstrong’s TV Campaign.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Coinbase will also organize a Stand for Crypto Day, where members of the crypto community will gather in Washington D.C. to advocate for pro-crypto policies and regulations from their political representatives in Congress. The crypto exchange will also host the State of Crypto Summit in New York on June 22, 2023, in collaboration with the Financial Times. The summit will bring together influential players from the traditional financial sector to discuss the various ways in which crypto is being deployed as financial technology.</p>



<p>The recent developments surrounding Coinbase, including the latest nationwide campaign, appear to have reassured its investors. The crypto firm’s share price has gained over 7% in the past 24 hours, reaching as high as $61. The stock (<a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/coin" rel="nofollow noopener">$COIN</a>) is up nearly 22% since the beginning of May.</p>

<ul><li>The Philippines SEC has issued a warning to Gemini’s recently launched derivatives trading platform.&nbsp;</li><li>The securities regulator has accused the exchange of illegally operating without the necessary registration.&nbsp;</li><li>Filipino investors have been warned to stop investing in Gemini until it obtains the necessary registrations.&nbsp;</li><li>The new derivatives exchange went live earlier this month in 30 countries including the Philippines.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a warning to the Gemini Foundation for operating in the country without proper registration. The securities regulator has accused the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange’s recently launched derivatives trading platform of violating local securities laws by improperly offering securities to Filipino investors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini May Face Severe Penalties For Securities Laws Violation</strong></h2>



<p>An <a href="https://www.sec.gov.ph/advisories-2023/gemini-trust-company-llc/#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noopener">advisory</a> issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the Philippines earlier today took aim at Gemini’s new derivatives exchange. The securities regulator highlighted that the products offered by the platform involved securities, including derivatives like options and futures contracts. The SEC stated that the sale of such products is prohibited in the Philippines without prior registration with the Commission. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>GEMINI TRUST COMPANY, LLC’s lack of prior registration with the Commission makes their activities of offering and/or selling securities in the form of derivatives ILLEGAL in violation of the provisions of the SRC.”</p><cite>Securities and Exchange Commission of Philippines</cite></blockquote>



<p>The SEC accused Gemini of violating the Securities Regulation Code by offering securities in the Philippines without the necessary license and operating as a broker/dealer without the proper registration. The securities regulator has also taken issue with the derivatives platform’s advertisements of said securities to local investors. The Commission’s advisory urged Filipino traders to not invest their funds in the new derivatives exchange until it obtains the necessary licenses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Filipino regulator warned Gemini of potential criminal prosecution and a penalty of up to five million pesos ($90,000) or a penalty of 21 years of imprisonment or both. The derivatives exchange went <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/geminis-crypto-derivatives-exchange-live/">live</a> in 30 countries earlier this month, including the Philippines. News of the warning to Gemini came just hours after the top securities regulator of Malaysia publicly reprimanded Huobi Global and initiated enforcement action against the crypto exchange for illegally operating in the country. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Digital payments processor Strike will integrate USDT, crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin issued by Tether.</li><li>CTO Paolo Ardoino said the collaboration will catapult digital currency adoption by &#8220;overcoming liquidity challenges that have previously hindered adoption.”</li><li>Strike&#8217;s integration was announced shortly after the USDT issuer said it was buying Bitcoin with realized profits.</li><li>The stablecoin company had $1.5 billion in BTC reserves at the end of Q1 2023 and said it will allocate 15% of net realized profits toward strengthening its Bitcoin holdings. </li></ul>



<p>Strike, a digital payment processor built atop the Bitcoin Lightning Network, will integrate crypto&#8217;s largest stablecoin by market cap issued by payment provider Tether &#8211; USDT. </p>

<p>According to the announcement <a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-be-integrated-onto-strike-leading-global-money-app/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://tether.to/en/tether-usdt-to-be-integrated-onto-strike-leading-global-money-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, the collaboration will address liquidity concerns stifling payments markets and motivate broader adoption of digital currencies, particularly stablecoins. CTO Paolo Ardoino added that the integration will ensure greater financial inclusion as Strike recently expanded to 65 additional countries. </p>



<p>The Strike mobile payments app was only available in a handful of countries like the U.S. and El Salvador. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By combining the stability and utility of Tether&#8217;s digital currency with Strike&#8217;s innovative payment solutions, users will experience a new era of secure and efficient transactions.

<h2>Tether&#8217;s Bitcoin Bag</h2>



<p>The Strike integration comes on the back of the company&#8217;s Bitcoin accumulation strategy for its stablecoin reserves. At the end of Q1 2023 in March, Tether&#8217;s quarterly attestation revealed that the company held a massive $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, along with other assets like Gold and short-term treasury bills. </p>



<p>In addition, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-700-m-profit-commercial-paper/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/tether-700-m-profit-commercial-paper/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether</a> said it would start buying more Bitcoin starting in May. The company will allocate 15% of net realized operating profits toward strengthening its BTC reserve. The extra Bitcoin will serve as an extra cushion to USDT&#8217;s reserves that the payments company claims are 100% backed. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Hobit users were told to withdraw all assets from the crypto exchange by Wednesday, June 21 before 4 PM UTC.</li><li>The platform will shutter all centralized exchange or CEX operations today May 22 by 4 PM UTC amid declining exchange trading activity and months after a criminal investigation into a former Hotbit manager.</li><li>Hotbit also cited stifled cash flow due to a U.S. banking crisis and the after-effects of FTX&#8217;s crash last November as reasons for its decisions.</li></ul>



<p>Amid declining crypto exchange trading volumes and on/off ramp difficulties, one CEX player is leaving the game for good. </p>



<p>Hotbit, a crypto exchange operating out of Shanghai and Taipai with 5 million users, <a href="https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823-It-s-time-to-take-a-bow" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/14750194236823-It-s-time-to-take-a-bow" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced</a> the shutdown of all CEX operations starting today May 22. Users will have until 4 PM UTC on June 21 to withdraw all assets from the platform. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>For 5 years and 4 months, the Hotbit team has been proud to participate in a wonderful crypto show with 5 million users. However, it is with great regret that we have made the decision to stop all CEX operations from May 22, UTC 04:00. </p></blockquote>



<h2>Hotbit Bows Out</h2>



<p>The decision comes nine months after a criminal investigation into a former employee, one of the reasons Hotbit has decided to sunset its centralized crypto exchange business. Although the nature of alleged crimes committed by the former manager was never explicitly revealed, other employees were subpoenaed and cooperated with the probe, reports said. </p>



<p>Shortly after this, the collapse of FTX and a U.S. bank crisis &#8211; which caused Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin to de-peg &#8211; crippled on/off ramp options, making cash harder to access for Hotbit and drained the platform&#8217;s cash reserves. </p>



<p>Hotbit said its team believes the CEX model that supports a dearth of assets &#8220;is unsustainable from a risk management standpoint&#8221;. The platform cited several losses stemming from cyber attacks, malicious users, and defective codes deployed by projects.</p>



<p>After navigating these turbulent waters, the platform also believes that operating a large CEX is increasingly difficult. The exchange also noted that the CEX industry has veered towards a crossroads where players must either become more centralized or embrace regulations.</p>



<p>While the platform&#8217;s sunset is set in stone now, other crypto exchanges are navigating declining trading volumes and regulatory uncertainty in jurisdictions like America. Daily CEX volume dropped to $10.4 billion on May 21, its lowest level so far in 2023. </p>



<p>Stakeholders like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-launch-offshore-crypto-exchange/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> are also expanding their products and setting their eyes on new shores in a bid to strengthen their books and survive market conditions. </p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>The Tornado Cash attacker swapped 483,000 TORN tokens for 360 Ether before sending the ETH back to the Ethereum-based crypto tumbler.</li><li>Wallets controlled by the exploiter still hold some 125 ETH and 38,300 TORN tokens lifted from the crypto mixer&#8217;s governance contract over the weekend.</li><li>The transactions come after the attacker hijacked Tornado Cash&#8217;s governance forum through an &#8220;emergencyStop&#8221; function in a malicious proposal.</li><li>The attacker also submitted a proposal that would seemingly return governance functionality to its original state.</li></ul>



<p>The Tornado Cash attacker sent 360 Ether (ETH) to the Ethereum-based crypto mixer after swapping TORN tokens siphoned from the protocol over the weekend. </p>



<p>On May 20, an attacker hijacked the Tornado Cash governance functionality by using a malicious proposal. The proposal was built using the same coding logic as a previously passed proposal but held an &#8220;emergencyStop&#8221; function. This allowed the attacker to essentially take over the protocol&#8217;s governance system and obtain an inordinate number of voting power.</p>



<p>After granting themselves 1,200,000 votes &#8211; 700,000 more than the real votes from community members &#8211; the attacker stole hundreds of thousands of TORN tokens used to incentivize private relayers. </p>



<p>Notably, the attacker was not able to access individual pools or drain assets deposited into Tornado Cash, Paradigm research @samczsun said on Twitter. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>Later on May 21, the attacker swapped TORN tokens using to ETH using 1nch and other DeFi protocols before depositing the proceeds in Tornoda Cash. Wallets controlled by the exploiter still hold some 125 ETH and 38,300 TORN tokens lifted from the crypto mixer&#8217;s governance contract over the weekend, said Nansen data scientist Martin Lee.</p>

<h2>Tornado Cash Attacker To Return Power?</h2>



<p>The attacker <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x1FAd009aD35689B5a9B91486148F2F32AFE31e23#code" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://etherscan.io/address/0x1FAd009aD35689B5a9B91486148F2F32AFE31e23#code" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted</a> a proposal that would seemingly undo the effects of Saturday&#8217;s heist and return power to the governance community. It&#8217;s unclear if the proposal is indeed legitimate or an attempt to prop up the price of TRON which trades above $4 on Monday. </p>



<p>Over 517,000 votes support the proposal set to conclude on May 26 at 2023 11:53:38 GMT.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>According to Malaysia’s Securities Commission, Huobi Global is not a registered business and must shut down its operations in the country.</li><li>The order to cease operations was issued to the crypt exchange Huobi and its CEO Leon Li whose younger brother Li Wei is <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-huobi-brother-dumping-ht-token/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-huobi-brother-dumping-ht-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused</a> of pocketing $7.45 million from free HT tokens.</li><li>Justin Sun noted that the order from Malaysia&#8217;s SC is directed at the former Huobi platform and not the revamped company he advises, per reports.</li></ul>



<p>The Malaysian Securities Commission <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-takes-enforcement-action-against-huobi-global-for-illegally-operating-dax-in-malaysia" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.sc.com.my/resources/media/media-release/sc-takes-enforcement-action-against-huobi-global-for-illegally-operating-dax-in-malaysia" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">launched enforcement actions</a> against crypto exchange Huobi Global for operating an unregistered digital asset business. </p>



<p>A presser from the regulator on Monday said Huobi must &#8220;stop its operations in the country&#8221; and &#8220;disable its website and mobile application on several platforms such as Apple Store, Google Play, and any other digital application platform&#8221;.</p>



<p>The crypto exchange was also told to shut down any marketing or advertising efforts aimed at onboarding Malaysian users and investors. Monday&#8217;s enforcement action was directed at the crypto company and its CEO, Leon Li. The securities regulator specifically noted that CEO Li must ensure his company complies with the directive. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This decision comes after concerns about the platform’s compliance with local regulatory requirements and protecting investors’ interests. The SC views this breach seriously, as operating a DAX without obtaining the SC’s registration as a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) is an offence under Section 7(1) of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Not This Huobi Says Advisor Justin Sun</h2>



<p>According to reports, Justin Sun said that the regulator&#8217;s order was issued to Huobi&#8217;s former entity and not the revamped platform he advises. </p>



<p>Indeed, Huobi&#8217;s controlling shareholder &#8211; who turned out to be CEO Leon Li &#8211; agreed to a deal to sell 60% of the company to Hong Kong investment firm About Capital Management. Reports said that Li sought $1 billion for his controlling stake while speculators claimed that Tron Founder <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/memecoin-frenzy-justin-sun-donate-profits/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/memecoin-frenzy-justin-sun-donate-profits/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Justin Sun</a> was the true buyer, a claim he denies to this day. </p>

<p>Auction house Sotheby’s has successfully auctioned off a series of rare NFTs associated with Three Arrows Capital (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/3acs-su-zhu-arthur-hayes-restraining/">3AC</a>). The popular Grails Collection, which was seized from the defunct crypto hedge fund last year, has been sold for almost $2.5 million. The auction comes three months after Three Arrows Capital’s liquidator announced its intention to sell a part of the firm’s massive digital art collection. </p>



<h2><strong>3AC’s Fidenza #725 Rakes In Over $1 Million In Sotheby&#8217;s Auction</strong></h2>



<p>Sotheby’s Metaverse, the digital art subsidiary of the auction house, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/Sothebysverse/status/1659694250215485440" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a> earlier today to announce that it had sold seven NFTs from 3AC’s Grails Collection. The auction was part of a multi-part sale announced by the defunct crypto hedge fund’s liquidator Teneo earlier this year. The most expensive NFT sold was Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza #725 ($1.01 million), which attracted a bid five times its estimated price of $120,000-$180,000. </p>

<p>The second highest bid was for Larva Labs’ Autoglyph #187, which raked in $571,500 despite having an estimated price of $120,000-$180,000. Other NFTs that were auctioned include Larva Labs’ Crypto Punk #1326, which sold for $165,000, Ringers #194 ($152,400), 0xDEAFBEEF’s Series 1: Angular &#8211; Token 134 ($241,300), Ringers #375 ($95,250) and Fidenza #861 ($241,300). Every piece of digital art from 3AC’s Grails Collection sold for considerably higher than the auction house’s estimate. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.sothebys.com/en/series/grails-property-from-an-iconic-digital-art-collection" rel="nofollow noopener">Sotheby’s</a> described the Grails Collection as some of the rarest and most important works from the most sought-after creators in the Digital Art markets. The auctioned NFTs are not part of the highly coveted NFT portfolio of 3AC’s Starry Night Capital. </p>

<ul><li>Miami-based M7 Holdings has successfully acquired FTX’s crypto derivatives exchange LedgerX.</li><li>The acquisition will diversify the portfolio of M7’s parent firm, which operates the Bermuda Stock Exchange and the Miami International Securities Exchange.</li><li>FTX is set to lose roughly $250 million on LedgerX’s sale to M7. The deal is estimated to be worth $50 million.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Miami-based M7 Holdings LLC has completed the acquisition of LedgerX from FTX. News of the successful sale comes two weeks after the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-bankruptcy-court-allow-ledgerx-sale/">approved</a> the deal between FTX’s bankruptcy estate and the Miami International Holdings affiliate. The bankrupt crypto exchange previously estimated the proceeds from the deal to be $50 million. </p>



<h2><strong>FTX Bears $250 Million Loss On LedgerX Deal</strong></h2>



<p>FTX had paid a whopping $298 million for LedgerX in August 2021. The sale to M7 Holdings represents a nearly $250 million loss for the bankrupt crypto exchange. According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/miax-completes-acquisition-of-ledgerx-from-ftx-debtors-301829665.html" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Miami International Securities Exchange (MIAX) earlier today, the acquisition of LedgerX will help in diversifying the portfolio of its parent firm Miami International Holdings Inc. The firm currently operates Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (MIAX), MIAX PEARL, LLC (MIAX Pearl), MIAX Emerald, LLC (MIAX Emerald), Minneapolis Grain Exchange, LLC (MGEXTM), The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), and Dorman Trading LLC. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>We are pleased to complete this acquisition and welcome the LedgerX team to the MIH family as we continue to execute on our strategy of operating regulated financial markets both in the U.S. and internationally.&#8221; </p><cite>Thomas P. Gallagher, Chairman and CEO of MIH</cite></blockquote>



<p>LedgerX is a Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated exchange and clearinghouse that is registered as a Designated Contract Market (DCM), Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), and Swap Execution Facility (SEF) with the CFTC. The acquisition is in line with Miami International Holding’s growth strategy, which aims to offer new and innovative products to the swaps and futures industry.</p>

<ul><li>Celsius Network’s bankruptcy auction is nearing its end with a possible conclusion within one week.&nbsp;</li><li>A consortium of investors that includes Coinbase has emerged as the top bidder for the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The bids submitted in the auction have exceeded the initial bid from NovaWulf by hundreds of millions of dollars.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Celsius Network is reportedly planning to conclude its ongoing bankruptcy auction within days. The bankruptcy auction, which commenced on April 22, 2023, has seen participation from multiple groups of investors backed by Wall Street Heavyweights. The auction process has reportedly attracted competitive bids from investors that are looking to restart the firm under new management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase’s Consortium Poised To Win The Auction For Celsius’ Assets</strong></h2>



<p>A consortium of investors led by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington’s Arrington Capital is reportedly poised to win the bankruptcy auction for Celsius’ assets. The consortium, Fahrenheit LLC, includes Coinbase, U.S. Data Mining Group Inc, Proof Group Capital Management LLC, Ravi Kaza, and former Algorand CEO Steven Kokinos. Fahrenheit LLC faced competition from the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee, which counts Gemini Trust Company, Global X Digital, and Plutus Lending LLC among its backers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ross Kwasteniet, an attorney representing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-alex-mashinsky-dismisses-lawsuit/">Celsius</a> Network, told bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles that while the auction process has taken longer than expected, it has attracted highly competitive bids from the participating investors. The bids from Fahrenheit and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee have reportedly exceeded the initial bid from NovaWulf LLC by “hundreds of millions of dollars.”. Kwasteniet further revealed that the crypto lender plans to conclude the auction “within a week.”. The competitive bids for Celsius’ assets will ultimately provide more value to its creditors and customers who have been stranded since July last year. </p>



<p>According to a report by the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-crypto-company-celsius-could-get-new-life-from-wall-street-3ee6df0f?mod=markets_minor_pos10" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal</a>, Wall Street giant Apollo Global Management is backing NovaWulf’s bid to acquire Celsius’ assets. This consortium will compete against Arrington’s Fahrenheit, which is backed by senior executives at Fortress Investment Group. People familiar with the matter revealed that each proposal would contribute roughly $50 million to help Celsius resume its operations and guide it out of bankruptcy. </p>
