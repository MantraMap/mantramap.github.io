<p>Cryptocurrencies have caught everyone by surprise since the arrival of the original cryptocurrency back in 2009. Nobody could see it coming, the revolution that has already gripped Millennials and Generation Z.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, the rise of meme coins has been nothing short of remarkable. With their humorous origins, meme coins have captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and investors alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now, a new player has emerged in the meme coin world, one that is already making waves in the market. Big Eyes Coin (BIG), a cat-themed meme coin built on the Ethereum blockchain, has outperformed established cryptocurrencies like Polkadot and Stellar during its presale phase, sending shockwaves through the crypto community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article, we will explore the story of Big Eyes Coin, how it has risen to prominence so quickly, and what it means for the future of the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Stellar (XLM): A Stellar Show All the Way!</p>
<p>Stellar is a decentralized protocol with open-source code that facilitates the storage and transmission of cryptocurrencies. It enables cross-border transactions with a minimal fee between any currency pairs.</p>
<p>The Stellar blockchain was launched in 2014, utilizing the Federated Byzantine Agreement algorithm to enable faster and more economical transactions.</p>
<p>In 2017, Stellar gained significant attention after announcing its collaboration with IBM to establish multiple currency corridors for nations in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>The primary token on the Stellar blockchain is Stellar Lumens (XLM), which serves as the transaction fee.</p>
<p>Early in 2021, the value of the Stellar Lumens token grew more than five times to reach $0.73. However, it failed to surpass its all-time high value of $0.93 reached in 2018.</p>
<p>At present, the value of the Stellar Lumens token stands at $0.093, which is 48% lower than it was a year ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT): Smoother Transactions Made Possible</p>
<p>Polkadot is a blockchain protocol that has been developed to facilitate cross-chain communication and data sharing between different blockchains. The architecture of the network is composed of a series of interconnected para chains, each of which can be customized to serve specific use cases and operate independently of one another. The Relay Chain acts as a security layer and a governance mechanism for the network, enabling the para chains to communicate with each other seamlessly.</p>
<p>To ensure the accuracy and security of the network, Polkadot employs a consensus algorithm known as nominated proof-of-stake (PoS). This algorithm was inspired by the Ouroboros protocol and allows DOT holders to participate in the validation and agreement of transactions on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot blockchain, DOT is used for various purposes including transaction fees, and governance. DOT tokens are also utilized in the consensus mechanism to incentivize network participants and ensure the stability and security of the blockchain.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOT was trading at $5.88 which is 64% lower than it was a year ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Big Eyes Coin (BIG): The New Kitty on the Block</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin is a new cat-themed cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum Blockchain. BIG functions as the native currency within the Big Eyes Coin ecosystem. The presale of the BIG token commenced in August 2022, and since then, it has successfully completed 12 stages and entered the 13th stage. The presale has raised more than $34.5 million thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>At the initiation of the presale in 2022, the value of one Big Eyes Coin unit was priced at $0.0001, which has shot up to $0.00053 in stage 13, marking a significant increase of 430% from its initial price. The project team is now targeting to set the launch price at $0.0006 upon completion of its presale in June.</p>
<p>To promote the presale, the Big Eyes Coin team has launched loot boxes at varying affordable prices, with the potential to win up to one million dollars worth of BIG tokens. Furthermore, those purchasing BIG tokens and loot boxes using the code END 300 can also avail of a 300% bonus.</p>
<p>As the presale draws closer to its conclusion on June 3rd, the team behind the cat-themed meme coin has announced that the BIG tokens will be launched on the Uniswap crypto exchange from June 15th onwards.</p>
<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>
<p>Big Eyes Coin has quickly become a significant contender in the realm of meme coins, surpassing well-established cryptocurrencies such as Polkadot and Stellar. The success of its presale, which has garnered over $34.5 million, has propelled the value of a single unit to $0.00053, representing a remarkable 430% increase from its initial price. Hence, the future of the meme coin market appears promising, with Big Eyes Coin spearheading the way.</p>
