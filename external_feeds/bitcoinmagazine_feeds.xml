As of today, users can now deposit and withdraw Bitcoin (BTC) using the Lightning Network on the Binance platform.</p><p>The integration of Bitcoin on the Lightning Network marks a significant milestone for Binance, as it aims to enhance the speed and scalability of Bitcoin transactions. By leveraging the Lightning Network, Binance aims to address the scalability challenges associated with the Bitcoin network, allowing users to enjoy faster and cheaper transactions. Previously, Binance has experienced issues in high fee environments, <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419622764720128?s=20">most recently highlighted</a> when Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">inscriptions caused a surge in fees</a>. </p><p>With the Lightning Network integration, Binance users can now take advantage of the Lightning Network's off-chain payment channels to send and receive bitcoin transactions with reduced fees and faster settlement times. This development comes just as Lightning is being integrated into other exchange platforms, essentially becoming an expectation for quick and easy bitcoin transactions. Just last week, a European exchange named Coinfinity also <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/austrian-bitcoin-broker-coinfinity-integrates-lightning-network">integrated the Lightning Network</a>, with plans for further integration down the road. </p><p>According to the official announcement by Binance, users can find their assigned bitcoin deposit addresses on the Lightning Network within the Deposit Crypto page on the platform. The exchange has also provided a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-use-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-to-deposit-and-withdraw-btc-on-binance-7a4eb2d9ccaf4433908b448aa3a93493">FAQ section</a> to guide users on how to deposit bitcoin using the Lightning Network.</p><p>The integration of the Lightning Network for bitcoin transactions is expected to bring tangible benefits to Binance users, offering them a faster and more cost-effective way to engage with the leading cryptocurrency.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0NjU5NjI0MzI1MDk2NjEw/lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Geyser Launches 5th Bitcoin Grant To Empower Educational Bitcoin Communities]]></title><description><![CDATA[Geyser’s fifth Bitcoin grant aims to provide support and resources to educational Bitcoin communities worldwide.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/geyser-launches-5th-bitcoin-grant</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/geyser-launches-5th-bitcoin-grant</guid><category><![CDATA[Geyser]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Grants]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Funding]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxMTkxOTc3Nzg4NzEyNjg0/storm-hurricane-weather-climate-eye-top-photo.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Geyser, a leading Bitcoin grant organization, has announced the launch of its fifth Bitcoin grant, aimed at supporting educational initiatives and community-based programs focused on Bitcoin. The grant opens up opportunities for campaigns that promote and bolster Bitcoin schools and communities worldwide.&nbsp;</p><p>Mick Morucci, CEO of Geyser, emphasized the importance of Bitcoin for underserved populations, stating, "These are the people that would most benefit from bitcoin, which can act as a shield. These are also those that are least aware of bitcoin." The grant seeks to amplify the efforts of Bitcoin communities that are emerging across the globe, offering knowledge, education and tools to promote participation in the Bitcoin movement.</p><p>To fund the grant, Geyser has raised 1 BTC, thanks to generous donors and a partnership with Blink. The organization aims to distribute the proceeds to numerous projects that demonstrate impact, need and proof of work. Applications for the grant are currently open and will be accepted until mid-August. A board will evaluate the projects and select the most deserving recipients.</p><p>Geyser Grants stands apart from typical Bitcoin grants, which primarily focus on core developers. The organization aims to recognize and reward all Bitcoin creators for their contributions. Geyser Grants has already made a significant impact, contributing 2.2 BTC to over 100 projects centered around Bitcoin education, creative endeavors, and community building.</p><p>The grants serve multiple purposes, including promoting Bitcoin awareness, encouraging contributions to the Bitcoin ecosystem, recognizing important work in the space, empowering creators globally and fostering the growth of the Bitcoin creator ecosystem.

After all, shouldn't we aim to convince everyone about the benefits of Bitcoin? Well, the truth is, we can't. And that's okay.</p><p>In our world, it's easy to live within a filter bubble, surrounded by like-minded plebs who reinforce our beliefs. But when we attempt to market Bitcoin to the masses, we quickly realize that not everyone shares our enthusiasm. The resounding chorus of "no" can be disheartening, and there are many examples of people claiming to “give up” on orange-pilling normies. </p><p>That's not the way forward. We just need to resist the temptation to use the same message on the ocean of regular people who we want to bring to our side.</p><h2>Finding Our Swimming Pool</h2><p>Instead, we need to find our swimming pool, a smaller audience that gives us the chance to make a real impact. It's unrealistic to expect every person to embrace Bitcoin, even with the most compelling pitch. By accepting this reality, we can laser-focus our efforts on those who are open to change and receptive to the message.</p><p>An example of someone who has understood this is Hermann Vivier from <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-ekasi-township-one-year-later">Bitcoin Ekasi</a>. He is laser-focused on building a circular economy in a very specific place: the township of JCC Camp in South Africa — and knows everything about the people in that community: their pain, beliefs, needs, doubts — and educates his local community about Bitcoin based on this information.</p><p>Vivier knows certain things that we might value will not be seen in the same regard among his community members, so he adopts their language, sprinkles it in with Bitcoin truth and makes the case for Bitcoin in a way that only they can truly understand. </p><p>To me, that is the spirit of respect. We must acknowledge that Bitcoin is not for everyone. This doesn't mean we are excluding or dismissing individuals; it's about recognizing that our offering is tailored to different, specific groups.</p><p>By saying, "It's not for you," we show respect for everyone’s time, beliefs and desires. We can proudly declare, "This for you. Not for the other folks, but for you."</p><p>To create something meaningful for the people who are willing to listen and study Bitcoin, we must embrace the freedom to ignore the critics who will never understand it. Our focus should be on polishing our stories for those who truly need to hear it, and want to hear it. </p><p>Success lies in changing the lives of the people who trust us, the ones who have connected with our vision. What others outside our target audience think becomes completely irrelevant!</p><p>Because there's one thing about normies that applies everywhere: They truly struggle to articulate their desires explicitly. But they do know what they want. As Bitcoiners, we understand this <em>too well</em>, but the complexity of our knowledge often makes it challenging to express in a way that resonates with them. </p><p>Simplifying our message and accepting that Bitcoin is not for everyone allows us to focus on those who are ready to listen.</p><p>Like Neil Woodfine just <a href="https://twitter.com/nwoodfine/status/1673381676808912914">wrote</a>: </p><p>“Every minute spent ‘spreading the word’ or ‘promoting awareness’ would be better spent coding, designing, PMing, documenting, selling, or marketing a product.”</p><h2>Standing For Something</h2><p>In conclusion, Bitcoiners have the opportunity to stand for something. Rather than claiming "Bitcoin is for everyone," we should start by identifying an audience worth serving. </p><p>By understanding their needs, wants and dreams, we can build something tailored for them. This requires sometimes going to extremes to make a solid point, finding our edge and standing for something specific, rather than trying to cater to everyone. </p><p>In doing so, we can create powerful narratives that resonate and drive meaningful adoption.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Fernando Nikolic.

    </figure><blockquote><p>"Those things which I am saying now may be obscure, yet they will be made clearer in their proper place."&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/nicolaus_copernicus_238365">Nicolaus Copernicus</a></p></blockquote><p>In the annals of history, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus">Nicholas Copernicus</a> is celebrated as the groundbreaking astronomer who toppled the geocentric view and unveiled the heliocentric model, placing the sun at the center of our solar system. However, there is a lesser-known facet of Copernicus' genius that remains shrouded in obscurity: his profound contributions to monetary thought. </p><p>While his astronomical achievements have captivated generations, his insights into the nature of money and its effects on economies have largely been overlooked.</p><p>As the medieval era drew to a close, marked by transformative inventions like the Gutenberg printing press and the disruptive force of gunpowder, Copernicus's groundbreaking work challenged not only the prevailing astronomical beliefs but also the accepted notions of money. </p><p>The emergence of the printing press ushered in an era of unprecedented knowledge dissemination, gradually eroding the information monopoly of the Catholic Church. Concurrently, the widespread adoption of gunpowder rendered knights and their armor powerless, signifying the decline of the feudal system. Amid this backdrop of change, Copernicus emerged as a visionary, his mathematical calculations eventually proving that the Earth was not the center of the universe.</p><p>While we may look back on our geocentric ancestors and marvel at their supposed ignorance, we must acknowledge that most of us are quite incapable of proving the heliocentrism ourselves. We generally accept the current belief. If that is true, mustn't there be obvious things we could be missing today? What if our assumptions about money, the lifeblood of economies, are flawed as well and the study of economics is still in its infantile stage? Perhaps, just as Copernicus shattered the prevailing astronomical narrative, we are on the cusp of an intellectual revolution that will expose the shortcomings of contemporary monetary belief.</p><p>It is here, amid these profound reflections, that Copernicus' hidden expertise in monetary matters resurfaces. Unbeknownst to many, this visionary mind not only revolutionized our understanding of the heavens but also made lasting contributions to the field of monetary thought.</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Copernicus the Monetary Scientist</h2><p>Born in 1473, Copernicus was a citizen of Prussia (now part of modern-day Poland) and lived most of his life in Frombork, where the polymath was employed in the royal court as an accountant and advisor on monetary reform after King Sigismund I <a href="https://mises.org/library/copernicus-and-quantity-theory-money">requested him to look at the nation’s depreciating currency</a>. </p><p>His first monetary contribution was to <a href="https://mises.org/library/copernicus-and-quantity-theory-money">strengthen a theory</a> we now know as <a href="https://youtu.be/0Q4o-beKoFw?t=2936">Gresham’s law</a>. The law describes that when there are two currencies in circulation, and the government decrees a fixed exchange rate, the bad money drives out the dearer. In such a scenario, it is profitable to exchange the debased coin and hoard the harder one. In 1526, his findings were bundled into a booklet titled “<a href="https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Monetae_cudendae_ratio">Monetae Cudendae Ratio</a>” — the “Monetary Minting Ratio.” Copernicus opened his treatise in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Hayek">Hayekian</a> style, emphasizing the surreptitious nature of monetary degradation:</p><blockquote><p>​​"Although there are innumerable plagues by which kingdoms, principalities, and republics tend to decline, yet these four (in my judgment) are the most powerful: discord, mortality, the barrenness of the land, and cheapness of money. The first three are so evident that no one knows that it is so, but the fourth, as regards money, is considered by a few and only by the most earnest, because it did not happen all at once, but gradually, in a kind of secret way. It overthrew republics by reason... Therefore, money is like a measure of some common estimation. It is necessary, however, that what should be a measure should always be firm and maintain a state of order. Otherwise, it is necessary to confuse the organization of the republic, and to defraud the buyers and sellers in many ways, as if the cubit does not hold a certain weight."</p></blockquote><p>In a pressing tone, he argued for a repair of currency, to destroy the old and bring full-weighted silver coins back into circulation. Prussia had just suffered a war and subsequent currency debasement. The amount of copper in the coin increased at the expense of the precious metal and finally reduced the money to pathetic puce pennies. Since a fixed exchange rate was in force, it became more profitable to melt down the coin and extract the silver. </p><p>In the end, Prussia's currency became worthless, leaving the inhabitants unable to trade abroad since nobody would accept the tangled money. The good money was gone. Hoarded, melted and exported — a Gresham's law by example. Though this mechanic was previously known to other civilizations, Copernicus was the first European to properly pen it down. Unfortunately for Prussia, the king didn't heed his advice.</p><h2>The Quantity Theory Of Money</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Rothbard">Murray Rothbard</a>, the American economist of the Austrian school, even claimed that the Polish polymath theorized an early version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money">quantity theory of money</a> (QTM). Rothbard summarized Copernicus’ thoughts in “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4715175961">Economic Thought Before Adam Smith Vol. 1</a>”:</p><blockquote><p>"The causal chain began with debasement, which raised the quantity of the money supply, which in turn raised prices. The supply of money is the major determinant of prices. We in our sluggishness do not realize that the dearness of everything is the result of the cheapness of money. For prices increase and decrease according to the condition of the money."</p></blockquote><p>While contemporary man is still monetarily illiterate, Copernius, half a millennium ago, already elegantly theorized a linear relationship between the supply of money and market prices. Somehow we take our unit of account to be fixed in supply, and never conclude that higher prices are the result of currency depreciation. Like the geocentric paradigm, it's hard to detach from this immersive and slanted point of view.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Today, QTM is quantitatively defined in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money#Fisher's_equation_of_exchange">Fisher's formula</a>. Here, the money supply (M) times the average velocity (V), equals the sum of all transactions in the economy (q) times their respective price (p). Given that spending behavior remains stable (V) and goods and services production remains level, we conclude that an increase in the money supply varies directly with all prices in the economy.</p><p>Subsequently, let's highlight that price (p) is a vector of all prices which individually respond differently to inflation, but on average increase linearly with the money supply. For example, a digital service might decline during monetary expansion through technological deflation, while scarce real estate appreciates. This is a point not lost on Michael Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy and the largest corporate holder of bitcoin, as shown when he <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1391174076983615491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1391174076983615491%7Ctwgr%5E3ea330d4498733800638c89282063506ce3231db%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fsaylor%2Fstatus%2F1391174076983615491image%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fi.embed.ly%2F1%2Fimage3Furl3Dhttps253A252F252Fabs.twimg.com252Ferrors252Flogo46x38.png26key3Da19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07">responded in a tweet</a> to Keynesian Paul Krugman in May 2021 on monetary expansion:</p><blockquote><p>"Inflation is a vector. A scalar index can be biased by choosing certain items. Your index assumes human beings don't need food, energy, or home ownership, nor desire assets such as property, equity, bonds, or commodities. It's obvious much of the inflation has been in assets.”</p></blockquote><h2>End Of An Age</h2><p>Copernicus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus#Heliocentrism">basically finished “De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium"<em> </em>in 1532</a>, but only published his heliocentric thesis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_revolutionibus_orbium_coelestium">on his deathbed in 1543</a> fearing the church’s scorn. The seed had been sown, but the theory took flight a century later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">following the arrival of the spyglass</a>. Galileo Galilei was an early telescope adopter who produced the first anomalous celestial observations that could <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei">only be explained by embracing Copernicus' paradigm</a>.</p><p>Rejection is easy in the absence of appliances that falsify the current model. Heliocentrism remained merely an abstract idea prior to telescopy. But then, what about Copernicus' monetary findings? Did we simply lack the tools to turn this view into reality? </p><p>With Bitcoin still in its early days, it appears that Copernicus is still way ahead of Keynesian economists and could be considered a Bitcoiner avant la lettre. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, is a digital telescope for anyone willing to peer deeply into the economic machine. We may now all observe what the polymaths of yesteryear had been saying all along — that a sound economy revolves around sound money. And though it may be designed by humans, Bitcoin shines bright as the natural center we've all been searching for. For this time might be that proper place, where simple monetary laws will refuse to remain obscure anymore.</p><blockquote><p>"At rest, however, in the middle of everything is the sun."<br></p><p>–<a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/nicolaus_copernicus_238392#:~:text=Nicolaus%20Copernicus%20Quotes&amp;text=Please%20enable%20Javascript-,At%20rest%2C%20however%2C%20in%20the%20middle,of%20everything%20is%20the%20sun.">Copernicus</a>, “De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium”</p></blockquote><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoin Graffiti.

    </figure><p>The political compass allows for a more comprehensive understanding of political ideologies by incorporating both economic and social dimensions. It recognizes that political views cannot be easily reduced to a simple left-right spectrum and acknowledges the varying degrees of government intervention and social control that different ideologies advocate for.</p><p>The left-right axis reflects a spectrum of economic policy preferences. On the left side, you find ideologies that generally advocate for greater government intervention in the economy and more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. These ideologies may support policies such as progressive taxation, social welfare programs and government regulation of industries. They often prioritize social justice and reducing inequality.</p><p>On the right side, you find ideologies that favor less government intervention in the economy and emphasize individual freedom and free markets. These ideologies tend to support lower taxes, limited government regulation and free trade. They believe that economic prosperity is best achieved through minimal government interference and individual initiative.</p><p>The authoritarian-libertarian axis represents social policy preferences and the degree of government control over personal freedoms. Authoritarian ideologies advocate for a strong central authority that exercises control over various aspects of society. They may support strict law enforcement, censorship and limitations on individual rights in the name of maintaining social order and stability.</p><p>Libertarian ideologies, on the other hand, emphasize individual liberty and limited government intrusion into personal matters. They prioritize individual rights, civil liberties and freedom of choice. They advocate for a smaller role of government and believe that individuals should have the freedom to make their own decisions without unnecessary interference.</p><h2>How Different Political Views Inform Understanding Of Bitcoin</h2><p>By assessing someone’s position on the political compass, we can gain insight into their overall political outlook and where they stand on key issues related to economics and personal freedoms. This also affects how we understand Bitcoin based on the perspective of each spectrum. Let’s analyze them one by one.</p><h3>Left-Authoritarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>People with a left-authoritarian-leaning outlook prefer strong state authority and control over society. It represents a belief system where the government plays a significant role in both the economy and social affairs.</p><p>Left-authoritarians typically advocate for greater wealth redistribution, social welfare programs and government regulation of industries to address issues of inequality and social justice. They believe that a strong central authority is necessary to ensure economic equality and protect the rights of marginalized groups. Left-authoritarians may support progressive taxation, labor rights and government intervention in markets to promote economic stability and reduce disparities.</p><p>When it comes to social policy, they favor strict regulations and laws to maintain social order and advance their vision of a more equitable society. They often prioritize collective well-being over individual liberties and may endorse policies such as censorship, limitations on free speech and restrictions on personal freedoms in the interest of promoting social cohesion and harmony.</p><p>Left-authoritarian-leaning Bitcoin enthusiasts advocate for increased regulations surrounding Bitcoin. They harbor a skeptical view of Bitcoin, appreciating its technological advancements while expressing concerns about its potential impact on government taxation. Furthermore, they express worries about the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin. They also despise that Bitcoin can be used for criminal and terrorist activities. These individuals find Bitcoin Maximalists frustrating and urge them to adopt a more inclusive approach and align with the popular narrative.</p><h3>Right-Authoritarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>Right-authoritarians generally support free-market capitalism and limited government intervention in the economy. They advocate for policies such as lower taxes, deregulation and protection of private property rights. They believe that economic freedom and individual initiative are key to prosperity and societal well-being. Right-authoritarians often emphasize the importance of law and order, national security and maintaining traditional social hierarchies</p><p>In terms of social policy, right-authoritarians prioritize traditional values and cultural norms. They tend to oppose social changes that challenge traditional family structures, religious institutions or national identity.</p><p>A right-authoritarian Bitcoiner sees Bitcoin as a byproduct of a free market. They appreciate the technological advancements and capital gains that come with bitcoin. That’s why these individuals advocate for bitcoin as a personal savings or reserve.</p><p>They also acknowledge the potential for bitcoin to be used in money laundering and, therefore, handle bitcoin with caution, making efforts to comply with regulations such as paying capital gains taxes and adhering to know-your-customer (KYC) requirements for Bitcoin. For Muslim Bitcoiners within the right-authoritarian spectrum, there could be genuine concerns regarding whether Bitcoin is considered halal or haram.</p><p>Even though they do not entirely agree with central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), these Bitcoiners see CBDCs as an inevitable move and believe it can be helpful in providing financial access to more people.</p><h3>Left-Libertarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>Left-libertarians generally advocate for significant economic and social reforms to address inequalities and promote a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. Left-libertarians believe that economic power should be decentralized and shared among individuals rather than concentrated in the hands of a few.</p><p>They advocate for the removal of laws and regulations that restrict individual choices and behaviors, as long as they do not harm others. They support issues such as human rights, freedom of speech and the right to privacy. Left-libertarians are critical of state control and interventions that infringe upon individual liberties.</p><p>A left-libertarian Bitcoiner sees Bitcoin as a tool to grant financial freedom to marginalized individuals. They are profoundly moved by stories showcasing how Bitcoin has been utilized by dissidents and even in war zones. They consistently remind us of the cases of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoiners-should-stand-up-for-my-brother-julian-assange">Julian Assange </a>and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-from-prison">Ross Ulbricht</a>, or quote George Orwell’s “1984” or “Animal Farm” books, using these examples to highlight why Bitcoin is necessary in the first place.</p><p>Left-libertarians prioritize utmost privacy, fearing that the State may eventually strip it away. They actively seek ways to obtain the most private form of bitcoin, and if they engage in mining, it is primarily to acquire bitcoin in a KYC-free way. They also pushed Bitcoin to be accepted as a global payment so that more people can be included in the economy.</p><p>Moreover, they hold a deep disdain for CBDCs and perceive them as a tool for State control over individuals. They express significant concerns about the potential correlation between CBDCs and social credit scores, similar to the system implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System">China</a>. Left-libertarians regard this as a serious threat to personal freedoms and are vigilant in voicing their apprehensions about the encroachment of State power.</p><p>In summary, the left-libertarian Bitcoiner advocates for using Bitcoin as a means to grant financial autonomy, strongly emphasizes privacy rights, resists CBDCs and remains wary of State overreach and potential surveillance systems.</p><h3>Right-Libertarian Bitcoiners</h3><p>Right-libertarians advocate for minimal government interference in the economy, promoting free-market capitalism and laissez-faire principles. They believe that voluntary transactions and individual self interest are the most efficient means to allocate resources and promote economic growth. Right-libertarians argue for reduced regulations, lower taxes and limited government spending, viewing these policies as catalysts for entrepreneurship, innovation and prosperity.</p><p><br>In terms of social policy, right-libertarians prioritize individual rights and freedoms, advocating for the protection of civil liberties, free speech and personal privacy. They generally oppose government intervention in matters such as drug use, consensual adult activities and non-violent behaviors. Right-libertarians value personal responsibility and self-determination, arguing that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices as long as they do not infringe upon the rights of others.</p><p>A right-libertarian Bitcoiner is enthusiastic about delving into Austrian economics literature. They firmly believe that Bitcoin represents the ultimate form of private property, immune to State interference. Many right-libertarians cherish their independence and prefer to be left alone. They enjoy weightlifting, follow a carnivorous diet and advocate for traditional family values.</p><p>These individuals are captivated by Bitcoin and eagerly explore various Lightning Network applications, always on the lookout for the latest innovations in the Bitcoin space. Some of them actively participate in trading or even establish their own Bitcoin-related businesses as alternative avenues to acquire more bitcoin.</p><p>Typically, these individuals prioritize their freedom of speech and are unafraid to express their views. They maintain a strong focus on investing in bitcoin with a long-term mindset, hoping that one day, their bitcoin holdings will generate wealth for their families.</p><p>They also despise CBDCs and surveillance cameras because they can be used as tools to strip away freedoms. Right-libertarians perceive CBDCs as a threat to the economy, as they bear the potential for hyperinflation and state control.</p><h3>Centrist Bitcoiners</h3><p>But what if your views lean neither left nor right? This would make you a “centrist.” Centrism is characterized by a moderate and pragmatic approach to politics, seeking to find a balance between competing interests and perspectives.</p><p>Centrists often emphasize the importance of practical solutions and compromise. They believe in considering a range of viewpoints, weighing evidence and making decisions based on what they perceive as the most effective and reasonable courses of action. Centrists typically reject extreme or rigid ideological positions, preferring a more flexible and nuanced approach. They are inclined to support policies that are based on evidence, effectiveness and the overall well-being of society.</p><p>A centrist Bitcoiner, whether positioned on the y axis (authoritarian-libertarian) or the x axis of the political compass, takes a pragmatic approach to Bitcoin. They do not discount the fact that accumulating bitcoin can be a means to personal enrichment and is also important for personal freedom. However, they also recognize the importance of the fiat system as it undergirds the currencies that people currently use.</p><p>Sometimes, other Bitcoiners perceive centrist Bitcoiners as opportunistic or confusing because they tend to navigate both sides of the spectrum. They may express skepticism towards cryptocurrencies on one occasion while being supportive of them on another. Similarly, they might hold both anti-government and pro-government regulation views. For centrists, their stance depends on the specific context of each situation. These Bitcoiners always try to appease extreme opinions from different spectrums and sometimes enjoy playing the devil’s advocate.</p><h2>Respect For Nuance</h2><p>It is foolish to label Bitcoiners solely as “libertards” or “maxis” because, based on this breakdown, there are nuanced differences among them all. </p><p>There are no right or wrong views, and no group holds superiority over others. This analysis serves to illustrate that everyone possesses unique perspectives, and this diversity will always be a dynamic characteristic of the world, particularly within the Bitcoin space.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Dea Rezkitha.

These new financial instruments would allow institutional and retail investors to access exposure to bitcoin's price without having to purchase actual bitcoin.</p><p>On the surface, this would be a major win for Bitcoin adoption because it will become easier for financial advisors, previously hesitant or unable to enter this market, to assist clients with a form of bitcoin allocation.</p><p>Banks and other traditional financial players will also use the spot ETF to increase their exposures, which may increase bitcoin's exchange rate with the dollar. For families and individuals, however, shares of a bitcoin product through spot ETFs are not a substitute for holding bitcoin in self custody.</p><p>Ultimately, Bitcoin ETF products still exist within the traditional financial system and do not offer complete protection from market, government or compliance risk. As such, market forces can affect the ETF issuers, and governments can enact and enforce regulations <a href="https://fee.org/articles/money-the-great-gold-robbery/">by decree</a> that devalue or debase the consumer's assets.</p><p>In contrast, holding real bitcoin allows individuals to access a <a href="https://coinbits.app/blog/is-bitcoin-a-bearer-asset#:~:text=In%20practice%2C%20bitcoin%20functions%20like,the%20first%20of%20its%20kind.">digital bearer asset</a> outside of control of governments and traditional financial institutions. Though it introduces new risks associated with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/weighing-the-options-of-bitcoin-private-key-management">private key management</a>, every diversified portfolio should have a real bitcoin allocation, regardless of any additional allocation to a bitcoin ETF. </p><p>As investors seek to diversify to spread risk and protect themselves from geopolitical and market shocks, there is no substitute for bitcoin in self custody. </p><h2>Advice Outside Of The Financial System</h2><p>For years, financial advisors have dutifully allocated clients' wealth across a variety of traditional financial assets (stocks, bonds, real estate, insurance). In aggregate, they have performed reasonably well. Vanguard analysts <a href="https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/IARCQAA.pdf">have calculated</a> that advisors can increase the value of client portfolios by up to 3% by simply ensuring that they follow best practices, rather than trying to chase returns. Advisors benefit from a <a href="https://money.usnews.com/financial-advisors/articles/financial-advisor-fees-and-costs#:~:text=An%20AUM%20fee%20of%201,of%20the%20year%20will%20change.">typical 1% annual fee</a> on assets under management (AUM).</p><p>Yet good financial advisors are more than outsourced portfolio allocators who recommend the right "blend" of assets to match a client's goals and risk profile. They work with clients to ensure protection from a wide range of outcomes and ensure wealth preservation through retirement and for future generations.</p><p>Some advisors ignore the reality that allocations entirely within the traditional financial system are exposed to risk stemming from the <a href="https://mises.org/library/austrian-theory-trade-cycle-and-other-essays">"boom and bust"</a> financial market cycle. As a result, sometimes clients must risk being unable to retire or change jobs until the market picks up again, placing them at a significant lifestyle setback.</p><p>Proper diversification requires liquid assets outside of the traditional financial system. For generations, the best asset for doing so <a href="https://coinbits.app/blog/which-is-better-gold-or-bitcoin">was physical gold</a>. In 2009, however, Satoshi Nakamoto released the next-best bearer asset, bitcoin, and with it a novel system with a <a href="https://coinbits.app/blog/how-many-bitcoins-are-there">credibly fixed monetary policy</a>. Now, anyone can use bitcoin to free up liquidity during a crisis.</p><h2>A Spot ETF Vs. Real Bitcoin</h2><p>The potential spot bitcoin ETF would provide benefits, such as exposure to bitcoin's price movements, some diversification from traditional financial markets and ease of purchase. Despite these advantages, it falters in <a href="https://mises.org/library/origin-money-and-its-value">saleability</a>, a key feature of a diversified portfolio.</p><p>Bitcoin operates on a monetary network that runs 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. Individuals and institutions can use it to instantly transfer value without third-party approval. They can also sell bitcoin for fiat currencies at any time via centralized exchanges or peer to peer.</p><p>In contrast, individuals and institutions can only exchange shares of a spot bitcoin ETF for fiat liquidity when financial markets are open, which, for retail investors, is 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time on weekdays, excluding holidays. Exchanges can also halt trading at will or because they receive <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions.htm">a regulatory order</a>, further limiting the saleability of ETF shares. </p><p>In another scenario, if a government attempts to restrict the acquisition of bitcoin, it might be able to seize the asset manager's bitcoin or order it to liquidate the ETF. Holding real bitcoin yourself by managing your own private keys offers exit ability from a system with strong capital controls, rather than suffering the consequences of an unpredictable future.</p><h2>Essential Protection, Meaningful Diversification</h2><p>Owning shares of a bitcoin product is not equivalent to directly holding bitcoin. Spot bitcoin ETFs would remain tethered to the conventional financial system. This has some mild advantages, but ultimately this limits the ability of bitcoin to be used as a shield against the risk inherent in the traditional financial system.</p><p>Including actual bitcoin is essential to a diversified portfolio, even if that portfolio already has a spot bitcoin ETF position.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by David Waugh.

The long-awaited debut of the European spot bitcoin ETF comes after a significant delay, which has only intensified the anticipation surrounding its arrival. Coinciding with this news, the United States is also experiencing a surge of interest in a similar product, kicking off with the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">filing by BlackRock</a> for an American spot bitcoin ETF.</p><p>Jacobi Asset Management is responsible for the ETF listing, which was actually approved in 2021. Due to market conditions in 2022, the ETF was delayed — although there’s no official launch date yet, the development comes at an opportune time. </p><p>The ETF is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to gain exposure to bitcoin without directly owning the underlying asset, albeit at the costs of properties only offered by self-custody. By offering a regulated and easily accessible investment vehicle, the spot bitcoin ETF has the potential to attract a broader range of institutional investors.</p><p>The delay in launching the European spot bitcoin ETF had only heightened market expectations. Investors have been eagerly awaiting a regulatory green light that would enable them to tap into the Bitcoin market with the convenience and security of an ETF structure. Now, with the imminent arrival of Europe's first spot Bitcoin ETF, many believe that it could herald a new era for bitcoin in the region.</p><p>Simultaneously, the United States has witnessed a surge of interest in a spot bitcoin ETF following <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">BlackRock's recent filing</a>. As one of the world's largest asset management firms, BlackRock's entry signals a significant shift in sentiment towards bitcoin. Indeed, several other similarly large firms <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fidelity-refiles-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-joining-peer-institutions">filed spot bitcoin ETFs afterwards</a>.</p><p>The filing indicates that even established traditional financial institutions are recognizing the growing demand for regulated exposure to bitcoin. If approved, a spot Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. could potentially provide a significant boost to the market, attracting institutional investors and further bringing bitcoin mainstream.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNTY1MTQ0NDExNjEyODM1/ac-btc.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[CleanSpark Announces Completion Of Georgia Expansion, Surpasses 8 EH/s]]></title><description><![CDATA[With this expansion complete, CleanSpark has reached the halfway point of its year-end goal of reaching 16 EH/s.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-completion-of-georgia-expansion</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-announces-completion-of-georgia-expansion</guid><category><![CDATA[Public Miners]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><category><![CDATA[CleanSpark]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 18:43:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyNjg3OTY1/bitcoin-mining.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>CleanSpark Inc. has announced the completion of phase two of its <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cleanspark-50-megawatt-bitcoin-mining-expansion">mining campus expansion in Washington, Georgia</a>.

According to the <a href="https://blog.mutinywallet.com/p/144ff55a-aebc-4cc8-88ef-a933b91a96d1/">release announcement</a>, the wallet aims to solve the onboarding challenge for Bitcoin users worldwide by providing accessibility regardless of location or device. The announcement described the wallet’s mission of catering to the five billion global internet users with web browser access by offering complete control of funds and eliminating the need for identity verification. Additionally, the wallet is aimed at introducing unique features that have been restricted by stringent App Store requirements in other Bitcoin wallets.</p><p>The first highlighted feature of Mutiny Wallet is its integration of Lightning, a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Bitcoin. The wallet leverages Block's <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/jack-dorsey-spiral-presents-the-lightning-dev-kit">Lightning Development Kit</a> (LDK) project, allowing developers to customize various aspects of the Lightning stack. To facilitate user liquidity management, Mutiny Wallet has partnered with Voltage and their Flow 2.0 product, enabling new users to receive their first Lightning payment within seconds of opening the application.</p><p>Furthermore, Mutiny Wallet has introduced separate balances for Lightning channel funds and on-chain spending, aiming for unified balances in the future. The wallet also emphasizes the importance of backups and introduces encrypted and remote storage for restoring Lightning-related data. Users are encouraged to provide feedback during the open beta phase, as the announcement said the team is dedicated to addressing bugs and swiftly implementing new features.</p><p>Mutiny Wallet also provides support for Nostr Wallet Connections, a tipping feature for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/nostr">Nostr</a>, a protocol enabling decentralized social media. In addition, Mutiny also intends to introduce subscriptions, offering a pull-based subscription feature built on Nostr Wallet Connect. They offer an example of this in their own subscription, Mutiny+.

This article does not attempt to argue for or against Bitcoin Ordinal inscriptions. Rather, it argues against the confusing, inaccurate and sometimes dubious ways they can be presented, marketed and sold. </p><p>It deals with a widespread fallacy which insinuates that ownership of Ordinal inscriptions is enforced and protected by the rules of the Bitcoin protocol itself (I maintain that it is not). And while this fallacy may be asserted duplicitously or innocently, it is always pernicious because it can make Ordinal inscriptions more attractive to prospective buyers. </p><p>Here is a typical example:</p><blockquote><p>“Ordinals allow a variety of data, including text, images, and video to be inscribed on a single Satoshi (the smallest denomination of a Bitcoin) and permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.”&nbsp;</p><p>–<a href="https://docs.ordinals.market">Introduction documentation</a> for Ordinals Market</p></blockquote><p>This suggests that ownership of an inscription will be protected by the permanence and immutability of the Bitcoin timechain itself. But Bitcoin does not enforce ownership of inscriptions, because an inscription is not “inscribed on a single satoshi” on the blockchain at all. </p><p>As the “<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/">Ordinal Theory Handbook</a>,” the guide to Ordinal theory <a href="https://github.com/ordinals/ord/">compiled by its developers</a>, points out:</p><p>“<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/faq.html">Satoshis live in outputs”</a> while “<a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/guides/inscriptions.html">inscription content is included in transaction witnesses</a>.”</p><p>While both <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/mod/book/view.php?id=36308&amp;chapterid=18905">output data</a> and <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/w/witness">witness data</a> are stored on the Bitcoin blockchain following the SegWit upgrade, claiming that inscription data is inextricably linked to an "inscribed" satoshi creates a misleading notion that any such link is recognized by Bitcoin itself.</p><p>In reality, the link between an inscription and a specific satoshi is manufactured off chain by a <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html">purpose-built external indexer</a>. This pulls data from the Bitcoin blockchain and presents it according to an elegant but ultimately centralized and arbitrary system of rules called “Ordinal theory.” These rules are entirely extraneous to the Bitcoin protocol itself, and have been described by their originator as <a href="https://twitter.com/rodarmor/status/1623355293362171906?s=20">akin to astrology</a>. </p><h2>Spread Of The Inscription Fallacy</h2><p>But in my view, statements in many of the places where Ordinal inscriptions can be created, viewed, bought and sold, as well in media coverage, do not explain the role of the Ordinal indexer clearly enough. Thus, the idea that inscriptions are embedded “onto” or directly “into” satoshis, and that the inscription data and a corresponding sat are inextricably linked within the Bitcoin protocol without the need for an external indexer, has created a dangerous fallacy for potential investors. </p><p>Here are just a few examples of such statements:</p><blockquote><p>“Ordinal Inscriptions, similar to NFTs, are digital assets inscribed on a satoshi, the lowest denomination of a Bitcoin.”</p><p>–<a href="https://ordinals.hiro.so">Ordinals.hiro.so</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“...Ordinals are ‘inscribed’ onto a single satoshi… Inscribing is the process of putting a piece of data onto the blockchain, where it will remain forever accessible and unchangeable.”</p><p>–<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/bytes/archive/the-bitcoin-ordinals-buzz-explained">“Coinbase Bytes” newsletter</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Each sat can be inscribed with data, such as JPGs, GIFs, PDFs and more, creating a Bitcoin Ordinal which is then held in a wallet.”</p><p>–<a href="https://support.gamma.io/hc/en-us/articles/15116277490707-What-is-an-Ordinal-">Gamma FAQ</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“What are Bitcoin Ordinals?

It simply spotlights the misleading, sometimes sloppy, and perhaps at times scammy, ways they are being presented, which wrongly implies that Bitcoin itself will enforce inscription ownership without the use of an external tool.</p><p>So, what can be done to make sure potential buyers of Ordinal inscriptions do not fall victim to this fallacy? We can keep clearing up confusion by pointing it out. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Bitcoms.

It combines two powerful tools — Macaroons, and of course, the Lightning Network.</p><p>Macaroons are special tokens used for authentication. They include permissions and can be verified using a root key. The <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/l402">documentation</a> states this is important for systems where we want to avoid or cannot go about looking up the validity of each token.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/lightning">Lightning</a> is a Layer 2 solution for making fast and secure bitcoin payments. L402 leverages the capabilities of Macaroons and Lightning to create a mechanism that allows users to authenticate and make payments without needing a central database.</p><p>In L402, a Macaroon includes a payment hash. To be valid, the user needs to present the Macaroon and the preimage corresponding to the payment hash in the Macaroon. The preimage is obtained by paying a Lightning Network invoice.</p><p>A <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/new-developer-tools-enable-easy-lightning-and-ai-integration">newly introduced</a> software called <a href="https://github.com/lightninglabs/aperture/tree/master">Aperture</a> acts as a middleman between the user and the service's API. It forwards requests with valid L402 to the relevant API endpoint and can issue new Macaroons and Lightning invoices to new users.</p><p>L402 allows for metered APIs, where services can charge for their usage without requiring logins or passwords. The Macaroon, together with the preimage, guarantees that the payer has made the payment.</p><p>The L402 specification includes different characteristics such as the version of the Macaroon, a unique user identifier and a payment hash that links the Macaroon to the Lightning invoice. The Macaroon can also include caveats that define access to specific services, service capabilities and service constraints.</p><p>When verifying the L402, the server uses the root key to check that the Macaroon was issued by the appropriate authority and that each caveat was properly amended. The preimage is also verified against the payment hash to ensure that all outstanding invoices have been paid.</p><p>In summary, L402 is a protocol that combines Macaroons and the Lightning Network to enable charging for services and authenticating users. It allows for secure payments and authentication without relying on a central database. Aperture is a software that helps handle the process and allows services to issue Macaroons and Lightning Network invoices.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4NzU2NzcxMDYwMzI4MDE2/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[SEC Inspector General Urged To Investigate Prometheum SPBD Approval Amidst Crypto Regulatory Scrutiny]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Blockchain Association has sent a letter requesting an investigation into the seemingly non-conforming approval.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sec-inspector-general-urged-to-investigate-prometheum-spbd-approval</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/sec-inspector-general-urged-to-investigate-prometheum-spbd-approval</guid><category><![CDATA[SEC]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legal]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 18:59:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>The Blockchain Association, a nonprofit organization advocating for pro-innovation policies in relation to Bitcoin, has called for an investigation into the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its approval of Prometheum Ember Capital as a Special Purpose Broker Dealer (SPBD). In <a href="https://twitter.com/MTCoppel/status/1679149946556280832?s=20">a letter</a> to the Inspector General of the SEC, the association raises concerns about potential impropriety and ethical issues surrounding the approval process.</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/MTCoppel/status/1679149946556280832"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>The letter highlights the lack of regulatory clarity regarding how U.S. securities laws apply to digital assets and criticizes SEC Chair Gary Gensler, accusing the SEC of overt hostility towards the digital assets industry while citing enforcement actions and proposed rulemaking that have impacted the sector. The approval of Prometheum as an SPBD is seen as concerning, as other companies with what the letter describes as "legitimate business models" have faced denials or delays in obtaining similar licenses.</p><p>The letter states Prometheum's license approval comes at a time when the company has no working product or assets, raising further questions. The association questions whether Prometheum received preferential treatment or leveraged personal connections to gain an unfair advantage. They express concern that SEC Chair Gensler is using Prometheum and the SPBD licensure process to impede congressional efforts towards legislation and promote what it views as a false narrative, that the law is clear regarding digital asset securities. “There's no question Prometheum is hiding something on its SEC relationship,” said Dan Spuller, head of industry affairs at the Association. </p><p>The Blockchain Association has submitted a request to the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act, seeking documents and communications related to the matter. They urge the opening of an investigation to address these concerns and provide clarity. The outcome of the investigation will determine whether there was any impropriety or validate the inferences made by the association.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyODY4MzAyMTgyMTY0MTc2/legal-justice.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Crumbling Economic Fundamentals, The Future Of Bitcoin Adoption In Norway Is Bright]]></title><description><![CDATA[Bitcoin adoption in Norway has been slow, but the dwindling value of the nation’s currency and growing concerns about the economy might speed it up.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/economics-in-norway-paves-way-for-bitcoin</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/economics-in-norway-paves-way-for-bitcoin</guid><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Norway]]></category><category><![CDATA[inflation]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Rune Østgård,Alexander Ellefsen]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg4OTI1NTg0NzQ5ODk3Njc2/20220420_btcfinal_norway_jaran_mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Rune Østgård and Alexander Ellefsen, financial writers based in Norway.</em></p><p>Although we don’t have exact numbers on Bitcoin adoption globally, we do know that the global average cryptocurrency adoption rate was estimated to be at about <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/6465463e9f049c5fc0df1960/">12%</a> in 2022 and that bitcoin currently has about <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTC.D/">half of the total market cap of the global cryptocurrency market</a>. Turkey (27.1%) and Argentina (23.5%) topped the 2022 adoption list, and the countries with the most inflation seem to have the highest adoption rates. </p><p>The oil-rich nation of Norway is at <a href="https://k33.com/research/reports/industry-reports/norwegian-crypto-adoption-survey-2023">8% cryptocurrency adoption,</a> which is just two-thirds of the global average. Considering that it has a rather tech-savvy population, this is surprisingly low. The following factors might provide some explanation:</p><ul><li><a href="https://no.tradingeconomics.com/norway/inflation-cpi">The official consumer price index (CPI) numbers</a> have been modest compared with most other countries.</li><li>Norwegian politicians demonstrate a negative attitude toward cryptocurrencies, and as analyst <a href="https://hashrateindex.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-around-the-world-norway/">Jaran Mellerud at Luxor</a> reports, the government wants to “smoke” out miners.</li><li>According to the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/governance/trust-in-government/">Organisation For Economic Co-Operation And Development (OECD)</a>, six out of 10 Norwegians “trust” their government, which is 50% more than the average OECD country. </li></ul><p>But a significant weakening of the Norwegian krone (NOK) may begin to incentivize more people and businesses to join the Bitcoin economy. </p><p>The NOK’s value has <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/sdXJbefN/?symbol=SAXO%3ANOKUSD">depreciated slowly but steadily since the financial crisis</a>, and the “frog boiling” effect might be the reason why there has been so little focus on it. This has <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/USDNOK/">changed in the last few months, as the depreciation has gained momentum</a>. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=USD&amp;To=NOK">it takes 10.7 NOK to buy $1,</a> up from <a href="https://freecurrencyrates.com/en/exchange-rate-history/USD-NOK/2008/cbr">4.9 NOK in 2008</a>. At its worst this year, the NOK had depreciated 10% against the USD, and even performed worse than the <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NOKTRY/">Turkish lira</a> and <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/poorest-countries-in-europe">one of the poorest European country’s currency</a>, the <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&amp;From=MDL&amp;To=NOK">Moldovan lei</a>. It probably helped very little that Norway’s minister of finance, in the beginning of June, told the people that “<a href="https://www.tv2.no/nyheter/innenriks/vedum-om-kronesjokket-den-norske-kronen-er-en-god-valuta/15779549/">the Norwegian krone is a good currency</a>.”</p><p>Economists scratch their heads as they are at pains to explain why the NOK is so unpopular, but judging from media coverage, people and companies are becoming increasingly wary. </p><h2>What Is Wrong In Norway?</h2><p>A loose monetary policy is probably one of the reasons why the NOK has performed so badly. The small country might be able to export large quantities of oil, but it’s in no position to export inflation. In the period of 2002 to 2022 the money supply (NOK M2) increased by an average per year at roughly 7%. This is on par with the USD, but it’s 16% faster than the euro, which had an average growth of 5.9% per year. While many factors affect the exchange rate, nothing good can come from letting the printing press run at high speed.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>A lower exchange rate makes imports more costly, fuels CPI numbers and gives the central bank an excuse to continue to raise interest rates. Norwegian citizens therefore are now hit with a triple whammy: high interest rates, high domestic price inflation and sharply increased costs for the thousands of sun-deprived Norwegians who are used to traveling abroad for their vacations. When the mainstream media covers the weak NOK, the standard theme is that budgets dictate that <a href="https://www.nhoreiseliv.no/tall-og-fakta/nyhet/2023/trenden-med-norgesferie-fortsetter/">people must stay within the borders when they go on summer holiday this year</a>.</p><p>Corporations that have a relatively-high share of their costs in foreign currency while their income mainly is in NOK have a particularly tough time. Home builders, who find themselves in this category due to increased reliance on imported materials, are hit hard. The weak currency eats up their profits, while the steep interest rate hikes have caused the market for <a href="https://www.boligprodusentene.no/artikkelarkiv/pressemelding/">sales of new homes to plummet</a>. Adjusted for population growth, sales are now at the same levels as when the market bottomed out during the great financial crisis.</p><p>If you also consider that:</p><ul><li>The government continues to raise taxes although Norway already <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-highlights-brochure.pdf">has a high tax rate </a>and a public sector that consumes about two-thirds of GDP (<a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/91bdfca9231d45408e8107a703fee790/en-gb/pdfs/stm202020210014000engpdfs.pdf">66% in the pandemic year of 2020</a> and 61% in 2022)</li><li>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/10/super-rich-abandoning-norway-at-record-rate-as-wealth-tax-rises-slightly">record number of super-rich people are abandoning Norway for low-tax countries</a></li><li>Norwegians now top the <a href="https://data.oecd.org/hha/household-debt.htm">OECD’s ranking of debt to disposable income per household</a> (247%)</li></ul><p>…then the picture looks increasingly grim.</p><p>It probably doesn’t help the NOK that most of the state’s income from taxes on oil and gas is being transferred to the government’s <a href="https://www.nbim.no/en/">sovereign wealth fund</a>, which only invests its capital outside of Norway. Today, the fund makes up more than<a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/norway/gdp"> two times the GDP</a>. The consequence of swapping the value of the petroleum resources in Norway for capital that is invested abroad is that the country gets an increasingly smaller capital base that the NOK can be invested in. </p><p>No wonder that the players in the foreign-exchange market and the wealthiest Norwegians worry that the NOK in the future will be reduced to nothing but a token for tax payments.</p><h2>Primed For Bitcoin</h2><p>The violent depreciation of the NOK compared to the currencies of almost all other nations and the low adoption rate of cryptocurrencies make the Norwegian case special. If the NOK falls further and Norwegians invest more into bitcoin, this might indicate that the same will happen in other advanced economies with loose monetary policies.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Norwegian citizens and corporations begin to line up for a consultation with Dr. Bitcoin. Considering that there is no other remedy in sight, we believe that economic incentives will beat the citizens’ exaggerated trust in the government.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Rune Østgård and Alexander Ellefsen.

The legal action stemmed from the Fed's inexplicable delay in approving Custodia's application for a "Master Account," a process that typically takes 5-7 days but had been pending for over two years. This extended delay, eventually turning into a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/orders20230127a.htm">denial on January 27, 2023</a>, raised concerns about potential biases favoring incumbent banks over disruptive newcomers like Custodia. The outcome of this lawsuit could have profound implications for the future of banking regulations and reshape the entire industry.</p><p>Custodia's disruptive approach aims to revolutionize the banking model by positioning itself as the least risky bank in the U.S., which would make it highly attractive to investors. It does this through its charter as a SPDI bank, or special purpose depository institution. These SPDI banks “are fully-reserved banks that receive deposits and conduct other activity incidental to the business of banking, including custody, asset servicing, fiduciary asset management and related activities,” according to the <a href="https://wyomingbankingdivision.wyo.gov/banks-and-trust-companies/special-purpose-depository-institutions">official website</a>. In other words, their business model is to make money from banking services and take far less risk than any other bank in the world. The key aspect of Custodia's strategy involves completely eliminating the controversial practice of fractional reserve lending, a move that no other bank in the United States has undertaken. If Americans had any idea what kind of risk they take by depositing money into a fractional reserve bank, they would likely revolt. </p><p>SPDI banks’ commitment to eliminating fractional reserve lending would likely strike a chord with institutions seeking to mitigate risks and hedge their investments. Additionally, a bank like Custodia could leverage Wyoming's pioneering regulatory framework for digital assets, providing customers with a system that ensures safety and security without resorting to rehypothecation or over-leveraging. This distinctive offering sets banks like Custodia apart from traditional banks and positions it as a trusted partner for institutional investors.</p><p>The lawsuit filed by Custodia against the Federal Reserve marks a historic milestone. As the case proceeds to the discovery phase, previously undisclosed internal emails and documents within the Fed are expected to come to light. This transparency could unveil any potential advantages afforded to incumbent banks and shed light on the fairness of the approval process. Custodia will also likely have the opportunity to conduct interviews under oath with prominent Fed officials, including Jay Powell and Kansas City Fed Governor Esther George. Such testimonies could reveal further insights into the approval process for <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/moonstone-bank-the-washington-state-bank-with-ties-to-ftx-will-wind-down-crypto-operations/">Moonstone Bank</a>, in which FTX/Alameda invested, raising questions about proper handling and fairness.</p><p>While the outcome of the lawsuit remains uncertain, a favorable ruling for Custodia could result in a substantial influx of institutional capital into Wyoming. The state's digital asset regulatory framework, coupled with Custodia's disruptive business model, offers clarity and priority for digital assets, attracting institutional investors seeking reliable and innovative banking solutions. The potential impact of Custodia's success extends beyond the banking industry, potentially triggering significant price movements in Bitcoin and influencing future banking regulations. As the case progresses and the court demands an administrative record from the Federal Reserve, the urgency and significance of this lawsuit are expected to become more apparent within the U.S. courts.</p><p>In her <a href="https://www.lynalden.com/march-2023-newsletter/">March 2023 newsletter</a>, Lyn Alden bluntly puts it, "From a depositor perspective, banks are essentially highly-leveraged bond funds with payment services attached, and we naively trust them with our hard-earned savings." Where would you rather keep your money, in a "highly-leveraged bond fund," or with Custodia? </p><p>If the answer to that question isn't clear, it's time for a wakeup call.</p><p>The philosophy is simple: instead of the famous “Don’t be evil,” mantra, the regulations at SPDI banks make it so that “You can't be evil." Unlike traditional banks, an SPDI bank like Custodia would prioritize the security and well-being of its customers.</p><p>This case may serve as a reckoning, and could become a watershed event that extends far beyond bitcoin, exposing the overreach of the Federal Reserve on our money and the profound unfairness of our banking systems. Technological advancements have brought these issues to the forefront, demanding action.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwOTE3NzExNjQ2MTcyNzU3/aa-btc-4.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New Phoenix Lightning Wallet Beta Reimagines The Self-Custodial Experience]]></title><description><![CDATA[Calling itself a third-generation self-custodial Lightning wallet, Phoenix’s new update sports significant updates.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/new-phoenix-lightning-wallet-beta-reimagines-the-self-custodial-experience</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/new-phoenix-lightning-wallet-beta-reimagines-the-self-custodial-experience</guid><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Wallets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Self Custody]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 17:01:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://phoenix.acinq.co/">Phoenix</a>, a Lightning wallet developed by Acinq, has undergone significant <a href="https://acinq.co/blog/phoenix-splicing-update">improvements</a> with the introduction of splicing technology, resulting in a more efficient and user-friendly experience. Unlike previous versions, which created multiple channels and incurred unpredictable fees, the new Phoenix manages a single dynamic channel, eliminating the need for scattered liquidity and splitting issues.</p><p>With splicing, users can now resize channels, adding or removing funds without adding future risk. The previous 1% fee on inbound liquidity has been replaced by the mining fee for the underlying on-chain transaction. The announcement emphasized the significance of splicing, stating, "We believe that the efficiency gains brought by splicing are so phenomenal that all wallets will eventually implement it."</p><p>The updated version of Phoenix also addresses user concerns regarding unexpected channel creation fees. Users are now notified in advance when an incoming Lightning payment will incur a channel management fee, allowing for fine control over fee management. Additionally, the fee for sending Lightning payments is now fixed at 0.4%, ensuring transparency and aligning incentives between users and the wallet provider, “to find the best (reliable, affordable) route within the fee budget.”</p><p>One notable feature of the new Phoenix is trustless swaps. Instead of relying on swap services, which often lack flexibility, Phoenix enables users to make on-chain transactions directly from their channel. Users have the freedom to set their own feerate and even adjust the fee later for faster confirmation.</p><p>While splicing offers remarkable benefits, it should be noted that external swap services still hold advantages in certain transactions. These services cut the link between off-chain and on-chain, maintaining the channel size and adding inbound liquidity.</p><p>The new Phoenix wallet marks a significant milestone in the development of self-custodial wallets. Its enhanced features, such as splicing, improved predictability and trustless swaps, showcase the continuous innovation in the Lightning Network ecosystem. The announcement noted that users can look forward to advancements like blinded paths for better privacy, BOLT 12/Offers for static Lightning invoices and Taproot for cheaper channel management and enhanced on-chain privacy.</p><p>The beta version of the new Phoenix is currently available for Android users, with an ETA for iOS release expected in the coming weeks. Interested users can apply for the beta by emailing phoenix@acinq.co.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgyMDU1MzM1MTk5MDU3MDI3/bitcoin-numbers.jpg"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unchained Announces New Signature Private Client Service]]></title><description><![CDATA[Members of the new service will receive special benefits, support and features akin to traditional premium banking services.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-new-signature-private-client-service</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/unchained-announces-new-signature-private-client-service</guid><category><![CDATA[financial services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Custody]]></category><category><![CDATA[multi-signature]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unchained capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 15:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained</a>, a Bitcoin custodial services company, has announced the launch of its private client service with collaborative custody. According to a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine, the new platform called “Unchained Signature” is a “membership-based service that helps high-net-worth individuals, institutions and corporations invest in and manage their bitcoin.”</p><p>The company compares the experience to that of premium banking services, but with the added twist of multi-signature custodial models that Unchained is known for. “The fact that clients hold their own bitcoin keys, even when they get a loan with their bitcoin used as collateral, is an assurance that Unchained is not able to singularly move or rehypothecate client funds, as many now-defunct crypto firms did prior to their collapse,” the press release stated.</p><p>Dedicated account management features described include private trade execution, multi-million dollar loans and retirement and estate planning — plus technical support, even to the extent that advisors will travel in-person for assistance during emergencies. In addition, Signature clients will receive early access to Unchained’s latest products as well as exclusive access to networking events. </p><p>“As the best performing asset of the last decade, bitcoin continues to draw in new high-net-worth individuals and institutions, many of whom have previously shied away from crypto due to technical barriers and third-party risks,” said Joe Kelly, co-founder and CEO of Unchained, as he described the company’s opportunity. “Unchained Signature exists to help these investors buy, secure, and grow their bitcoin with as much technical and logistical assistance as they need — all without compromising security.”</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMzYwODg2MzE2MTE1MzQ4/draper-moon-rocket-bitcoin-studio-demo-pitch.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[As Zimbabwe’s Fiat Currency Crashes Again, Bitcoin Adoption Is Poised To Last]]></title><description><![CDATA[Recent efforts from Zimbabwe’s reserve bank to bolster its local currency signal the return of rampant inflation and the need for Bitcoin.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/with-return-of-zimbabwe-inflation-bitcoin-adoption-will-stick</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/with-return-of-zimbabwe-inflation-bitcoin-adoption-will-stick</guid><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cbdcs]]></category><category><![CDATA[Africa]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gold]]></category><category><![CDATA[Zimbabwe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[hyperinflation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Usd]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Thabo P.

Ncube, a Bitcoiner who lived through Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation in 2008.</em></p><p>The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the fiat custodian and lender of last resort in the country, recently “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-06/zimbabwe-liberalizes-foreign-exchange-market-as-it-hikes-rates#xj4y7vzkg">liberalized</a>” its much-vaunted <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/index.php/financial-markets/foreign-exchange-auction">foreign exchange auction trading system</a> in hopes of selling foreign currencies at market-determined exchange rates through regulated banks.</p><p>Zimbabwe <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/forex/z/zwd-zimbabwe-dollar.asp#:~:text=ZWD%20in%20April.-,The%20Multiple%20Currency%20System,South%20African%20rand%20(ZAR).">uses a multi-currency system</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/zimbabwe-announces-new-measures-aid-ailing-local-currency-2023-05-30/">with 80% of its economy being dollarized</a>, according to economists. The black-market rate for the U.S. dollar (USD) has recently been<a href="https://www.newzimbabwe.com/black-market-exchange-rate-breaches-zwl2-000-mark-prices-soar/"> twice as high or even higher</a> than the official rate backed by the RBZ.</p><p>In January 2023, the local Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL) was trading at about <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/Foreign_Exchange_Auction/2023/AUCTION_RESULTS_-_10-01-23_pdf.pdf">ZWL$705 to $1</a>, but on June 7, 2023, just after the bank’s pivot, the official price was about <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/Foreign_Exchange_Auction/2023/June/WHOLESALE_AUCTION_RESULTS_FOR_PUBLICATION_-07.06.2023.pdf">ZWL$4,868 to $1</a>. Just a day earlier, the black-market rate was reported to be around <a href="https://twitter.com/BitiTendai/status/1666113606813990912">ZWL$7,000 to $1</a>. </p><p>Meanwhile, the month-over-month inflation rate in Zimbabwe was measured at <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/local-news/article/200012114/inflation-spikes-in-may">15.7% in May 2023</a>, while the annualized inflation was <a href="https://www.newsday.co.zw/local-news/article/200012114/inflation-spikes-in-may">estimated to have reached 75.6%</a>.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/">Professor Steve Hanke</a> of John Hopkins University recently measured Zimbabwe’s annual inflation rate at <a href="https://twitter.com/steve_hanke/status/1674137842392485907">1,298%, the highest in the world</a>. </p><p>I believe that these painful developments, and many others, have opened the door for Bitcoin adoption in Zimbabwe, and that no person and no institution will be able to stop it.</p><h2>In The Wake Of Financial Crisis</h2><p>For most Zimbabweans, 2023 must feel like déjà vu all over again. </p><p>In 2008, at the apex of another financial crisis, Zimbabweans lost their savings when inflation hit world-record levels (<a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/2009/5/cj29n2-8.pdf">79.6 billion percent)</a> and many, including myself, had to carry bundles of money just to buy food essentials in long queues. </p><p>The country stabilized to a certain extent, a “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe_Government_of_National_Unity_of_2009#:~:text=The%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity,Mutambara%20as%20Deputy%20Prime%20Ministers.">Government of National Unity</a>” was formed between the ruling party and the leading opposition party after a disputed and violent election. The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-06/usd-use-dethrones-zwl-for-second-time#:~:text=The%20Zimbabwean%20dollar%20was%20abolished,to%20revive%20the%20stagnating%20economy.">nation fully adopted the USD</a> and it was minted as the only legal tender. Public or private sector employees who had worked for 30 years and sometimes more lost their savings as the whole economic infrastructure collapsed. </p><p>The value of trillions of ZWL just vaporized and left many in despair. To this day, many Zimbabweans prefer keeping their money at home, affectionately known as “mattress banking,” because the financial institutions, government bureaucrats and politicians let them down. Who can blame them? </p><p>But many miles away, as Zimbabweans were still getting to understand their new normal, <a href="https://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/the-history-of-bitcoin#:~:text=Bitcoin%20was%20the%20first%20cryptocurrency,identity%20has%20never%20been%20verified.">Satoshi Nakamoto was pioneering Bitcoin</a>. This wouldn't just be a revolutionary way of transacting and storing value, but in the future, could be a way for normal Zimbabweans to avoid the painful memories of 2008 and many more failures of government and fiat currencies. </p><h2>Continued Crises</h2><p>Since 2016, another crisis has been looming on the horizon. </p><p>The RBZ <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/publications/press/press-statement-on-the-introduction-of-bond-notes.pdf">introduced “bond notes” and “coins”</a> to help with change when transacting. Only USD notes were available on the market and coins were hard to come by. Experts warned this was the resurrection of the ZWL, but the RBZ <a href="https://www.herald.co.zw/bond-note-introduction-to-ease-cash-shortages/">denied that and defended itself</a> — the current governor, John Mangudya, <a href="https://zimfact.org/has-mangudya-reneged-on-his-bond-note-promise/">even promised to resign if this scheme didn’t work</a>.<br></p><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwean_bond_notes#:~:text=Zimbabwean%20bond%20notes%20are%20a,equally%20against%20the%20U.S.%20dollar">Despite evidence that it is not working</a>, Mangudya <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-zimbabwe-mangudya-idUKKCN1N64TA">was given another term</a> and the <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1652851/zimbabwe-dollar-is-back-but-economists-are-unsure-it-will-work">ZWL was fully resurrected by June 2019</a>. Zimbabweans once again lost their savings as the government legislated that the ZWL was equal to the USD in their bank accounts. The black market for foreign exchange was resuscitated and people began paying a premium for USD notes outside of the normal financial sector. Zimbabweans had been lied to once again by people who professed to having their best interests at heart. </p><p>But they had learned their lesson and, by early 2018, bitcoin in Zimbabwe was <a href="https://www.pindula.co.zw/2017/11/28/bitcoin-soars-in-zim-reaches-record-high-of-17-875/">trading at a premium</a>, at one point reaching a price of $17,875 while across the world the price was closer to $10,000. People were looking for ways to store their hard-earned money in value and bitcoin was proving to be a viable solution. </p><p>But in May 2018, <a href="https://freemanlaw.com/cryptocurrency/zimbabwe/">bitcoin was effectively banned in the country</a> as all financial institutions were instructed to stop transactions linked to Bitcoin. This nearly totally killed the local Bitcoin community and sent many people to seek unorthodox ways to acquire BTC.</p><p>In June 2022, the RBZ <a href="https://www.africa-press.net/zimbabwe/all-news/reserve-bank-of-zimbabwe-introduces-gold-coins">introduced gold coins as a store of value</a>. By May 2023, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/5/9/zimbabwes-new-gold-backed-digital-currency-all-you-need-to-know">it was also introducing gold-backed digital currency</a>. This was clearly an indication that the local currency was racing to the bottom again. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ReserveBankZIM/status/1656963536197758976">Over 90% of the tokens and gold were bought using ZWL</a> and <a href="https://www.rbz.co.zw/documents/press/2023/May/Gold-Backed_Digital_Tokens_Prospectus_-_4_May_2023_1.pdf">they could be vested after a certain period in USD</a>. This seemed like a good way for the elites to store the depreciating currency in gold while the rest of the populace watched the ZWL crash every week. </p><p>Tentatively, it seemed like the gap between the demand and supply of the USD on the market keeps on widening and the apex bank's methods of shouldering the local fiat currency keeps on failing. People don’t trust its methods, and rightfully so. Unfortunately, with governments controlling the fiat money supply, these kinds of problems will persist, small and large. </p><p>As a result, Zimbabwe could be heading toward another dark period. Recently, the price of a loaf of bread <a href="https://twitter.com/daddyhope/status/1667129941698269187?t=5YMW99BXAwSL-NqIvrYgmw&amp;s=19">changed twice in less than a day</a>, from ZWL$10,000 to ZWL$12,200. </p><p>To make things worse, some banks<a href="https://twitter.com/baba_nyenyedzi/status/1667023790725898241?s=1"> have published statements limiting the usage of Nostro accounts</a>, instituting panic across the board and <a href="https://www.techzim.co.zw/2023/06/zim-banks-limiting-nostro-account-usage-deactivating-nostros-for-international-use-for-example/">setting up a possible bank run</a>. Nostro accounts are the Zimbabwean versions of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nostroaccount.asp">foreign currency accounts</a>, which have become needed as the government and private employers have taken to paying employees portions of their salaries in USD, along with the highly-inflationary ZWL. Now, it seems like the government payments are not backed by real cash on hand. </p><h2>A Way To Preserve Value</h2><p>Against the backdrop of all this, Bitcoin is emerging again as a valid way to preserve value. </p><p>Via VPNs, which can be used to access exchanges blocked in the country; no-KYC or KYC-light exchanges all over the world; and peer-to-peer networks through WhatsApp and Telegram, Zimbabweans are finding ways to access Bitcoin. Bitcoin provides security, absolute scarcity, a commitment to accountability via a public ledger and, more than anything else for those in Zimbabwe, a store of value. Bitcoin puts control of an individual’s destiny in their own hands and that’s just perfect for a lot of Zimbabweans, who won’t have to rely on politicians and bureaucrats for their economical survival. More than anything. Bitcoin is independence, freedom and individual sovereignty.</p><p>Bitcoin represents more than sound money in Zimbabwe, and no political government can ever match its standards and safety. And this time, the RBZ won’t be able to stop Bitcoin, as the people have figured out ways to exist in the safety of Bitcoin outside of the regulated financial corridors. Bitcoin is now!</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Thabo P. Ncube.

The Digital Disclosure Survey conducted by Broadridge Financial Solutions sheds light on the fact that key metrics such as tokenomics and network performance are often overlooked by investors. This finding raises questions about the extent to which investors understand the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin and its underlying technology.</p><p>As the largest and most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin serves as both a decentralized network and a digital asset. Network performance, one of the metrics commonly disregarded by investors, is crucial for assessing the health and functionality of the Bitcoin network. But only 28% of participants considered it important, putting it outside of the top five factors. Understanding how the network operates, how resilient it is to change and to disruption and the different projects currently being built on Bitcoin are vital pieces of information for any investor in the market. </p><p>Moreover, the study's findings regarding investors' preference for traditional finance metrics highlight a potential gap in their understanding of Bitcoin as an asset. Tokenomics, the economic aspects of a coin, play a significant role in determining its value and future supply. Despite this, only 16% of respondents indicated that tokenomics was a factor that they considered. By overlooking the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/bitcoin-supply">rock-solid tokenomics</a> that serve as a foundation for bitcoin, investors may miss crucial insights into the potential long-term sustainability and growth prospects of bitcoin.</p><p>The survey's results also have implications for Bitcoin's transparency and trustworthiness as an asset. Rob Krugman, Chief Digital Officer at Broadridge, emphasized the importance of transparency for market survival and growth. Enhancing disclosure practices and providing standardized, easily accessible metrics for tracking bitcoin's performance can foster trust among investors, and help lead to approval for developments like a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/the-arrival-of-blackrock-bitcoins-first-spot-etf">spot Bitcoin ETF.</a> </p><p>Furthermore, the study's revelation that 65% of investors view their crypto holdings as long-term investments aligns with the popular perception of bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin's limited supply and decentralized nature have attracted long-term investors seeking an alternative to traditional fiat currencies and store-of-value assets like gold.</p><p>Overall, the Digital Disclosure Survey underscored the need for investors involved with Bitcoin, to consider a broader range of metrics that specifically apply to cryptocurrencies. By recognizing the significance of network performance, tokenomics and other crypto-specific factors, investors can make more informed decisions regarding the viability and attractiveness of bitcoin both as a network and as an asset.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkxNzU0OTcxNDk3MTEzMjUx/20220819_best-sidechain-recap---shinobi.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Austrian Bitcoin Broker Coinfinity Integrates Lightning Network]]></title><description><![CDATA[Coinfinity now offers customers access to the Lightning network, enabling faster and cost-effective transactions in the EU.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/austrian-bitcoin-broker-coinfinity-integrates-lightning-network</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/austrian-bitcoin-broker-coinfinity-integrates-lightning-network</guid><category><![CDATA[Austria]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eu]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lightning]]></category><category><![CDATA[Exchanges]]></category><category><![CDATA[Europe]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 18:57:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQyMTg0NjEw/img_6220.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>Coinfinity, an Austrian bitcoin broker, has recently integrated the Lightning Network into its services, allowing customers to make bitcoin purchases with reduced transaction fees and quicker processing times.</p><p>Thomas Burgstaller, Chief Growth Officer at Coinfinity, highlighted the significance of this integration, stating, "Being this early to market is an important innovation step for us at Coinfinity, and Lightning itself is an essential foundation for the global adoption of Bitcoin as a usable monetary system."</p><figure>

But it’s also a piece of software that deliberately takes away the power of insiders — no matter if those insiders are large miners or bitcoin whales. </p><p>What we’ve seen in the larger cryptocurrency space over the past few years has been a perversion of those ideas and principles. The fact that the U.S. Securities And Exchange Commission (SEC) is (finally) waking up to those shenanigans is something that was to be expected. </p><h2>When Profit Trumped Common Sense</h2><p>The pursuit of exponential profits with very little upfront investment of time, brain power or capital has not just helped crypto-token Ponzi schemes take off. It has allowed rent seekers like <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/ftx-files-for-bankruptcy-ceo-resigns">FTX</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/blockfi-files-for-bankruptcy">BlockFi</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/luna-foundation-sold-80000-bitcoin-amid-ust-crash">Luna</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/celsius-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy">Celsius</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/fears-of-further-contagion-in-the-bitcoin-market">Three Arrows Capital</a> and countless “Web3” projects to be perceived as “innovations” instead of just pure cash grabs.</p><p>While it’s a venture capitalist’s (VC’s) job to put bets on what he or she believes will make money and shape the future of technology, the sheer audacity with which the crypto-Ponzi industry’s insiders pushed their agendas in recent years has been unbelievable. We have read the stories of a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/coinbase-ex-manager-sentenced-2-years-prison-us-insider-trading-case-2023-05-09/">former Coinbase manager sentenced to two years in prison</a> for front-running its users, and we know that Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), one of the largest VC firms in the space, <a href="https://protos.com/the-crypto-bets-of-a16z-crumble-early-investors-still-profit/">has shilled Ponzi schemes like Helium</a>.</p><p>The marketing approach a16z has had for its projects was <a href="https://protos.com/the-crypto-bets-of-a16z-crumble-early-investors-still-profit/">summed up by Cory Klippsten</a>: </p><p>“Most Bitcoiners that promote Bitcoin are just buying and holding as much as possible — and people who love it the most are the people who never sell. It’s kind of the exact opposite of what you see with the likes of a16z: full-frontal assault, marketing through all their channels, executing massive pumps after they bought a bunch of cheap Solana from the centralized team that controls it in the spring of 2021. They ⏤ and all their VC friends ⏤ were selling the top in late 2021, while claiming to the world that they were HODLing.”</p><h2>‘Crypto’ Was Always A Cash Grab Disguised As Tech Innovation</h2><p>Everyone who learns more about Bitcoin will soon realize that it isn’t perfect. The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-first-major-bitcoin-civil-war">block size debate</a> is, luckily, behind us, but full mempools and new things like the Ordinals protocol show that scalability is still a thing to be fully figured out. I believe that the Lightning Network, as well as similar solutions, offer a viable path toward secure, fast and affordable transactions, but we are not fully there yet.</p><p>Trying to improve the Bitcoin network is a noble cause, and if you feel that it can be done, giving it a try on your own is a legitimate thing to do. But the Bitcoin spinoffs we have seen over the years all failed, in terms of adoption, brand value and price. We know that ICOs in 2017 were largely cash grabs among retail investors, with little to no real innovation or market proof up until now. Hollow buzzwords like “blockchain” soon vanished, just to be replaced by an even vaguer concept of “Web3” in the wake of the COVID19 pandemic. </p><h2>Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes</h2><p>Today, there are <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/863917/number-crypto-coins-tokens/">thousands of crypto tokens out there</a>, with a vast number of them created from the beginning as blatant Ponzi schemes without any long-term vision other than to benefit a small group of insiders. Honestly, I would have preferred to let the market decide their fate, and not regulators. But the reality is that the U.S. is now cracking down on them after the SEC failed miserably when it came to stopping people like former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.</p><p>SEC boss Gary Gensler recently made clear that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/28/bitcoin-is-the-only-coin-the-sec-chair-will-call-a-commodity">bitcoin is a commodity</a> and, therefore, doesn’t fall in the domain of his agency. And now, in the SEC’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/05/sec-sues-crypto-exchange-binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">lawsuit against Binance</a>, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Gensler appears to be preparing to crack down on the crypto Ponzis, as it includes severe accusations against the company itself and also states that a range of crypto projects should be defined as securities. Those include big names, like Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Polygon (MATIC).</p><p>I don’t want to cheer for the SEC or any other regulator, because we all know that in the U.S., we barely managed to dodge a <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/legal/biden-administration-proposes-30-tax-on-energy-used-by-bitcoin-miners">30% energy tax on Bitcoin mining</a>. And the powerful people who don’t want Bitcoin to win will find other angles through which to attack it. But at the same time, Bitcoiners had warned about FTX, Terra Luna and other shady crypto projects from day one. I’m sorry for every person who burned their fingers and lost money by trusting those criminals, but it’s also understandable that Bitcoiners are rightfully celebrating this “told you so” moment.</p><h2>The Crypto-Securities Discussion Is Also Coming To Europe</h2><p>Love it or hate it, the <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-market-in-crypto-assets-6751039">Market In Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> is the first comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in a major economic zone. Unless you think the free market should take care of scams and bad actors (which would be a fair point), you probably see MiCA as a step in the right direction. At least it’s a different approach than the “burn it all down” vibes we are getting from the Democratic Party, the SEC and other actors in the U.S. </p><p>But MiCA is the starting point rather than the end when it comes to trying to tame the “crypto Wild West” in Europe. A few days after signing MiCA into law in May 2023, a <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/IPOL_STU(2023)740083">study published by non-other than the European Parliament</a> came to the conclusion that MiCA needs to take further steps to really work. In fact, the study came to a similar conclusion as what we already see unfolding in the U.S.: It advises that lawmakers should take a closer look at things like DeFi, staking and NFTs. And, most importantly: <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/01/treat-crypto-as-securities-by-default-european-parliament-study-says/">All crypto assets should be treated as securities by default</a>.</p><p>I think that, no matter what will happen in terms of regulation, it’s important to remember what makes Bitcoin unique and why we are here in the first place: It’s an asset you can really own, living on a network no one can shut down or control. This is it. As Adam Back recently said, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-antifragile-regulatory-pressures-blockstream-120120211.html">Bitcoin is “antifragile” to regulatory pressures</a>. And we can already see that this is the key difference between random crypto projects and Bitcoin.</p><h2>Bitcoin Only And Non Custodial Are The Way Forward</h2><p>Again: I’m not cheering for more regulation. I believe in the free market, and I think that with or without laws, bad actors will be flushed out eventually. On the other hand, I feel for everyone who gets scammed and loses money in shameless crypto scams. So, I also understand why some guardrails are needed, especially when bad faith actors are disguising themselves as “tech innovators.”</p><p>Companies that focus on Bitcoin and offer real, non-custodial BTC will thrive. Players who offer countless, shady Ponzi tokens to their (newbie) users will not only face regulatory scrutiny, but also lose the trust of their customers when tokens that were once promoted as “the next big things” start heading to zero amid harsher regulation.</p><p>Now, more than a decade after Satoshi Nakamoto invented true digital scarcity, the Bitcoin network stands stronger than ever as the one true cryptocurrency. An asset that can’t be diluted, can’t be easily changed and that doesn’t have a small group of founding insiders who dictate the rules. I don’t know what the future holds for Bitcoin, but I know that a lot of the things that Bitcoiners like me have been repeating about “crypto” and why Bitcoin is different rings true today more than ever.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Julian Liniger.

Bitcoin is among the greatest wonders of the late-modern world, so Greg Foss is understandably very passionate about it. So passionate in fact, that he dropped <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoTea_/status/1660822173257199617?s=20">11 f-bombs in 31 seconds</a> out of concern for its future (and this despite the fact that he’s Canadian!). </p><p>Why is such a stalwart Bitcoin proponent so concerned? Because <a href="https://twitter.com/TaprootWizards/status/1660434627125817347?s=20">two guys in cheap wizard costumes</a> did a cringey Fortnite dance? Surely the stakes must be higher.</p><p>According to some, there is a battle underway for the future and soul of Bitcoin. According to others, we’ve just gained a fun, nerdy and innocuous way to play with Bitcoin that makes it even funner and nerdier, though no less revolutionary. </p><p>Ordinals, inscriptions and the BRC-20 protocol are the bone(s) of contention. Ordinals <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-ordinals-an-overview-of-bitcoin-nfts">allow individual sats to be identified</a>; inscriptions <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/guides/inscriptions.html">allow objects like text, images and data files to be written onto them</a>; and BRC-20 <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/brc-20-explained-how-tokens-on-bitcoin-work-and-why-they-are-controversial/">allows second-order tokens to be minted directly onto them</a>, like an Ethereum-lite. In effect, they introduce storage as a new use case for the Bitcoin blockchain in addition to its existing and principal use as a ledger for currency transactions. These features are affecting <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/ordinal-concerns-bitcoin-decentralization-and-block-space">block sizes, transaction fees and validation times</a>, so they’re not inconsequential. </p><p>The bone of contention is what they mean for Bitcoin’s future. Are they pathological, like a tumor? Do they offer a competitive advantage, like chlorophyll and claws? Or are they just harmless and benign, like male nipples or that little dangly thing at the top of your throat?</p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Ordinal <s>ABCs</s> One, Two, Threes</h2><p>Of the recent developments in Bitcoin listed above, Ordinals came first. Casey Rodarmor, the guy who “invented” Ordinals (this time around), <a href="https://github.com/casey/ord/blob/master/bip.mediawiki#user-content-Motivation">sought to devise</a> “stable identifiers that may be used by Bitcoin applications.” In other words, he wanted to index sats by giving each one a serial number that would survive across time and UTXOs.</p><p>Of course, giving each sat a unique identifier means that they are no longer <em>perfectly </em>fungible because they are no longer strictly identical, when applying the Ordinal convention. Just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification">the Library Of Congress Classification (LCC) system</a> for books in research libraries or URLs for web pages, Ordinals make each sat unique and retrievable. Identifiability affects fungibility without eliminating it.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Inscriptions are the second controversial, recent development in the world of Bitcoin. <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/inscriptions.html">The “Ordinal Theory Handbook”</a> gives a marvelously succinct definition of inscriptions, helpfully relating them to Ordinals:</p><blockquote><p>“Inscriptions inscribe sats with arbitrary content, creating bitcoin-native digital artifacts, more commonly known as NFTs… These inscribed sats can then be transferred using bitcoin transactions, sent to bitcoin addresses, and held in bitcoin UTXOs. These transactions, addresses, and UTXOs are normal bitcoin transactions, addresses, and UTXOS in all respects, with the exception that in order to send individual sats, transactions must control the order and value of inputs and outputs according to ordinal theory.”</p></blockquote><p>Of course, Bitcoiners are far too sophisticated to get suckered into all that <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/seth-greene-recovers-lost-nft-1234733180/">Bored Ape nonsense</a>. If we were to copyright cartoons on our blockchain, we’d do <a href="https://www.taprootwizards.com/collection">wizards</a> instead of apes. I mean, apes? C’mon.</p><p>Whatever. Think of inscriptions like blockchain tattoos. Some people are going to love them, others are going to disdain them. The world (and the witness data of a transaction) is big enough for both. </p><p>The third recent development in Bitcoin is <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata/status/1633658974686855168?s=20">the BRC-20 protocol</a>, which lets people <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/644951761f54331a2616ba16/">mint and distribute tokens</a> according to predefined parameters. These tokens are written as inscriptions onto sats marked with Ordinals, which brings us full circle. These three features allow users to create digital artifacts/NFTs and to use the Bitcoin blockchain to distribute and trade them.</p><p>So, how’s it going? Not surprisingly, some people are attracted to particular numbers, like one, seven or 69,420, so some sats are coveted because Ordinals have made them “<a href="https://medium.com/@johnnytdong/what-are-rare-sats-5fc9c8ac890e">rare</a>” (although, if you think about it, each Ordinal number is unique, so each one is exactly as rare as the others). </p><p>There is also a market for BRC-20 tokens, many of which are just second-order bitcoin. For example, the <a href="https://www.brc-20.io/">$OG$ token</a> and the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/piza-brc-20/">$PIZA token</a> both have a supply of 21 million (just like bitcoin) and, at one point, had market caps of around $10 million.</p><p>The upshot is that:</p><ol><li>Sats are now uniquely identifiable according to a new convention</li><li>People can add data to sats</li><li>Token-minting algorithms are a kind of inscription data, so people can mint tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain</li></ol><figure>

    </figure><p>It’s important to note that, while Ordinals, inscriptions and BRC-20 are recent developments in how Bitcoin works and how we use it, they’re not really “innovations” because they’re not really new. Something like Ordinals was proposed under the name BitDNS <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.0"><em>back in 2010</em></a>. Using OP_RETURN to store strings of data on UTXOs <a href="https://unchained.com/blog/bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals/">goes back nearly a decade</a>. And minting second-order “tokens” on an underlying blockchain is basically the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/">idea behind Ethereum</a>, which isn’t really new. (Hat tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/giacomozucco">Giacomo Zucco</a>, who took a deep dive into this in <a href="https://youtu.be/596InlNtfD0">a presentation he gave in Prague</a>.)</p><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plus%20%C3%A7a%20change,%20plus%20c%27est%20la%20m%C3%AAme%20chose">Plus ça change</a>…</p><h2>What This Means For Bitcoin: Transaction Fees</h2><p>Ordinals, inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens are, of course, controversial. Though some love them, as the transaction fees of recent months attest, others are bemused or annoyed. Even the guy who invented BRC-20 <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata/status/1633828036943704068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1633828036943704068%7Ctwgr%5E34a7857f0440af46b74f5d075c2ae2cd0124be7b%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fordinals-good-or-bad-for-bitcoin-supporters-and-opposers-raise-voice">has said</a>, “These will be worthless. Please do not waste money mass minting.” </p><p>OK, but “worthless” isn’t a synonym for “evil.” Some people think tattoos and Big Macs are worthless, other people love them. So, what’s the big deal?</p><p>Opposition to Bitcoin’s new features usually stems from the suppositions that: </p><ol><li>Ordinals and inscriptions make bitcoin less like money </li><li>They make transactions more expensive</li></ol><p>Let’s deal with the last point first. Thanks in part to Ordinals, the number of transactions in the mempool has increased by about <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/mempool-size">two orders of magnitude</a>, and the data in the backlog has increased about 150 times. </p><p>The effects are ambivalent. On the one hand, more data per transaction increases the storage and computing burdens for node operators, for which they receive no compensation. Not great. </p><p>On the other hand, more data to compute means higher fees for miners. In fact, the average on-chain transaction fee reached <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">$30.91</a> recently. High <em>on-chain </em>transaction fees are not evil. In fact, high fees are a good thing. They incentivize miners, which attracts miners and spurs them to invest, which keeps <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/02/05/what-does-hashrate-mean-and-why-does-it-matter/">the hash rate</a> high and makes Bitcoin more secure. That’s about as evil as a St. Bernard carrying a cask of brandy.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Moreover, high on-chain fees merely reinforce the different use cases between on-chain bitcoin and sats on the Lightning Network. On-chain payments have arguably never been well suited for quick microtransactions because they treat small and large transactions pretty much the same. By contrast, Lightning fees are proportional to the transaction amount. If you’re paying two-, or three- or 10 times the price of your beer or pizza in transaction fees for an on-chain payment when you could be paying one one-thousandth of it on Lightning, you’re doing it wrong.</p><p>If on-chain fees are inhibiting you from paying with bitcoin, then you should probably take advantage of Lightning’s proportional fees. If Lightning fees are inhibiting you from paying with bitcoin, then you should probably take advantage of the one-size-fits-all, on-chain fees.</p><h2>What This Means For Bitcoin: Money-ness</h2><p>As for whether bitcoin is still money in a world of ordinals, there are a couple of ways to answer that question. First, we could comb through various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money">definitions</a> of <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-money/">what</a> <a href="https://open.lib.umn.edu/principleseconomics/chapter/24-1-what-is-money/">money</a> is, come up with the ultimate list of criteria and use it to evaluate the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Bitcoin white paper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin">all subsequent protocols</a>. Aristotle would be proud, but the answer would be unnecessarily theoretical and abstract. </p><p>Alternatively, we could actually observe what people are doing out there in the world. However sensible this new use case is, people like inscriptions and are willing to pay for them. </p><ul><li>Whom are they paying? Miners. </li><li>How are they paying? Transaction fees.</li><li>What are miners doing with the transaction fees? Reinvesting some to cover the costs of mining more bitcoin.</li><li>Where does that bitcoin go? From the miners out into the world, where it circulates.</li></ul><p>And there we have it: payment and circulation. People pay miners, miners pay people, they’re using bitcoin, ergo bitcoin is money. We’ve found the essence of currency without a dictionary (sorry Aristotle).</p><p>In other words, bitcoin is still money, but the Bitcoin blockchain can <em>also</em> be used for storage. Note the Boolean operator: (money <em>and</em> storage) <em>not</em> (money <em>or</em> storage). Indeed, adding new, sensible use cases might be a prerequisite for any currency from this point forward. The question is merely, what counts as “sensible”? But time — and the market — will tell.</p><h2>Good, Bad Or Benign?</h2><p>So, let us return to the original question: Are Ordinals, inscriptions and BRC-20 good or bad for Bitcoin? Or are they just a new feature of the world that we’ll adapt to without much consequence? </p><p>Well, these functions weren’t at the top of my personal list of priorities. I can’t say that <a href="https://www.taprootwizards.com/">Taproot Wizards</a> or “Ordinal tokens” are really making the world a better place. </p><p>But I don’t fear these developments either. They raise fees, and higher fees have beneficial side effects for the blockchain. What’s good for Bitcoin is good for the world, whether it’s intentional or not.</p><p>And they reinforce the case for Lightning as a low-fee means to use bitcoin as money for smallish, everyday purchases and transfers. Generally, what’s good for Lightning is good for Bitcoin, which is good for the world. Wizards GIFs and subsidiary tokens can’t really do much harm, so I’m just gonna stay cool, stack sats and continue making Lightning as good as it can be.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Roy Sheinfeld.

It can be viewed as a catalyst for personal growth and spiritual transformation, offering individuals a unique path toward self discovery and enlightenment.</p><p>In this essay, I will explore how Bitcoin can serve as a tool for this type of self transformation and become a catalyst for a profound journey of spiritual growth.</p><h2>Embracing Financial Sovereignty</h2><p>Bitcoin's core principle lies in decentralization and the elimination of intermediaries, offering individuals full control over their financial assets.</p><p>By embracing Bitcoin, we embark on a journey of financial sovereignty, freeing ourselves from the restrictions imposed by traditional financial systems. This newfound autonomy allows us to transcend limiting beliefs and societal expectations regarding money, enabling us to reevaluate our relationship with wealth and abundance.</p><p>As we develop a sense of self reliance and take responsibility for our financial well-being, we open the doors to self empowerment and spiritual growth.</p><p>Furthermore, financial sovereignty through Bitcoin encourages us to question the existing economic paradigm, in which financial institutions and governments exert significant control over our monetary transactions. As we challenge this centralized authority, we develop a deeper understanding of the importance of individual freedom and the potential for positive change through decentralized systems.</p><p>This realization extends beyond financial matters, encouraging us to question other aspects of our lives that may be governed by external authorities, fostering a sense of empowerment and self determination.</p><h2>Fostering Trust And Collaboration</h2><p>Bitcoin's underlying technology, its blockchain, relies on a network of participants who collectively validate and verify transactions. This decentralized approach fosters trust and collaboration, as each participant contributes to the overall security and integrity of the network.</p><p>Through engagement with the Bitcoin community, we develop a sense of interconnectedness, recognizing the importance of collaboration, transparency and consensus.</p><p>This realization extends beyond the realm of finance, teaching us valuable lessons about trust, cooperation and the power of collective action in our personal lives and relationships.</p><p>The Bitcoin community, consisting of developers, miners, investors and enthusiasts, demonstrates the power of collaboration and shared goals. It encourages individuals to work together towards common objectives, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation that transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. By actively participating in this community, we learn to embrace diversity, respect differing opinions and harness the power of collective intelligence.</p><p>These values extend beyond Bitcoin and can shape our interactions with others, helping us build stronger relationships and fostering a sense of harmony within our social circles.</p><h2>Cultivating Patience And Emotional Resilience</h2><p>Bitcoin's volatile nature tests our emotional resilience and challenges our capacity for patience.</p><p>The market's ups and downs teach us invaluable lessons in perseverance, discipline and emotional control. Investing in bitcoin necessitates a long-term perspective and the ability to weather temporary setbacks without succumbing to fear or panic.</p><p>By cultivating these qualities, we foster a deeper sense of equanimity, learning to detach ourselves from outcomes and embracing the journey rather than fixating solely on the destination. This shift in mindset lays a strong foundation for spiritual growth, as we develop the ability to navigate life's uncertainties with grace and composure.</p><p>And the lessons learned from bitcoin's volatility extend beyond financial markets.</p><p>They teach us to approach life's challenges with a calm and composed demeanor, recognizing that setbacks are temporary and part of a larger journey. Cultivating patience allows us to embrace the process of personal growth and transformation, understanding that true change takes time.</p><p>By embracing this patient mindset, we become more attuned to the present moment, finding joy and contentment in the journey itself rather than fixating solely on the end goal. This mindfulness fosters a deeper sense of self awareness and spiritual connection, enhancing our overall well-being</p><h2>Exploring New Paradigms Of Value</h2><p>Bitcoin challenges our conventional notions of value and offers an opportunity to explore alternative systems of wealth.</p><p>Its limited supply and decentralized nature detach it from the control of central authorities, prompting us to question the established notions of money and the pursuit of material possessions.</p><p>As we delve into the world of Bitcoin, we encounter a diverse community of individuals who value knowledge, innovation and personal growth over superficial indicators of success.</p><p>This exposure broadens our horizons, encouraging us to redefine our own measures of value and prioritize the pursuit of experiences, relationships and personal development.</p><p>Bitcoin's emergence as a store of value introduces us to the concept of "digital scarcity," which highlights the importance of intellectual and technological advancements. This shift in perspective prompts us to reevaluate our own talents, skills and knowledge, recognizing that they hold intrinsic value beyond material possessions.</p><p>By prioritizing personal growth and the pursuit of meaningful experiences, we align ourselves with a more holistic and fulfilling understanding of wealth.</p><p>This new paradigm allows us to embrace a purpose-driven life, in which our actions and contributions to society hold greater significance than mere accumulation of wealth.</p><h2>Practicing Mindfulness And Gratitude</h2><p>Engaging with Bitcoin provides an invitation to cultivate mindfulness and gratitude in our lives.</p><p>As we witness the transformative power of this technology, we become more aware of the present moment and the opportunities it holds. By practicing gratitude for the innovations and possibilities Bitcoin presents, we shift our focus from scarcity to abundance, attracting more positive experiences into our lives.</p><p>This newfound mindfulness expands our consciousness and deepens our spiritual connection, as we learn to appreciate the interconnectedness of all things and the limitless potential of the universe. Bitcoin's disruptive nature encourages us to challenge the status quo and approach life with a sense of curiosity and wonder. It prompts us to question the existing financial systems, societal structures and our own belief systems.</p><p>By cultivating a mindful and grateful attitude, we remain open to new possibilities, embrace change and foster a sense of awe for the transformative potential that lies within us and the world around us.</p><p>This mindset allows us to tap into our inner wisdom, explore our true purpose and cultivate a deeper sense of spiritual growth.</p><h2>A Catalyst For Individual Evolution</h2><p>Bitcoin's impact extends far beyond the realm of finance. By embracing this digital currency, we embark on a transformative journey of self discovery, personal growth and spiritual enlightenment.</p><p>Through the cultivation of financial sovereignty, trust, emotional resilience and alternative paradigms of value, Bitcoin serves as a catalyst for our individual evolution.</p><p>As we practice mindfulness and gratitude, we become more attuned to the interconnectedness of the world and the vast opportunities for growth and expansion.</p><p>Bitcoin, when approached with an open mind and a willingness to learn, can be a powerful tool for self transformation, guiding us towards a life of greater authenticity, abundance and spiritual fulfillment.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Heliand.

These tools leverage the Lightning Network and bitcoin to seamlessly integrate with LLMs. They are built on the L402 protocol, a Lightning native authentication mechanism and Langchain, a library that simplifies working with AI agents by incorporating external data for advanced functionality.</p><p>One of the tools included in the release is LangChainBitcoin, which enables Langchain agents to interact directly with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. It includes features such as LLM Agent Bitcoin Tools, which utilize OpenAI GPT function calls to enable developers to create agents capable of holding a bitcoin balance, sending/receiving bitcoin on Lightning and driving with a LND node. Another tool, the L402 HTTP API Traversal, is a Python wrapper for a LangChain LLM chain (APIChain) that allows agents to access L402 payment-metered APIs seamlessly.</p><p>Aperture, a drop-in reverse proxy server, is also part of the release. It implements the L402 protocol and transforms any API into a pay-per-use resource gated via L402 functionality on the Lightning Network. The latest version of Aperture now supports Lightning Node Connect protocol, enabling compatibility with various Lightning Nodes, such as Voltage, Umbrel, Start9, Raspiblitz and BTCPayServer.</p><p>The L402 protocol, introduced in 2020, is a standard for payment-metered APIs designed to utilize the existing HTTP 402 Payment Required status response code. It combines bitcoin and the Lightning Network to enable global micropayments for paid APIs. The protocol allows for authenticating and charging per use of internet-native services, addressing challenges faced by the AI developer community, such as the high cost of GPU training and limited accessibility to advanced LLM models.</p><p>By providing these developer tools, the creators aim to build more accessible AI infrastructure for both humans and AI agents. They are particularly excited about the AI4ALL hackathon, taking place this month, where developers can leverage these tools to unleash their creativity and innovation. The Lightning and AI communities are encouraged to explore the potential of these new tools and contribute to the development of the machine-payable web powered by Lightning.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkwMjY2NTkxMzgyODczMjQx/bitcoin-lightning-network.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bitcoin As The World’s First Over-Unity Power Generator]]></title><description><![CDATA[In a sense, Bitcoin achieves over-unity power generation by storing energy and creating additional value over time.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/converting-energy-to-stored-value-bitcoin-is-over-unity</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/converting-energy-to-stored-value-bitcoin-is-over-unity</guid><category><![CDATA[energy consumption]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Culture]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Kevin Melody]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkyMzg0NjM5NzQwOTQ2MDc3/20220916_better-five-factors-making-bitcoin-miners-unique-energy-consumers---jaran-mellerud.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by Kevin Melody, a node runner and real estate professional.</em></p><p>An “over-unity” power generator (similar to the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_motion">perpetual-motion machine</a>) is a hypothetical device that produces more energy than is required to run it. Although there is quite a bit of controversy in this field, the mainstream scientific consensus is that over-unity power generation is impossible, because it defies the first law of thermodynamics. </p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics">According to this law</a>, energy can undergo transformations from one form to another, but the total amount of energy within a closed system remains constant. This principle is derived from empirical observations and has been validated through numerous experiments and theoretical frameworks. </p><p>In practical terms, this means that energy can neither be created "out of nothing" nor spontaneously disappear. It exists in various forms, such as mechanical, thermal, electrical, chemical and nuclear energy. These forms can be converted into one another, but the total amount of energy remains constant throughout the process. </p><p>However, it's important to note that the law of conservation of energy applies to closed or isolated systems where no external energy sources or sinks are involved. In open systems, such as those interacting with their surroundings, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/cellular-energetics/cellular-energy/a/the-laws-of-thermodynamics#:~:text=An%20open%20system%20can%20exchange,with%20its%20surroundings%2C%20not%20matter.">energy can be exchanged with the environment</a>, leading to changes in the system's total energy. </p><p>For proponents, the trick behind the concept of an over-unity power generator is that it does not, in reality, break the law of conservation of energy. On the surface, it appears to be a closed system (i.e., one that powers itself and keeps itself running as well as producing excess energy). But many of whom believe such an invention is possible do not claim that the device creates energy out of nothing. They claim that, once the device is started, it is able to draw energy from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy">unproven source</a> and then use that energy to run itself forever as well as provide excess energy to be applied to some other useful purpose. </p><p>There have been many devices created that claim to be able to tap this “free energy” source, but to date, none of these devices has been empirically proven to work. However, there is a persistent notion that many of them do indeed work and that they are deliberately suppressed and withheld from the public. </p><h2>Are Over-Unity Devices Real?</h2><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_suppression_conspiracy_theory">Conspiracy theories surrounding the suppression of over-unity devices</a> suggest that powerful entities, such as governments, corporations and energy conglomerates, actively prevent the development and dissemination of such technologies due to economic interests, desire to retain power and control, national security concerns, patent and legal issues and other related reasons. </p><p>If the conspiracy theories are true, then these technologies are able to be suppressed because they rely upon third parties for protection. For example, inventors typically file for patents, presuming that patent law enforced by governments will enable them to monetize their inventions without fear of theft or exploitation by bad actors. </p><p>However, governments are made up of people, and people are subject to bribery, extortion, coercion and their own personal biases, as well as many other influences. The common denominator is trust. If you have to trust a third party, you are subject to the honesty, integrity, ability and resources of that party.</p><h2>Enter Bitcoin, A Unique Energy User </h2><p>Enter Bitcoin: the first technological discovery in human history specifically designed to resist and disincentivize violence.</p><p>The Bitcoin network has survived primarily because the only way to attack it is to turn it against itself. But the Bitcoin network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile_(book)">antifragile</a>: the harder it is attacked, the stronger it becomes and that includes attacks against itself! The only practical way to defeat it is via a 51% attack and, to date, there has never been a successful one carried out against the Bitcoin network. In fact, such an attack is so difficult and expensive that prospective attackers would benefit more by devoting the same resources to mining and spending bitcoin honestly. </p><p>As a result of this antifragility, the Bitcoin network has proven to be an extremely reliable way to convert energy to stored value. In a sense, Bitcoin is the equivalent of a battery that allows its users to retrieve nearly all of the energy provided to create/acquire it at any time in the future. In addition, due to its fixed supply of units, each unit will also capture <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2015/deflationary-technology-disruption-impact-money/">the deflationary effect of advancing technology</a>. The net result is that, in a way, users are able to take advantage of more energy in the future than what was required to create/acquire each unit at any given moment in time. </p><p>Therefore, the Bitcoin network effectively operates like an over-unity power generator by using the energy it receives from outside sources to run and protect itself as well as capturing additional outside energy over time. </p><p>Contrast this with the fiat system, which does claim to be able to break the law of conservation of energy by creating value out of thin air. But note that even the “strongest” fiat systems all require inflation to work for any period. Inflation is a euphemism for theft and all the users in such a system are participating in theft to one degree or another. The main benefactors are <a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect">those in charge of creating and distributing the monetary units</a>, but everyone who uses the system is counting on receiving some value from the productive efforts of others without having to contribute to those productive efforts themselves. For their own excess production, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham%27s_law">rational people will seek a means of saving rather than spending</a>. </p><p>Thus, <em>all</em> fiat systems eventually fail because they require energy stolen by means of fraud and coercion from actual producers and actual producers save as much of their productive efforts in more efficient systems (e.g., real estate and equities). Since no new energy is created by the system, and far less energy is put in than is taken out, the system eventually fails due to lack of energy. </p><p>This is how the Bitcoin network ultimately wins: People who produce value will see it as a better means of escaping the parasitical fiat system, thereby depriving it of energy and effectively starving it to death.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Kevin Melody.

The move from the $10 trillion asset manager stoked plenty of excitement and concerns alike from bitcoin proponents, with many championing the potential for massive inflows from legacy institutional investors, while others pushed back, citing the risks that such a product structure could pose to the bitcoin market. The introduction of such a product could bolster bitcoin’s profile among traditional investors, but it’s vital to understand the potential implications.</p><p>This article delves into the BlackRock proposal, comparing it with existing bitcoin investment vehicles, assessing the potential risks and benefits and drawing parallels with the introduction of liquid investment vehicles into the gold market, which many analogize as bitcoin’s monetary predecessor. The goal is to evaluate the implications of such a product on the broader bitcoin market and institutional adoption, while keeping in mind the principles that underpin the potential of bitcoin to serve as a global neutral reserve asset and settlement layer. </p><h4>BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust Proposal: An In-Depth Examination</h4><p>BlackRock's submission of an S-1 with the SEC marks a significant development in the bitcoin investment landscape. Although not an ETF in name, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust application bears striking resemblance to an ETF in function by allowing for daily subscriptions and redemptions, distinguishing it from existing bitcoin investment vehicles like Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>In contrast to the current leading bitcoin investment product, Grayscale’s GBTC, BlackRock's trust proposes an in-kind redemption feature. This means investors aren’t tied to selling their shares and creating a taxable event; instead, they can opt for withdrawing bitcoin from the trust. This circumvents the tax implications that Grayscale investors face when selling their shares for fiat and then purchasing bitcoin.</p><p>However, it’s important to note that the proposed in-kind redemptions come with a big caveat: Only BlackRock’s authorized participants, essentially investment firms in good standing with BlackRock, can withdraw bitcoin from the product. This implies that the benefit of in-kind redemptions is essentially restricted to large-scale investors and institutions. </p><p>The trust is slated to adopt the <a href="https://www.onrampbitcoin.com/newsletter/blackrock-creates-bitcoin-vehicle-half-good-half-terrible">grantor trust model</a>, aligning its structure closer to the likes of gold investment trusts. This implies that owning shares of BlackRock’s trust would, for tax purposes, equate to owning the underlying asset, e.g., bitcoin.</p><p>Questions start to arise regarding potential risks with BlackRock's proposed trust structure, particularly with the possibility of rehypothecation. A common practice among traditional asset ETFs, rehypothecation involves lending out assets to market participants. If extended to the Bitcoin Trust, it could lead to a situation where investors only have a claim to bitcoin that has been lent out, a situation that could lead to investors owning paper claims to bitcoin rather than the asset itself.</p><p>Furthermore, the proposal gives BlackRock considerable latitude in case of a Bitcoin fork, allowing them to determine which Bitcoin version to back. This opens up the possibility for potential manipulation and could present risks to investors who may not align with BlackRock’s decisions.</p><h3>The Current Landscape Of Bitcoin Investment Products</h3><p>Delving into the current landscape of bitcoin investment products, let’s focus on two leading vehicles: the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).</p><p>First, there’s the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which has long served as a primary avenue for legacy financial institutions to gain liquid exposure to bitcoin. Operating as a closed-end fund trading over the counter, GBTC saw billions of dollars flow into it over the years. The product carries a hefty 2% annual fee as a percent of net asset value and does not offer redemption back into bitcoin, thus creating a one-way street for supply. This structure was once very appealing to investors looking to exploit a seemingly automatic arbitrage trade, especially when the premium for GBTC shares reached as high as 40%, leading to a reflexive dynamic between inflows into the trust and demand for spot bitcoin.</p><p>However, this feedback loop reversed as demand for GBTC shares wavered when institutions began to attempt to unwind the arbitrage trades they had put on — meaning selling GBTC to realize the gain — which caused the premium to turn into a discount, with shares trading less than the net asset value of the bitcoin within the trust. The dislocation of GBTC from its net asset value alongside its inferior liquidity profile relative to spot bitcoin itself resulted in a market that liquidated all overleveraged participants who were using GBTC as collateral. </p><p>GBTC’s relatively high 2% annual fee has also come under scrutiny, especially as cheaper investment vehicles have emerged. As a result, GBTC shares came under immense pressure during the later months of 2021 and throughout 2022, with the discount to net asset value plummeting to almost negative 50%. </p><p>Besides GBTC, there is also BITO, which marked a significant milestone in the history of bitcoin investment products. As the first bitcoin-linked ETF available on a U.S. exchange, BITO opened the doors for investors to gain simple, indirect access to bitcoin exposure through a securitized ETF that has exposure to bitcoin futures contracts. However, as a futures ETF, BITO doesn't hold bitcoin directly. Due to the nature of futures contracts, the fund exposes investors to rollover risk, particularly when the futures curve is in contango — meaning futures prices are higher than current spot market prices — which causes their holdings to decay relative to the price of bitcoin over long periods of time. </p><p>Displayed below is the relative returns of GBTC and BITO shares against bitcoin since the launch of BITO, and since the start of 2020.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><h3>A Closer Look At BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust: Potential Implications &amp; Risks</h3><p>Given the intricate design of BlackRock’s Bitcoin Trust, its implications and potential risks raise serious concerns. There is an excellent post written by Allen Farrington, aptly named <a href="https://allenfarrington.medium.com/trust-me-bro-fb5a25964634">Trust Me, Bro</a>, which details some of the fine print and seemingly opaque risk models that an otherwise “bullish” ETF application from BlackRock contains. Below is a summary of some of his points in this section, but Farrington’s piece is well worth a read.</p><p>From a broader perspective, BlackRock’s trust could amass a considerable amount of Bitcoin, which isn’t necessarily a problem in and of itself, but bitcoin investors should pay close attention and remain vigilant of the possible second-order effects. BlackRock could in theory “sell bitcoin” to many financial institutions in the form of its iShares ETF, which is subject to rehypothecation and opaque ownership, unlike bitcoin UTXOs which exist on a transparent and immutable ledger. </p><p>Second, in terms of monopolistic pricing, it is likely that the existence of an ETF will place significant pressure on bitcoin exchanges, where the trading costs of an ETF are a mere few basis points compared to the rates of 50 bps to 100 bps charged by many exchanges for spot purchases. This could lead to consolidation of liquidity and put price-setting into the hands of BlackRock (or another entity with the dominant ETF).</p><p>In addition to accumulating a significant share of the circulating bitcoin and having a heavy hand in setting the price, BlackRock could create a narrative around any specific bitcoin that has yet to enter or has left the perceived safety net of the trust. This may look like spreading stories of dirty coins that could have been used by criminals, terrorists, drug dealers, etc., and would have a negative impact on fungibility of the asset because it would essentially create two tiers of bitcoin.</p><p>If BlackRock paints the picture of clean bitcoin within their trust versus the dirty bitcoin outside of it, they can then turn to banks to encourage opting into the trust’s version of Bitcoin since it will be viewed as “safe” from a regulatory perspective, further consolidating the ownership of bitcoin and allowing banks to offer their clients access to “bitcoin” which will actually be paper claims to the underlying asset as mentioned earlier.</p><p>Also within the trust filing is a section that provides BlackRock an option to choose the “appropriate network” should there be a time when Bitcoin faces an adversarial change in consensus and undergoes a hard fork. The filing specifies that BlackRock’s choice may not necessarily be in line with the most valuable fork. While this is likely a simple form of due diligence, by amassing a significantly large share of bitcoin that has the backing of equally large banking institutions and is held by a large portion of retail investors looking for simple exposure to bitcoin, it’s possible that BlackRock could instigate a hard fork or side with a consensus proposal that changes the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin which make it unique and valuable in the first place.</p><p>As mentioned above, there are also redemption concerns with the way this trust is structured. Only authorized participants, meaning investment firms, can withdraw bitcoin from the trust. Average, everyday investors will not be the ones able to redeem bitcoin from the trust in the first place, and since the authorized participants have to be in good standing with the firm, it’s possible that BlackRock could refuse redemptions — even to institutional investors.</p><p>All those concerns notwithstanding, there are historical examples of the creation of ETFs, namely gold, and their impact on the market.</p><h3>The Impact of Exchange-Traded Products: The GLD Analogy</h3><p>There’s many comparisons and contrasts between gold and bitcoin as investment vehicles. This article doesn’t dig into those but rather highlights the analogy and market impacts of a gold ETF in the past. By far, the biggest question of a bitcoin BlackRock ETF is: What does it mean for the price, market cap, liquidity, adoption, demand, etc.? This is not a new bitcoin-centric startup launching an investment vehicle, but rather the largest financial institution in the world that carries weight for market adoption in the age of passive investment vehicles.</p><p>For comparison, let’s look at the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), the largest gold ETF by assets under management (AUM) that started in 2004. It’s still one of the largest ETFs in the market today with $58 billion AUM. In November 2004, the <a href="https://www.spdrgoldshares.com/usa/historical-data/">ETF had over $1 billion in total asset value</a> in the first few days and then hit $50 billion by 2010.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Compared to many of the top ETFs in the market, GLD has been one of the best performing ETFs since its inception, only behind QQQ and Vanguard’s Growth ETF. This only accounts for looking at ETF performance since GLD’s start date as opposed to comparing similar start dates of other ETFs.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk5MTcyNjkzODE4NDE5MDg3/etf-performance.png" height="287" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>GLD is just one of a few large gold ETFs on the market. Total gold ETF products are estimated to have $220 billion in AUM as of last month. In 2022, gold in tonnes held by ETFs accounted for 1.66% of estimated above ground gold supply. A much larger share of gold supply, around 15%, resides in central bank reserves heavily dominated by the United States, Germany, Italy, France, Russia, China and Switzerland. </p><p>Obviously, it’s not easy to separate the impact of a widely adopted gold ETF on gold’s price over the last two decades, but it’s clear that the ETFs, even accounting for only a small amount of gold supply, have had a significant impact on the market. The GLD ETF was a major shift in how investors could purchase gold and essentially opened up gold buying to the masses while increasing gold market volumes and overall liquidity. In a limited way, there’s already been some of that impact via the GBTC trust with all its limitations. Compared to bitcoin today, GBTC’s 3.2% of circulating supply was a primary driver of bull market mania despite locking up only a small share of bitcoin supply. </p><p>Coupled with new narratives and a bit of gold mania into 2011, the GLD ETF was a key spark for a 350% rise over 6 years. Bitcoin is on a path to go through a similar shift where a more comprehensive ETF with more regulatory clarity will offer it to the masses, both institutional money and 401K or IRA style accounts. It’s not the self-custody bitcoin this publication advocates for, but it is a significant development in the market that many will likely opt for as it’s a market need for those wanting financial exposure to bitcoin on a larger scale, without the responsibility of holding their own keys.</p><p>But what about price suppression schemes, similar to the ones that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/jp-morgan-spoofing-penalty-idUSKBN26K325">big banks have historically used to tamper the price of gold</a>? Bitcoin’s design characteristics largely shield it from the type of price manipulation that traditional assets like gold have historically experienced. Unlike gold, whose physical nature makes it hard to verify, assay, secure and transport — leading to dependency on futures contracts that can be manipulated — bitcoin exists on a transparent and immutable ledger. </p><p>Furthermore, Bitcoin's digital nature and decentralized structure enable virtually cost-free and near instant settlement of transactions, which allows for manipulation and price dislocations in the futures market to be settled with ease compared to gold, which is much more costly to store and transport. Hence, the type of price suppression seen in the gold market is fundamentally challenging to replicate in the bitcoin market.</p><h3>Conclusion: The Future Of Bitcoin ETFs And The Path Forward</h3><p>After all of the Bitcoin ETF conflict and regulatory debate over the years, it’s becoming clear that BlackRock is likely a leading candidate to advance some sort of new bitcoin investment vehicle in the United States. The SEC’s delay in clarity and regulation over the years, all but seems part of a broader plan to get the market’s dominant bitcoin ETF investment option into the hands of one of America’s largest traditional finance institutions. Although other ETFs may get approved, it’s likely a winner-takes-all market or an oligopoly in terms of initial flows, competition and size of AUM.</p><p>Based on the standard procedural timelines, the best guess is that an ETF approval is on the horizon for sometime in early 2024. It’s a timely move as it will coincide in the same year as Bitcoin’s next halving. Ideally, this is the perfect time for institutional investors to get exposure to bitcoin while also playing into a gold-like-mania narrative, to drive increased market interest right before Bitcoin’s planned supply issuance schedule gets cut in half.</p><p>Although helpful for price and boosting institutional demand and access, be wary of the second- and third-order effects of this ETF. Wide adoption of BlackRock’s ETF, complete with bitcoin IOUs, will offer more paper bitcoin variants to emerge. This could lead to a small cohort of institutions having a significant impact on overall price and market liquidity because of the large size of their financial flows. Other effects may include rehypothecation, determining “clean” versus “dirty” bitcoin and influence of new institutions on future hard-fork scenarios. </p><p>In summary, this type of investment vehicle is an inevitable path for an asset that is gaining institutional adoption at the same time as the market expands with many others demanding bitcoin exposure. BlackRock is free to purchase bitcoin like anyone else. Ultimately, it’s up to the market to decide and create better bitcoin custody solutions over time that can outcompete pseudo-bitcoin ETFs and IOU-like products.</p><hr><p><em>That concludes the excerpt from a recent edition of Bitcoin Magazine PRO. </em><a href="https://bmpro.substack.com/subscribe"><em>Subscribe now</em></a><em> to receive PRO articles directly in your inbox.</em></p><figure>

Since then, central banks around the world have started operating a <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1969-1976/nixon-shock">fiat-based monetary system</a> with floating exchange rates and no currency standards at all. <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL">The money supply has been rising steadily ever since</a>. This forced market participants to look for ways to invest their money to protect against this inflation and one of the most popular investment assets has been real estate. </p><p>In the past, people owned real estate for its utility value, which is characterized by the fact that you can live on it or use it for production. Nowadays, however, it serves the world as the primary asset to store value. <a href="https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/two-reasons-real-estate-is-worlds-most-preferred-store-of-wealth/#:~:text=Over%2067%20percent%20of%20the">Around 67% of global wealth ($ 330T) is stored in real estate</a>. This has pushed up real estate prices enormously and, with that, the cost of housing and the cost of living.</p><h2>Home Value Change Vs. Income Change</h2><p>The <a href="https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/">chart</a> below shows the increase in wages in the U.S. from 1965 to 2021 compared to the increase in housing prices. It shows that real estate prices have risen excessively.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>As a result, it is no longer possible for most people to afford their own home. In addition, regulation and inflation have made construction significantly more expensive, for example, due to the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-esg-requirements-disrupting-office-investment-market/">increased building requirements because of so-called “ESG” guidelines</a> and the <a href="https://www.builderonline.com/data-analysis/building-material-prices-increase-14-3-on-year-over-year-basis_c">increase in raw material prices</a>. Property owners pass this price increase onto tenants in the form of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/28/how-much-higher-rent-will-go-in-2023-according-to-experts.html">increased rents</a>.<br></p><h2>From Utility To Speculation</h2><p>Real estate has become a speculative investment object because it is used as a store of value,<a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-tokenize-use-bitcoin"> </a>a former function of money that is no longer possible <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/dont-tokenize-use-bitcoin">due to decades of monetary inflation that has decimated peoples' purchasing power</a>.</p><p>The exorbitant increase in housing costs is one of the biggest problems of the fiat-based financial system because it has created a multitude of secondary problems. When the number-one store of value in the world, real estate, becomes increasingly expensive, and thus inaccessible, people can no longer save and plan for the future. When house prices and rents become increasingly expensive while money loses purchasing power, people can no longer afford adequate housing, leading to a deterioration in living standards.</p><p>In addition, aside from being used to store value, real estate is the most commonly used form of collateral in the traditional banking system. It is frequently used by a borrower to secure the repayment of a loan to a lender. Banks lend to people and institutions that own real estate. This has created an exclusive financial system as real estate has become unaffordable. In an inflationary environment where money loses value over time, it is a problem if most cannot borrow because saving is not an efficient way to accumulate capital. Debt becomes necessary to be productive. </p><p>These developments, which can be observed worldwide, are among the main drivers of wealth inequality. </p><h2>From Speculation To Utility </h2><p>Real estate should be reduced to its utility value as a dwelling or place of production, rather than used as a store of value by proxy if we ever hope to solve the growing gap in wealth inequality. Since bitcoin is a nearly perfect store of value, it offers a straightforward solution to the housing crisis. </p><p>The properties associated with bitcoin make it an ideal store of value. The supply is finite. It is easily portable, divisible, durable, fungible, censorship-resistant and noncustodial. Real estate cannot compete with bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin is rarer, more liquid, easier to move, harder to confiscate and cheaper to maintain. You don’t have to worry about daily maintenance, rent or repairs. It is easily accessible and cheap to store. </p><p>You can buy any amount large or small. You can self-custody bitcoin. All you need to store it safely is a basic computer without internet access and a BIP39 key generator - or a $50 hardware wallet. </p><p>People can buy bitcoin to store value instead of doing so through a home or rental property. As a result, real estate prices will fall and allow people to afford buying a home for its utility value. </p><h2>Bitcoin Presents A Solution</h2><p>As explained in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jssradfVJ4&amp;t=8s">recent episode of “The Hard Money Show,”</a> real estate has become a store of value in a world where fiat currencies are losing power, with many negative implications for society. But Bitcoin presents a solution.</p><p>As Bitcoin adoption increases, the money that would otherwise be invested in real estate, and some that is already invested in real estate, will flow into bitcoin. As pointed out above, this will make housing affordable.</p><p>By functioning as an actual store of value, bitcoin will absorb the monetary premium that real estate has accumulated over the past decades due to the broken monetary system. Under a Bitcoin standard, housing will eventually collapse to its utility value. The easy access to Bitcoin will create a financial system that is far more accessible than it is today. </p><p>Unfortunately, this will not solve the problem of rising rents in the short term. This is a structural problem of the fiat system. Due to the ever-increasing supply of money, it loses purchasing power over time and prices rise. However, as our financial system adjusts to a Bitcoin standard, deflation will cause prices to fall. </p><p>It should also lead to a more decentralized and less regulatory form of governance, as governments increasingly become service providers. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Leon Wankum.

The company’s decision to take steps to offer its clients exposure to the digital asset are likely to bring a surge of institutional adoption to the space.</p><p>The company also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1675926078177550336?s=20">resubmitted their filing</a> after the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/sec-demand-clarity-and-comprehensive-information-for-spot-bitcoin-etf">SEC responded</a> that the initial filings required more information in regards to the exchange’s involved, subsequently adding Coinbase to the filing, as other firms refiling did.</p><p>And now, BlackRock’s CEO, Larry Fink, has made an appearance on Fox Business where he <a href="https://twitter.com/Pledditor/status/1676684658086404106?s=20">stated</a> that the role of bitcoin and crypto is “digitizing gold.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation … or the devaluation of your currency … [bitcoin] can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,” Fink stated. The description reinforces the perception of bitcoin as a store of value, akin to the role gold has traditionally played in investment portfolios. By likening bitcoin to gold, Fink acknowledges the international nature of the digital asset, highlighting its potential as a global store of wealth — and indeed, during his news appearance, Fink further emphasized that, "Bitcoin is an international asset."&nbsp;</p><p>The televised statement underscores the conviction Fink, and likely BlackRock, have in bitcoin and its potential role in the future. Fink's recognition of bitcoin's international appeal further bolsters the case for increased institutional interest and investment.</p><p>BlackRock's pursuit of a Bitcoin ETF and Fink's endorsement of bitcoin as digitized gold reflect a notable shift in the attitude of major financial institutions toward bitcoin. These developments suggest that BlackRock, along with other industry giants, recognizes the potential of bitcoin to reshape the financial landscape.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTgzMjM5NTgzMDQxODU2OTMw/img_6139.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[With Nix, Bitcoin Projects Can Accelerate Contributions And Deployment]]></title><description><![CDATA[As a unique solution to software distribution, Nix can help Bitcoin projects garner more contributions, quicker deployment and better scaling.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-nix-can-accelerate-bitcoin-software</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-nix-can-accelerate-bitcoin-software</guid><category><![CDATA[Technical]]></category><category><![CDATA[Opinion]]></category><category><![CDATA[software]]></category><category><![CDATA[development]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[niftynei]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MzI5NzY4OTU4MTA5MzYx/bitcoin-code.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><em>This is an opinion editorial by niftynei, a developer educator who runs the Base58 Bitcoin protocol academy and an organizer of the upcoming, Nix-focused Bitcoin++ conference.</em></p><p>When you want to install a new app on your computer, where do you get it from?</p><p>Deciding which source to use is a problem that's surprisingly difficult to solve, but it's one that every computing platform struggles with. </p><p>Before the internet was widespread, new software “packages” were distributed on hard media, like CDs or USB sticks. If you wanted to get the latest version of your computer's operating system (OS) or the newest version of Bitcoin Core, for example, you'd need to buy it physically at the store or have it mailed to you. You'd then load the disk or USB stick into your computer, and make a copy of the new software onto your local disk.</p><p>As a developer writing code, you'd have to physically hand out copies of your programs to friends and family. Or you'd work for a large corporation that had relationships with companies and computer stores, which would figure out how to get the software you wrote distributed to their clients and customers.</p><p>With the advent of always-connected computers, the landscape of software distribution forever changed. Now, instead of having to physically pick up a copy of the bits in a program, you can easily download a copy of it from the internet.</p><p>This made it much easier for new developers to write apps that anyone can download. The problem now, however, is answering the question: Where on the internet should users download the new software from?</p><h2>The Hacker's App Store</h2><p>The way that mobile phone ecosystems solve the problem of new application distribution is through a program on your phone called the "App Store" (or the "Google Play store" on Android). </p><p>Developers upload the latest copy of their apps to either Apple's or Google's servers. Those companies then send out a silent notification to all of the phones that have the app installed, and the app gets updated in the background on users' phones, without the users’ involvement.</p><p>If you're a user and you want to add a new app to your phone, in most cases you'll be able to find it in the App Store, and download it from there.</p><p>But not all software is available as a mobile phone app. Some software projects are desktop apps or tools that developers use to write new pieces of software. These applications need a distribution channel too. On desktop operating systems, we tend to call the "App Store" software by the term "package managers." They manage the packages of software that you download onto your computer.</p><p>Modern package managers consist of a central server, sometimes called a repository, that can keep track of the latest version of the app, and a client-side application which runs on the package user's computer. </p><p>If you're a developer, you've probably run into “homebrew” or “apt-get install” somewhere in your life. “Homebrew” and “apt” are package managers.</p><p>In the way package managers work, the client-side application will check in with the central repository occasionally to see if there's any new updates for any of the currently-installed packages. Or, if you have the right OS and the right permissions set, maybe your computer will automatically run these checks, download and install the latest version of an app.</p><p>(As an aside, you can add other sources of software packages to your local package-manager client. If a developer self hosts their apps instead of uploading them to the central repository, you'd need to add their self-hosted website to the list of places to look for updates in your own package-manager client app.)</p><h2>What If We Could Reproduce Everything? </h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/nixbitcoinorg?lang=en">Nix</a> is a package manager that aims to bring reproducible builds to all of the packages that it helps to distribute.</p><p>Nix solves the problems with software distribution by keeping detailed track of all of the inputs to a build, uniquely identifying every input and using the same ones as the original builder did. This ensures it's able to build the same thing every time and on any machine.</p><p>Nix hashes every input and output of a build; this makes it easy to identify when an input has changed. When the inputs to a build change, the outputs are guaranteed to also change. </p><p>One big problem with reproducible builds is that different users will have different versions of the inputs that a program needs to be built with. Every new program that you build on your machine might need a different version of its input in order to be reproducible. </p><p>Nix fixes this by keeping track of builds by hash lists, and only using inputs that match the list of hashes it expects. The tradeoff is that Nix uses a lot more disc space and can often take a bit longer to download, as it'll need to download the correct inputs to a binary build process if you don't have them on your computer already.</p><p>I like to joke that Nix was only made possible thanks to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore's law</a>, which means that we now have enough extra disk space to not need to worry about having multiple copies of the same program, just in slightly different versions.</p><p>So, Nix makes it possible to distribute a reproducible build of your software much much more easily, which means that a user can reliably rebuild your software on their machine and have it just work, no questions asked.</p><p>As a small aside, note that what "reproducible" means for a Nix build is that "if a package works on one machine, it will also work on another." This isn't the same as the reproducibility that Bitcoin Core developers try to guarantee for official Bitcoin binaries, which <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-process.md#building">have a separate process</a> to check that they're bit-for-bit identical.</p><h2>Nix And Bitcoin</h2><p>Distributing open-source software in a way that's easy for end users to get running, and is reproducible on any system, is a very useful and important feature. It makes it easier for anyone to start using the project and also easier for new developers to start contributing back to the project.</p><p>A few years ago, a set of intrepid developers launched a repository of the most common Bitcoin software projects that are packaged up as Nix packages and modules.</p><p>Packages make it much easier for anyone using the Nix package manager to install and start running a Bitcoin node, on almost any architecture. You don't have to worry about installing the right dependencies before running the build commands, and the project will build from source on your own machine. It's pretty ideal in terms of quickly being able to download, build and run a Bitcoin node from scratch.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin">Nix-Bitcoin repository</a> provides Nix “modules,” which are configurations for software applications that are meant to work on <a href="https://nixos.org/">NixOS</a>. The Nix-Bitcoin modules allow anyone who's running NixOS to reproduce a build of Bitcoin Core and other Bitcoin open-source projects, and quickly get them running on their machines with minimal fuss.</p><p>In an interview for this article, Jonas Nick, one of the <a href="https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin/commits?author=jonasnick">lead maintainers of the Nix-Bitcoin project</a>, had the following to say about using the project:</p><p>"The main benefit that Nix-Bitcoin gets from Nix/NixOS is declarative config management. Configuring your system using the Nix programming language allows for abstraction, so you can modularize your logic to reuse and test individual components. This allows managing complexity, which inevitably occurs when building systems, and helps to build a correct and secure system. For example, a lot of the security features that Nix-Bitcoin provides would be very annoying to maintain if we didn't have the module system. Reproducibility in NixOS also helps a lot with updates, because we know exactly what is running on the systems of our users. Finally, with NixOS can also get errors at evaluation time instead of at runtime."</p><p>Bitcoin Core isn't the only project that's packaged up for distribution on Nix.</p><p>There's also Core Lightning, BTCPay Server and a number of other projects. For the most part, these projects are added and bundled up for distribution on Nix by fans of the Nix package-management system, not the developers who are writing the software. For a more complete list of available packages, check out the “modules” list in the <a href="https://github.com/fort-nix/nix-bitcoin#features">Nix-Bitcoin GitHub repository</a>.</p><h2>Why Not Nix Everywhere? </h2><p>If Nix is such a great change to the way that Bitcoin projects are built and shipped, why doesn't everyone use it? The truth is that Nix is a big project that's a bit difficult to get into. The learning curve for using Nix is quite steep, and the paradigm of running Nix as a package manager can be quite different than most are used to.</p><p>NixOS started as a research project by <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11773365">Eelco Dolstra in 2003</a>, and has slowly been building a following and user base since then. </p><h2>Bitcoin++ Berlin: Expanding The Use Of Nix In Bitcoin</h2><p>By organizing the upcoming <a href="https://btcpp.dev/berlin23">Bitcoin++ conference</a> in Berlin, we aim to change this. <a href="https://btcpp.dev/">Bitcoin++</a> is a developer-focused conference series which focuses on different topics in the Bitcoin developer space. Originally started in Austin, Texas, in 2022, the most recent conference in late April 2023 focused on Layer 2 technologies in Bitcoin, such as <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-ark-plans-to-scale-private-bitcoin-payments">Ark</a>, the Lightning Network</p><p>and validity rollups.</p><p>The upcoming Berlin conference, planned for October 6 and October 7, 2023, aims to be a “Nix-pilling” event for the Bitcoin developer ecosystem. The core maintainers of the Nix-Bitcoin project on Fort Nix will be in attendance (including Nick, Pavol Rusnak and Eric Sirion, to</p><p>name a few). The two-day event will be full of hands-on workshops and lectures</p><p>designed to teach developers from across the ecosystem about how to use Nix to package</p><p>their projects and better bundle their development dependencies so that new</p><p>contributors can start coding and contributing faster, as well as demonstrate how fast and easy it is to deploy software using modules on NixOS.</p><h2>Additional Article References</h2><ol><li><a href="https://blog.devgenius.io/reproducibility-with-nix-991ad466c92e">Reproducibility with Nix</a></li><li><a href="https://btctranscripts.com/stephan-livera-podcast/2020-07-26-nix-bitcoin/">Interview with “nixbitcoindev”</a></li><li><a href="https://nixos.org/learn.html">Where to start</a></li><li><a href="https://nickler.ninja/slides/2023-pizza.pdf">Why Nix-Bitcoin, for Bitcoiners</a></li></ol><p><em>This is a guest post by niftynei.

Then, <a href="https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-ordinals-a-beginners-guide-to-bitcoin-nfts">a late 2021 privacy upgrade</a> had the unintended consequence of allowing data storage on the Bitcoin blockchain, resulting in <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/quantifying-bitcoin-inscriptions-ordinals">NFT-like inscriptions</a> and BRC-20 tokens, both applying <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/concerning-ordinals">Ordinal Theory</a> for asset tracking. </p><p>The popularity of NFT-like Ordinal inscriptions and the experimental BRC-20 token standard has <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">driven up transaction costs</a> across the Bitcoin network. The frothy demand for “stamping” limited block space with new data pushed transaction costs so high that in May 2023, Binance twice <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/05/08/binance-pauses-bitcoin-withdrawals-for-the-second-time-in-24-hours/">had to pause BTC withdrawals</a>, a risky and undesirable step for a global exchange. To help manage the transaction costs, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/501886">announced it would start using the Lightning Network</a> — a decentralized, Layer 2 network designed for fast transactions bypassing the underlying Bitcoin blockchain— to process BTC withdrawals.</p><p>While some argue that Bitcoin should stick to being digital gold, I don’t see it that way. </p><p>As a store of value, bitcoin will continue to provide a trustless alternative to central banking; other uses of its immutable blockchain don’t diminish this function. On the contrary, emergent uses of the Bitcoin blockchain will drive more efficient use of the limited block space, leading to broad adoption of Lightning Network as a scaling solution for bitcoin as a global currency. The Lightning Network’s growth will provide a trustless alternative to centralized payment processors, expanding Bitcoin’s utility.</p><h2>Challenges Faced By BRC-20 Tokens</h2><p>The BRC-20 token standard is extremely new — <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-is-a-brc-20-token-standard-an-overview">created in March 2023</a>. If its name sounds familiar, that’s because it’s somewhat akin to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-erc20-and-what-does-it-mean-ethereum/">ERC-20 tokens</a> such as Shiba Inu and MakerDAO that run atop the Ethereum network. Whereas Bitcoin has traditionally been about storing and transmitting value, BRC-20s allow for other assets to be “minted” in an Ordinal inscription. Now, a slew of BRC-20s have popped up for trading and speculation, many in the form of meme tokens, from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/piza-brc-20/">PIZA</a> to <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/meme-brc20/">MEME</a>. As of June 26, 2023, the market cap for BRC-20 tokens was over $260 million, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/brc-20">according to CoinGecko</a>. </p><p>But all of this minting is driving bitcoin transaction costs higher. That’s not necessarily bad for bitcoin miners, who earn BTC by processing transactions. CoinDesk <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/08/ordinals-upend-bitcoin-mining-pushing-transaction-fees-above-mining-reward-for-first-time-in-years/">reported</a> in early May 2023 that some BTC miners were earning more by collecting transaction fees than they were by creating new BTC. That’s quite a lot, considering each block reward currently nets miners 6.25 BTC (worth roughly $188,000 at the time of writing).</p><p>As for whether this is good for users, that’s debatable. The average bitcoin transaction fee recently hit a two-year high, <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee">peaking at $30.91</a> on May 8, 2023, despite a bear market; those abstaining from BRC-20s are likely grumbling about increased fees. On the other hand, the introduction of the BRC-20 token standard has inspired deeper conversations about network scaling for Bitcoin.</p><h2>Already Making An Impact</h2><p>At the moment, BRC-20s lack some of the utility of their ERC-20 cousins. They don’t, for instance, use smart contracts, and their utility is mostly the same as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-are-pfp-nfts/">PFP NFTs</a>, leading many to argue they’re not worth the cost.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the demand for Bitcoin-based tokens is sustainable or whether such activity will get redirected to other, more permissive or centralized networks. </p><p>In one scenario, higher fees could force Bitcoin’s traditional users away from the network. This is unlikely. Bitcoin’s unchanging and conservative monetary policy remains the primary attraction; the network has no real competition in this regard as a hedge to monetary debasement.</p><p>But assuming Ordinal inscriptions and BRC-20 tokens show the same staying power as memecoins and NFTs on other networks — Shiba Inu, remember, has a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">market cap of $5 billion</a> and Bored Apes are virtually a household name — they will keep driving transaction fees above their historical average.</p><p>This could have long-term impacts on Bitcoin users.</p><p>In particular, higher transaction costs create a demand for more efficient transactions. While some of this can be done at a protocol level (e.g., <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit">SegWit</a>, the contentious 2017 upgrade to Bitcoin that enabled leaner transaction sizes by separating the signature data from the transaction data), much of it can come from scaling technologies on a second layer. </p><p>Enter: the Lightning Network, which batches transactions via long-term smart contracts and uses Bitcoin’s underlying security to allow fast and cheap payments.</p><h2>Future Solutions</h2><p>Lightning Network fees are extremely modest compared to on-chain counterparts. While the fees do fluctuate, the overall network fees have not increased as a result of BRC-20s or inscriptions. The network currently charges fees to reward network node operators. According to data available via Amboss’ Bitcoin Lightning Network analytics platform, the <a href="https://amboss.space/stats?params=eyJtZXRyaWMiOiJmZWVfcmF0ZV9tZXRyaWNzIiwiY2F0ZWdvcnkiOiJuZXR3b3JrTWV0cmljcyIsInN1Ym1ldHJpYyI6Im1lZGlhbiIsInRpbWVFbnVtIjoiMXkiLCJzY2FsZUVudW0iOiJBYnNvbHV0ZSJ9">median fee remains 0.002%</a>. Compare that to traditional payment networks, which charge <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/credit-card-processing-fees/">2% to 3%</a> of the payment amount every time you swipe your credit card.</p><p>The Bitcoin community is currently subsidizing the creation of the payment network, driving Lightning fees extremely low. Even with increased demand over time, sustainable fee rates for Lightning should grow to around 0.03%, based on less generous operator behavior.</p><h2>Primed To Become The Default Global Payments Processor</h2><p>The combination of Bitcoin monetary policy and Lightning’s transaction network is a potent one. Bitcoin has long presented itself as an alternative to a broken central banking system. But through competitive uses of its unforgivingly tight blockchain, the efficiency gained through Lightning transactions is more prescient than ever. </p><p>Though the Lightning Network has been years in the making, it is maturing at the perfect time — ready to enable billions of transactions across the network — and become the global de facto payment processor.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Jesse Shrader.

I've visited 45 countries, lived in nine and covered all continents except Antarctica.</p><p>After years of globetrotting, I thought that part of my life would have been over by now. But just when I began to feel the desire to settle down and set roots, something happened: I discovered Bitcoin. My life, then, was radically changed. Not only has it transformed my worldview, but it's also reignited a fire in me to keep moving and seek out people who have gone through the same awakening. </p><p>Combining my passions for adventure and hard money, I've recently begun to focus on visiting emerging Bitcoin circular economies across the globe. From helping me save time and money to making me feel more protected and connected with the people I meet along the way, using Bitcoin has been a game changer for my travel experiences. </p><p>In this piece, I discuss how Bitcoin has helped me fix common money issues known to travelers everywhere and how it's made my journeys more special in multiple ways. </p><figure>

    </figure><h2>Bitcoin Helps Travelers Save Time</h2><p>If I had a sat for every time I've had to deal with payment-related issues in a foreign country, I'd have a big enough stack to make Michael Saylor jealous. Whether it was finding a currency exchange with decent rates, looking for a store that accepted my cards or calling my bank to resolve credit card issues, I've wasted so much precious time on these problems that just thinking about them frustrates me.</p><p>In a few scenarios, it's even resulted in the disruption of my itinerary and a significant dose of anxiety, as when it happened during a trip to a remote island in the Philippines in 2015. Though I had a great time, it wasn't long before I found myself running out of cash, with no ATMs and no currency exchange offices in the area. Ultimately, I was saved by the only Western Union office in town — when it finally opened two days after my crisis began.</p><p>Had the locals and I known about Bitcoin then, my journey would have gone as planned, and my stress levels would have remained stable the entire time. </p><p>Fast forward eight years, and I returned to the Philippines, but this time, my experience with money matters was much better. Why? Because I chose the island of Boracay, <a href="https://thechainsaw.com/business/bitcoin-island-boracay-philippines/#:~:text=Not%20only%20can%20tourists%20pay,local%20currency%2C%20the%20Philippine%20Peso.">also known as “Bitcoin Island,”</a>&nbsp;as my destination. </p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTg3NDc1NTAxMTk3MjY4/paying-with-bitcoin.png" height="371" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>Thanks to the many merchants now accepting Philippine pesos via the Bitcoin Lightning Network rail, I was able to deal with all payments digitally. This prevented me from wasting time dealing with cash, ATMs and currency exchange offices and allowed me to do more of what I wanted to do: enjoy the island. </p><p>Bitcoin has helped me save time. </p><h2>Bitcoin Helps Travelers Save Money</h2><p>As a backpacker, I was always very conscious of my budget. Street food, hostels and overnight bus rides were my bread and butter, but one thing I could never avoid was those unwanted and often unexpected expenses that come with the territory. </p><p>Think of credit card fees, which, in Guatemala, <a href="https://www.frommers.com/destinations/guatemala/planning-a-trip/money">can cost up to 10%</a>, and ATM fees which, in Thailand, <a href="https://www.thethailandlife.com/atm-thailand#:~:text=Withdrawal%20fees&amp;text=The%20large%20majority%20of%20banks,per%20transaction%20(approximately%20%244.50).">can amount to $6 per withdrawal</a> for foreign bank cards plus your bank fees. Even currency exchange rates are costly, as I have found that they generally charge 10% for their services. These small numbers may not seem like much, but they add up quickly, which means a lot for someone traveling on a budget.</p><figure>
        <img src="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTg3NDc1NTAxNTI0OTQ4/bitcoin-accepted-here.png" height="371" width="620">
        
        
        
    </figure><p>But that has never been an issue when visiting Bitcoin communities. That's because the only fees involved in bitcoin payments are transaction costs, which are often negligible or non-existent. And I've also enjoyed the benefits beyond these hotspots, as many businesses nowadays offer a discount if you pay in bitcoin. If you've ever bought tickets to a Bitcoin conference, you might know what I'm talking about. </p><p>Bitcoin has helped me save money. </p><h2>Bitcoin Enhances Travelers’ Safety</h2><p>Whenever I share tales of my solo adventures, the topic of safety always comes up. While street smarts and wise decisions have helped me avoid real danger, I've had to deal with a different kind of unpleasantness multiple times: fraud. </p><p>In Vietnam, I got scammed by a taxi driver with fake Vietnamese dong notes. In Bali, my travel card was cloned, and I only found out when the culprits tried to withdraw money in the middle of the night. To this day, I have no idea how they did it. And I've lost track of how many times I felt my heart racing while using an ATM in a questionable location or at odd hours of the day or night and walking away with three days’ worth of cash in my bag.</p><p>Navigating exclusively on Bitcoin eliminates all of those concerns for me. And it makes perfect sense. When you're not dealing with cash, ATMs or credit cards, your risks are minimized, and your peace of mind is maximized. </p><p>My only goal is keeping my phone safe, though even if I lose it, I can still access my funds by recovering my wallet on a new device. That's why it's important to back up your seed phrase, people!</p><p>Bitcoin has enhanced my safety.</p><h2>Bitcoin Makes Traveling More Meaningful</h2><p>Poverty, weakening currencies and countless unbanked individuals are some of the biggest afflictions that developing countries face today. Call it selfish or exaggerated, but paying locals for their goods and services in bitcoin feels more rewarding than giving them pieces of paper that are guaranteed to lose value.</p><p>During a visit to Bitcoin Lake in Guatemala, for instance, it was wonderful to see how many merchants in the local market accepted bitcoin. It allowed them to attract more customers, make more sales and prompted more conversations about the significant changes they've gone through since using bitcoin as money.</p><p>Being able to pay hard-working people in Bitcoin feels more authentic and makes for a more memorable exchange and bonding experience. It renders tourism more meaningful and worth all the time and effort that goes into planning a trip to these unique places around the world. </p><p>Bitcoin has made my travels more meaningful.</p><p>Needless to say, my travel experience hasn't been the same since I discovered Bitcoin. Understanding money and its profound effects on every aspect of our lives has significantly changed the way I look at the world and walk through life everywhere I go. </p><p>As an avid wanderer, I want to see more places embrace Bitcoin in the future. It will help empower the communities, boost the economies and attract the attention of Bitcoiners like myself, who will want to encourage and support them in any way they can. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by HodlingCarla.

In the realm of Bitcoin heresy, before you prepare to hang me from the gallows for that statement, permit me to express my final thoughts. Allow me to provide a brief introduction — I am not a galaxy-brained, shadowy super coder. I must admit to my relative ignorance in the fields of computer science and cryptography. I do not work within the Bitcoin industry. Instead, I am an ordinary pleb, toiling away in construction to make ends meet, striving to maintain humility and gain a comprehensive understanding of the true nature of Bitcoin. So, why do I say that Bitcoin must change?</p><p>Let us commence by reflecting upon the adage, "Not your keys, not your coins," which resounds as one of the loudest mantras in the Bitcoin community, and rightfully so. When your private keys are held by a centralized exchange or custodian on your behalf, you effectively surrender control over your funds. This situation introduces counterparty risk, as you become reliant on the security practices and integrity of the third party entrusted with your keys.</p><p>The philosophy underlying "not your keys, not your coins" aligns with the broader principles of decentralization and censorship resistance. These principles seek to empower individuals with financial sovereignty and eliminate the necessity for intermediaries. It underscores the significance of personal responsibility, security and self-reliance in this digital era where governments increasingly employ technology as a tool for controlling individuals.</p><p>Now, you may ask, what is the issue at hand? Well, the truth of the matter is that, under the current implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, self custody does not scale. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts choose not to critically analyze this reality. However, we cannot ignore the consequences of ignoring reality. </p><p>Recently, the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoins-high-fees-create-controversy-and-challenges">BRC-20 minting issue</a> thrust this challenge into the spotlight within the community. The event triggered an explosion in the base layer fee market, resulting in exorbitant costs to confirm transactions. Regardless of your opinion on BRC-20, the incident provided us with a glimpse of the future if the network continues to expand. Try to envision, in all honesty, the exacerbation of this situation with 8 billion users. As activist Anita Posch pointed out <a href="https://twitter.com/AnitaPosch/status/1655459803957739520?t=vheLiKcJZV5pMnemaWokrA&amp;s=09">in this tweet</a>, custodial solutions would become the only means of onboarding new network participants. While there are <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/fedimint-adds-new-bitcoin-custody-solutions">federated protocols aiming to disintermediate custodial risk by spreading it among multiple custodians</a>, this solution remains fundamentally different from self custody.</p><p>Recently, human rights activist Alex Gladstein <a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1662128272975745024?t=41V9ClnVRMa7f2s7S3WTvQ&amp;s=09">posed a thought experiment focused on this issue</a>:</p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1662128272975745024"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>To my dismay, over 54% of respondents to his scenario deemed it a success. This sentiment is perilous, as such a scenario undermines Bitcoin's ethos of self sovereignty and censorship resistance. It may not come as a surprise, though; this poll may indicate that more people prioritize "number go up (NGU)" over individual liberty.</p><p>Whenever the scaling issue arises, a common response is to invoke the notion that Bitcoin scales in layers, and that the base layer can ossify while additional layers facilitate the onboarding of the global population. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_trollz/status/1663640665056485376?t=4W29G5__Hr04xZ93lFFlWQ&amp;s=09">as Shinobi reminds us</a>, "Layer two is not a magic incantation. For layer twos to optimize and improve, new functionality on the base layer is required. Layer twos are literally just things built on the functionality of layer one. The limitations of layer two are a direct result of layer one limits."</p><p>Accepting this reality can be daunting, especially for individuals like myself who are not computer science majors or cryptographers. We adore Bitcoin, and the prospect of change can be intimidating because we are unaware of what we don't know. There is a non-zero possibility that any alteration could lead to Bitcoin's failure. Consequently, many of us stubbornly dig our heels into the sand and advocate for the ossification of the base layer to ensure, in our minds, that Bitcoin remains intact.</p><p>If you, like me, believe that "not your keys, not your coins" should be an option for all participants in the network, present and future, we must embrace Bitcoin's malleability before it is too late. In the <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1622593393036611585?t=0vUtwlo7p7hbnCQ-MteRpw&amp;s=09">words of Jameson Lopp</a>:</p><blockquote><p>"Bitcoin is sound money. But it's not just digital gold. Bitcoin is programmable money. Unlike gold, it is a technology that can be upgraded. We need not throw that property out the window. There is still much about Bitcoin that can be improved without violating its soundness... The nature of how network protocols ossify means that the changes necessarily must happen earlier rather than later; it becomes impossible to coordinate changes once a protocol is adopted at a mainstream level.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>And to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/should-we-be-worried-about-bitcoin-ossification/?sh=73256e762b6a&amp;s=09">quote Lopp once again</a>:</p><blockquote><p>“Ossification is a side effect of growth, not an explicit decision unto itself. There is no way to really know when we’ve gone too far until newly proposed changes simply cease to gain any traction. Now, the real problems of ossification become clear: once we cross an invisible line in the future, Bitcoin will be ‘set’ as it is, with no more updates practically possible.</p><p>“Before this happens, developers and users need to think about what Bitcoin’s ultimate code base should look like. We can see from past debates surrounding things like the SegWit fork that bitcoiners are both divided and passionate about many issues, and there’s almost certainly no answer to this question that everyone will agree on. This is, of course, part of the problem driving ossification in the first place.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Only time will reveal whether we have already crossed that invisible line of base-layer ossification. However, until that day arrives, it is crucial for all users who cherish Bitcoin for its properties of self sovereignty and censorship resistance, as well as its potential to truly separate money from the state, to embrace changes with an open mind.

Fiat food, fiat jobs… and fiat athletes. In this article, I introduce ideas about what it means to be a Bitcoin athlete — an archetype that I seek to embody in my professional pickleball career and a template for the 21st century professional athlete. </p><h2>Fiat Athletes Vs. Bitcoin Athletes</h2><p>Fiat athletes compete to earn fiat money. They store their time and energy (aka, their wealth) in manipulated money that steals from them, they trust companies not to censor them and they often live high time preference lifestyles. </p><p>Bitcoin athletes are a new breed of elite, professional athletes. Bitcoin athletes store their wealth in sound money that protects them from theft, they leverage decentralized protocols like Nostr to create uncensorable, peer-to-peer relationships with their fans, they embody Bitcoin values and they live a low time preference lifestyle. </p><p>Fiat athletes build digital identities on platforms created by companies that have the ability to censor what they say and that divide them from their fans. Bitcoin athletes build digital identities on open-source protocols that can’t censor what they say. These protocols enable Bitcoin athletes to connect directly with their fans. </p><p>Fiat athletes trust banks to hold their money and leak energy with every exchange between fiat currencies when traveling to different countries. Bitcoin athletes hold their own money and conserve energy by using global money when traveling to compete. </p><p>Fiat athletes trust politicians to maintain monetary integrity. Bitcoin athletes run nodes and verify that the monetary policy of Bitcoin is enforcing a 21 million supply cap. </p><p>Fiat athletes live fiat lifestyles and propagate fiat values to their fans. Bitcoin athletes live Bitcoin lifestyles and propagate the values of the Bitcoin protocol to their fans — the values of truth, freedom and personal responsibility. </p><p>Fiat athletes live at the mercy of banks and politicians who control their money and the companies who control their financial sponsorship. Bitcoin athletes are sovereign and without masters. Their money is governed by mathematics and they are directly supported by their fans, who zap them sats at the speed of light. </p><p>Fiat athletes are motivated by fame and fiat riches. Bitcoin athletes are motivated by the mission to spread financial literacy to 8 billion people on earth and unlock unprecedented peace and human flourishing. Bitcoin athletes play for a purpose beyond money. They’re playing to save the money. </p><p>Fiat athletes use centralized money, centralized social media and centralized sponsorship models. They have relationships with intermediaries (banks, platforms and companies) that have the power to censor or control them if they don’t tow the line. Bitcoin athletes use decentralized money, decentralized social media and decentralized sponsorship models. They use protocols in order to restore direct relationships with their fans and reduce (or eliminate) their reliance on banks, platforms and companies. </p><h2>Winning With Bitcoin</h2><p>I believe a Bitcoin world will forge Bitcoin athletes, this new type of professional athlete who is financially energized directly by their fans, lives in alignment with values of the Bitcoin protocol and uses their influence to improve financial literacy and fix the money. The elite athlete of the 21st century will build their career on Bitcoin and be powered by the Lightning Network. </p><p>As a professional pickleball player, I’m on a mission to demonstrate this new template myself. I seek to master my sport by testing myself against the best pickleball players in the world and I play for Bitcoin. </p><p>Part of my mission as a Bitcoin athlete is to help fiat athletes make the jump over to a Bitcoin world, to help them understand Bitcoin and secure their bits of information in cyberspace (property, identity, data, etc.) with encrypted energy. That process often begins with me sending them 21 sats after a game so they can experience the magic of Bitcoin firsthand and then helping them set up a Nostr account so that fans can directly support them financially. </p><p>I believe the professional athletes of the 21st century will be powered by Bitcoin. They will connect directly with their fans with zaps and will store their life energy in scarce, digital, encrypted money. They will run nodes, share proof of work and connect with fans on Nostr. They will be uncensorable, unstoppable and sovereign in their quest to financially support their careers. </p><p><em>This is a guest post by Obiwan Satoshi.

The VLS solution, an open-source Rust library and reference implementation, separates a user's private keys from their Lightning node, providing an extra layer of protection against potential compromises and theft of funds. According to the announcement, VLS offers a level of security unmatched by other solutions in the ecosystem.</p><p>"We're thrilled to announce the VLS beta release, a major step forward for Lightning network security, and we're excited to share it with developers and companies in the Bitcoin ecosystem," stated the VLS team. They encouraged developers and companies to try out the VLS Beta release, participate in the feedback process and test the software with sample CLN or LDK nodes to help enhance the security of the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p><p>The VLS beta release introduces various features designed to safeguard against malicious nodes and enhance user protection. These features include working with CLN and LDK, encrypted cloud state backup, disaster recovery capabilities, a complete set of Layer 2 and Layer 1 validation rules, heartbeat generation and an allowlist for approved destinations. However, it's important to note that while VLS is secure against common ways of stealing user funds, it may not cover all possible scenarios of fund loss. Therefore, the team advises running VLS in testnet or with limited funds until the production release.</p><p>VLS provides a unique approach to Lightning Network security by sequestering private keys and secrets in hardened policy signing devices. The reference implementation in Rust ensures that proposed transactions are safe to sign by applying a comprehensive set of validation rules. By incorporating UTXO Set Oracles to provide proofs of unspent UTXOs, VLS offers additional protection even in the case of a complete compromise of the node software.</p><p>Looking ahead, the VLS roadmap includes plans to run signers on platforms with limited resources, improve performance for embedded processors, and add features such as extended BOLT-12 support and VSS integration. Additionally, the team aims to enable the use of multiple signers using multi-sig with Lightning keys, pending the maturity of key protocols like Taproot, MuSig2 and FROST.</p><p>The VLS beta release represents a significant advancement in securing the Bitcoin Lightning Network and holds promise for developers, companies and users seeking enhanced protection for their funds within the network.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTg5ODk5NzMzNTMwMDYwNTQy/20220601_btcfinal_best-protected--a-computer-for-bitcoin-transactions-installing-linux-mint---arman-parman.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Is Proof Of Work?

Then they apply a cryptographic hash function of the previous block's header to the new block. Finally, they try to solve the proof-of-work problem. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/who-created-bitcoin">Satoshi Nakamoto</a> adopted a proof-of-work (PoW) <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-nakamoto-consensus-bitcoin">consensus mechanism</a> to resolve the Byzantine Generals' Problem, establishing a transparent and objective protocol.</p><h2>What Is Proof Of Work (PoW)?</h2><p>Proof of work is literally proof that work has been done to validate the network’s transactions and generate new bitcoin. It is the consensus mechanism and algorithm that uses computing power to verify transactions and add them to the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-bitcoin">Bitcoin blockchain</a>. Such a mechanism allows the Bitcoin network to be trusted and remain decentralized. </p><p>PoW resolves the Byzantine generals' problems, which may fail a distributed computer system for different reasons, not only of malicious nature, but perhaps a software defect, a hardware malfunction, or a well-coordinated attack by a bad actor. They can all be difficulties that prevent nodes from reaching consensus on distributed networks. </p><p>The Byzantine Generals’ Problem is only common to decentralized systems, where it’s more difficult to come to an agreement. </p><p>Bitcoin resolves the Byzantine Generals’ Problem by providing a way to communicate and transfer value safely without the need to trust one another through a network of nodes that agree on the truth before it is timestamped. Once one node has recorded a transaction, a copy is propagated to all other nodes in the network. PoW was created to achieve this objective. </p><h3>Why Is Proof Of Work Important?</h3><p>Proof of work is often misunderstood or underestimated, as many consider it a wasted effort on a poor system design; they claim that entering a transaction on any other digital ledger could be made instantly and with no effort. This is why proof of work is necessary for the ledger’s security and how it prevents any one party from compromising it. The effort is not wasted however, if it empowers a network to be an alternative to the current monetary system and its various flaws.</p><p>The significance of proof of work lies in its ability to serve as a tangible expense for generating bitcoin and safeguarding its credibility. It would be exorbitant to execute a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network with the intention of creating counterfeit coins or carrying out deceitful Bitcoin transactions. If any entity tries to compromise the Bitcoin network, it would have to redo all previous proof of work quickly enough to outpace the network's continuous proof of work. For this reason, Bitcoin has <a href="https://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/">unforgeable costliness</a> characteristics and is immutable since it is nearly impossible to change confirmed transactions.</p><p>To maintain stability in the proof-of-work system, Nakamoto implemented a simple yet genius solution referred to as the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which regulates the difficulty level of discovering a new block every 10 minutes. This is crucial to prevent the discovery of new blocks from happening too quickly as more miners join the network. It also ensures that the mining process does not become too slow if the mining activity drops. </p><h3>Proof Of Work Versus Proof Of Stake</h3><p>We’ve seen how <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-why-bitcoin-wont-change">PoW is a good use of energy</a> to secure Bitcoin while forcing everyone to adhere to the same fixed rules, including the interdiction to issue more bitcoin to increase the supply.</p><p>The security difference between the two consensus mechanisms holds great importance. Proof of work requires energy consumption to ensure that Bitcoin maintains its position as the most secure network worldwide, whereas proof of stake (PoS) does not resolve the problem of possible interference from malicious entities. Instead, PoS sacrifices security for scalability, making it a faster blockchain, albeit one that cannot be trusted. Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism is expensive, and motivates participants to only publish truthful information. </p><p><a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/proof-of-stake">Proof of stake</a> is the consensus mechanism for most altcoins, digital penny stocks, and other Ponzi schemes marketed as alternatives to bitcoin. Its consensus mechanism works through “staking,” which requires investors to lock the chosen protocol’s tokens into the system so that the token cannot be spent. However, the higher the number of tokens staked, the higher the chance of validating a block of transactions. </p><p>Considering that most altcoin tokens are issued to insiders and developers before they became publicly available, it’s easy to figure out how poorly decentralization is designed in proof-of-stake networks.</p><p>The primary differences between the two mechanisms are highlighted here:</p><h4>Proof Of Work</h4><ul><li>Validation is performed by a network of miners</li><li>Competitive nature uses lots of energy and computational power to determine the probability of finding a new block</li><li>Proof of work has a real-world physical cost to production, which insulates the network from attack</li><li>There is an economic and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-a-net-benefit-to-the-environment">environmental advantage to proof of work</a></li></ul><h4>Proof Of Stake</h4><ul><li>Validation is done by participants who offer their tokens as collateral</li><li>Less energy is used, but the amount of stake or number of coins determines the probability of validating a new block</li><li>Proof of stake has no real-world cost of production, which leaves the network vulnerable to attack</li><li>There is <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">no environmental advantage to proof of stake</a></li></ul><p>In proof of stake, it’s easy to acquire a 51% stake and then change the rules of the protocol to one’s benefit, and relatively straightforward to censor network participation and activity, such as declining a person or entity's transactions by not including them.</p><h2>How Proof Of Work Works</h2><p>Proof of work was previously achievable using central processing units (CPUs) and graphic processing units (GPUs). However, due to the vast amount of electricity required, it can now only be performed using specialized computers operated by miners, known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).These serve to input transaction data, information from the previous block header, and a nonce (random number) to guess the result of hash functions. </p><p>Hash functions are mathematical functions. In Bitcoin, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/how-mining-protects-the-bitcoin-network">SHA-256 is the hash function algorithm</a> that transforms your input data — anything that can be represented in ones and zeros — into the output, a string of 64 characters, which will be unique and perfectly correlated to the input data.</p><p>From how it works, it is impossible to figure out a resulting output from a publicly visible input other than through expensive ASIC-generated rapid guessing. </p><p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">miners want to optimize their work</a>. To be profitable, they must increase the number of hashes (or guesses) per second that their devices can produce while using the cheapest and most reliable energy source.</p><p>Bitcoin’s difficulty adjustment makes mining an even more competitive industry.<em> </em>In simple terms, proof of work is similar to buying lottery tickets with a prize draw every 10 minutes. The more tickets you buy, the greater the statistical likelihood of winning the lottery. In ASIC terms, a Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro can operate at 104TH/s, which basically means 104 trillion guesses, or tickets, per second.</p><p>Due to the increased competition, it's become harder for individual or solo miners to mine bitcoin since 2012, when ASICs became necessary. Yet, they can now join a mining pool to increase their chances of getting rewarded with bitcoin, though the funds would be split among the pool members. </p><h2>Advantages And Disadvantages</h2><p>Proof of work is necessary to keep Bitcoin secure, immutable, and always decentralized. Here are the primary benefits and drawbacks of Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism.</p><h3>Advantages </h3><ul><li>Decentralization, i.e., the real breakthrough of the technology</li><li>Censorship resistant, as a result of decentralization</li><li>Immutability, the blockchain is nearly impossible to reverse</li><li>It’s a fair and objective system based on robust protocol rules and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-rules-are-enforced-by-physics">laws of physics</a></li><li>High level of security: PoW economically incentivizes miners to protect the network</li><li>Carbon and methane capture: Bitcoin exploits wasted energy to issue more coins and verify transactions</li><li>By monetizing energy, PoW speeds up the rollout of renewable energy networks, and also improves load balancing on existing grids, making them more efficient and secure</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul><li>Slower transaction speeds</li><li>Mining expenses (OPEX &amp; CAPEX) are very high but necessary for proof of work</li><li>PoW consumes a lot of energy, but this has been <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-is-a-net-benefit-to-the-environment">proven to encourage</a> innovation in renewables and wasted energy exploitation</li></ul><h2>Criticism Of Proof Of Work</h2><p>Criticism of Bitcoin's energy consumption is common. Since Bitcoin requires a substantial amount of energy to protect the network, proof of work is an easy attack vector by those whose interests are more aligned with the pre-existing fiat financial system. </p><p>However, the widespread narrative fails to acknowledge that Bitcoin is, in reality, driving innovation in the technology that generates clean energy and exploits wasted energy.</p><p>How? Bitcoin miners need to find the most cost-effective energy sources to be profitable. As a result, affordable energy for Bitcoin mining is increasingly coming from renewables, as well as from wasted and "stranded" energy sources, rather than relying on fossil fuels.</p><h3>Renewables</h3><p>Since renewables — primarily wind and solar — are among the cheapest energy sources, Bitcoin miners are incentivized to subsidize their innovation, to the benefit of everyone.</p><p>Many misunderstand that energy consumption doesn’t directly produce carbon dioxide emissions, but the source may. The effect on carbon emission comes from energy production, not consumption. </p><h3>Wasted Energy</h3><p>Flared natural gas is an example of wasted energy: To avoid the high costs of transporting natural gas from remote locations, oil companies that produce it are recommended to either release the gas into the atmosphere or literally “flare” it to limit environmental impact. However, flaring it safely also has a cost, and if gas drillers could use a gas generator to power Bitcoin miners, that wasted energy is turned into good usage — producing bitcoin!</p><h3>Stranded Energy</h3><p>As Bitcoin mining operations can be located anywhere in the world, they are increasingly attracted to “stranded” energy, which is often too remote for populated areas, like ocean currents or desert sun. <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/profiting-on-biogas-with-bitcoin-mining">Biogas is another such option</a>, which produces reliable energy, but is oftentimes not connected to the grid. </p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><p>How is the difficulty level of the proof-of-work problem determined?</p><p>Depending on how many hashes per second are mining on the network, the hash function’s complexity will increase or decrease accordingly so that it takes miners an average of 10 minutes to find a new block across the global network.</p><p>Can brute force solve the proof-of-work problem?</p><p>The only way to resolve the proof-of-work problem is through brute force, a general problem-solving technique, and an algorithmic paradigm that searches all the possible solutions to a given problem before finding the most satisfactory one.</p><p>What happens to proof of work when all the bitcoin has been mined?</p><p>When all the bitcoin has been mined, proof of work will still be needed for validating transactions, for which miners will receive a fee.</p><p>Are there any viable alternatives to proof of work?</p><p>To produce a decentralized, immutable, censorship-resistant, secure cryptocurrency like bitcoin, there is no secure alternative to proof of work.</p><p>What happens if two miners solve the proof of work problem for the same block simultaneously?</p><p>The block that appears in the longest chain will be chosen, which is the one that has the “greatest combined difficulty” of the hashes used and took the most computational power to create it. </p><h2>The Final Word </h2><p>Purposely misleading politicians and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/greenpeace-intensifies-campaign-against-bitcoin-after-ethereum-merge">organizations</a> have an advantage in criticizing Bitcoin’s proof of work and financing projects to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/white-house-condemns-energy-use-of-mining-bitcoin">discredit Bitcoin</a> for its energy consumption. The advantage is to keep the current system as it is, beneficial to them, under the disguise that Bitcoin is wrong and harmful to humanity and the Earth.</p><p>Bitcoin is disruptive; it’s the hope humanity needs and must be discovered and understood to be fully appreciated. Proof of work is necessary to empower the transition to a new monetary system and a different world, and the effort required to produce it makes it even more worthy.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk5MDMyNTU3MDg4NTQ4NjI1/proof-of-work-feature-image-w_text.png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sabre56 Partners With Arkon Energy For Ohio Data Center Consultancy Deal]]></title><description><![CDATA[Leading hosting provider Sabre56 deepens its strategic partnership with Arkon Energy, consulting on their new Ohio data center acquisition.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sabre56-partners-with-arkon-energy-for-ohio-data-center-consultancy-deal</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/sabre56-partners-with-arkon-energy-for-ohio-data-center-consultancy-deal</guid><category><![CDATA[Data Center]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mining]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jun 2023 14:36:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTkzNTEyMTIxODA2MzY2MTQ3/bitcoin-code.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p><a href="https://www.sabre56.com/">Sabre56</a>, a leading hosting provider and Bitcoin and digital asset mining consultancy, has signed a consultancy deal with <a href="https://www.arkonenergy.com/">Arkon Energy</a> for the management of Arkon's recently acquired data center in Hannibal, Ohio.

In a recent hearing at the Senate Banking Committee, she cited <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/chinese-businesses-fueling-the-fentanyl-epidemic-receive-millions-in-cryptocurrency-payments">a report</a> from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, indicating that digital currencies, particularly bitcoin, are being used to fund the fentanyl trade in China. But this is a clear obfuscation of the facts and a willful disregard for concepts in logic. </p><p>Let's put this into perspective: Any technology can be used for good or ill but we do have a responsibility to address and mitigate any potential misuse. The proportion of illicit transactions in digital assets is actually quite small compared to the overall transaction volumes. </p><p><a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/2022-crypto-crime-report-introduction/">According to Chainalysis</a>, illicit transactions made up only 0.15% of all cryptocurrency transactions in 2021, down from 0.62% in 2020. In comparison, <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">according to the UN</a>, it is estimated that annual money laundering amounts to 2% to 5% of global GDP. Furthermore, the Chainalysis report argues that the transparency of blockchain technology allows for better analysis and tracking of illicit activity compared to traditional financial systems. </p><p>So, while we should certainly aim to reduce the amount of illicit activity being fueled by cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to remember that illicit activities are not unique to cryptocurrencies. Consider this quote written <a href="https://cryptoforinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/An-Analysis-of-Bitcoins-Use-in-Illicit-Finance-By-Michael-Morell.pdf">in a report by former CIA Acting Director Michael Morell</a>: </p><p>“The broad generalizations about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated. The blockchain ledger on which Bitcoin transactions are recorded is an underutilized forensic tool that can be used more widely by law enforcement and the intelligence community to identify and disrupt illicit activities. Put simply, blockchain analysis is a highly effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.” </p><p>We respect Senator Warren’s office and her commitment to public safety, but we must also speak truth to power, especially when powerful elected officials manipulate statistics for a political agenda. The suggestion that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are primarily tools for illicit trade is absolutely false. It is a misrepresentation that is being used as propaganda to push for tighter regulation and potentially infringe on the freedoms that these decentralized systems provide. </p><h2>Why Attack Bitcoin?</h2><p>Such misconceptions about bitcoin and digital assets suggest a lack of understanding within the government about these innovative technologies. It is concerning when these misinterpretations are used to justify attempts to limit the freedoms that these systems afford. To put it more succinctly, this is a willful mischaracterization of an emerging technology that has the potential to empower individuals and decentralize power away from governments. </p><p>All governments throughout history have abused their authority of coinage and seigniorage, so a free-market tool that threatens that system would clearly be a target. Figures like Senator Warren have been issuing dire warnings about the use of cryptocurrencies in illicit transactions, while calling for greater regulation of the sector. These statements are clearly attempts to exploit the situation to push an anti-decentralization and anti-innovation agenda, resulting in greater government control and limits to the freedoms of individuals. </p><p>Instead, our mission should be to foster understanding and acceptance of this innovative technology, emphasizing the transformative potential and the inherent freedoms that Bitcoin can provide. We should defend the right to freedom and privacy that these decentralized systems protect. As such, we can't stress enough the importance of educating our legislators about bitcoin and digital assets. Accurate understanding is key to developing fair and effective regulation that protects consumers without stifling innovation. It is our responsibility as members of the Bitcoin community to ensure that our voices are heard, our technology is understood and our rights are protected.</p><p><em>This is a guest post by Lee Bratcher and Mark Shut.

This move comes after several other major players in the financial industry have also made similar filings, cementing Bitcoin's position as a sought-after asset among traditional investors.</p><p>The momentum began with <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custody">BlackRock</a>, one of the world's largest asset management firms, filing for a spot bitcoin ETF application. Although they were not the first — ARK Investments and 21Shares had already filed for a spot ETF — they initiated the cascading effect now seen. Investment firms <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/blackrock-bitwise-bitcoin-etf-filings">Bitwise</a> and <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/invesco-reapplies-for-bitcoin-etf-advocates-for-more-crypto-investment-products/">Invesco</a> both refiled for their own spot ETFs, which they had submitted previously.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/wisdomtree-files-application-for-spot-bitcoin-etf">WisdomTree</a>, an investment management company renowned for its innovative exchange-traded products, filed its own application for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Adding to the now-growing list of firms seeking to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/valkyrie-investments-joins-flurry-of-firms-filing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs">Valkyrie Investments</a> joined the race. </p><p>Meanwhile, ARK, a prominent investment management firm, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1674055780058771463?s=20">amended</a> its 19b-4 filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF, solidifying its position in the race for approval. With the inclusion of a surveillance sharing agreement between CBOE and a crypto exchange (likely Coinbase), ARK's filing aligns with BlackRock's strategy and places them at the forefront to potentially be approved first, given their early filing.</p><p>However, amidst this competition, Fidelity Investments has reentered the fray by reapplying for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Fidelity, a trusted name in the financial industry, brings its significant expertise and reputation to the bitcoin market, further solidifying the notion that Bitcoin is gaining acceptance among institutional investors.</p><p>Jaymes Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg,<a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1674469367466143745?s=20"> took to Twitter</a> to share his guesses at when the filings may be addressed, noting that the dates for when the filings will be approved or denied are not exact. </p><div><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1674469367466143745"></a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><p>This series of events serves as a testament to the growing recognition of Bitcoin's potential as a mainstream asset class.

The plebs that make up the group have wide-ranging skill sets across multiple industries, such as education, finance and information technology, in addition to holding blue-collar jobs. This grassroots movement has lofty goals. As early member Mark Maraia stated in an interview for this article, CLOs have embarked on a mission of helping “Lightning rails rule the Earth.”</p><h2>Diagnosing Before Prescribing</h2><p>While Maraia and many others in the group have sales experience, the goal is not about “closing the deal”: Self-appointed members of CLO, who call themselves “chief Lightning officers,” meet local, prospective Lightning point-of-sale (PoS) merchants with a fact-finding mindset: they build relationships with these local merchants and uncover their pain points. While it’s easy for Bitcoiners to say “Bitcoin fixes this,” CLOs attempt to, as Maraia puts it, “diagnose before you prescribe.” </p><p>The biggest frictions discussed by the group have been high fees, delayed settlements, the security of in-house funds, friction during international business transactions and overreaching government regulations. But, as anyone who has studied the Lightning Network enough has realized, it has boundless potential to reduce fees, “lightning” quick final settlement, increased security and privacy, not to mention its ability to be borderless and permissionless.</p><p>The goal of the first few meetings of CLO was to determine which industries were ripe for Lightning adoption. Of the early suggestions were cannabis dispensaries, coffee shops (oh, the irony — paying for coffee with bitcoin), food trucks and non-chain restaurants, local sports teams and craft brewers, to name a few. During each meeting, the group brainstorms other industries that would benefit from utilizing the Lightning payments network (LPN). The group agrees that local Bitcoin meetups should all be working toward having merchants at their meetup spot accept Lightning payments. Some already are, like <a href="https://www.meetup.com/boulder-bitcoiners/">Boulder Bitcoin</a>, which created an LNURL/QR code that funds meetup event items such as drinks and pizza. <a href="https://twitter.com/BTCLincolnLand">Lincolnland Bitcoin</a> is in the process of obtaining the <a href="https://geyser.fund/project/bitcoinlightningatm">World’s Smallest Bitcoin (Lightning) Hobby ATM</a> so that local plebs can convert their spare change into bitcoin.</p><h2>Member Successes</h2><p>One CLO member, <a href="https://twitter.com/midsummer21mil">Holly Young</a>, recently shared <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboarding-portugal-to-bitcoin-lightning">her experience hosting a Lightning workshop in Portugal</a> for merchants and local small business owners. Aside from being called a “spammer” and accused of “promoting a Ponzi scheme or profiteering,” Young had a productive experience. Thanks to the help of a tech-savvy family member, attendees of her workship were able to successfully create Coinos accounts. In <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/onboarding-portugal-to-bitcoin-lightning">an article for Bitcoin Magazine</a>, Young described her motivation, “For me personally, the possibility of hooking the vendors up with the Bitcoin community and the Bitcoin community with people producing goods of genuine value is a key driver in organizing events of this kind.” </p><p>Since that workshop, Young has received several requests for similar one-on-one support. She is increasingly assured of Lightning’s potential “as more and more of us devote time and energy to helping it along its natural path to success,” she told me.</p><p>Another CLO member, <a href="https://twitter.com/the_brischster">Ryan Brisch</a>, has had recent success onboarding a local restaurant to accept bitcoin via the Lightning payments network. Brisch, who recently started a business called “Lightning Network Solutions” which helps merchants set up the ability to accept Lightning payments, explained the process in his own words for this article. </p><p>“Thanks to my local Bitcoin group, I learned about a <a href="https://bitcoin-grill.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/menu-bitcoingrill.pdf">new restaurant called Bitcoin Grill</a>, but that they weren't yet set up to accept bitcoin payments on chain or via Lightning,” he said. “After having my discussions with a couple business owners, including a restaurateur, I decided to call the restaurant and asked to speak to one of the owners. From there I scheduled a meeting. The first attempt was a dud, the owner had something come up and left me hanging.” </p><p>As any Bitcoiner knows, this is a common problem; most people require multiple touchpoints before being able to grok Bitcoin/Lightning. </p><p>Brisch continued, “After learning their Bitcoin journey, I showed him the IBEX solution. He was blown away by how easy it was to use and asked if he could sign up for it on the spot! So, we walked through the sign-up process and created a couple of BPTs (Bitcoin payment terminals) on a couple of their iPads.” </p><p>From there, Brisch took the time to follow up by training the servers. As previously stated, the goal is not to close the deal but rather to build a relationship with local merchants. Brisch foresees more follow-up training to ensure a smooth transition.</p><p>Another tool in the CLO members’ toolbelts is inviting and interviewing businesses built on Lightning. The CLO members realize that every merchant has needs specific to their situations. Therefore, they don’t prescribe one solution; rather, they stay platform agnostic. The group has so far sought out the expertise of the following: <a href="https://twitter.com/AnalysFalchuk">Analys Falchuk</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ibexpay">IBEXPay</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Dooowta">Michael Atwood</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/OshiApp">Oshi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsoltys">Adam Soltys</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/coinoswallet">Coinos</a>. In addition, a large part of meetings discuss the pros and cons of various Lightning infrastructures. And it’s not like there are just a few to sift through (see image below). Of the many options, <a href="https://twitter.com/walletofsatoshi">Wallet of Satoshi</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/PhoenixWallet">Phoenix</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MuunWallet">Muun</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightsats21">LightSats</a> and <a href="https://blixtwallet.github.io/">Blixt</a>, as well as payment processors like <a href="https://twitter.com/BtcpayServer">BTCPay Server</a> and plenty of others, have been analyzed.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Maraia believes Lightning adoption will gain traction in 2023. His reasoning is as follow:</p><p>“(There are a) dizzying number of companies that are innovating like crazy. Lightning companies are like Legos. People will use the Lightning payments network without knowing it. The Lightning payments network is the Trojan horse (for bitcoin adoption). (We’re) building a community of problem solvers in payments. Lightning can go places and do things fiat can’t.”</p><p>If you run a Lightning business or you’re a pleb wanting to help further Lightning adoption in your area, consider reaching out to the <a href="https://t.me/+46xTJG4PnEE5NGJh">CLO Telegram group</a>. Find a <a href="https://bitcoin-only.com/meetups">Bitcoin meetup</a> in your area. Locate <a href="https://btcmap.org/">merchants accepting bitcoin and Lightning</a> in your area. Adoption won’t happen on its own. It takes individuals like you and me willing to go the extra mile. </p><p>Like nodes on a network, we are the ones disseminating the boundless benefits of these revolutionary technologies in a peer-to-peer payment system that is soon to cover the globe.

Rather than the energy expenditure necessitated by PoW, PoS requires validators or miners to make contributions to the network from their own holdings of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency, i.e., their “stake.”</p><p>To avoid losing their stake, validators are incentivized to operate honestly and reach a consensus on the order and validity of transactions. PoS miners are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network; therefore, the more cryptocurrency a validator stakes, the more likely they will be chosen to create the next block. </p><p>Read More &gt;&gt; <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoiners-guide-to-proof-of-stake">Technical Guide To Proof Of Stake</a></p><h2>Comparison With Proof Of Work</h2><p>Instead of stakes, PoW requires considerable computational resources and energy consumption to validate transactions and create new blocks. For this reason, people assume proof of stake is more energy efficient and less resource intensive than PoW. Yet, we will learn later in this article that this is a somewhat false assumption.</p><p>Both consensus mechanisms aim at producing new blocks and validating transactions. They must also maintain the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/proof-of-work-is-objective-proof-of-stake-is-not">security and integrity</a> of the blockchain network, but they do so in different ways.</p><p>In PoW, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining">miners compete</a> to solve the Byzantine Generals’ Problem faster and reach a consensus on the validity of transactions. The quickest miner to complete the target hash creates a new block and receives the block reward, the network's token of value. By selecting the chain with the most work, the network overcomes any ambiguity, and double spending is prevented due to requiring at least 51% of the global hash power for a double spend block to catch up. </p><p>In <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/tags/ethereum">Ethereum’s</a> PoS, by means of comparison, the double-spending problem is solved using “checkpoint blocks” at various points in time, approved by a two-thirds majority vote through a stake to “assure” everyone in the network about the “truth” of the system.</p><p>Another significant difference between PoS and PoW is the incentives and the ethics behind them. In a PoS network, incentives hide a negative (penalty-based) connotation since validators may lose their stake if they act maliciously. This contrasts with PoW, where miners are only incentivized to behave honestly to be rewarded with cryptocurrency through a positive (reward-based) incentive system. </p><p>Bitcoin miners who attempt to break the rules by producing poorly formatted blocks or invalid transactions will find their blocks ignored by full nodes. As a result, they will incur substantial electricity costs. Moreover, they would need to command 51% of the hash power to build upon older blocks; otherwise, these chains will lag behind, leading to even more costly energy waste. </p><p>One of the most heated debates in consensus mechanisms is decentralization and the ability to maintain this decentralization. PoW decentralization is secured by an active network of full nodes, in addition to miners, a vital feature that isn’t reflected in PoS consensus mechanisms. The importance of nodes in PoW was marked in the blocksize war of 2017 when the small block supporters won the battle against big blockers by starting the <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-independence-day-how-this-watershed-day-defines-community-consensus">user-activated soft fork (UASF) movement</a> and voting for the BTC chain instead of Bitcoin Cash (BCH). That historic Bitcoin event emphasized how nodes could win against big corporations and that miners do not control the network, unlike PoS validators.</p><h2>How Proof Of Stake Works</h2><p>In a proof-of-stake network, participants can be miners or validators who verify and authenticate transactions and create new blocks based on the amount of the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency they hold or "stake" in the network. </p><p>Validators are randomly selected to add the following block based on their stake; the more cryptocurrency a validator has staked, the more likely they will be chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks.</p><p>When a validator is chosen to create a new block, they need to validate all the transactions in the block and add them to the blockchain. To validate the transactions, the validator must check that they are valid, are not “double spending,” and that the sender has enough cryptocurrency to make the transaction.</p><p>Once all transactions are validated in the block, a new block is created and added to the blockchain. At that point, the successful validator is rewarded with native tokens for their work.</p><p>In a proof-of-stake network, consensus is achieved when most validators agree on the state of the blockchain. If a validator creates a block that is not accepted by the majority of validators, the block is rejected, and the validator may lose their staked cryptocurrency.</p><h2>Valid Criticisms Of Proof Of Stake</h2><p>Although proof of stake is often perceived as more energy efficient and less resource demanding when compared to proof of work, these assumptions can be easily refuted, showing that decentralization and security are compromised with proof of stake and that PoS is a mirror image of the current monetary system, which is known to be particularly energy inefficient, as well as unfair to the majority of participants. </p><p>One key argument against the perceived advantages of proof of stake is the concentration of wealth and power this can lead to. In a PoS system, validators with more stake (or wealth) have a higher probability of being chosen to validate transactions and create new blocks. This results in a rich-get-richer scenario, where the wealthiest validators gain even more control and influence over the network. The table below from Nansen Research provides a clear picture of the staking landscape within the Ethereum proof-of-stake system.&nbsp;</p><figure>

    </figure><p>This concentration of power contradicts the principles of decentralization, as a small number of validators can potentially dominate decision-making processes. Unlike proof of work, where miners have to invest in computational power, proof of stake allows validators to accumulate wealth and control the network based on their initial stake, rather than their ongoing contributions to the system.</p><figure>

    </figure><p>Another valid criticism of proof of stake is the pre-mine configurations many cryptocurrencies, including ether (ETH), are based on. Mining tokens before their public launch means that founders, stakeholders, and developers may access a lot of wealth and have a considerable advantage over any other investors or validators who later join the network. While such a design could also apply to proof-of-work blockchains, it is more often used in the proof-of-stake ecosystems, because in such systems, it’s possible to have a greater share of the validation process, due to the absence of nodes.</p><p>Common critiques of the PoS consensus mechanism:</p><ul><li>Lack of decentralization: validators who hold a large amount of cryptocurrency have a higher chance of being selected to create new blocks, receive rewards, and they have more influence over the network, leading to a concentration of power in the hands of a few validators. This could lead to a situation where a small group of validators controls the network and its rules, potentially compromising its security and decentralization and reinforcing existing wealth inequalities. </li><li>The validation process can be manipulated: since the network could be manipulated by owning 51% of the tokens in circulation, it is easier to influence the transaction validation than with a 51% attack on PoW, which requires controlling 51% of a network’s current computational power.</li><li>Security: in PoS, the network's safety depends on the amount of cryptocurrency held by validators, making it more vulnerable to attacks if a large number of validators were to collude.</li><li>Complexity: there are various types of proof of stake, such as delegated PoS (DPOS), leased PoS (LPOS), pure PoS (PPOS), and other hybrid types. These are all variants of an overengineered system, which is difficult for anyone to truly explain and understand. The more complex a system is, the more likely it is to fail.</li><li>Environmental impact: proof of stake (PoS) is often criticized for its environmental impact, mirroring the concerns associated with the existing monetary system. Unlike proof of work (PoW), which <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">incentivizes the expenditure of energy</a>, PoS systems are considered less energy intensive. However, the proliferation of blockchains relying on inefficient PoS mechanisms collectively exacerbates their environmental footprint.</li><li>Nothing-at-stake problem: the nothing-at-stake problem is a theoretical weakness in PoS, where validators have little to lose by creating multiple versions of the blockchain. In a PoS network, validators could create multiple versions of the blockchain, hoping that one version will become the "correct" version. This could lead to a situation where the network is unable to reach a consensus, compromising its security.</li><li>Difficulty in determining the right amount to stake: determining the optimal amount of cryptocurrency to stake in a PoS network is challenging. Validators must balance the desire for higher rewards with the risk of losing their stake.</li></ul><h2>Would Bitcoin Ever Move To Proof Of Stake? </h2><p>Ethereum’s recent shift from PoW to PoS in September 2022 sparked ideas across the corporatized environmental world that Bitcoin should do the same and therefore abandon the “extreme energy consumption” required by its consensus mechanism. </p><p>Changing Ethereum to a PoS system <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoin-not-proof-of-stake-solves-energy">won’t/didn’t reduce energy consumption by 99.95%</a>, as it fails to take into account that expensive enterprise farms and corporations use enormous amounts of energy to subsidize the work necessary to complete PoS transactions globally.</p><p>The <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/greenpeace-seeks-to-change-bitcoin-code">Greenpeace “Change the Code” campaign</a> funded by Ripple Labs to discredit the energy usage of Bitcoin’s proof-of-work system is a typical example of how the corporate world does not encourage change and, instead, promotes the perpetration of an elitist system that is now fully mirrored in Ethereum’s consensus mechanism.</p><p>Besides proposing a new revolutionary and fair monetary system, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/bitcoins-energy-revolution-happening-now">PoW fosters renewable energy innovation</a> and the use of <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/profiting-on-biogas-with-bitcoin-mining">stranded and wasted energy</a> which will benefit the environment more than a supposedly energy-efficient PoS system in the long term. Proof of stake is merely better at concealing the energy purchases made by the corporations that enable its validating mechanism.</p><p>Thankfully, <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-will-never-change-to-proof-of-stake">Bitcoin’s code is highly resistant</a> to these types of attacks and was purposely developed this way. It is improbable that a proposal to change the code would even pass any initial stage of consideration by the developers, let alone the community. </p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In free markets, it is important to allow both proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanisms to coexist and evolve in ways that are profitable and beneficial to their respective supporters. Bitcoin, as an innovative monetary system, not only brings about technological advancements but also strives to have a positive impact on the environment. Educating individuals about the significance of PoW in this transformative process is a responsibility that Bitcoin enthusiasts understand and embrace.</p><p>If you're concerned about wealth protection, financial inclusion, and fostering a better environment for all life on earth, the ideal choice is a currency that is borderless, permissionless and embodies pristine hard money and freedom technology.</p><p>This type of money, which is impervious to censorship and safe from confiscation, highlights the superiority of proof of work over proof of stake. In years to come, Bitcoin may likely be the only token of value, and the decision to support proof of work will be seen as obvious in hindsight.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk4OTkwMTMzMjgwNjQ2OTI5/proof-of-stake-feature-image-w-text.png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTkwMTA0ODI2NDg4Nzg4/unnamed.png" height="302" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/><media:content url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTk4OTkwMTIyODExNjY0MzQw/unnamed-1.png" height="349" width="620" medium="image" type="image/png"/></item><item><title><![CDATA[MicroStrategy's Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy Secures 0.726% of Total Supply]]></title><description><![CDATA[MicroStrategy continues to dominate the corporate bitcoin space with an aggressive acquisition strategy.]]></description><link>https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategys-secures-0-726-of-total-bitcoin-supply-with-latest-buy</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategys-secures-0-726-of-total-bitcoin-supply-with-latest-buy</guid><category><![CDATA[bitcoin treasuries]]></category><category><![CDATA[News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[microstrategy]]></category><category><![CDATA[michael saylor]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[BtcCasey]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jun 2023 17:02:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- tml-version="2" --><p>MicroStrategy, the leading public corporation in terms of bitcoin holdings, has once again demonstrated its aggressive bitcoin acquisition strategy. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 12,333 BTC for approximately $347.0 million, at an average price of $28,136 per bitcoin. This brings MicroStrategy's total holdings to an impressive 152,333 BTC, acquired at an average price of $29,668 per bitcoin. With a total of 21 million bitcoins set to ever exist, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total available supply.</p><p>This latest move by MicroStrategy further solidifies its position as the largest public corporation holder of bitcoin. MicroStrategy's journey with bitcoin began in August 2020, and despite <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-buys-2500-btc-despite-sale">selling some of its holdings</a> for tax loss harvesting in December 2022, the company has consistently increased its bitcoin collection. In fact, shortly after the sale, MicroStrategy acquired an additional 2,500 bitcoin, further bolstering its already significant holdings. With their current holdings, MicroStrategy now controls approximately 0.726% of the total 21 million bitcoins that will ever be mined.</p><p>In addition to its relentless accumulation of bitcoin, MicroStrategy has recently revealed plans to leverage <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/microstrategy-launch-bitcoin-lightning-apps-2023">Lightning</a> for enterprise infrastructure services and content monetization solutions. The company's chairman, Michael Saylor, has been actively spearheading the mission of advancing Bitcoin adoption and development.</p><p>The latest acquisition of bitcoin by MicroStrategy reinforces the company's belief in the long-term viability of the digital asset. With Marathon being the only other company holding a substantial amount of bitcoin compared to MicroStrategy, and this acquisition being larger than their entire holdings, it is clear that MicroStrategy's aggressive acquisition strategy positions it as a dominant force in the corporate bitcoin space, controlling a significant percentage of the limited supply.</p>]]></content:encoded><media:thumbnail url="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_1200%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MTk0MjMxNzYxODMwNTUzMDkz/bitcoin-stack.png"/></item></channel></rss>
