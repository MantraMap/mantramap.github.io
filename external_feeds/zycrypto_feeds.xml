<ul>
<li>The ongoing banking crisis and hyperinflation are the other catalysts Saylor believes could boost the adoption of Bitcoin.</li>



<li>Ordinals have caused a surge in activity on the top blockchain.</li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s famous maximalist and co-founder of MicroStrategy, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/mammoth-btc-whale-the-chinese-government-holds-more-bitcoin-than-michael-saylors-microstrategy/">Michael Saylor</a>, says that the latest enthusiasm around Ordinals is a catalyst for Bitcoin adoption.</p>



<p>Speaking on PBD Podcast, Saylor added that the growing cases of bank failures, soaring inflation, and the clampdown by the regulators on digital assets were the other key factors that could drive the next bull run.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Every time someone builds an application that&#8217;s cool on Bitcoin, like all the Ordinals and inscriptions and whatever that are driving up transactions fees, it is a catalyst, he said, adding that &#8220;a company like Microstrategy buying another $100 million worth of bitcoin,&#8221; is also a catalyst.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Ordinals are taking Bitcoin and the entire crypto space by storm, judging by the recent <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">surge in activities</a> reported on the blockchain. The feature surfaced at the beginning of the year, allowing users to store media on the blockchain by inscribing data on the smallest unit of bitcoin, Satoshi, as non-fungible tokens.</p>



<p>The result has been a jump in the transaction fees for the transfer of bitcoins on the network. According to BitInfoCharts, the average transaction fee on Bitcoin was $20 at press time, representing a jump of more than 500% before May 2023.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ordinals-push-btc-transaction-fees-for-miners-above-the-mining-rewards"><strong>Ordinals Push BTC Transaction Fees for Miners Above the Mining Rewards</strong></h2>



<p>Besides, for the first time since 2017, some Bitcoin miners received more rewards for validating transactions on the blockchain than they were getting for minting new tokens, thanks to Ordinals. </p>



<p>A new fungible standard, BRC-20, introduced in March atop Ordinals, has also brought new use cases of the Bitcoin block space to meme tokens. The current market cap for the BRC-20 tokens, according to brc-20.io, is more than $500 million.</p>



<p>Colin Harper, head of content for mining pool Luxor Technologies, agrees with Saylor concerning the potential of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens. Recently he commented that the development is a &#8220;cool example of how, just when you think Bitcoin has become boring, something is waiting around the corner that surprises everyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>MicroStrategy <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-spends-29-million-buying-more-bitcoin-as-btc-eyes-30000/">added 7,500 bitcoins</a> last quarter, bringing its total holding to 140,000, according to the firm&#8217;s first quarter 2023 financial results. The company also reported that its digital asset impairment losses had narrowed to $18.9 million from $197.6 million in the prior quarter.</p>

<ul>
<li>The meme token has plunged more than half since peaking on May 5.</li>



<li>Most trading volumes have shifted from Uniswap to centralized exchanges, including Binance.</li>
</ul>



<p>Major crypto whales are accumulating large amounts of meme crypto PEPE coin, despite a drop in prices, on-chain analytics tool Lookonchain reported.</p>



<p><em>‘‘3 whales started to buy $PEPE after the price dropped. 0x50C1 withdrew 1.4T $PEPE ($2.76 million) from Binance when the price was $0.000002054. 0x2Baa bought 212B $PEPE (429K) with 223 $ETH (412k) at $0.000001942. 0x3ae8 bought 424B $PEPE ($864K) with 450 $ETH (831K) at $0.000001957,’’ Lookonchain posted on Twitter.</em></p>



<p>Since <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-listing-of-pepe-and-floki-in-its-innovation-zone-strikes-further-eruption/">Binance listed</a> the meme token, inspired by the cartoon meme character Pepe the Frog, on May 6, the exchange has seen huge volumes of the token’s trading on its platform, a shift from decentralized to centralized exchanges.</p>



<p>At press time, data from CoinGecko showed that PEPE’s trading volumes were over $430 million, most of which came from Binance. Despite the price decline, the number of $PEPE holders has surpassed 100,000, according to DexTools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-down-more-than-50"><strong>$PEPE Down More Than 50%</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-this-early-pepe-buyer-turned-260-into-almost-8-million-amid-meme-coin-frenzy/">PEPE peaked</a> at an all-time price high of $0.000004354 on May 5, with daily volumes of $1.61 billion, according to the data shared by CoinMarketCap. But, at press time, the token was changing hands for $0.000001577, representing a price decline of more than 52%,</p>



<p>The decline was reportedly exacerbated by profit-taking by traders and those using advanced trading strategies &#8211; Pepe-tracked futures. According to on-chain analytics firm Santiment, an increase in ether deposits showed traders were likely taking profits from their Pepe positions.</p>



<p><em>‘‘Exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November 2021, Santiment posted on Twitter, adding, ‘‘as expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again.’’</em></p>



<p>Nonetheless, market experts are questioning how sustainable $PEPE would be in the future, considering that few investors hold vast amounts of the token since it was tilted on the Ethereum blockchain, risking having few holders in control.</p>

<p>Coinbase is facing withering backlash and a boycott from some members of the crypto community who are turned off by the exchange’s Pepe-hating rhetoric.</p>



<p>In an email newsletter sent to Coinbase users on Wednesday, the crypto exchange called Pepe a “hate symbol” while highlighting an association of the Pepe the Frog meme to political groups.</p>



<p>“The token is based on the Pepe the Frog meme, which first surfaced on the internet nearly 20 years ago as a comic-strip character,” the email read. “Over time it has been co-opted as a hate symbol by alt-right groups, according to the Anti-Defamation League.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-community-seethes-with-anger"><strong>Pepe Community Seethes With Anger&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>While the email has a disclaimer that dissociates the writer and does “not necessarily reflect the views of Coinbase or its employees”, a legion of fans and investors of the frog-themed meme coin were outraged at Coinbase’s portrayal of their beloved token.</p>



<p>Solidity developer and PEPE supporter Kenobi, for instance, astutely stated that the token is not a symbol of hate and that he would be transferring his crypto funds to Gemini digital asset exchange.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>The hashtag “#deletecoinbase” began trending on Twitter Thursday as users seemingly deleted their accounts with the leading U.S. exchange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Former congressional candidate David Gokhshtein <a href="https://twitter.com/davidgokhshtein/status/1656485195099324418">predicts </a>that Coinbase will lose a boatload of customers for “disrespecting PEPE”.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coinbase Avoids Listing PEPE</strong></h2>



<p>After the market’s largest exchange Binance, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/binances-listing-of-pepe-and-floki-in-its-innovation-zone-strikes-further-eruption/">listed </a>Pepe on the platform’s innovation zone on May 5, the token’s fans have been calling for other crypto exchanges to list the newly-launched meme coin as well.</p>



<p>Winklevoss twins-owned exchange Gemini succumbed to the pressure as it <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/gemini-now-supports-pepe">announced </a>the listing of PEPE on May 9. Coinbase, on the other hand, has not indicated any plans to list the token on its exchange for trading.</p>



<p>Pepecoin has been on a roll since its launch last month, with its market cap peaking at $1.82 billion on May 6. Besides its stratospheric price increase, the flurry of speculation also sent Ethereum gas fees skyrocketing to 12-month highs.</p>



<p>However, the Pepe rally has run out of steam in recent days, with the token falling from a peak of $0.00000431 to $0.00000164 at press time, per CoinGecko. The downward price action has seen the meme coin’s total market cap sinking to $691 million.</p>

<p>It appears things are only getting worse for disgraced Terra founder Do Kwon. A Wednesday report revealed that South Korean prosecutors had managed to freeze around 233.3 billion Korean won, valued at about $176 million, in Kwon’s personal assets as criminal proceedings against the former Terraform Labs CEO continue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kwon-s-funds-frozen"><strong>Kwon’s Funds Frozen</strong></h2>



<p>Do Kwon has had his assets frozen by South Korean authorities.</p>



<p>According to a May 10 report from local publication Hankyung, Chief Judge Yoon Chan-young of the 12th Criminal Division of the Seoul Southern District Court approved the prosecutors’ request to lock Kwon’s property. The assets in question include the Galleria Foret apartment complex in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, a new officetel in Nonhyeon-dong, and multiple imported cars.</p>



<p>The judge also prohibited the sale of Kwon&#8217;s financial assets, such as securities deposited in Mirae Asset Securities, deposits in Woori Bank, and crypto assets stored in personal wallets on exchanges.</p>



<p>South Korean law mandates that suspects are banned from the disposition of assets or proceeds obtained illegally until a conviction is made.</p>



<p>Last week, the director of Seoul Southern District’s joint financial crimes told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that Kwon is facing up to 40 years behind bars if convicted — the longest sentence handed to a financial crime in the history of&nbsp; South Korea.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From Crypto ‘Genius’ To Alleged Crypto Scammer</strong></h2>



<p>The spectacular collapse of Terra’s Luna and the UST algorithmic stablecoin back in May 2022 was a key catalyst for the crypto industry’s slip into its crypto winter, with the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies falling hard and several high-profile players like<a href="https://zycrypto.com/after-weeks-of-hiding-3ac-founders-break-silence-blame-luna-for-hedge-fund-collapse/"> Three Arrows Capital </a>becoming insolvent.</p>



<p>Kwon was infamously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-theranos-do-kwon-stares-at-multiple-lawsuits-as-investors-sense-fraud-in-terras-debacle/">compared </a>to the infamous Elizabeth Holmes, who promised Theranos investors far more than she could deliver.</p>



<p>In mid-February this year, roughly 9 months after the Terra ecosystem careened to zero, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">lodged </a>civil charges for securities fraud against Kwon and his now-defunct Singapore-based firm Terraform Labs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The SEC claims, for a start, that Terraform Labs worked with U.S.-based trading firms to keep the illusion that UST’s self-balancing algorithm truly worked to keep its price pegged to one dollar. Both through these relationships and through more direct techniques, the SEC states that the beleaguered crypto founder and Terraform frequently intervened in the market for Luna and TerraUSD.</p>



<p>Then, in March, came the news that everyone in the cryptosphere was really hoping for. Authorities of the small Balkan nation of Montenegro disclosed that their police… had <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>Do Kwon.</p>



<p>The detention was swiftly confirmed by both South Korean law enforcement and by Interpol. And within hours, U.S. prosecutors slapped the South Korean national with eight counts of fraud, adding to the civil charges filed previously by the SEC.</p>



<p>Both South Korea and the U.S. are currently vying for the extradition of the crypto entrepreneur once hailed as a genius.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of ETH in whale addresses drops weeks after the Shanghai update, indicating that big investors may be leaning bearish.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Conversely, “shrimps” or small-scale investors with less than 1 ETH have increased their holdings in the past weeks.</li>



<li>Digital asset analysts debate ETH price-to-whale ratio with some saying it is no longer a huge indicator as shown by charts in recent months.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Post-Shanghai era for Ethereum (ETH) came with many possibilities for the network, including attracting more investors but a new statistic shows something might be brewing among big investors.</p>



<p>New data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode show that ETH supply in whale addresses has dropped since Shapella hit the Ethereum network. A drop in whale addresses could signify a shift in perspective from large investors who now look bearish for the short term.</p>



<p>ETH in wallets above 1000 &#8211; 10000 ETH stood at 14.167 million ETH a day for Shapella however, weeks after the update, the figure now stands at 14.033 million ETH. A week before the update, whales had acquired the highest amount of ETH in 2023, 14.303 million ETH.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the assets held by whales continue to decline, a similar pattern is also shown by smaller investors with 1- 1000 ETH and even mega whales above 10,000 ETH. However, users with less than 1 ETH have slightly increased their holdings.</p>



<p>Described as “shrimps”, their net position rose from 1.79 million to 1.80 million ETH. The Shapella upgrade hit Ethereum’s mainnet on April 12 to enable users to withdraw their staked assets for the first time since the Merge, which saw the network transition to a proof-of-stake blockchain.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-s-next-for-the-price-of-eth">What’s next for the price of ETH?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>ETH has recorded a good run this year, soaring 55.29% and going <a href="https://zycrypto.com/post-shanghai-huge-influx-of-eth-in-exchanges-leave-experts-at-crossroads-as-price-falls-below-2k/">past</a> the $2,000 resistance level last month before declining below $1,900. Historically, reduced whale activity would give assets a bearish outlook as whales often ignite bull runs, although this is not always the case.</p>



<p>Between 2020 and 2021, ETH witnessed declining whale activity despite going on a bull run in 2021, but from the downtrend in 2022, whale holdings have risen by nearly 1 million ETH driving up the price to $1,857.</p>



<p>Ethereum has dipped since the Shanghai update as validators withdraw their staked assets. A declining whale activity coupled with a reduced investment of staked ETH points downward for the asset.</p>

<p>The world’s largest blockchain advocacy and trade group, the Chamber of Digital Commerce (CDC), has announced backing Coinbase in its legal and public relations battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The Chamber of Commerce filed an amicus brief on Tuesday, claiming that the U.S. regulator’s antagonistic stance against crypto is causing significant economic harm.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-crypto-trade-group-files-amicus-brief-in-coinbase-v-sec"><strong>Crypto Trade Group Files Amicus Brief In Coinbase v. SEC</strong></h2>



<p>CDC, a non-profit trade association that engages government officials on the use of crypto and blockchain, has filed an amicus brief in the ongoing court case between America’s leading exchange Coinbase and the SEC.</p>



<p>In the amicus brief — a legal document supplied to a court of law that allows a non-litigant to submit their expertise or opinion in a case as “a friend” of the court — the Chamber of Digital Commerce argued that by failing to respond to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-goes-offensive-against-the-sec-with-lawsuit-targeted-at-regulatory-clarity/">Coinbase’s July 2022 petition</a> for sufficient regulatory guidance, the SEC is “causing substantial economic harm to both Coinbase and the broader business community.”</p>



<p>Filed on May 9, CDC says it is supporting Coinbase as it seeks formal rulemaking within the digital assets sector. In particular, the exchange wants the SEC to answer when a token sale constitutes an investment contract — and therefore qualifies as a securities offering.</p>



<p>The amicus brief also notes that the CDC has a strong interest in ensuring there is enough clarity around regulations applying to digital assets:</p>



<p><em>“Chamber’s members have a strong interest in regulatory clarity, and many of its members are companies subject to US securities laws that may be adversely affected by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s current approach to digital assets.”</em></p>



<p>In recent months, the SEC has pursued a spate of enforcement actions against what it considered issuers of unregistered securities. Recently, those crypto cases have come at a furious pace, with the SEC even boosting the size of its digital assets enforcement team.</p>



<p>The securities watchdog in March sent Coinbase a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">Wells Notice</a> regarding aspects of the company’s staking service Coinbase Earn and Coinbase Wallet after a cursory probe, tipping it off that the regulator is building a case against it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Chamber Says Innovation And Regulation Can Co-Exist</strong></h2>



<p>The Chamber of Commerce further argued in the brief that the lack of regulatory certainty in the U.S. is stifling innovation.</p>



<p>“The digital-asset industry offers a case study in how regulatory uncertainty undermines innovation. Before the Commission began rattling its saber, the industry grew quickly — reaching a trillion dollars in market capitalization by early 2021,” the amicus brief noted.</p>



<p>The trader group also has serious concerns about the SEC not testing its legal allegations in court because it forces most companies to settle its enforcement actions. The agency leaves crypto firms to “accept the risk of future litigation — and the associated financial burdens — or they can stop engaging in conduct that the agency might or might not ultimately target.”</p>



<p>The Third Circuit Court of Appeals recently ordered the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s complaint within ten days.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-debuts-offshore-exchange-with-bitcoin-and-ethereum-perpetual-futures-amid-regulatory-challenges-in-the-us/">rolled out</a> its international platform earlier this month via regulatory approval from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). Coinbase International Exchange will first list Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures.</p>

<p>It was recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/garlinghouse-reveals-ripple-will-spend-200m-defending-itself-against-the-sec-even-as-case-worries-xrp-holders/">reported </a>that Ripple Labs would spend roughly $200 million defending the SEC lawsuit. However, top venture capitalist Jason Calacanis has claimed that the San Francisco-based blockchain payments firm would have spent less if it only registered XRP as a security.</p>



<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse did not hesitate to criticize Calacanis, alluding to his lack of securities laws knowledge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-xrp-is-obviously-a-security"><strong>“XRP Is Obviously A Security”</strong></h2>



<p>It all started when well-known tech investor and podcaster Jason Calacanis commented on Brad Garlinghouse’s recent interview, revealing that Ripple’s courtroom battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is set to cost his company a lot staggering $200 million.</p>



<p>In Jason’s view, XRP is “obviously a security”, adding that it would have cost Ripple way less if it went to the SEC and registered the token as a security. He added that the company should have just “played by the rules” like other participants in the crypto industry.</p>



<p>The SEC — which is currently going after crypto like never before — <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-holders-are-completely-fcked-messari-founder-predicts-drop-to-0-10-as-the-sec-sues-ripple/">accused </a>Ripple of violating federal securities laws. The specific complaint revolves around the firm’s sale of the XRP cryptocurrency without obtaining prior registration with the watchdog agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, the Ripple chief questioned Jason’s understanding of securities laws and noted that he was known for making controversial statements and taking aim at topics without proper knowledge. Garlinghouse also indicated that the VC’s assertion was both “embarrassing” and “hilariously wrong” given that U.S. authorities have not provided sector-specific rules for registering digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>More Support For XRP</strong></h2>



<p>The heated exchange between Ripple and Jason spotlights the ongoing debate surrounding the security status of XRP and the lack of a clear rulebook for cryptocurrencies in the United States.</p>



<p>Attorney John E. Deaton, who is representing XRP holders as amicus curiae, also contributed to the argument initiated by Jason. Deaton said the claim that Ripple sold XRP as a security is one thing, while the claim that XRP, which is basically a line of code inside the software, is a security is another thing.</p>



<p>The legal expert also asked where other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Algorand (ALGO), and Stellar (XLM) have registered for they not to be facing the same attack from the SEC.</p>



<p>The three-year battle between the SEC and Ripple — possibly coming to an end soon — is expected to set a precedent for the treatment of cryptocurrencies, particularly altcoins, under U.S. securities and commodities laws.</p>

<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest exchange by trading volume, announced it is working on including Bitcoin’s Ordinals tokens in its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.</p>



<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/nft/binance-nft-marketplace-to-support-bitcoin-nfts-4250480174684233711?ref=AZTKZ9XS&amp;utm_source=BinanceTwitter&amp;utm_medium=GlobalSocial&amp;utm_campaign=GlobalSocial">statement</a>, Ordinals tokens will be included in &#8220;the coming weeks&#8221; as the exchange expands its NFT ecosystem.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-wants-to-expand-its-nft-marketplace"><strong>Binance wants to expand its NFT Marketplace</strong></h2>



<p>Binance is working with other relevant projects from the Bitcoin Ordinals community to drive its expansion. Currently, Binance&#8217;s marketplace only supports three networks: BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Polygon.</p>



<p>Therefore, the team hopes that integrating the Bitcoin network will elevate its marketplace and turn it into an &#8220;open marketplace ecosystem, where users can explore and trade a wider variety of NFTs.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thanks to this integration, Binance users will be able to trade Bitcoin NFTs without the need for a separate Ordinals wallet. This could benefit the NFT market by removing barriers to entry for artists and content creators with little experience in the crypto ecosystem.</p>



<p>Binance will focus on finding quality NFT projects that are &#8220;innovative&#8221; to support the growth and development of Bitcoin Ordinals.</p>



<p>Those who wish to participate in Binance&#8217;s special registration event, which includes opportunities to be whitelisted and receive an airdrop, must complete a form available from May 09 to May 15 at 23:59 UTC.</p>



<p>It is worth mentioning that many crypto enthusiasts have rejected Ordinals tokens due to congestion caused by the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-weekly-transactions-hit-new-high-as-ordinals-mint-goes-past-2-5-million-sets-new-record/">excessive minting </a>of BRC20 tokens on the Bitcoin network and the non-financial nature of this implementation —which is considered by some to be against Bitcoin’s ethos as a P2P electronic cash system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are Bitcoin Ordinals, and why have they become a trend?</strong></h2>



<p>The Ordinals protocol essentially allows users to convert individual satoshis into unique NFTs by attaching additional data. This process is known as &#8220;inscription.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional NFTs, Ordinals inscriptions can contain videos, images, texts, or codes. Although this could be innovative for artists in the crypto ecosystem, it has been the most significant problem caused by the latest Bitcoin &#8220;Taproot&#8221; update, according to some<a href="https://zycrypto.com/ordinals-project-surpasses-11000-nft-mints-in-weeks-amid-criticisms-from-bitcoin-maxis/"> bitcoin maximalists</a>.</p>



<p>Even Binance had to temporarily halt Bitcoin transactions over the weekend for a few hours due to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-sees-spike-in-transfer-fees-following-ordinals-launch/">network congestion</a> related to the issuance of BRC-20 tokens minted and traded through the Ordinals protocol.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin market has been witnessing a gradual shift recently as the transaction count of $1 million or more among Bitcoin whales has steadily declined since March 22. This downward trend has caught market analysts&#8217; attention and led to several speculations about the future of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>As the leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin&#8217;s market trends have far-reaching implications for the entire digital asset market. Therefore, any significant change in the behaviour of Bitcoin whales can have ripple effects on the entire industry. Whales are large holders of Bitcoin who own a significant portion of the cryptocurrency, and their actions are often a leading indicator of market sentiment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-change-in-whale-sentiment-why-does-it-matter"><strong>Change in Whale Sentiment: Why Does It Matter?</strong></h2>



<p>The decline in the Bitcoin whale transaction count could be an indication of several possible scenarios. Firstly, it could suggest a reduction in the trading activity of these large holders. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a shift in investment strategy, a decrease in market volatility, or the absence of any significant price movements in recent times.</p>



<p>Another possible implication of the downward trend in Bitcoin whale transaction count is a shift in market sentiment. Whales often make significant moves in the market that can cause a price surge or a price crash. Therefore, a decline in their transaction count could indicate a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/early-bitcoin-investor-says-crypto-is-dead-in-the-u-s-and-heres-why/">lack of confidence</a> in the current market conditions. This could lead to a more cautious approach from large holders, which could dampen the overall market sentiment.</p>



<p>However, it is worth noting that the decline in Bitcoin whale transaction count could also be a temporary phenomenon. It is not uncommon for large holders to adjust their investment strategy based on market conditions. Therefore, this trend may not be an accurate indicator of the long-term future of Bitcoin.</p>



<p>It is essential to admit that the declining trend of Bitcoin whale transaction count could have several possible implications for the future of Bitcoin. Whether it signals a reduction in trading activity among large holders or a shift in market sentiment remains to be seen. However, the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, and trends can change quickly. Therefore, investors and analysts should keep a close eye on future developments to stay ahead of the curve.</p>

<p>Ishan Wahi, the former product manager at Coinbase Global accused of insider trading, was on Tuesday sentenced to 24 months in prison.</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto </em>previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/former-coinbase-product-manager-pleads-guilty-to-insider-trading-in-landmark-u-s-case/">reported</a>, Wahi pleaded guilty in February to fraud charges for his role in using insider information he obtained during his time working at Coinbase to profit off upcoming token listings.</p>



<p>The sentence imposed by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan was one year shorter than what prosecutors had asked for.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-profiting-from-insider-trading"><strong>Profiting From Insider Trading</strong></h2>



<p>Ex-Coinbase manager Ishan Wahi will spend time behind bars at a Federal prison after pleading guilty to insider trading allegations.</p>



<p>Wahi and his co-conspirators — including his brother, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/insider-trading-former-coinbase-employee-pleads-guilty-to-charges-as-sec-clamps-down-on-the-cryptosphere/">Nikhil Wahi</a> — allegedly used information he acquired from America’s biggest crypto exchange to profit off new crypto listings. The alleged scheme revolving around trading on Wahi’s confidential information netted the three men as much as $1.5 million.</p>



<p>Judge Loretta Preska ordered Wahi to surrender by June 21 at 2:00 PM ET to serve his term at the Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution in New Jersey. After his time in jail, he will be subject to two years of supervised release for each count, running concurrently.</p>



<p>Wahi tried to flee the country after being questioned by Coinbase, the Department of Justice revealed. But he was arrested by U.S. authorities in July 2022 while attempting to board a flight to India.</p>



<p>After first pleading not guilty and trying to dismiss the charges against him, the Indian National pleaded guilty in February to two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.</p>



<p>Wahi, his brother, and his friend Sameer Ramani were also slapped with civil charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ramani remains at large at press time, while Nikhil was sentenced to 10 months in prison.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Second Insider Trading Case Involving Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Notably, U.S. prosecutors had recommended a three-year term for Wahi to dissuade other crypto insiders from misusing confidential information.</p>



<p><em>“You spoke very nicely, you said all the right things,” Preska said, while sentencing Wahi to two years in prison. “I hope that you can make this up to your parents.”</em></p>



<p>Wahi’s imprisonment marks the second criminal insider trading case involving digital assets that the Department of Justice has pursued.</p>



<p>The sentencing came less than a week after the ex-head of product at non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea, Nathaniel Chastain, was convicted of fraud and money laundering for using inside knowledge of which assets would be featured on the platform’s homepage to accrue illegal profits. According to the DOJ, this was the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-ever-nft-insider-trading-case-heads-to-trial-2c5e9e97">first-ever insider trading scheme</a> involving crypto.</p>



<p>Chastain will be sentenced at a later date, but he faces a maximum of 40 years in prison.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Ethereum Foundation has transferred 30 million worth of ETH to Kraken igniting massive sell-off concerns among users.&nbsp;</li>



<li>ETH price plunged by 4%, hanging on to the $1,900 mark on May 7 before sliding below the resistance following the sell-off rumours. </li>



<li>Digital asset analysts have drawn similar patterns with the last two sell-offs by the Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik Buterin.</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereums-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-exchange-deposits-spike-to-an-8-month-high/">Ethereum</a> (ETH) trades at $1,832 after a rough weekend for digital assets plagued with congestion on the Bitcoin Network and massive sell-off concerns.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xedbb0d22f37376b415e449d582a14afd162b92ba801916547834551f499201c8">data</a> from crypto analytics firm Lookonchain, Vitalik Buterin transferred almost half a million worth of ETH to Kraken before the Ethereum foundation did the same with about $30 million worth of ETH.</p>



<p>At the time of both transactions, ETH exchanged hands at $1,960, with bulls holding on to the thoughts of $2,000. The price of ETH has trickled down weeks after the Shapella update, although its on-chain data still point upwards.</p>



<p>The transfer of millions worth of digital assets to exchange often indicates a rising balance springing up selling pressure from traders. In this case, despite the transfer of $30 million and mounting sell pressure, ETH balances on exchanges dropped from 18.22 million to 18.15 million over the weekend, showing signs of a strong recovery.</p>



<p>Sequel to the news, digital asset analysts compared market trends from past sales of ETH by the foundation and Buterin. The last big sale came in 2021, when 20,000 ETH was sold before the bear market kicked in. On the flip side, the foundation has also made large sales in the past during bull cycles, with the price surging.</p>



<p> Although large sales in the past preceded ETH plunging into the red zone, little or no lines can be drawn to establish a connection between the sale and the market’s bearish outlook.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-eth-bulls-look-toward-a-breakout-above-2k">ETH bulls look toward a breakout above $2k</h2>



<p>ETH now exchanges hands at $1,847, a 4.32% drop in the past 72 hours as the wider crypto market goes red. Despite this drop, on-chain indicators like ETH&#8217;s 200-day exponential moving average look good to push through the resistance.</p>



<p>Furthermore, data aggregator Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1654355262638288897?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">believes</a> that the huge inflow of ETH in exchanges could spark an initial uptick in price similar to the scenario in 2022. The firm took to Twitter to explain that ETH looks set to decouple from Bitcoin on the verge of breaking $2k.</p>



<p>“<em>Updating our report on #Ethereum&#8217;s sky-high active deposits, exchange addresses interacting on the network is now at its highest level since November 2021. As expected, $ETH is showing decoupling signs and on the cusp of breaking $2k once again,” </em>the tweet reads.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Bitcoin transaction fees hit the highest point in nearly two years over the weekend, with some users paying a little over $26. </li>



<li>Several voices within the Bitcoin community have viewed the congestion leading to high fees as a direct attack on the network.</li>



<li>Binance temporarily halts transactions twice before reverting to regular business, describing it as a learning process. </li>
</ul>



<p>The debate on the purpose of Bitcoin (BTC) Ordinals is now at the fore of community spaces following record ordinal mints leading to the congestion of the network.</p>



<p>The Bitcoin network was overwhelmed through the weekend, resulting in rising transaction fees to the dismay of users. In less than two weeks, unconfirmed transactions on the mempool surged from 134,000 to 469,000 on May 7, causing a 343% increase in transaction fees.</p>



<p>The surge in transaction fees was the highest recorded in two years, with high-priority transactions costing up to 654 sat/vB (approximately $26), according to mempool.space. Most users bemoaned the predicament pointing fingers at Bitcoin Ordinals, while others called it an attack on the network.</p>



<p>Over the past week, BTC Ordinals have occasioned a daily rise in trading volume, with currently over 3 million mints within its first 5 months. Despite chain data pointing to the hike in fees to Ordinals, users took to Twitter to claim their beloved assets were under attack. </p>



<p>Twitter user @proofofjogi <a href="https://twitter.com/proofofjogi/status/1655157035804098561?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">claimed</a> that we are in the “<em>then-they-fight-you stage.”</em></p>



<p><em>“High transaction fees are the chosen pain point by the attacker, probably to make Bitcoin unusable for smaller players. We&#8217;re in the then-they-fight-you-stage,</em>” he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin maxi Dylan LeClair also restated the “<em>attack vector” theory,</em> although he added that it will have no impact on the network in the long run.</p>



<p>“<em>Pretty obvious attack vector for three later agencies with an infinite budget over the short-term. Changes nothing over the long term tho, though miners thank ‘em.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-resumes-btc-withdrawals-following-shaky-weekend"><strong>Binance resumes BTC withdrawals following shaky weekend</strong></h2>



<p>Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, temporarily halted BTC withdrawal twice in 24 hours, citing network congestion. The exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1655419622764720128?s=46&amp;t=sCvh3f3rMDfXyJcf1y1Eyg">resumed</a> withdrawals, with transactions now successfully sent to wallets. </p>



<p>In a statement released by the exchange, fees have been adjusted to prevent a similar occurrence. At the same time, close monitoring will continue to be carried out, including exploring the Bitcoin Lightning Network.</p>



<p>“<em>We’re looking to enable BTC Lightning network withdrawals for users within the next few months. The BTC Lightning network works just like any network; users can withdraw via the Lightning network from the Binance platform into their private wallets.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>The decision of Binance to pause withdrawals sparked concerns about the exchange’s health on social media leading to a slight drop in price. BTC now trades at $27,635 at the time of writing, a 3% fall in the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and former CEO of the failed FTX crypto exchange, has filed pre-trial motions to dismiss most of the charges levelled against him by United States prosecutors.</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s attorneys are arguing that the implosion of FTX in November resulted from the so-called “crypto winter” and not any cruel intention. Their argument also lays blame on the U.S. government over its hostile regulatory environment around crypto assets in recent years.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-classic-rush-to-judgement"><strong>“A Classic Rush To Judgement”</strong></h2>



<p>Sam Bankman-Fried, who is set to face criminal trial in October, has moved to dismiss all but three allegations against him.</p>



<p>In May 8 filings in the Southern District Court in New York, SBF’s lawyers sought to dismiss everything apart from charges alleging conspiracy to commit commodities fraud, conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sam Bankman-Fried has filed motions to dismiss all but three charges in the criminal case against him.<br><br>The charges he is not contesting atm are:<br>5. Conspiracy to commit commodities fraud<br>6. Conspiracy to commit securities fraud<br>and<br>11. Conspiracy to commit money laundering <a href="https://t.co/0Dk1zxEw4j">pic.twitter.com/0Dk1zxEw4j</a></p>&mdash; Molly White (@molly0xFFF) <a href="https://twitter.com/molly0xFFF/status/1655751738568196096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The disgraced FTX founder, who is currently on house arrest in his parent’s home in Palo Alto, faces a total of 13 different charges ranging from wire fraud to bribery claims. His lawyers are, however, seeking the dismissal of 10 of these charges. The pretrial motions contend that four of the charges added from February, including foreign bribery, campaign finance, and bank fraud, violate “Treaty’s rule of specialty provision.” According to the “rule of specialty”, the U.S. should only trial Bankman-Fried for the offenses for which he was extradited from the Bahamas.</p>



<p>The early defense effort also asserts that the remaining six charges should be dismissed because the federal prosecutors failed to state an adequate offense in these counts.</p>



<p>Furthermore, SBF’s defence argues that the U.S. prosecutors’ pursuit of the fallen crypto star is a “classic rush to judgment.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Blame Crypto Winter, Not FTX: SBF’s Defense Team</strong></h2>



<p>The legal team also contends that the bankruptcy of Bahamas-based FTX — once the third-biggest cryptocurrency exchange in terms of trading volume with a valuation of around $32 billion — was the result of a broader “crypto winter” last year, which saw the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dive, rather than failure to back FTX’s native token FTT, or secret loans from FTX to affiliated trading firm Alameda Research as alleged by prosecutors.</p>



<p>The defense claimed that “every major participant” in the crypto sector “cratered,” and compared the fall of various crypto companies to the infamous 2008 global financial crisis, which spurred the popularity of bitcoin and the blossoming of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>“Like many other cryptocurrency market participants and many other start-ups that experience exponential growth in a short period, FTX did not have fully developed controls and risk management protocols,” SBF’s defense posited. “FTX, like other market participants, was susceptible to a broader market collapse.”</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried’s estimated fortune of $26 billion, largely accrued during the crypto bull market, was seriously eroded after his crypto empire crumbled last year. Still, prosecutors have accused the former crypto mogul of splurging billions of customer funds on luxury property in the Bahamas, funding sports teams, and political donations in the United States.</p>

<p>Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continued to trade flatly towards the weekend, extending a two-week-long period of lacklustre price volatility.</p>



<p>Since plunging following the Shanghai-Shapella upgrade, the asset’s outlook has continued to weaken, with its price bouncing between $1,825 and $1,930. This weakness has resulted from various issues, key among them exchange inflow, which could be fuelling short-selling.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-exchange-deposits-soar"><strong>Exchange Deposits Soar</strong></h2>



<p>According to crypto analytics firm Santiment, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-mints-more-sharks-and-whales-amid-discounted-prices/">Ethereum</a> is facing another bout of turbulence as it experiences a fresh influx of coins into exchange addresses.</p>



<p>On Friday, the firm noted that the asset’s active exchange deposits had hit an eight-month high, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may soon be poised for increased volatility.</p>



<p><em>“Ethereum&#8217;s active deposits just hit an 8-month high,”</em> the firm tweeted, noting that&nbsp; Ether saw over 9,000 unique deposit addresses on exchanges. Notably, this has been the highest amount since September 15.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="657" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-1024x657.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80669" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-1024x657.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-300x192.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14-768x493.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-14.png 1428w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And while the cause of this surge in exchange deposits is still unclear, the firm warned that this trend could lead to an outcome similar to the spikes observed during the merge and FTX collapse. These incidents caused significant volatility in the Ethereum market, creating an unfavourable trading environment for many.</p>



<p>Today’s news comes just days after the firm reported a single transfer of 273,781 Ethereum tokens to Binance, one of the largest self-custody to-exchange transfers in five years.</p>



<p>“<em>With a $505M transfer of Ethereum tokens onto Binance today, this is one of the largest self-custody to exchange transfers in 5 years,”</em> the firm tweeted on Tuesday, May 2. Reportedly, the transfer also led to the largest daily exchange supply increase since the day before the merge.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ether’s&nbsp;Price Outlook</strong></h2>



<p>Normally, when users deposit cryptocurrencies onto exchanges, it indicates that they intend to sell or trade them. Selling can indicate potential negative price movement, so the recent surge in exchange deposits for Ethereum should be a cause for concern for investors and traders.</p>



<p>In the past two weeks, Ether whales with 1,000 to 10,000 Ethereum have offloaded&nbsp;over 110,000 Ether, according to a recent tweet by crypto analyst “Ali-charts.”</p>



<p>According to analyst “Crypto Patel”, Ether’s chart currently shows a strong range-bound market, with strong support at $1800 and resistance at $1930. In his view, there are currently two potential scenarios for Ether’s price.</p>



<p>Either the $1800 support breaks leading to a drop to $1400-$1500, or the $1800 support holds, and the price pushes to the $1930 resistance. If the price breaches that resistance, it could surge to $2100-$2500.</p>
