<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Samsung has announced it will roll out its Samsung Wallet mobile app to another eight countries.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The Korea firm launched the app in June 2022, and expanded it to 21 countries before the latest announcement.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>The wallet app integrates with the Samsung Blockchain Wallet for cryptocurrencies.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Samsung Electronics has announced that its unified <a href="https://coinjournal.net/wallets/">mobile wallet application</a> Samsung Wallet will now be available in eight more countries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The South Korea-based tech giant revealed it would be rolling out the wallet app across Singapore, Australia, Brazil, Hong Kong, Canada, India, Malaysia and Taiwan. Support for the Samsung Wallet in these countries will go live by the end of January.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the company noted in a <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-wallet-will-be-available-in-eight-new-markets" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">news release</a> that the exact timing of the launch will vary and depend on user devices and the specific market.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Samsung&rsquo;s mobile payments platform grows</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Samsung launched the wallet app in 2022, with support since its unveiling in June having increased from an initial seven countries to 21 countries by the date of the latest announcement.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, the Samsung Wallet app is available for Samsung Galaxy users in Korea, UK, the US, Bahrain, China, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Norway, Oman, Qatar, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Vietnam, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More than a payments platform, the app also <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/samsung-introduce-a-new-blockchain-wallet-app/">integrates</a> with the Samsung Blockchain Wallet and comes with safety features enhanced by Samsung Knox, an inbuilt proprietary security platform.</p>
<p dir="ltr">So, while Samsung&rsquo;s wallet app is not crypto-specific, users with supported devices can leverage it to do things like keeping tabs on their digital assets portfolio. The wallet allows for this via an interface that enables access to cryptocurrency prices across multiple exchanges.</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Nexo reached a $45 million settlement with US regulators, including the SEC.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>The crypto lender allegedly offered unregistered securities via its Earn Interest Product.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>Nexo will pay $22.5 to state regulators and the rest to the SEC, with this expected in the next 12 months.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/nexo/">Nexo</a>, a Cayman Islands corporation founded in 2018 and a leading crypto lender, will pay $45 million as settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).</p>
<p dir="ltr">NASAA announced the settlement late Thursday, noting Nexo had agreed to pay the penalties following the outcome of a comprehensive investigation into an interest product the crypto platform allegedly offered to US customers.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Nexo settlement closes multi-year investigation</h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.nasaa.org/67039/nasaa-and-sec-announce-45-million-settlement-with-nexo-capital-over-interest-bearing-account/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a> announcing the settlement, the charges related to Nexo&rsquo;s offering and sale of alleged unregistered securities via its Earned Interest Product (EIP). The regulatory watchdog noted 17 US state securities regulators had agreed to the reported settlement, with more set to accept it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>T</em><em>his settlement recognises the important work of state securities regulators and the SEC in making sure that those who are investing their hard-earned money have all the information necessary to understand the risks and rewards of their decisions</em>,&rdquo; said Charlie Clark, Director, Washington Department of Financial Institutions Agency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nexo commented on the landmark settlement via a <a href="https://nexo.io/media-center/nexo-reaches-landmark-resolution-with-us-regulators" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog release</a>, confirming it had been reached on a &ldquo;<em>no-admit-no-deny basis</em>.&rdquo; This closes a multi-year probe into Nexo&rsquo;s offerings, particularly its interest bearing accounts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Nexo, the regulators&rsquo; inquiries over the past year or so showed the company had not engaged in any fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nexo believes that the company has been recognized for what it truly is &ndash; a pioneer, like Uber and Airbnb, providing disruptive solutions in a fast-paced environment.</p>
<p>4/9</p>
<p>&mdash; Nexo (@Nexo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1616195617574854656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>We are content with this unified resolution which unequivocally puts an end to all speculations around Nexo&rsquo;s relations to the United States. We can now focus on what we do best &ndash; build seamless financial solutions for our worldwide audience</em>,&rdquo; said Nexo co-founder Antoni Trenchev.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto lender will pay $22.5 million to state securities regulators and the rest to the SEC, with the payments made over the next 12 months. Notably. Nexo was in the process of a phased out exit from the United States market.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nexo&rsquo;s native token NEXO rose in the aftermath of the announcement, and was changing hands around $0.84 on Friday afternoon. The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/nexo/">NEXO price</a> was up by more than 17% in the past 24 hours as at 12:10 pm ET</p>

<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Fantom Foundation, the platform behind the Fantom (FTM) blockchain announced the launch of Ecosystem Vault on Friday.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><em><strong>Vault is a decentralised funding mechanism that will be financed by 10% of FTM transaction fees.</strong></em></li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong><em>The funds in the vault are available to projects that get 55% approval in community-driven governance vote.</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/fantom/">Fantom</a>, a scalable Layer-1 blockchain platform, has officially launched Ecosystem Vault, a decentralised funding pool that will empower and help builders deploy new community-driven projects on the blockchain.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Vault to boost Fantom&rsquo;s dApps ecosystem</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Announcing that Vault was officially live, Fantom noted in a <a href="https://fantom.foundation/blog/ecosystem-vault-now-live/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">blog post</a> that the funding mechanism will encompass governance proposals from the community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project represents Fantom&rsquo;s continuing evolution as the community eyes further decentralisation, the Fantom Foundation team wrote.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Vault&rsquo;s on-chain mechanism allows for a funding profile where projects and developers seeking to build decentralised apps (dApps) in the ecosystem can secure financing. As noted above, the funding pool also gives the Fantom community a chance to contribute to the growth of the blockchain via their funding decisions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Per the Fantom Foundation, the Ecosystem Vault will get funds from 10% of transaction fees. The community controls these funds, which are a result of a reduction in the burn rate of native token FTM. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Anyone can apply for the funds in the Vault, a process that requires applicants to create a Fantom Governance proposal (has 100 FTM fee). Afterwards, the proposal will need approval from 55% of the community based on 55% quorum. The Foundation tweeted:</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">5/ A proposal must receive at least 55% approval with 55% quorum to be considered successful. <a href="https://twitter.com/llamapay_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Llamapay_io</a> will be used to distribute all funding. Only wallet addresses included in the application can be paid.</p>
<p>&mdash; Fantom Foundation (@FantomFDN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1616120331478990848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>As of Friday, 20 January, 2023 at 11:06 am ET, the vault <a href="https://vault.fantom.network/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">held</a> roughly 69,247 FTM tokens valued at just over $21,000.</p>

</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have lost more than 65% of their value since the all-time high of November 2021.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin&rsquo;s recovery will not happen overnight</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dan Ashmore, a cryptocurrency analyst at Coinjournal,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/01/11/crypto-analyst-breaks-down-decline-bitcoin-millionaires.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>told CNBC</u></a> in a recent interview that the price recovery of cryptocurrencies will not happen overnight. When commenting about the price collapse last year, Ashmore said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Entering 2022, we were at the tail-end of one of the longest and most explosive Bull Runs in recent memory. And then the world is gripped by this inflation crisis post-pandemic. We also experienced one of the swiftest rate hike cycles in recent memories. That sucked the liquidity out of all these risky assets. It is not overly surprising that we have seen this massive pullback.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/20/1674230971916-49ee06fe-a239-4d3b-a34d-e4864740e165.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" width="600" height="334"></em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The macro climate will play a role in market recovery&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/price/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $21,163, down by more than 60% from the all-time high. While commenting on the possibility of price recovery, Ashmore said the macro climate would play a huge role in that regard. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;In the last month or so, we have seen slightly more positive readings. It still has a long way to go, but it is brighter than it looked a month or two ago. We still have a long way to go before we get back to that $69,000 all-time high. This is not going to be an overnight process.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that the rise depends on a whole range of variables in the macro climate going our way. Furthermore, the avoidance of incidents such as the LUNA, FTX, and Celsius crashes could help boost the market in the long term.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The analyst pointed out that the reports only indicated the assets held by the exchanges and didn&rsquo;t reveal the liabilities of the companies.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Several exchanges, including Binance and OKX, have published their proof of reserve reports in the last few months.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Proof of reserves didn&rsquo;t include liabilities</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Dan Ashmore, a cryptocurrency analyst at Coinjournal,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/01/17/bitcoin-21000-three-arrows-founders-crypto-debt-platform-crypto-world.html"><u>told CNBC</u></a> in a recent interview that the audit reports by cryptocurrency exchanges were not entirely accurate.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Last month, accounting firm Mazars Group&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/16/mazars-suspends-all-work-with-crypto-clients-including-binance-cryptocom.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>suspended all work</u></a> with its crypto clients, including&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Binance</u></a>, KuCoin and Crypto.com. When asked about the move, Ashmore said the move was a disappointing one for the crypto industry. He stated that;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;It is disappointing, but it is not surprising. When you look at those audit reports, they were anything but an audit. It was essentially a statement of reserves. But there was no mention of liabilities. It is not possible to do an audit without mentioning liabilities. These proof of reserves need to become proper audits.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Ashmore added that third-party entities need to look at these centralised exchanges and make financial assessments. However, due to the lack of in-depth information, it is impossible to do so at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Centralised exchanges continue to publish proof of reserves</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Since the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange in November 2022, centralised crypto exchanges have been publishing proof of reserves to show their users that they have assets on their platforms.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the OKX crypto exchange&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/okx-publishes-proof-of-reserves-report-has-assets-worth-7-5b/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>published a proof-of-reserves report</u></a>. The report revealed that the exchange has a total of $7.5 billion worth of assets in reserves which do not include its native token, OKB.</p>

These industries include healthcare, transportation, and financial services, to name a few.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of hidden things and the curtains are about to get off. Because blockchains are decentralized, transparent, and boost the capacity of an entire network, they open the door for innovations that require a large amount of computational power to be implemented.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most significantly, they give customers the ability to exercise control over their assets, which may include their data, without having to rely on any outside parties.</p>
<p>As blockchain technology continues to advance, businesses all over the world are collaborating to discover the most effective methods to apply the technology in a variety of contexts. In order to gather deeper insight, we have sought out initiatives that are changing industries and pushing blockchain closer to the lives of people on a daily basis.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The medical innovation &nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">For a very long time, physicians or health institutions all over the world have been thought of as the exclusive owners of medical records.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A database in Argentina that contained sensitive data such as governmental IDs including tax ID numbers with over 115,000 persons who filed for COVID-19 circulation licenses was breached in the year 2020. This database contained the information of everyone who applied for the licenses.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Turning the pitiable state of patients into a comfortable one</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Because of this occurrence, ShelterZoom decided to develop a system that would safeguard the medical records of its customers from any future cyber breaches that are comparable to this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to empower patients with full ownership and control over their medical information, the firm developed a smart-document software-as-a-service supplier and collaborated with a private hospital.</p>
<p>Users are able to access medical record panels and do any and all essential procedures whenever they choose by utilizing a mobile app or extension based on blockchain technology. It also gives patients the ability to monitor email attachments and access privileges to those documents, irrespective of whether the receiver of the email has even opened it.</p>
<p>As a direct result of the agreement, more than 300,000 individuals have permission to the Web3 application. Additionally, there are plans in place to make the service available to other healthcare professionals in Argentina in the near future.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of several experts, projects centered on first-party information will eventually replace analytics in advertising and serve as the basis for personalization. Users are given the ability to monetize their own data through Web3, and consumers stand to gain considerably as a result of this fundamental innovation that is made possible by blockchain technology.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The authority leading to data confidentiality&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In the decades that have passed since the introduction of the internet, data has evolved into an extremely valuable resource.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Traditionally, users have donated their personal data to services and websites for free, and they do not receive any monetary advantage when those businesses sell their personal data to other parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users are able to once again exercise control over their own data and decide for themselves whether or not to commercialize it for their personal advantage when using Web3.</p>
<p>Dimo is a decentralized system for transport data that gives users the ability to produce vehicle data recordings that have been confirmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owners have the ability to privately share this information with apps, which provides them with the ability to negotiate cheaper insurance and finance prices. The native DIMO token can be earned as a reward for both referrals and active involvement in the network.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of several experts, projects centered on first-party content will soon overtake cookies in marketing and serve as the basis for personalization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users are given the ability to monetize their own data through Web3, and consumers stand to gain considerably as a result of this fundamental innovation that is made possible by blockchain technology.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The luxurious leverages of blockchain&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Customers of high-end brands can now easily confirm the genuineness of their purchases thanks to the Aura Blockchain Consortium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, Prada is guaranteeing the authenticity and transparency of its recycled gold jewelry and diamonds through a relationship with Aura, allowing customers to track the items from mine to finger.</p>
<p>By the same token, there are certain AI-based <a href="https://coinjournal.net/robots/">trading bots</a> too, <a href="https://the-ethereumcode-pro.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">go URL</a> and know how these bots have turned basic trading mechanisms into luxurious ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, and other LVMH labels are also part of the group. The company provides its customers with an Aura-powered diamond certificate detailing the features, history, and travel of each stone.</p>
<p>The jewelry trade has struggled with the issue of traceability for a long time, notably in regard to diamonds, despite the trade&rsquo;s efforts to sell only conflict-free gems.</p>
<p>While ConsenSys developed the blockchain infrastructure and the traceability <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a> for Aura, the Ethereum blockchain is the foundation around which Aura is built. Mercedes-Benz and Cartier are two additional members of the funding group.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">The silver lining&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain technology is being adopted in a wide variety of industries, from healthcare to gaming to supply chain management to digital identity verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Ethereum as well as other blockchains now able to store and run computer code, the number of potential applications for this cutting-edge technology has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve dispelled the misconceptions that cryptocurrencies serve as a bank for the unbanked, provide a safe haven from inflation and that Decentralized Finance (DeFi) financial engineering can produce higher returns than any other asset class.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, though, people have returned to ask about the practical applications of digital assets rather than my forecasts for their <a href="https://coinjournal.net/price/">future prices</a>. And that&rsquo;s making headway.</p>
<p>The recent events may prove to be a blessing in disguise by shifting the blockchain industry&rsquo;s focus from financial engineering to more appealing business applications that actually add value.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Some individuals are under the impression that it will take the place of the conventional financial system and are excited to be a part of the transition.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong here? Maybe you are not linked with <a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-crypto-trading-bots/">reliable trading bots</a> like bitcoin prime and your investments are con artists who have the intention of using their crypto token holdings to become wealthy very rapidly, and their methods are improving each day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cursory glance at crypto fraud, along with some steps you may do to protect yourself, is presented here.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is a crypto scam?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Mining is the process that must be carried out between the two parties. This requires users to execute complex mathematical computations on behalf of everybody on the network, send off some details about themselves, and then wait for their reward.</p>
<p>Few individuals have a firm grasp on how cryptocurrencies function because of their complexity and the emergence of new cryptocurrencies. In other words, you risk losing your money to con artists who are hoping you&rsquo;ll invest in their scheme.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial to know about potential threats before taking any chances, whether they come in the form of phishing schemes or fraudulent apps promising free currency.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Unleashing the reason behind crypto fraud expansion</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There is a lot of public interest in the crypto market, which is highly volatile. The fact that there are more people to swindle is enough to make this an appealing environment for fraudsters.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission estimates an increase in complaints about cryptocurrency scams from 2021. In 2020, crypto fraud cost consumers a maximum of $130 million. The following year reports skyrocketed, and by 2021, the United States had lost $680 million.</p>
<p>Some frauds may go unreported because as many as 35% of victims didn&rsquo;t realize they could do so. As a result, this year&rsquo;s losses may be considerably greater.</p>
<p>A few of the reasons why scammers stick around in this industry are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Because cryptocurrencies are digital, hackers need just access to a computer to launch assaults.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When money is transferred, it can&rsquo;t be retrieved unless the recipient cancels the transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a decentralized system, cryptocurrencies offer no guarantee of payment to their owners.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person&rsquo;s identity will not be revealed during this procedure. You can avoid storing sensitive data as the crypto regulatory landscape develops. The source of funds can be traced, however, fraudsters might complicate matters by using several wallets. It&rsquo;s already hard enough to figure out who the wallet owners are.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anyone with cryptocurrency holdings is vulnerable to a crypto scam. To counter this, though, you have a few options for safety.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protecting your trading account from hackers&nbsp;</h2>
<h3 dir="ltr">VPN service</h3>
<p dir="ltr">To protect yourself from intrusions like this, consider signing up for a VPN.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the security of your cryptocurrency transactions, you may wish to sign up for a VPN service. If you invest for a year or more in advance, you can save money on a VPN service that normally costs between $5 to $15 per month.</p>
<p>VPNs offer usefulness outside of the crypto realm, such as when you want to watch foreign TV or hide your online behavior from your ISP.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">A big NO for public Wi-Fi</h3>
<p dir="ltr">There will be occasions when you need to access the internet away from home, and the allure of free public Wi-Fi in a local cafe or restaurant is understandable.</p>
<p>However, you may wish to stay away from free public Wi-Fi if you&rsquo;re conducting cryptocurrency transactions. Anyone in the vicinity can listen in on your web traffic using a program like Wireshark if you&rsquo;re utilizing a free, open Wi-Fi network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can usually detect if you are browsing <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">crypto sites</a> based on the data they collect. The possibility exists that they can even see your financial dealings.</p>
<p>While this won&rsquo;t directly lead to the theft of your cryptocurrency, a fraudster may decide to pay much particular examination to you if they notice you making purchases or browsing crypto sites with a big dollar amount. You don&rsquo;t want that type of focus, do you?</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Password&nbsp;</h3>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s tempting to use the same login for your wallet that you use for your favorite website, but you should avoid this.</p>
<p>If you use the same password for your wallet as you do for a site, then the hacker will have access to your key vault if your website password is compromised. (The key vault is typically taken during attacks of this nature.)</p>
<p>An attacker may theoretically use key-logging spyware to track your keystrokes while you type in your password or retrieve your unprotected vault data from your PC&rsquo;s RAM, regardless of how complex your password is.</p>
<p>These methods are quite clever, and to our knowledge, no crypto user has ever had their seed words compromised in this fashion. Unfortunately, this type of crime may become increasingly widespread as cryptocurrency usage grows.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, using a trading bot like <a href="https://bitcoinprimeapp.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">bitcoin prime</a> are others is a must.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Hardware Wallet</h3>
<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrency-guides/what-is-a-cryptocurrency-hardware-wallet/">hardware wallet</a> is a USB gadget that can contain your key vault and is one of the finest ways to keep your cryptocurrency secure. The device is built in such a way that your seed words remain encrypted even if they are removed.</p>
<p>It is very difficult for a hacker to infiltrate a hardware wallet with malware because it does not have access to the Internet.</p>
<p>You must pair your hardware wallet with your smartphone or tablet via USB or Bluetooth before each transaction. To conduct transactions without disclosing your private key to a potentially malware-infected device, the wallet generates a signature and transmits it to your internet-connected device.</p>
<p>Even if your hardware wallet were taken, the attacker would have a hard time accessing your cryptocurrency because of the PIN code.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Authentication Software</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The security of your online wallet can be bolstered by using a third-party authenticator tool like Google Authenticator for two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since authenticator apps don&rsquo;t use SMS text communication to give you the pullout code, an attacker who gains access to your phone&rsquo;s service or who is able to mirror your messages will still be unable to obtain your withdrawal code.</p>
<p>Using an authenticator app means the hacker must physically obtain your device in order to access the 2FA code. As an additional safeguard, it outperforms the use of simple text messages.</p>
<p>It is possible for an attacker to circumvent the safety of the exchange even if you have two-factor authentication turned on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s possible that the exchange&rsquo;s withdrawal hold policy or other safeguards will prevent you from withdrawing your cryptocurrency in the event of a hack.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Summing Up&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">There is a growth in criminal behavior when the cryptocurrency market reaches new heights because more people are downloading wallets and joining sites for the first time.</p>
<p>As we&rsquo;ve seen, there are many ways to keep your cryptocurrency safe from this new breed of the crook, including two-factor authentication, pulling from an exchange, loading up the seed words, staying away from free public Wi-Fi, and utilizing a virtual private network (VPN).</p>
<p>Scammers will no doubt think of new ways to steal cryptocurrency in the future; we&rsquo;ll be certain to keep this page as necessary. For the time being, these are among the best methods for keeping your crypto safe.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Brett Harrison, the former FTX.US president, has raised $5 million in a seed round funding for his new <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/">crypto project</a> for institutional investors.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The new platform is a decentralised finance (DeFi) venture dubbed Architect and has been in stealth development since last September.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Architect raises $5 million in seed round</h2>
<p dir="ltr">An announcement Harrison released on Friday stated that Architect had secured the $5 million investment from some of the top venture investors within the crypto space, including Coinbase Ventures and Circle Ventures.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other investors to back the former FTX.US president&rsquo;s startup Architect are SALT Fund, Third King Venture Capital, Motivate Venture Capital and SV Angel. SkyBridge Capital&rsquo;s Antony Scaramucci has also invested in the new crypto software project.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key takeaway</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Play to Earn model became the starting point in the NFT gaming development but created a sustainable concept &ndash; NFT games are not for fun. They are for making money only.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Players do not support P2E games since making money during the red market is more challenging, and these games cannot offer anything interesting.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A new branch of industry is emerging that listens to users and develops games emphasising engagement and emotions.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Combined with the best traditions of WEB 2.0 games, the use of NFT becomes the realisation of an exciting tool that allows players to immerse in addictive gameplay and unleash their creativity while engaging in the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">NFT space continues to battle user attraction and retention</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/non-fungible-token-nft/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">NFT</a> direction has kept the crypto industry in good shape for several years. It has evolved from funny cats into a global trend that responds to all market circumstances and user requirements.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We have all witnessed the birth of NFT gaming and its several cycles of hype. The most powerful impetus for the jump was the appearance of good Play to Earn model implementation, where enthusiasts could earn thousands of dollars by completing in-game tasks. Not surprisingly, this motivation attracted a lot of users and started a vast P2E craze, where projects claiming to develop a game received large trading volumes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Their essence is approximately the same &ndash; &nbsp;users need to buy in-game objects, resources, and various virtual items to start playing. The cost of these virtual items ranges from a few cents to hundreds of dollars, but you can buy them only with in-game currency. Then, users who have purchased the necessary characters and resources begin to compete with each other and complete tasks, receiving rewards in the form of in-game currency that can be converted into real money.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The idea of such games is excellent. It&rsquo;s a win-win story for both game creators and players. However, the problem was that many of these games were not fun to play. Many of the early P2E games had rudimentary gameplay, basic graphics, and nothing more than rewards. The biggest challenge has always been user attraction and retention. And as soon as the crypto market bounced into the red zone in 2022, many P2P games focusing only on earning rewards began to lose users rapidly. When the game is not very fun, and players are kept only by receiving crypto rewards against a falling market, the attraction steadily goes to zero.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Investors in 2023 are looking for more than clone NFT games</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Thus, the current Play to Earn games are only a transitional stage, a link in the evolution of the entire gaming industry because it is impossible to exclude the NFT influence on the global gaming market. Already, unique NFT-based games are emerging that focus on gameplay and appeal to traditional players. They combine the best traditions of WEB 2.0 games and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/web-3-0/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WEB 3.0</a> technological possibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors in 2023 are looking towards something other than clone NFT games with only promises and cute websites. Now everyone is thinking about the players, the gameplay, and how to keep users from getting bored, immersing them in a unique world that captivates them for a long time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Using the example of the <a href="https://chainers.io/?utm_source=coinjornal&amp;utm_medium=article&amp;utm_campaign=promotion&amp;utm_content=Fun%20Over%20Profits:%20NFT%20Gaming%20Takes%20the%20Stage" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Chainers project</u></a>, which is powered by Polygon, you can trace an improved model for creating NFT games. The team&rsquo;s mission is to create a fascinating and addictive gameplay that will make Chainers stand out from other NFT games. Crypto game creators are interested in emotional connection with their players and develop strategies based on the users&rsquo; interests. In this context, NFT gives much more than just a few cents from some NFT elephant.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/20/1674219853848-b14bc4c0-17c5-4e39-b97c-4cdad2b9a7c0.jpg" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-fil" width="600" height="336"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Chainers is a crafting story based on the creative economy and a fancy design, which traditional players worldwide appreciate. Players don&rsquo;t need to buy their first asset to explore their adventures. The free-to-start concept immediately removes the barriers and lets them into the unique world of NFT gaming, which includes full self-expression, rich design, the ability to play by your own rules and get tremendous pleasure from completing various tasks. The team is on track with their roadmap and has already implemented several features that scale the Chainers community. The developers&rsquo; task is to provide value to the players already at the first release stage and not to make them wait until the long process of developing the game is completed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
