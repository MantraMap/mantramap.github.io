            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a successful breakout above the critical $30K resistance level, Bitcoin&#8217;s price is currently maintaining its position above this level. However, there are concerning indications emerging that suggest a potential retracement or change in direction in the near future.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Daily Chart:</strong></h3>
<p>After a strong bullish breakout above the crucial resistance level at $30K, the upward momentum in Bitcoin&#8217;s price has halted on the daily chart.</p>
<p>The price is currently consolidating above this level, but caution is advised as the RSI indicator is signaling overbought conditions, indicating a potential short-term decline. If it retreats below $30K, the recent breakout could be considered false, leading to a possible reversal.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, the 50-day moving average around $28K and the 200-day moving average near $25K would likely act as support levels.</p>

<h3><strong>The 4-Hour Chart:</strong></h3>
<p>Examining the 4-hour timeframe, it is clear that the price of Bitcoin is currently in a consolidation phase, tightly ranging above the previously breached $30K resistance level.</p>
<p>This consolidation follows a rapid and steep ascent after breaking out from a significant descending channel. Although the RSI indicator is hovering near the midpoint of 50% in this timeframe, there is a notable chance of a short-term retracement, particularly if the $30K level is unable to sustain the price.</p>

<h2><strong>On-chain Analysis</strong></h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/profile/u/Edris?tab=quicktake" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Bitcoin Miners Position Index</strong></h3>
<p>Analyzing the behavior of Bitcoin miners can provide valuable insights, especially following the recent price rally above the important $30K resistance level. Miners play a crucial role in the Bitcoin network, and their actions can significantly impact the market.</p>
<p>The Miners&#8217; Position Index Metric (MPI) is depicted in the chart, representing the ratio of total miner outflow (in USD) to its one-year moving average. A higher value indicates that miners are sending more coins than usual, suggesting potential selling activity. If miners collectively sell a portion of their reserves, it could trigger a decline.</p>
<p>The chart clearly shows a notable increase in MPI during the recent upward movement of BTC&#8217;s price above $30K.</p>
<p>This can be interpreted as miners selling some of their holdings to ensure they can cover their operational expenses, particularly if there is a market downturn in the future. However, if this selling behavior continues, it may result in an oversupply of Bitcoin and potentially lead to a significant price crash. Investors should exercise caution and monitor this situation closely.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Max Keiser is of the opinion that Ripple will lose its case against the SEC. However, the reason is different from what you may think. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Max Keiser has once again come out with a comment on the ongoing case between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple &#8211; the company behind XRP.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin permabull thinks Ripple will lose, but the reason is not what many might think.</p>
<ul>
<li>Max Keiser is a well-known proponent of Bitcoin &#8211; one that&#8217;s been very vocal about the primary cryptocurrency&#8217;s merits.</li>
<li>He&#8217;s also bashed multiple altcoins on many different occasions, and Ripple&#8217;s XRP hasn&#8217;t been an exception.</li>
<li>In a recent tweet, he said that Ripple will definitely lose its case against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. But why?</li>
<li>Well, Keiser seems to think that Gensler &#8211; the SEC&#8217;s Chairman &#8211; is a &#8220;leg-breaker for the banking mob.&#8221;</li>
<li>Citing an article from the Wall Street Journal where the SEC called out spot Bitcoin ETF filings &#8220;inadequate,&#8221; he said:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>As explained, the SEC runs a protection racket for Wall St. crooks so this is no big surprise. It also means XRP will definitely lose their case &#8211; as well as everything not Bitcoin (BTC is untouchable).</p>
<p>Not on the basis of law, but because Gary&#8217;s a leg-breaker for the banking mob.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Just a week ago, Keiser also openly called Ripple a Ponzi Scheme while maintaining that the SEC will &#8220;kill XPR.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The meme coin landscape is continuing to evolve every week, creating an abundance of opportunities for dramatic gains.</p>
<p>One token garnering significant attention from the masses is <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a>, a new and culturally resonant project in the meme coin space.</p>
<p>Given its unique value proposition and appealing tokenomics, there’s a growing consensus among low-cap crypto traders that $THUG could be the next big meme coin once it makes its open-market debut.</p>
<h2>Unique Hip-Hop Themed $THUG Token Makes Its Mark</h2>
<p>Thug Life, using the ticker symbol $THUG, stands out from the plethora of meme coins by grounding itself in the richness of hip-hop culture.</p>
<p>Paying homage to the Thug Life movement of the 80s, the project aims to foster a sense of resilience amid the ever-changing crypto landscape.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the $THUG token seeks to create a community and rally supporters thanks to its hilarious market-themed memes.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258134" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="365" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-300x182.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This appealing setup has already managed to attract the attention of investors, amassing over $150,000 in the first two days of its presale.</p>
<p>The presale&#8217;s allure has also been driven by the fact that early investors can buy $THUG tokens for just $0.0007 – with no price increase scheduled during the presale&#8217;s lifespan.</p>
<p>If that wasn&#8217;t enough, Thug Life also benefits from potential links with rap icon Snoop Dogg, referenced multiple times in the project&#8217;s branding.</p>
<p>Although there&#8217;s no direct link between Thug Life and Snoop yet, the rapper is no stranger to the world of cryptocurrency – meaning there&#8217;s certainly scope for collaboration if things continue moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><strong>Visit Thug Life Presale</strong></a></p>
<h2>Thug Life’s Transparency &amp; Community Focus Set Stage for Success</h2>
<p>Importantly, Thug Life’s team aims to ensure the project is more than just a catchy name – they also plan to make $THUG as transparent as possible, an approach that&#8217;s unfortunately fallen by the wayside in the meme coin space.</p>
<p>As noted on the <a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life website</a>, the team has pledged to lock liquidity for three months post-presale, effectively safeguarding investors from rug pull scenarios.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258133" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="343" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Moreover, 70% of the total token supply has been allocated to presale investors, emphasizing the team&#8217;s commitment to building a strong community.</p>
<p>By enabling early supporters to secure a stake in the project’s success, Thug Life creates the foundation for a loyal community base – evidenced by the huge influx of new members to the official <a href="https://t.me/thuglifetoken" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a>.</p>
<p>Thug Life’s <a href="https://twitter.com/thug_life_token" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Twitter page</a> has also rocketed to over 2,500 followers in the space of two days, further showcasing the project’s widespread appeal.</p>
<h2>Investor Excitement Grows About Potential $THUG Price Surge</h2>
<p>Speculation is already rife that Thug Life could be the next big sensation in the meme coin market.</p>
<p>Jacob Bury, a well-known crypto influencer, has already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVtbCRWEmgA&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=JacobCryptoBury" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">predicted</a> a price surge once $THUG makes its debut on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) after the presale ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-258132" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="295" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The project’s commitment to community engagement has been referenced in both videos, given that Thug Life&#8217;s team has already planned a post-presale airdrop campaign.</p>
<p>Details are still scarce on this campaign, but the team has set aside 15% of the total token supply for community rewards – hinting that the airdrop could significantly benefit early adopters.</p>
<p>Ultimately, only time will tell whether this hip-hop-themed crypto project will be the next big crypto, but one thing is for certain &#8211; $THUG is undoubtedly a project to watch closely in the weeks ahead.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Kraken's issues with US government agencies continue. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kraken has been ordered to turn over sensitive user information for clients that had transactions worth in total over $20,000 over the course of a year.</p>
<p>The tax agency said it wants to determine whether crypto investors have been cheating on their tax reports.</p>
<ul>
<li>The IRS filed the initial court petition in the Northern District of California earlier this year, claiming that it had previously issued summons to the exchange in 2021 that the latter ignored. The agency also said it wants to check for tax liabilities for users transacting in the aforementioned amount between 2016 and 2020.</li>
<li>Now, Judge Joseph Spero <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.407965/gov.uscourts.cand.407965.34.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">ordered</a> Kraken to turn over the required information, which includes the user&#8217;s name, pseudonyms, if any, taxpayer identification number, phone number, email and physical address, birthdate, etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Court must determine whether the Government’s summons is narrowly tailored, that is, whether it is &#8216;no broader than necessary to achieve its purpose.&#8217; The Court finds that to the extent the first three requests are aimed at establishing the identities of the Kraken account holders who fall within the Doe definition, the information sought in these requests is much broader than what is necessary to achieve that purpose for the vast majority of Doe users.&#8221; &#8211; the Judge wrote.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>However, Judge Spero has seemingly rejected the IRS&#8217; requests to receive more detailed information regarding the users&#8217; source of wealth, employment data, etc.</li>
<li>Kraken was among the first crypto entities to go under the regulatory scope of another US government agency &#8211; the Securities and Exchange Commission.</li>
<li>A few months before the SEC went after Binance, Coinbase, and several digital assets, it reached an <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-eth-plunge-4-following-sec-termination-of-kraken-staking/" data-wpel-link="internal">agreement</a> with the veteran US exchange to halt its staking service and pay $30 million in disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A year after invading Ukraine, Russia’s military fundraising groups have raised millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies despite sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>While it appears that Russian military procurement and disinformation groups have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/russia-has-received-over-2-million-in-cryptocurrency-donations-chainalysis-says/" data-wpel-link="internal">raised</a> about $4.2 million, comparatively smaller than Ukraine’s over $212 million, research by blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/crypto-payments-to-russian-military-fundraisers-reaches-20-million-amid-ukraine-counter-offensive-and-wagner-revolt/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">discovered</a> that the nation has raised as much as $20 million in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Russian Military Groups Raise $20M in Crypto</h2>
<p>Elliptic made the discoveries after NATO allies identified and sanctioned new Russian financiers. A deeper analysis showed that half of the donated funds came through U.S.-sanctioned entities.</p>
<p>More than 80% of the funds from the sanctioned pro-Russian entities were traced to centralized crypto exchanges, showing that they were the most common destination for the assets. Besides centralized platforms, the entities also engaged with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, including cross-chain bridges, non-fungible token (NFT) services, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs).</p>
<p>Among the sanctioned entities are individuals and groups that have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pro-russian-outfits-turn-to-crypto-fundraising-to-support-war-efforts-against-ukraine-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">embraced</a> crypto for several reasons. Some see digital assets as a source of fundraising, and others, as an incentive. For instance, U.S.-sanctioned individual Alexander Zhuchkovsky heavily promoted the Terricon NFT project aiming to raise funds for the Russian war effort. However, NFT marketplace OpenSea deleted the collection before it could raise any funds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, senior officials at the Donetsk People’s Republic disclosed that they reward intelligence about Ukrainian military positions with bitcoin (BTC). U.S.-sanctioned Task Force Rusich has also suggested that its supporters bury dead Ukrainian soldiers and demand BTC from their families in exchange for information on the location of their bodies.</p>
<h2>Growing Sanctions Risk</h2>
<p>While global sanctions regimes have intensified their positions against pro-Russian individuals and entities raising money to acquire military equipment, supposedly humanitarian groups have released crypto donation wallets, revealing exposure to sanctioned individuals.</p>
<p>One example is the Russian Humanitarian Mission (ROM), which solicits crypto donations through the wallets of Russian fighter Evgeny Poddubny, who is sanctioned by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Ukraine. Elliptic found that Poddubny receives funds from sanctioned and criminal platforms like darknet markets <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-how-darknet-markets-scrambled-for-users-after-hydras-collapse-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">Hydra</a> and Shkaf, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/atomic-wallet-hackers-continue-laundering-funds-through-binance-kucoin-huobi/" data-wpel-link="internal">Garantex Exchange</a>, and Bitzlato Exchange.</p>
<p>The movement of funds underscores growing sanctions risks to crypto services and the need for effective compliance regimes in the nascent sector.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Binance’s lowkey profile is one of the most powerful women in crypto, as well as the mother of CZ’s children.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A low-profile but highly influential senior executive at Binance has spoken out as the company begins legal battles against two top market regulators in the United States.</p>
<p>Yi He, who boasts a massive fortune as one of the company’s early shareholders, has also had children with Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ).</p>
<h2>The SEC Lawsuit</h2>
<p>He <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/crypto-s-most-powerful-woman-speaks-out-as-crisis-rocks-binance-1.1939022" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">spoke</a> to Bloomberg in a series of interviews – one of which took place in Dubai last month, shortly before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/3-most-serious-claims-in-the-sec-lawsuit-v-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">136-page lawsuit</a> against her company.</p>
<p>At that time, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) had already <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-are-binance-and-cz-being-accused-of-a-closer-look-at-the-cftc-filing/" data-wpel-link="internal">sued</a> the company on some overlapping charges, such as serving U.S.-based customers from its international platform. He struck a conciliatory tone with such regulators, saying she respects their “attitude” and “intentions.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she still thinks their actions are misguided. “If they really took the time to understand our industry, they would see that if Binance isn’t compliant, then practically no other global trading platform or offshore company is,” she said.</p>
<p>Binance published a <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/community/playing-by-the-rules-an-overview-of-binances-compliance-program-7787599269355947143" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">blog post</a> on Thursday outlining the lengths to which it tries to remain legally compliant worldwide. The company’s 8000-person workforce includes “750 core and supporting compliance staff” consisting of “former law enforcement officers, regulators, crypto, fintech, and traditional banking compliance experts.”</p>
<p>The exchange is known for having no formal headquarters, thus making it theoretically harder to sue or regulate. It’s also been criticized for being shrouded in opacity, from its governance structure to its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-responds-to-reuters-claims-about-mixing-user-funds/" data-wpel-link="internal">handling</a> of client assets.</p>
<p>According to He, Binance offers more transparency than its critics often claim and strives to cooperate with regulators rather than evade them. “The trend of regulations is inevitable globally,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not something you can solve by shouting ‘fight’ a couple of times.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Yi He and CZ: What’s Going On?</h2>
<p>He’s history with CZ stretches back years to her time at OKCoin in 2014, where she later hired him as a Chief Technology Officer (CTO). CZ later asked her to be a consultant at Binance in 2017, where she helped rewrite parts of the company’s whitepaper.</p>
<p>She’s also the mother of CZ’s children – an open secret among crypto industry insiders. “What do they call it in the entertainment industry? CP?” she said when questioned on the topic. CP is a Chinese internet slang term for ‘shipping.’</p>
<p>He referred to Zhao less as a romantic partner and more as a “comrade in arms,” rejecting comparisons of their relationship to that of failed FTX and Alameda CEOs Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison.</p>
<p>In fact, He claimed she and CZ’s relationship went beyond dating in some capacity. “A co-founder relationship is about comradeship, a dating relationship is about chemistry. The former is based on shared beliefs and goes beyond gender, the latter is based on physical attraction and selfish desires,” she said.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BitcoinSV is today's best performer from the top 50 with a 18% surge. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin went on a short-lived roller-coaster yesterday but has reclaimed $30,000 after dumping to a 10-day low.</p>
<p>Yet, its dominance over the altcoins has declined a lot on a daily scale, as some, such as LTC, LDO, VET, and BSV, have shot up.</p>
<h2>BTC&#8217;s Dump and Pump</h2>
<p>After last week&#8217;s massive price surge, which drove bitcoin from $26,500 to over $31,000 at one point, the cryptocurrency had calmed and remained in a tighter range between $30,000 and $31,000.</p>
<p>It tried to overcome the latter yesterday when the bulls drove it to a daily high of $31,250. Despite failing there, it initially lost only $200 and remained above $31,000 for a few hours.</p>
<p>However, it all changed after a WSJ <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumps-below-30k-as-sec-warns-that-recent-btc-spot-etf-filings-are-inadequate-wsj/" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a> emerged claiming that the SEC deemed the recent BTC Spot ETF filings, from the likes of BlackRock and Fidelity, as &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bitcoin reacted with an immediate price drop that drove it south by $1,500 to a 10-day low of $29,500. However, the bulls stepped up once again and recovered almost all losses, with BTC currently sitting around a grand higher.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization stands close to $600 billion as of now, but its dominance over the alts has taken a major hit and is down below 50%. In fact, the metric has declined by almost 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<h2>LTC Sees 14-Month High</h2>
<p><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoins-hash-rate-hits-ath-as-halving-countdown-narrows-and-ltc-nears-100/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> yesterday that Litecoin&#8217;s price action drove it to a multi-month high of its own, just under $100. This comes as the network&#8217;s hash rate jumped to an ATH ahead of the next halving. However, the landscape for LTC holders changed for the better once again in the past 24 hours as the asset soared to over $110 for the first time since April 2022.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, Polkadot, Ethereum Classic, and Lido DAO are the other notable performers from the larger-cap alts, with gains of up to 7% daily.</p>
<p>BitcoinSV has skyrocketed the most from the top 50 alts, having surged by 18% to over $50.</p>
<p>ETH and BNB are up by 1.5% and sit above $1,900 and $240, respectively.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has remained relatively stagnant at just under $1.2 trillion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[There are nearly 700,000 owners of ENS domains.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum Name Service &#8211; the distributed, open, and extensible naming system operating on the Ethereum blockchain &#8211; announced plans for Layer 2 expansion.</p>
<p>The growing popularity of Ethereum significantly increased gas prices forcing market participants to look for cost-effective alternatives. Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is one such project that had earlier said that Layer 2 interoperability has been on the pipeline for quite some time via &#8211; ENSIP-10: Wildcard Resolution and EIP-3668: CCIP Read: Secure offchain data retrieval.</p>
<ul>
<li>On a community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKXtWaVn-tM" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">call</a> this week, the team behind ENS emphasized the importance of the upgrade that would lead to Layer 2 expansion to improve scalability and reduce costs.</li>
<li>They said facilitating the interaction of existing solutions with ENS domains would help in domain name registrations and transactions becoming more accessible to a wider user base.</li>
<li>Going forward, the devs behind the Ethereum-based naming system intend to leverage off-chain resolvers via an ENS off-chain registrar contract and different service providers, such as Coinbase-operated project cb.id, Polygon-based Lens Protocol, Optimism-based OptiNames, etc.</li>
<li>Unfazed by the market turmoil in the digital asset space last year, ENS <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-name-service-ens-wrapped-2022-with-over-2-2m-registrations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">clocked</a> in more than 2.2 million domain names.</li>
<li>The figure has been on a steady rise and currently stands at 2.73 million across nearly 700,000 unique addresses.</li>
<li>ENS <a href="https://www.moonpay.com/newsroom/ens" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">rolled</a> out a new fiat on-ramp for domain registrations via Web3 fiat payment gateway MoonPay in April this year.</li>
<li>The move enabled Web3 users to register decentralized .eth domains on the platform using various popular fiat payment options, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, in addition to debit and credit cards as well.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The exact date for Base's mainnet launch has not been revealed yet.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase&#8217;s developed Layer 2 network &#8211; Base &#8211; is gearing up for a mainnet launch. Since its deployment on testnet earlier this year, Base has already met 4 out of 5 of the criteria for the upcoming event while giving security the top-most priority in its goal to attract the next million developers and a billion users on-chain.</p>
<p>As such, the team tasked with protocol security has doubled down efforts to improve the security of Base and Optimism over the last six months. The experts haven&#8217;t detected any major flaws so far.</p>
<h2>Base&#8217;s Security First Mindset</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/_SiAx8dQRYJJ4lygkJc0QvBKvf16VVm7_-mdWMdFv20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a>, the devs have audited all Optimism pre-deploys and contracts on both L1 and L2 to detect bugs and risks in the technology stack.</p>
<p>&#8216;Fuzzing&#8217; methods were leveraged for critical components such as the L2 bridge and the sequencer in addition to developing operational runbooks for different kinds of risk scenarios as well as distress events.</p>
<p>The team also reviewed and audited the key management setup and contracts for Base.</p>
<p>Following the completion of these audits, no critical severity bugs were discovered by over 100 external security researchers that were employed for the purpose. This boosted Base&#8217;s confidence to proceed toward the mainnet launch, the platform said in a statement.</p>
<p>The team is currently working on ensuring appropriate action for any informative or minor issues that were reported during the process.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our goal with all our security work is to see around corners and blunt the effectiveness of these attacks. We’re proud of the work we’ve done to secure Base and while even the best controls will sometimes fail, we will always learn and do better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Going Foward</h2>
<p>Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-launch-eth-layer-2-network-based-on-optimism-op-token-pumps-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">unveiled</a> its own Ethereum layer-2 network in February, which is being developed in collaboration with Optimism. Its mainnet launch is slated for sometime in 2023. As part of the agreement, the crypto exchange joined Optimism as a core dev on the open-source OP Stack.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Base revealed the addition of an open-source monitoring tool, dubbed Pessimism, which is designed to notify builders of any anomalies such as account balance irregularities, contract events, or disparities between L1 and L2 states.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new tool will be put alongside existing OP Labs monitoring tools, Coinbase&#8217;s native blockchain monitoring capabilities, as well as third-party tools for detecting malicious and out-of-pattern events.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[It is not known if Ripple's takeover is connected to this. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>American multinational investment giant &#8211; Citigroup Inc. &#8211; is reportedly reviewing its partnership with Metaco. The Swiss firm, which specializes in crypto custody for institutional investors, had partnered with Citi a year back to develop and pilot the latter&#8217;s digital asset custody capabilities.</p>
<p>The latest development comes amidst tumultuous market conditions that have significantly strained the relationships of traditional financial firms that tapped into the digital assets industry.</p>
<h2>Strain in Citi and Metaco&#8217;s Relationship?</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg&#8217;s sources familiar with the matter, both Citi and Metaco have <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/citigroup-reviews-partnership-with-crypto-custodian-metaco-1.1939963" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">started</a> informal talks with other providers. However, the deliberations are private, and hence, the sources have chosen to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The reason for the decision has not been revealed yet, as a Citi representative declined to comment. The latest wave of uncertainty that has gripped the crypto industry induced several of its dedicated banking partners to go under or step back from crypto firms.</p>
<p>The report cited examples such as the recently-launched platform EDX Markets, a crypto exchange backed by firms including Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab Corp., that scrapped its plan to leverage Paxos as a custodian.</p>
<p>Similarly, banking giant State Street Corp. also ended its licensing agreement with crypto custody firm Copper last month, thereby winding down its enterprise infrastructure business to bridge banks and hedge funds with digital assets. Copper&#8217;s association with State Street lasted for over a year since its <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/state-street-partners-with-copper-to-offer-crypto-custody-for-institutional-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a> last March.</p>
<h2>Ripple Partnership to Blame?</h2>
<p>Last month, blockchain firm Ripple <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-xrp-enters-a-250-million-deal-to-acquire-metaco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> spending $250 million to acquire Metaco in a bid to expand its services to enable customers custody their digital assets with its forthcoming product suite. Commenting on the development, Metaco Founder and CEO Adrien Treccani said that the acquisition will allow the Swiss company to scale up in the market.</p>
<p>But with Ripple itself being embroiled in a long-drawn lawsuit with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and custody becoming a bone of contention for the crypto industry, Citi&#8217;s decision to review the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/citi-partners-with-metaco-for-digital-asset-custody-pilot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">partnership</a>, which has been in place since last summer, appears to be alarming.</p>
