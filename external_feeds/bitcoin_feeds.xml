The piece of legislation seeks to examine the level of adoption of bitcoin as a legal tender in El Salvador and how this might affect the financial stability of the country.</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador (ACES) Act&#8217; Reintroduced in U.S. Senate</h2>
<p>U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Bob Menendez have <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/rep/release/risch-menendez-reintroduce-legislation-to-mitigate-risks-of-el-salvadors-adoption-of-bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reintroduced</a> the &#8220;Accountability for Cryptocurrency in El Salvador Act,&#8221; also known as the &#8220;ACES Act,&#8221; to be discussed in the U.S. Senate. The piece of <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/05-11-23_aces_act.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislation</a>, that was previously presented to Congress on March 23, 2022, seeks to examine the process applied to make bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador, as well as its effect on the economy of the country.</p>
<p>When reintroducing the ACES Act, U.S. Senator Jim Risch reinforced the perceived need to assess the possible effects of using crypto as legal tender. He stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must seek greater clarity on how the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender may impact El Salvador’s financial and economic stability, as well as El Salvador’s capacity to effectively combat money laundering and illicit finances.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Elements of the Act</h2>
<p>If enacted, the act would compel the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury to produce a report about the adoption of bitcoin and legal tender in El Salvador. This would include an assessment of the legislation that allowed it, the impact it is having on the personal economy of Salvadorans, and also the gaps that this implementation could create regarding compliance with the guidelines issued by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) on money laundering and terrorism financing activities.</p>
<p>The report should also include how the introduction of bitcoin could affect the relations of El Salvador with multilateral finance organizations, like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as well as its international financial stability.</p>
<p>Finally, it must also examine how bitcoin adoption might influence the remittance flow between El Salvador and the U.S., and how it might undermine the usage of dollars in the country.</p>
<p>Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele had expressed his disbelief on the text of the ACES Act before, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-senate-committee-advances-bill-to-mitigate-risks-from-el-salvador-adopting-bitcoin-as-legal-tender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought that the U.S. Government would be afraid of what we are doing here.</p>
</blockquote>

However, Jones emphasized his unwavering commitment to the dominant cryptocurrency, affirming that he maintains &#x201C;a small diversification&#x201D; in his investment portfolio and always will.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Paul Tudor Jones on Bitcoin: &#x2018;I&#x2019;m Sticking With It, and I&#x2019;m Going to Always Stick With It&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/15/paul-tudor-jones-says-hes-going-to-keep-bitcoin-in-his-portfolio.html">appearance</a> on CNBC&#x2019;s &#x201C;Squawk Box&#x201D; this week, the legendary hedge fund manager <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-paul-tudor-jones-expects-bitcoin-price-to-be-much-higher-than-today/">Paul Tudor Jones</a> shared his insights on both <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC/">bitcoin (BTC)</a> and the U.S. economy. Jones expressed his view that the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ron-paul-states-federal-reserves-decade-of-near-0-rate-created-todays-financial-crisis/">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> might have gone overboard with its actions, asserting that any rate hikes are unlikely to occur this year. Furthermore, he suggested that inflation could persistently decrease, bringing the Federal Reserve closer to achieving its objectives of controlling inflation than anticipated. Nonetheless, this decline in inflation could present a challenge for the leading cryptocurrency, bitcoin.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In addition to his observations on the U.S. economy, Paul Tudor Jones delved into the regulatory landscape surrounding bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency industry. With conviction, Jones opined that &#x201C;bitcoin has a real problem because, in the United States, you have the entire regulatory apparatus against it.&#x201D; Despite this formidable opposition, Jones emphasized during his interview with CNBC that he remains steadfast in his commitment to the leading digital currency, opting to maintain a modest allocation of <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in his investment portfolio.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Jones said:&#13;</p>
<blockquote><p>From the beginning, I&#x2019;ve always said I want to have a small allocation to it because it&#x2019;s the only thing humans can&#x2019;t adjust the supply in. So I&#x2019;m sticking with it, and I&#x2019;m going to always stick with it as a small diversification in my portfolio.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#13;<br />
Back in October 2021, Jones confidently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-paul-tudor-jones-now-prefers-crypto-over-gold-as-inflation-hedge/">declared</a> that bitcoin was &#x201C;winning the race against gold,&#x201D; just before <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> surged to its all-time high of $69K. Fast forward to May 2022, and Jones <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billionaire-paul-tudor-jones-its-hard-not-to-want-to-be-long-crypto/">expressed</a> the difficulty of not being bullish on cryptocurrencies. However, with the potential decline in inflation, the rationale behind hedging with gold and bitcoin might lose some of its luster in the future.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#x201C;[Bitcoin and gold have] done so well recently because of the fact that we have had these great risk premiums,&#x201D; Jones told CNBC. &#x201C;I wonder whether they may not be boring in the future. If inflation is truly done a bit, if that story&#x2019;s been played, then you have to wonder: we were buying gold and bitcoin for the inflation hedges &#x2013; that game may be over,&#x201D; the investment mogul added.&#13;<br />

The headline was another rate hike by the Federal Reserve, which came as U.S. non-farm payrolls rose marginally higher than expected. Heading into the last fortnight of the month, could bulls be on the brink of returning?</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Current Market Status</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
At the halfway point of May, bitcoin has fallen to a two-month low, as market sentiment shifted bearish, following April&#x2019;s strong gains.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
With several key data points all being released in a short window, it was somewhat expected that price uncertainty would be present.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The Fed increased interest rates by 25 basis points, days after non-farm payrolls rose to 253,000, versus expectations of 180,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since then, inflation fell to 4.9% in April, with many still uncertain as to what the Federal Reserve will do during June&#x2019;s meeting.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>May Outlook</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) fell to a low of $25,810 last Friday, which came after a breakout occurred at a key price floor of $26,500.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This move saw the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency plunge to its weakest point since March 17, when the price was below $25,000.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Since then, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> has somewhat rebounded, climbing to a peak of $27,527.51 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, one of the catalysts for this move was the 14-day relative strength index (RSI), which rose above a ceiling at 42.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is now tracking at 44.66, with bitcoin reentering its own support point at $27,500, with bulls seemingly targeting $28,000 in the near term.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
A big test will be what happens when the RSI reaches a ceiling at 48.00, should it move beyond this, not only will <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> be above $28,000, however, there is a good chance that it could hit $30,000 before the month&#x2019;s end.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />

Outraged Lebanese depositors, witnessing their savings vanish, have resorted to smashing bank windows, setting fires, and engaging in riots. Simultaneously, leaders of Lebanon&#8217;s central bank face grave allegations of fraud, embezzlement, and political corruption.</strong></p>
<h2>Lebanese Citizens Left Penniless as Financial Institutions Crumble</h2>
<p>In February 2023, Lebanese depositors that were incensed by the alleged theft of their life savings by the country&#8217;s central bank, set ablaze the very banks that held their fortunes. Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/lebanon-financial-crisis-banks-torched-after-pound-taps-new-low-versus-the-us-dollar/">highlighted</a> this distressing situation, revealing that regional banks had frozen accounts, leaving residents unable to access their hard-earned funds. As if that weren&#8217;t enough, Lebanon was plagued by skyrocketing inflation, further exacerbating the plight of its citizens.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-587904 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3480231-2143167677.jpg" alt="" width="670" height="471" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3480231-2143167677-300x211.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3480231-2143167677.jpg 670w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /></p>
<p>The wave of discontent continued in March 2023 when protests reverberated throughout Beirut and other regions. Outlookindia.com vividly <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/international/protests-erupt-as-financial-crisis-deepens-in-lebanon-photos-273044">reported scenes</a> of shattered windows, burning tires, and passionate demonstrators venting their anger against Riad Salameh, the governor of Lebanon&#8217;s central bank.</p>
<p>Amidst the month of May 2023, <a href="https://www.outlookindia.com/international/lebanon-people-protest-against-banks-over-liquidity-crisis-photos-285156">resolute demonstrations</a> persist as Lebanese residents grapple with mounting anxiety over the fate of their hard-earned savings. Reports reveal that the bank, in a bid to restore order, enlisted the aid of security personnel and called upon riot police to <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinNewsCom/status/1657591556616929283?s=20">quell the upheaval</a> unfolding outside the downtown Beirut branch of Bank Audi.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-587905 aligncenter" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022-300x169.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022-768x432.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022-190x107.jpg 190w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022-380x214.jpg 380w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022-760x428.jpg 760w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ddd0000000022.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Frustration simmers among Lebanese citizens who find themselves utterly deprived of access to their deposits, with accusatory fingers pointed squarely at Salameh and his brother. Alarming allegations have emerged from six European countries, as <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/lebanon/2023/02/02/revealed-how-investigators-say-riad-salameh-conducted-central-bank-embezzlement-operation/">detailed</a> by The National, suggesting that Salameh and his brother orchestrated an <a href="https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/lebanon/2023/05/15/embezzlement-at-the-lebanese-central-bank-did-auditors-overlook-alleged-fraud/">intricate embezzlement scheme</a> of colossal proportions.</p>
<p>“In Lebanon, it is not one firm or one bank but the whole financial system that collapsed without warning from auditing firms,” The National’s reporter Nada Maucourant Atallah explains. “The crisis exposed losses of almost $70 billion wiping depositors&#8217; savings out and triggering an uncontrolled inflationary spiral, which plunged more than 80 percent of the population into poverty.”</p>
<h2>Leaders of Lebanon&#8217;s Central Bank Under Fire: Grave Allegations of Fraud and Corruption Surface</h2>
<p>According to French court documents <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/french-prosecutors-accuse-lebanon-central-bank-chief-hiding-fraud-2023-04-21/">reviewed</a> by Reuters, French prosecutors have unveiled their intentions to level preliminary accusations of fraud and money laundering against Salameh. The charges revolve around allegations that he concealed his wealth using purportedly counterfeit bank statements. A scheduled hearing in France on May 16th has been arranged by the French judicial authorities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the circumstances faced by ordinary citizens and Lebanese bank depositors persist, leaving them without any funds. The consequences of this predicament have ignited relentless indignation, as people grapple with the urgent need to provide for their families and meet basic necessities such as food and shelter. Lebanese financial institutions have now devolved into mere façades, with hollow bank tellers, vacant ATMs, and fortified buildings standing as bleak reminders of Lebanon&#8217;s broken economy.</p>

The token dropped below the $20.00 level last week, as a red wave hit cryptocurrency markets. Litecoin was also higher today, climbing by nearly 7%.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Solana (SOL) rose to a one-week high on Monday, as momentum shifted following a recent bear run.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
SOL/USD surged to a peak of $21.49 earlier in today&#x2019;s session., which comes after Sunday&#x2019;s low of $20.65.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
As a result of this rally, solana moved to its strongest point since last Monday, when price was close to $22.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
One of the catalysts of today&#x2019;s gains came as the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a ceiling at 45.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is now tracking at 48.31, which is its highest reading in almost ten days of trading.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Should current sentiment extend throughout the week, there is a good chance SOL will near its long-term resistance at $24.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>)</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Additionally, litecoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>) also moved higher in today&#x2019;s session, with price climbing by as much as 7%.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $81.75 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $87.54 earlier in the day.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
This jump resulted in the token reaching its highest point since March 6, which is the last time <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/LTC" 312004  target="_blank">LTC</a> was trading close to the $90.00 mark.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
From the chart, a breakout of the RSI has also occurred here, with a ceiling at 51.00 being broken.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, price strength is now at the 54.15 mark, with the next visible point of resistance being 58.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
There is a strong possibility that litecoin could move above $90.00 in the coming days.&#13;<br />

Bitcoin Cash fans believe the transformative changes are set to revolutionize the blockchain&#x2019;s ecosystem.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Cash Network Takes a Leap Forward With 4 New Ruleset Changes</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
At Bitcoin Cash block height <a href="https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/block/792772">792,772</a>, the network <a href="https://cash.coin.dance">successfully upgraded</a> the blockchain. The upgrade is more developer focused and average <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> users do not need to do anything. Only miners and full node operators need to upgrade their <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> software to be compatible with the ruleset changes. Over time, specific <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> compatible wallets can upgrade as well and incorporate some of the new improvements like Cashtokens.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-587885 size-full" title="Bitcoin Cash Achieves Milestone Upgrade, Unleashing Cashtokens&#x2019; Transformative Features " src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dhhdhhhjj.jpg" alt="Bitcoin Cash Achieves Milestone Upgrade, Unleashing Cashtokens&#x2019; Transformative Features " width="1280" height="550" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dhhdhhhjj-300x129.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dhhdhhhjj-1024x440.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dhhdhhhjj-768x330.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/dhhdhhhjj.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Today&#x2019;s upgrade features four new elements which include: Cashtokens, Allow Transactions to be smaller in size, P2SH32, and Restrict Transaction Versions. The <a href="https://bitcoincashresearch.org/t/chip-2021-01-allow-transactions-to-be-smaller-in-size/154">Allow Transactions</a> ruleset changes &#x201C;prevents a hash griding attack, where SPV wallets can confuse a 64-byte transaction for a merkle node,&#x201D; according to a <a href="https://cash.coin.dance/development">summary</a> published by Coin Dance.&#13;<br />

The modification introduces an advanced address format exclusively designed for smart contracts, boasting enhanced cryptographic security measures.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
With the introduction of the &#x201C;<a href="https://gitlab.com/bitcoin.cash/chips/-/tree/master">Restrict Transaction Versions</a>&#x201D; modification, Coin Dance explains that transactions are now strictly limited to version numbers of either 1 or 2. Any blocks containing transactions that defy this rule will be swiftly invalidated.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The <a href="https://blog.bitjson.com/cashtokens-v2/">Cashtokens upgrade</a>, eagerly awaited by the <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" 312002  target="_blank">BCH</a> community, <a href="https://github.com/bitjson/cashtokens/blob/master/examples.md">promises a wealth of transformative features</a>, making it a slightly more intricate enhancement. This highly anticipated upgrade is poised to usher in a multitude of advancements that will significantly elevate the capabilities of the network.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-cash-smart-contracts-comparable-to-those-on-ethereum-possible-via-may-upgrade-1000x-efficiency-advantage-dev-jason-dreyzehner/">spoke</a> with software developer <a href="https://twitter.com/bitjson">Jason Dreyzehner</a> about Cashtokens on May 2, 2023, and he detailed the potential game-changing impact of Cashtokens CHIP for Bitcoin Cash. According to Dreyzehner, Cashtokens will offer censorship-resistant, low-fee digital assets that can represent physical assets and function as currencies, stablecoins, securities, and more.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Cashtokens offer a multitude of enticing benefits, such as empowering individuals to issue tokens representing a wide range of items. In addition, they bring smart contract functionality that rivals Ethereum but with an efficiency advantage of over 1,000 times in transactions and block validation.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The introduction of Cashtokens also paves the way for the development of low-fee, censorship-resistant prediction markets, while contract-issued commitments and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) open up exciting possibilities for decentralized applications (dapps). Amid the upgrade, <a href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH/">bitcoin cash (BCH)</a> is up 4% higher against the U.S. dollar on Monday morning.&#13;<br />

Prices slipped to a two-month low over the weekend, however momentum has marginally shifted. Ethereum was also higher today. </strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) jumped back above the $27,000 level to start the week, as sentiment showed glimpses of shifting after last week&#x2019;s bear run.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Following a low of $26,762.25 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD raced to an intraday peak of $27,521.62 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The move saw the world&#x2019;s largest cryptocurrency continue to move away from a floor at $26,500, and a recent two-month low.&#13;</p>

Monday&#x2019;s rise in price sees bitcoin move higher for a second straight day, breaking out of a ceiling on the relative strength index (RSI) in the process.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
At the time of writing, price strength is now tracking at 43.66, which is marginally above the aforementioned resistance at 43.00.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Bulls will now likely be looking to reenter the $28,000 level, which was last hit this past Thursday.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;</p>
<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also made gains to start the week, as it moved beyond the $1,800 mark in today&#x2019;s session.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD rose to a high of $1,834.94 on Monday, less than 24 hours after falling to a bottom at $1,787.54.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, today&#x2019;s move is the second consecutive day <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> has risen, and comes following the recent eight-day losing streak.&#13;</p>

&#13;<br />
Price strength on ethereum has also risen, climbing above a key point of resistance at the 44.00 level.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The index is now tracking at the 45.85 mark, with the next ceiling at the 50.00 level.&#13;<br />

These de-risking policies might affect bilateral trade, which fell by 11.2% to $217.9 billion during the first four months of 2023.</strong></p>
<h2>&#8216;De-Risking&#8217; Is a Euphemism for Decoupling U.S. and China Relations, Analysts State</h2>
<p>Analysts are criticizing the &#8216;de-risking&#8217; strategy of the US against China. The term, which was <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/us-china-relations-derisk-decouple-investing-b93b9bbb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by the U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan last month, is used to explain the position that the U.S. is adopting in front of the growth and policies of China on the Russia-Ukraine conflict. And while U.S. Treasury Secretary Yanet Yellen has previously stated that a full decuple of the economies of the two countries would be &#8220;disastrous,&#8221; Chinese analysts believe that this is just a semantics choice.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaoming, a senior researcher at the Centre for China and Globalisation, has stated that this &#8216;de-risking&#8217; strategy has &#8216;nothing short&#8217; of decoupling in action, as it seeks to limit the economic interaction with China to just the necessary. Xiaoming <a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3219928/us-de-risking-china-just-economic-decoupling-another-name" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explains</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. will continue to trade with China as it has learned that totally cutting economic ties between the two is neither feasible nor desirable. Nevertheless, the Biden administration still appears intent on building a “small yard” with a “high fence”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach would be responsible for the inclusion of more Chinese companies in the called &#8216;entity list&#8217; of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the recent tightening of the export controls on chips to China, but might expand to other fields in the future, Xioaming states.</p>

<h2>Possible Effects on Trade</h2>
<p>Xiaoming believes that this de-risking strategy seeks to also undermine the relations that China has with the world, stating that &#8216;Washington clearly sees decoupling as critical to its strategy of reducing China’s economic ties with the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, this might also be affecting American consumers and companies. According to the General Administration of Customs of China, bilateral trade has <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1614955" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fallen</a> by 11.2% year over year during the first four months of 2023, after having <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/07/trade-china-relations-economies-00081301" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a $690 billion record in 2022.</p>
<p>The European Union (EU) has also recently proposed to de-risk its relationship with China, facing a strong answer from Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who <a href="http://us.china-embassy.gov.cn/eng/zgyw/202305/t20230511_11075089.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>China does not export its system, and it follows a path of peaceful development, pursues a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, stays true to and safeguards the international order underpinned by international law, and opposes hegemonic, domineering and bullying practices.</p>

The program, managed by Reef Labs, aims to support, incubate, and invest in promising Middle East-based Web3 developers, teams, and projects building on the Reef Chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rise of blockchain/Web3 applications in the Middle East are setting the stage for remarkable technological progress and innovation. Reef has already made a significant impact in the region by securing the </span><a href="https://t.me/reefannouncements/676"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Best Ecosystem Award</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at The Middle-East Blockchain Awards. </span></p>
<p><b>Driving Growth in the MENA Region:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Accelerator Program seeks to drive Reef&#8217;s vision for growth, making it the de-facto blockchain in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region. Ideas selected as part of this initiative will benefit from the financial support provided by Reef&#8217;s venture partners, along with mentorship, marketing, and business development assistance from Reef Labs. Additionally, these ecosystem projects can leverage Reef&#8217;s global community to promote their ideas and achievements to other Web3 developers and blockchain enthusiasts.</span></p>
<p><b>Positioning Reef for Web3 Adoption:</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The present geo-political landscape in the MENA region fosters the growth of region-specific blockchain networks, which are set to play a significant role in promoting Web3 adoption. Reef is ideally positioned to deliver enterprise-grade solutions with high scalability, cost-effective transactions, extensible EVM, and on-chain upgradability features, thus stimulating inventive models to harness blockchain technology. Additionally, the remarkably low entry barrier for dApp developers has made Reef one of the most developer-friendly ecosystems to build upon. </span></p>
<p><b>Denko Mancheski, CEO of Reef, said about this new initiative</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’re launching the Reef Accelerator Program with the aim of welcoming the brightest minds in the Web3.0 industry. The Reef team has been working with Web3 developers in the Middle East region for some time now, and is extremely excited by the talent and innovation we witness. Through our recently conceptualized Reef Labs initiative, we will choose the best Middle Eastern projects, empower them to realize their full potential and integrate them into the current Reef ecosystem of NFT, DeFi, Metaverse, and GameFi projects. It will also enable us to drive the growth of the Web3 industry in the Middle East and emerge as this region’s de-facto blockchain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Reef Accelerator Program is poised to solidify Reef Chain&#8217;s position as the most developer-friendly blockchain solution for web2 businesses transitioning into the web3 space in the MENA region, ultimately propelling the upcoming wave of innovation and Web3 adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This program amount of $10 million will be part of the </span><a href="https://medium.com/reef-finance/reef-finance-launches-20m-grant-fund-to-expand-reef-chain-development-bca4cb9f53a9"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$20 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> developer support fund that Reef had announced earlier.</span></p>
