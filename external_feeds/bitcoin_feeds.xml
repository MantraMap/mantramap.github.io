<h2>Balaji Srinivasan on FTX, State Failure, and U.S. Dollars Becoming Worthless</h2>
<p>Angel investor Balaji Srinivasan commented on the collapse of crypto exchange FTX in a series of tweets Saturday. Formerly the CTO of crypto exchange Coinbase and a general partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Srinivasan is also the author of The Network State, a WSJ bestseller.</p>
<p>&#8220;Treat FTX as a preview of state failure,&#8221; he wrote, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>One day, your USD bank account balance may be frozen or inflated to worthlessness. The authorities will show no interest in prosecuting — they&#8217;re the ones who ordered it in the first place. That world is coming and we need alternatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all just a dress rehearsal for the ultimate rug pull — when the state prints trillions, monetizes the debt, and ends the fiat century,&#8221; the angel investor explained in another tweet. &#8220;Our space will be prepared. We know what that looks like. And our trust-minimizing systems will be life rafts for the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many people on Twitter agreed with Srinivasan, stating that bitcoin and decentralization are the answer.</p>
<p>However, some disagreed, telling the entrepreneur that FTX is a fraud and a Ponzi scheme. &#8220;It&#8217;s not a preview of state failure. It has nothing to do with that. It&#8217;s simply fraud,&#8221; one wrote. &#8220;How can you equate a 32-year-old con man who had no controls, structure, systems, or board to the U.S. government?&#8221; another questioned. A third opined: &#8220;Comparing regulated banking industry to unregulated crypto exchange is misleading.&#8221;</p>
<p>Srinivasan also commented on bitcoin as a hedge against inflation in another tweet on Saturday. The angel investor detailed:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s a hedge against hyperinflation, monetary debasement, bank freezes, and wealth seizure. It&#8217;s already proven itself in that role, in places like Venezuela, Lebanon, Nigeria. For &#8216;standard&#8217; inflation it may eventually have a gold-like role, but that takes decades to show.</p></blockquote>

Noting that he has several cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and ethereum, Simmons stressed: &#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m holding, but everybody should do their own due diligence.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Gene Simmons Says He&#8217;s &#8216;Deep in Crypto&#8217;</h2>
<p>Rock legend Gene Simmons confirmed Thursday that he is still holding cryptocurrencies despite the crypto winter and the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Simmons is an Israeli-born American musician, singer, songwriter, actor, and producer. He was the frontman, bassist, and co-lead singer of Kiss, the rock band he co-founded with lead singer and guitarist Paul Stanley.</p>
<p>Responding to a question from Crypto Housewife at his Moneybag Vodka launch event in Alberta, Canada, about whether he is &#8220;still hodling&#8221; his cryptocurrencies, Simmons said: &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not gonna suggest or recommend anything. I&#8217;m not a financial advisor.&#8221; The rock legend added:</p>
<blockquote><p>But since you&#8217;re asking me, yes, I&#8217;m deep in crypto. I believe in it. I&#8217;ve got bitcoin, litecoin, ethereum, quite a few others … Personally, I&#8217;m holding, but everybody should do their own due diligence.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the price of bitcoin is down about 64% year-to-date while ether has fallen 66%. The crypto industry has suffered several major blowups this year, including the Terra blockchain implosion in May and the FTX collapse last month.</p>
<p>FTX, Compute North, Voyager Digital, Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital, and Blockfi have all filed for bankruptcy protection after dealing with financial problems. An estimated one million customers have lost billions of dollars in the FTX meltdown.</p>

<p>Simmons previously revealed that he owns <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/rock-legend-gene-simmons-owns-14-cryptocurrencies-i-have-not-sold-a-single-position-since-the-downturn/">14 cryptocurrencies</a>. In June, he said he hasn&#8217;t sold any of his coins despite the crypto market downturn.</p>
<p>In an interview with American Songwriter in May, Simmons said he found himself thinking about cryptocurrency most often. &#8220;Governments, as you know now print money whenever they need it. So, inflation keeps getting bigger and bigger,&#8221; the rock legend described, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah, it&#8217;s a game-changer. I&#8217;m in it big. I&#8217;ve done very well.</p></blockquote>

Community reports detail that Lodestar lost roughly $6.9 million from the vulnerability. </strong></p>
<h2>Lodestar Finance Loses $6.9 Million in an Exploit, TVL Drained, LODE Drops by 53%</h2>
<p>Another decentralized finance (defi) platform, Lodestar Finance was <a href="https://twitter.com/BowTiedPickle/status/1601650177369993216?s=20&amp;t=vj2tXyN1bV59iBKrjK-MLA">hacked for $6.9 million</a> in an exploit, a number of <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1601661447683055622?s=20&amp;t=vj2tXyN1bV59iBKrjK-MLA">reports</a> detail. “[The] protocol was exploited and deposits have been drained,” Lodestar’s official Twitter account said. “We have set all interest rates to 0 so that supply and borrow balances are not moving while we weigh recovery options.”</p>
<p>Lodestar says the hacker “manipulated the exchange rate of the plvGLP contract” and then “supplied plvGLP collateral to Lodestar and borrowed all available liquidity.” This allowed the exploiter to cash out “what they could.” However, a “collateralization ratio mechanism prevented them from fully cashing out the plvGLP,” the team noted on Saturday.</p>

<p>Via the team Discord channel, Lodestar team members explained that they had paused borrowing and liquidation activity. <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/lodestar-finance">Data from defillama.com</a> indicates that the total value locked (TVL) in Lodestar was drained from close to $7 million down to a mere $11.06. The project’s native cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/lodestar">lodestar (LODE)</a> has dropped 53% in value against the U.S. dollar in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>LODE recently tapped an all-time high at $0.718 per unit, 18 days ago on Nov. 23, 2022. LODE’s value is now down 76.1% from that value and has seen a 24-hour price range of around $0.13 to $0.369 per unit. At press time, LODE is exchanging hands for $0.173 per coin.</p>

<h2>Binance CEO Allegedly Told SBF to Stop Causing &#x2018;More Damage&#x2019; and to &#x2018;Stop Trying to Depeg Stablecoins&#x2019;</h2>
<p>The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivals-worried-sam-bankman-fried-tried-to-destabilize-crypto-on-eve-of-ftx-collapse-11670597311">reports</a> that just before the crypto exchange FTX <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy, there was a conversation between CZ and SBF on Nov. 10, 2022, in a Signal chat group called &#x201C;Exchange coordination.&#x201D; The Signal group&#x2019;s chat logs were apparently seen by the WSJ and high up crypto execs like Tether&#x2019;s CTO Paolo Ardoino and Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell are purportedly members of the group.</p>
<p>The WSJ report details that SBF was accused of trying to destabalize stablecoins and more specifically tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>). &#x201C;A Tether official and the head of the world&#x2019;s largest crypto exchange grew alarmed that Sam Bankman-Fried was trying to destabilize the stablecoin,&#x201D; the WSJ reporters Patricia Kowsmann, Alexander Osipovich and Caitlin Ostroff allege. However, in a statement made to the WSJ, SBF denied the claims made in the report about the Signal chat conversation.</p>
<p>Kowsmann, Osipovich and Ostroff detail that Binance&#x2019;s CEO Changpeng Zhao confronted SBF about the alleged depegging attempts. &#x201C;Stop trying to depeg stablecoins,&#x201D; CZ is cited as saying. &#x201C;And stop doing anything. Stop now, don&#x2019;t cause more damage.&#x201D;</p>

<p>FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried has recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-co-founder-sam-bankman-fried-agrees-to-testify-before-us-congress/">agreed</a> to testify in front of U.S. Congress and he also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/talks-of-issuing-a-new-ftt-token-fuel-coins-price-despite-ftts-broken-tokenomics-scheme/">discussed</a> the idea of launching a new FTT token with crypto proponent Ran Neuner on Dec. 9. Additionally, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/report-shows-crypto-news-publication-the-block-was-secretly-funded-by-bankman-frieds-alameda/">revelations</a> released this weekend indicate that The Block CEO Michael McCaffrey was secretly given more than $43 million from SBF&#x2019;s Alameda Research. Shark Tank star Kevin O&#x2019;Leary also <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kevin-oleary-reveals-ftx-paid-him-15-million-to-become-a-spokesperson-for-the-exchange/">revealed</a> this past Thursday that he was paid $15 million to be a spokesperson for FTX.</p>

The media companies believe the public should be made aware of the creditors’ information, as the publications stressed in the court filing that the “news media acts as the eyes and ears of the public.”</strong></p>
<h2>So-Called &#8216;Media Intervenors&#8217; Insist the Court Should Unseal FTX&#8217;s Creditor Information</h2>
<p>Four major news media publications have filed a document with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy case tied to the now-defunct FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Essentially, the publications call themselves “media intervenors” and the intervenors “object to the continued sealing and redaction of information that historically has been quintessentially public in nature.” The four media outlets include the Financial Times (FT), the New York Times (NYT), Bloomberg, and Dow Jones &amp; Company.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-563550 size-full" title="New York Times, FT, Bloomberg Blasted for Attempting to Get FTX Creditors' Names Unsealed" src="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rrlefter.jpg" alt="New York Times, FT, Bloomberg Blasted for Attempting to Get FTX Creditors' Names Unsealed" width="1280" height="600" srcset="https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rrlefter-300x141.jpg 300w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rrlefter-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rrlefter-768x360.jpg 768w, https://static.news.bitcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rrlefter.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>The so-called “media intervenors” cite a specific rule that permits “any interested entity” to intervene in a bankruptcy matter and “with respect to any specified matter.” The publications also says that the courts have “routinely recognized the right of the media” to “intervene” or “challenge sealing orders.” The filing adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>The news media acts as the eyes and ears of the public, informing the public of issues of the day. This valuable social function is hampered by sealing of judicial records.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the debtor&#8217;s objections to keep the customer list in strict confidence, and the reasoning that says the dissemination of the debtors’ customer list could cause harm to the clients, the “media intervenors” call these arguments “vague statements” that “do not appear to satisfy the evidentiary burden.” Bloomberg, FT, NYT, and the Dow media firms insist that “redacting the names of creditors is inappropriate.” The court filing continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>While redaction of contact information arguably may be justified in some circumstances to prevent identity theft and harassment, releasing the names of the creditors neither exposes the creditors to risk of identity theft nor to personal danger. It also does not create undue risk of unlawful injury.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the Celsius bankruptcy case is highlighted by the media firms in the court filing. In that specific case, the bankruptcy court <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bankruptcy-court-publishes-14000-pages-of-celsius-customer-usernames-and-trade-history/">published</a> 14,000 pages of Celsius customer usernames and trade histories. After the court did this to Celsius users, it caused quite a bit of public outcry. “This Celsius dox is one of the [most] egregious privacy violations in crypto history,” one individual <a href="https://twitter.com/TheBitfi/status/1578196953300488193?s=20&amp;t=gfES-pZtmMwrz3j77e2kag">wrote</a> at the time. The news also follows the public denouncing mainstream media publications on several occasions for doxxing people.</p>
<h2>From Dorian Nakamoto to Libs of Tiktok, Media Doxxing Moves Beyond Internet Culture and Becomes the Industry&#8217;s Choice Tool</h2>
<p>In recent times, the Washington Post&#8217;s reporter, Taylor Lorenz, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/04/19/taylor-lorenz-blasted-for-doxxing-libs-of-tiktok-creator/">blasted</a> in mid-April for reportedly doxxing the Libs of Tiktok creator. Four years ago mainstream media publications like the NYT <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/technology/doxxing-protests.html">said</a> that doxxing has become “a mainstream tool in the culture wars.” The report notes that “identifying extremist activists and revealing their personal information has become a bit of a sport on the internet.”</p>
<p>Years later, the establishment’s media has been accused of leveraging the doxxing tool and using the controversial tool for clicks, publicity, and notoriety. When Newsweek columnist Leah McGrath Goodman published a report in March 2014, the reporter was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/many-facts-dorian-nakamoto-satoshi/">slammed</a> for doxxing Dorian Nakamoto’s California address. It was found that Dorian was not Satoshi Nakamoto and he said the reporter treated him unfairly.</p>
<p>As far as the FTX bankruptcy case is concerned, Redditors from the forum r/cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zijpa4/after_gaslighting_and_running_cover_for_ftx_now/">lambasted</a> Bloomberg, FT, NYT, and the Dow media firms for attempting to dox customers associated with the fallen exchange. In the forum discussion, Redditors also talked about how a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/washington-post-forbes-wall-street-journal-slammed-for-puff-piece-reports-on-ftx-and-alameda-execs/">number of publications</a> like the New York Times <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-is-sleeping-better-playing-video-games-new-york-times-sam-bankman-fried-interview-dunked-on-for-going-soft-on-ftx-co-founder/">published puff pieces</a> on the FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<p>“Never expected anything better by the media. It&#8217;s just all about the money for them and 0% about the truth,” one individual <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zijpa4/comment/izrrr74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">wrote</a>. “Sadly way too many still trust them.” Another person <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/zijpa4/comment/izrqc42/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mainstream media are paid actors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the most recent public outcry against the Celsius dox, the so-called “media intervenors” do not mention that part of the story, even though it was quite evident the public was not pleased with the bankruptcy court’s decision.</p>
<p>“Redacting the names of the creditors will have far-reaching impact as the case progresses,” the media publications note in the FTX bankruptcy court filing. “This court has routinely authorized debtors in other Chapter 11 cases to file under seal confidential information,” the filing concludes.</p>

<h2 class="article__header__heading">Document Claims Alameda CEO Caroline Ellison’s FTX Margin Position Was Negative $1.3B in May 2022</h2>
<p>In a number of recent interviews, the former co-founder of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), explained that he “wasn’t running Alameda” and he “didn’t know the size of their position.” In a more recent discussion with The Block’s Frank Chaparro, SBF explained that auditors were looking at FTX’s corporate financials, but the auditors were “not looking at customer positions and not looking at customer risk.” This week, an FTX insider speaking to Bitcoin.com News under terms of anonymity shared a document that purportedly shows Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s personal account was in the hole by $1.31 billion in May 2022.</p>

<p>Tesla CEO and Twitter chief Elon Musk says that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) probably donated over $1 billion to support the Democratic Party, which would be a much larger sum than the number publicly disclosed. Many people slammed Musk for making accusations without providing proof. “This statement is so unbelievably irresponsible,” one commented.</p>

<p>Following FTX’s collapse, many industry executives, influencers, luminaries, and politicians have shared their opinions about the carnage the event has caused to crypto markets and a great deal of innocent bystanders. On Dec. 2, the CEO and founder of Morgan Creek Capital, Mark Yusko, explained in an interview that it’s quite possible that the FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) was merely a “pawn” or “useful idiot” leveraged to “punish the industry.”</p>

This is the second arrest in the Gulf state of a high-ranking member of the pyramid announced in the past month. </strong></p>
<h2>Finiko Fraudster Caught by Interpol in UAE, Russia Seeks His Extradition</h2>
<p>Another individual involved in organizing Russia’s largest financial pyramid in recent years, Finiko, has been placed under custody in the UAE. The detention of Edward Sabirov in the Arab country comes after last month’s news of the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/co-founder-of-russias-largest-crypto-pyramid-finiko-arrested-in-uae/">arrest</a> of the Ponzi scheme’s co-founder, Zygmunt Zygmuntovich. Both have allegedly played key roles in the embezzlement of millions from the fraud’s victims.</p>
<p>Sabirov was put on an international wanted list on Nov. 12, the Russian Prosecutor General’s Office told the RIA Novosti news agency. The National Bureau of Interpol of the United Arab Emirates announced his arrest on Nov. 30. Russia’s National Central Bureau of Interpol has already petitioned UAE authorities for a 60-day detention and stated Russian intentions to request his extradition from the country’s Ministry of Justice.</p>
<p>Another of Finiko’s high-profile representatives, Marat Sabirov, is still wanted. Investigators point out that the Sabirovs were directly related to the top management of the crypto pyramid, being close associates of its founder and mastermind, Kirill Doronin, who has been in Russian jail since July 2021. Along with Zygmuntovich, they managed to leave Russia as the scheme was collapsing.</p>

<p>Finiko, which was never established as a legal entity, was based in Kazan, the capital city of the Russian Republic of Tatarstan. It had branches in more than 70 other Russian regions which promoted investments in a virtual platform, offering extraordinarily high returns of up to 5% a day. Earlier this year, the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced it had received around 10,000 applications from victims claiming losses exceeding 5 billion rubles (close to $80 million).</p>
<p>However, the actual damages from Finiko’s activities are likely much higher. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponzi_scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ponzi scheme</a> raised capital from unsuspecting investors in Russia, Ukraine and other countries in the former Soviet space, EU nations like Germany, Austria, and Hungary, the United States, and elsewhere. Many of the victims were asked to send cryptocurrency to Finiko’s wallets and according to a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/eastern-europe-sends-over-800-million-in-crypto-to-scams-in-single-year-report-reveals/">report</a> by Chainalysis, the pyramid received more than $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin between December 2019 and August 2021.</p>
<p>Besides <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/finiko-founder-doronin-offers-to-testify-against-44-accomplices-at-crypto-pyramid/">Doronin</a>, Zygmuntovich, and the Sabirovs, more than 20 other people have been accused of taking part in the massive fraud. The list includes <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-police-arrest-2-women-high-ranking-members-of-finiko-crypto-pyramid/">Lilia Nurieva and Dina Gabdullina</a> as well as Finiko’s Vice President <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/top-finiko-crypto-pyramid-executive-arrested-in-russias-tatarstan/">Ilgiz Shakirov</a> who was arrested in Tatarstan. Anna Serikova, Finiko’s executive director better known under the pseudonym Tiffany, was also detained.</p>

However, some in the Web3 community, like Astar Network&#8217;s Sota Watanabe, believe the protocol cannot &#8220;build the innovative future of blockchain alone.&#8221; In addition, some critics point to the language obstacle which they argue makes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) a less-than-ideal place to build.</strong></p>
<h2>Webassembly Smart Contracts &#8216;Will Accelerate the Adoption of Web3&#8217;</h2>
<p>It is this and other limitations of the EVM that led to the creation of an alternative known as Webassembly (WASM). This alternative is said to be a virtual machine of choice for developers, engineers and academics that are frustrated with the EVM. According to Watanabe, for Web2 developers that want to migrate to Web3, WASM seems like a logical choice because it &#8220;supports a wide range of languages with native performance and high portability.&#8221;</p>
<p>To learn more about WASM, Bitcoin.com News reached out to Sota Watanabe, the CEO of Astar Network, a multichain smart contracts platform.</p>
<p>In his written responses to questions sent, the <a href="https://astar.network/">Astar Network</a> CEO offered his thoughts on Webassembly and the role it will play in accelerating the adoption of Web3. Watanabe also explained why Astar Network is supporting both the EVM and WASM.</p>
<p>Below are Watanabe&#8217;s responses to questions sent to him via Whatsapp.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin.com News (BCN): In very simple terms, can you explain to our readers what the WASM is all about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sota Watanabe (SW):</strong> Webassembly, more commonly called WASM, is a portable compilation target for programming languages. WASM supports a wide range of languages with native performance and high portability. On Astar, we support a WASM smart contract environment, just like Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). What’s nice about WASM is that most Web2 languages are composable into Webassembly, which is not true for Ethereum’s EVM which relies on a specialized programming language called Solidity.</p>
<p>We believe the growing use of WASM smart contracts will dramatically accelerate the adoption of Web3. Most of the tech talent still works in the Web2 space, and if Web2 developers want to enter Web3, they have no choice but to learn a new programming language called Solidity which is used by the most popular smart contract platform today (EVM). That’s an obstacle. Imagine if they could build Web3 dapps [decentralized applications] using the languages they already know. And, on top of that, make their dapps compatible with EVM with ease. That’s why WASM smart contracts are [going to] pull a lot of talent from Web2 to Web3. That’s why it’s so exciting.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"></p>
<p><strong>BCN: What are some of the challenges or limitations of the EVM and how does the WASM overcome these?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Though Ethereum brought us the Web3 revolution with the introduction of smart contracts, it cannot build the innovative future of blockchain alone. With a specialized programming language, it restricts the developer community’s ability to explore and create new, truly interoperable dapps. EVM is blockchain-specific, with less support and a specialized programming language, Solidity.</p>
<p>Today, Web3 is prohibitive for many Web2 developers as Web2 languages aren’t composable into Solidity, the programming language of Ethereum. With Webassembly (WASM), developers can quickly transition from a Web2 to Web3 infrastructure, which enables them to spend more time building core features in their dapps rather than learning specialized languages such as Solidity.</p>
<p>WASM increases performance since it’s closer to the machinery language. It brings near-native performance to web browser applications and allows developers to build high-speed web apps in the language of their choice. Also, WASM has a huge potential for the future of the internet as it’s designed for the web.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Already backed by four major browser engines (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Webkit), WASM is said to be safer, more efficient, faster, debuggable, and open. Can you explain in simple terms why this matters?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> You’re right. All the things you said about WASM have helped it build trust among Web2 developers. And when they can build interoperable Web3 dapps with WASM toolings, they are more likely to embrace Web3.</p>
<p>Moreover, WASM development is already supported by top-tier companies such as Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla, and can be used with popular programming languages such as C/C++, GO, TypeScript and RUST, which is common among Web2 developers.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Some reports have suggested that Web2 developers that are migrating to Web3 are attracted to WASM. Is this suggestion correct? If this is the case what do you think could be the reason(s)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> The answer would be similar to Nos. 2 and 3. And I’d add:</p>
<p>Over the years, we have interacted with thousands of Web2 developers who are inclined to build in Web3, but the lack of familiar tooling was a hindrance. By supporting WASM, making it interoperable with EVM, and providing devs with all the tooling they need to build in Web3, Astar Network hopes to give this emerging ecosystem a major boost.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Instead of encouraging or discouraging the use of either, your platform Astar Network is said to be helping developers build dapps with both EVM and WASM. What are your reasons for supporting both virtual machines?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> Developers in the Web3 space come from diverse backgrounds — armed with different skill sets, capabilities and preferences. They should all not be forced to bring their vision to life using a single smart contract platform. They deserve choices, and then it’s up to them to decide which smart contract is appropriate for the project they are building.</p>
<p>Yes, we support both EVM and WASM smart contracts to give developers flexibility. EVM because it’s the most popular smart contract environment with the largest user base. WASM because it overcomes the limitations of EVM while also making it easier for a new wave of developers to enter the space. We believe having two VMs simultaneously and making them interactive is a key success factor for an emerging Layer-1 blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: How does that benefit the broader blockchain ecosystem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> It will dramatically expand the blockchain ecosystem by enabling Web2 developers to build innovative, decentralized, and interoperable solutions in the Web3 space.</p>
<p><strong>BCN: Astar Network is said to be offering true interoperability with cross-consensus messaging. What does this mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>SW:</strong> We believe in a truly interoperable Web3 ecosystem, and provide developers with everything they need to build truly interoperable dapps. We achieve it through:</p>
<p>Cross-consensus messaging (XCM): It allows dapps built on chains with different consensus mechanisms to securely transfer data and value between one another. The exchange is bidirectional. It’s been made possible because Astar is a para chain on Polkadot and can use this feature as part of our core features.</p>
<p>Cross-virtual machines (XVM): It brings interoperability between two different smart contract environments like EVM and WASM. A dapp can use EVM for their smart contract but can implement WASM smart contract modules and at the same time use features from another para chain to be integrated into their dapp.</p>
<p>These two innovations will be the start of the next wave of innovation for dapps.</p>

At the same time, the regulator supports prohibiting payments with digital coins and their advertising.</strong></p>
<h2>Rosfinmonitoring Backs Government’s Strategy to Strictly Regulate Cryptocurrencies in Russia</h2>
<p>The Federal Financial Monitoring Service of the Russian Federation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosfinmonitoring">Rosfinmonitoring</a>) supports the adoption of strict rules for cryptocurrencies, as per the regulatory concept approved by the government, the agency’s Deputy Director Herman Neglyad said in an interview with Izvestia. However, the official also indicated to the Russian daily that a full ban is unlikely, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>We understand that citizens and legal entities already own digital currency and in such conditions, it would be counterproductive to introduce a complete ban on the circulation of cryptocurrencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neglyad explained that Russia’s financial watchdog favors proposals to prohibit settlements in cryptocurrencies and their advertising, as envisaged in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/amendments-to-russias-digital-asset-law-aim-to-allow-mining-ban-crypto-exchange-and-ads/">bill</a> submitted to the lower house of Russian parliament in November. It also recognizes the need to raise awareness about the nature of cryptocurrency as a high-risk asset.</p>
<p>“We believe that virtual assets or digital currencies should be legally equated to property, which entails their recognition as the subject of crimes,” the executive also said. He added that Rosfinmonitoring has been seeing an increasing use of cryptocurrencies both in payments for illegal purposes and concealment or laundering of criminal proceeds.</p>

<p>The financial intelligence agency has been developing a special crypto analysis service called “Transparent Blockchain.” It allows authorities to track crypto transfers and identify wallet owners. Russia’s Interior Ministry is already using such a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-interior-ministry-employs-tool-to-identify-crypto-wallet-owners-track-transactions/">tool</a>, as the head of its economic security department revealed this week.</p>
<p>Herman Neglyad also emphasized that the activities of platforms providing exchange, transfer, and storage services for virtual assets should be controlled through registration, licensing, and supervision. He believes these entities should be responsible for identifying clients and beneficial owners, storing data and reporting suspicious transactions to Rosfinmonitoring.</p>

The judge stated that the law &#8220;expects investors to act reasonably before basing their bets on the zeitgeist of the moment.&#8221;</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Lawsuit Against Kim Kardashian Dismissed</h2>
<p>A federal judge dismissed a proposed class action lawsuit on Wednesday against Ethereummax&#8217;s founders and the crypto project&#8217;s celebrity endorsers, including reality TV star Kim Kardashian, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr., and former Boston Celtics star Paul Pierce.</p>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Michael Fitzgerald of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California agreed that the lawsuit&#8217;s claims raised legitimate concerns about &#8220;celebrities&#8217; ability to readily persuade millions of undiscerning followers to buy snake oil with unprecedented ease and reach.&#8221; However, he explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the law certainly places limits on those advertisers, it also expects investors to act reasonably before basing their bets on the zeitgeist of the moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kardashian promoted Ethereummax and the EMAX cryptocurrency token in an <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kim-kardashian-floyd-mayweather-sued-inappropriately-promoting-cryptocurrency-token/">Instagram post</a> in June 2021. The reality TV star <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-charges-socialite-kim-kardashian-for-unlawfully-touting-ethereummax/">settled</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October for failing to disclose a $250,000 compensation for touting the crypto token on her Instagram account. Mayweather Jr. promoted the same crypto token at a boxing match and a large Miami bitcoin conference in June 2021.</p>
<p>Attorney John Jasnoch told Fitzgerald:</p>
<blockquote><p>If plaintiffs had known the true facts related to the promoters&#8217; financial interest in the tokens, and that they were being paid to shill these tokens, they wouldn&#8217;t have paid as much for the tokens as they did.</p></blockquote>

<p>Investors <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/kim-kardashian-floyd-mayweather-sued-inappropriately-promoting-cryptocurrency-token/">sued</a> Ethereummax&#8217;s founders and the crypto project&#8217;s celebrity promoters in January after the EMAX cryptocurrency lost 97% of its value. Fitzgerald said in his ruling that he would allow the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers to refile their suit after amending some of their claims under a number of the statutes cited in the original filing.</p>
<p>Michael Rhodes, a lawyer for Kardashian, told CNBC:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re pleased with the court&#8217;s well-reasoned decision on the case.</p></blockquote>
