<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-regulatory-approval-crypto-futures-trading/">Coinbase Secures Regulatory Approval for US Crypto Futures Trading </a></p>
<p>Leading American crypto exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Coinbase</a> has received regulatory approval to offer eligible customers in the United States the opportunity to trade Bitcoin (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC</a>) and Ethereum (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ETH</a>) futures contracts. The company will serve as a Futures Commission Merchant (FCM), a type of derivatives exchange controlled by the National Futures Association (NFA).</p>
<p>NFA is a self-regulatory organization under the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/cftc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CFTC</a>). The group is tasked with overseeing the country&#8217;s derivatives industry, including on-exchange traded futures, retail off-exchange foreign currency, and OTC derivatives.</p>
<h2>First Crypto Native to Offer Both Spot and Futures Trading</h2>
<p>Coinbase said in a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-financial-markets-inc-secures-fcm-approval-to-bring-regulated" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> on 16 August that the NFA approved the license, allowing it to engage with futures trading officially. According to the company, the FCM application was submitted to regulators in September 2021. After two years of deliberations, the firm has finally been greenlighted to offer a derivatives exchange alongside its spot trading options.</p>
<p>With the approval, Coinbase has become the first native crypto company to provide both derivatives and spot trading services directly to customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coinbase will now be the first crypto-native leader to directly offer traditional spot crypto trading alongside regulated and leveraged crypto futures on an integrated trading solution for our verified customers,&#8221; the company said.</p>
<p>The exchange described its latest achievement as a &#8220;critical milestone&#8221;, noting that it had passed through stringent requirements to obtain the approval.</p>
<p>While Coinbase&#8217;s customers will soon be able to access futures trading directly through its platform, the company has already laid the groundwork for its derivatives offering. Last year, the exchange acquired FairX, which now operates as the Coinbase Derivatives Exchange.</p>
<p>The platform is open to third-party brokers, FCMs, and market makers, and it has accumulated substantial liquidity, facilitating notable trading volumes in BTC and ETH futures.</p>
<p>In June, Coinbase announced its intentions to launch BTC and ETH futures trading specially designed for institutional investors. Before that, the company said it was considering launching a derivatives platform in Bermuda.</p>
<h2>75% of Crypto Trading Volume Comes from Derivatives Market</h2>
<p>Coinbase also said in its blog post that a large chunk, approximately 75%, of the entire crypto trading volume is generated within the derivatives market worldwide. The company also claimed that &#8220;margin&#8221; trading gives customers an edge over the market compared to those trading spot options.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The global crypto derivatives market represents ~75% of crypto trading volumes worldwide and is a critical trader access point. The ability to trade using margins gives customers leverage and access to the crypto market with less upfront investment than traditional spot trading.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth noting that Coinbase&#8217;s regulatory milestone comes at a time when the exchange is also dealing with legal challenges. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) filed a lawsuit against the company in June, alleging that it operated as an unregistered exchange in the country.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-crypto-mining-industry-forms-dec/">US Crypto Mining Industry Forms DEC to Address Wrong Beliefs About Sustainability </a></p>
<p>Dubbed the Digital Energy Council (DEC), the team is in Washington DC and was established on the 15th of August.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-crypto-mining-industry-forms-dec/">US Crypto Mining Industry Forms DEC to Address Wrong Beliefs About Sustainability </a></p>
]]></description>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-crypto-mining-industry-forms-dec/">US Crypto Mining Industry Forms DEC to Address Wrong Beliefs About Sustainability </a></p>
<p>The US crypto mining sector has created a lobby group targeted at dispelling misconceptions about its sustainability. Majorly, the DEC wants to address the misbelief about its sustainability with policymakers. The US government has kept an eagle eye over the crypto-mining industry for a while. As much as exchanges have had their share of the persisting scrutiny, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/biden-tax-crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">miners are also in the same boat</a>. The sector has been at the receiving end of multiple actions and has been queried about sustainability and emissions.</p>
<p>The Crypto-Asset Environmental Transparency Act was introduced in Congress in March. At the time, miners were accused of exploiting large amounts of power from public grids. Part of the accusation was that the crypto miners emit vast greenhouse gasses. Hence, the bill seeks that mining firms disclose emissions that utilize over 5 megawatts of power.</p>
<h2>Digital Energy Council (DEC) Kickstarts in US</h2>
<p>Now, the DEC founder and president Thomas Mapes stated that it was high time digital asset miners had a unified voice in Washington. As a matter of fact, Mapes said the action was “long overdue”. As the first member associated, the founder <a href="https://twitter.com/tommapes88/status/1691609288953725032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1691609288953725032%7Ctwgr%5Ee9e3be63c068bb19e1d3602401d73b003422270c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fcrypto-mining-lobby-digital-energy-council-launched-in-united-states" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> the group will focus on the “intersection of digital asset mining and energy policy at the federal level”.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Its official 🚨 first member association solely focused on the intersection of digital asset mining and energy ⚡️ policy at the federal level, look forward to working with digital asset and energy leaders check it out: <a href="https://t.co/kBFRkXHTNy">https://t.co/kBFRkXHTNy</a> <a href="https://t.co/kzNhtfxYZi">https://t.co/kzNhtfxYZi</a></p>
<p>— Tom Mapes (@tommapes88) <a href="https://twitter.com/tommapes88/status/1691609288953725032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>After years of service as the chief of staff at the US Department of Energy’s Office of International Affairs, the DEC president was also the director of energy at the Chamber of Digital Commerce. According to Mapes, he began to understand the importance of crypto-mining firms to the energy ecosystem. Referring to some of the advantages, he mentioned purchasing excess energy that would have been useless. He also noted providing energy to the grid during demand. He declared his vision about crypto companies serving the same roles as energy companies in the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I see energy companies, utility companies, power providers &#8211; the big majors &#8211; all taking a look at this new technology and figuring out ways they can get involved in this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>His opinion about crypto companies appears to be different from US lawmakers, which is why the DEC is committed to correcting misconceptions. Besides clearing the air around the sustainability of mining activities, the DEC also plans to advocate for policies supporting US crypto mining and energy development.</p>
<p>The CEO of one of the DEC member companies, Zach Bradford, said the DEC is the only group in Washington in the US that targets mining and energy abundance. He also referred to politics as a team sport requiring dedication and intense efforts.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-bitcoin-etf-approval-2024/">US SEC Extends Bitcoin ETF Approvals Decision to 2024</a></p>
<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has announced an extension of the numerous pending Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund approvals decision until 2024. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-bitcoin-etf-approval-2024/">US SEC Extends Bitcoin ETF Approvals Decision to 2024</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com">Coinspeaker</a><br />
<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/us-sec-bitcoin-etf-approval-2024/">US SEC Extends Bitcoin ETF Approvals Decision to 2024</a></p>
<p>This move <a href="https://cryptosheadlines.com/sec-may-delay-bitcoin-etf-approval-to-early-2024/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">highlights</a> the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>&#8216;s commitment to thoroughly assess the potential risks and benefits of a Bitcoin ETF, considering its potential impact on both the crypto market and traditional financial systems.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Hurdles Surrounding BTC ETF Approvals</h2>
<p>One of the primary reasons behind the SEC’s cautious stance on spot <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coins/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a> ETFs is the rapidly changing and complex nature of the crypto market in the U.S. While the market is regulated to some extent, ongoing uncertainty and regulatory gaps have prompted the SEC to take deliberate steps.</p>
<p>The regulatory actions taken against major players like <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase Global Inc</a> (NASDAQ: COIN), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ripple-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple Labs Inc</a> highlight the need for a cautious approach that safeguards investors and the integrity of the financial system. The SEC’s reluctance to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF may be due to the nature of the investment vehicle. While ETFs linked to Bitcoin futures have been accepted since October 2021, a spot Bitcoin ETF involves a different level of risk due to its direct investment nature.</p>
<p>A futures-linked ETF allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without holding the actual asset. In contrast, a spot Bitcoin ETF would involve the fund holding Bitcoin, raising concerns about custody, security, and market manipulation.</p>
<p>The journey toward obtaining approval for a Bitcoin ETF from the US SEC has been a long-protracted one. Reflecting on the past, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/cameron-winklevoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cameron</a> and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/persons/tyler-winklevoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler Winklevoss</a> were the first to make an attempt to list their Bitcoin Trust as a stock exchange product in July 2013, but their request was rejected by the SEC.</p>
<p>At the time, cryptocurrencies were in their early stage, and the regulatory landscape was characterized by uncertainty. Remarkably, market experts have now <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-us-eoy/https://www.coinspeaker.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-us-eoy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">assigned</a> a roughly 65% likelihood of the SEC approving spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<h2>Firms Await SEC Bitcoin ETF Decision</h2>
<p>Notably, a diverse array of well-known asset management firms has expressed interest in launching spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>These firms, including <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BlackRock Inc</a> (NYSE: BLK), <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/ark-invest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ARK Invest</a>, Bitwise Asset Management, VanEck, WisdomTree, Invesco, <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/galaxy-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galaxy Digital</a>, Fidelity, and Valkyrie, represent a cross-section of the investment landscape, each bringing their unique perspectives, strategies, and expertise to the table.</p>
<p>Stuart Barton, the founder of Volatility Shares, has offered insights into how the SEC&#8217;s deliberation, suggesting that smaller companies might hold an advantage when it comes to obtaining approval for spot crypto ETFs.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the SEC’s evaluation process for ETF applications can take up to 240 days, a timeline that has significant implications for companies seeking approval. The decision on the ARK Bitcoin ETF, for instance, has been pushed to January 2024 due to this timeline.</p>
<p>For other contenders, decisions might not be rendered until March 2024. This extended timeline reflects the SEC&#8217;s careful approach and its dedication to ensuring thorough assessments.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tencent-q2-results-failing-meet-expectations/">Tencent Reports Solid Q2 Results despite Failing to Meet Expectations</a></p>
<p>Chinese tech giant <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tencent Holdings</a> has released its second-quarter financial earnings report for the year. The company reported revenue of 149.2 billion yuan ($20.5 billion), showing an 11% increase compared to the 132 billion yuan it posted in the same period last year. Despite the current macroeconomic conditions in China and evolving market dynamics, the company&#8217;s revenue growth remains strong.</p>
<p>Bloomberg analysts had earlier projected Tencent&#8217;s revenue to reach 152 billion yuan. However, the Chinese firm, operating the world&#8217;s largest gaming business and owner of the social media platform WeChat, reported lower-than-expected income, missing market expectations by a slight margin.</p>
<h2>Tencent&#8217;s Gaming Revenue: Domestic Stability and Global Growth</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://static.www.tencent.com/uploads/2023/08/16/f283f2dfd05151ae7659e7a8e3d667ef.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a>, Tencent&#8217;s Q2 profits reached 26.2 billion yuan, marking an impressive 41% surge from last year. Although slightly below the expected 32.3 billion yuan, Tencent&#8217;s profitability demonstrates its financial resilience in the face of economic turmoil.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s co-founder and chief executive officer, Pony Ma Huateng, said in a statement that the company is committed to boosting revenue quality and margins through innovative AI initiatives.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will continue to drive innovation, including through generative AI, where we will provide a library of models to our partners via our Tencent Cloud Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) offering, as well as refining our proprietary foundation model,&#8221; Huateng.</p>
<p>Tencent&#8217;s domestic gaming revenue held steady at 31.8 billion yuan year-on-year due to the integration of &#8220;less-commercial content&#8221; in key titles. However, this phenomenon is anticipated to be short-lived, with a projected resumption of year-on-year growth in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue from its international games unit surged by 19% to 12.7 billion yuan, powered by popular games like Valorant. With a focus on bolstering global gaming revenue amidst weak domestic sales and regulatory challenges in China, Tencent expressed optimism about recovering from the pandemic-induced downturn in mobile gaming activity.</p>
<h2>Tencent Music Entertainment Group Scores 5.5% Profit Growth</h2>
<p>The company&#8217;s entertainment subsidiary, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, dubbed the &#8220;Spotify of China&#8221;, also <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/tencent-music-q2-2023-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> a 5.5% increase in its quarterly revenue. The growth was attributed to a rise in user subscriptions. However, the company has warned about its future income due to stricter controls on live-streaming activities.</p>
<p>Tony Yip, the company&#8217;s chief strategy officer, told Reuters during a phone call that Tencent Music Entertainment Group is taking steps to revamp its live-streaming business to exert better control over potential risks that might arise down the line.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, while the company&#8217;s revenue growth remains robust, Tencent has further reduced its headcount. During the first quarter report that ended in March, the Chinese company had about 106,221 employees. However, this quarter, the number decreased to 104,503 at the end of June.</p>

<p>The Dutch economy, once a beacon of robust growth and stability, has hit a rough patch as it enters a recession following two consecutive quarters of contraction.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/dutch-economy-recession/">Dutch Economy Enters Recession amid Consecutive Contractions</a></p>
<p>The preliminary estimate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/dutch-economy-enters-recession-inflation-bites-2023-08-16/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> by Statistics Netherlands revealed a 0.3% decline in the second quarter of the year, following a 0.4% contraction in the first quarter. The Dutch economy’s recent downturn comes as a surprise to many, especially considering its rapid rebound from the economic slump induced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Netherlands achieved yearly economic growth of about 5%.</p>
<p>This strong performance at the time was largely attributed to successful <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/azn-stock-up-0-68-now-astrazeneca-to-deliver-400m-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-to-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccination campaigns</a>, increased consumer spending, and a resurgence in trade activities. The Netherlands was admired for its ability to adapt and emerge from the pandemic-induced crisis with resilience.</p>
<p>However, the consecutive quarterly contractions in the first half of 2023 have raised questions about the sustainability of this growth trajectory. Economists and analysts are now grappling to understand the underlying causes of this sudden reversal.</p>
<h2>Factors Influencing the Dutch Economy’s Recession</h2>
<p>As the first recession since the pandemic, it is imperative to dissect the contributing factors to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation. A closer examination reveals that a drop in consumer spending and exports, exacerbated by surging inflation, lies at the heart of the Netherlands’ economic challenges.</p>
<p>The report highlighted that consumer spending, which is a key indicator of economic vigor, has suffered a significant blow, plunging by 1.6%. This decline is particularly concerning as it reflects a reduction in the purchasing power of households, indicative of broader economic uncertainty.</p>
<p>The surge in inflation, which has driven up costs across the board, has prompted individuals to tighten their belts and curtail discretionary expenditures. High prices for necessities like food and energy bills have caused people to reconsider their spending habits, resulting in lower overall consumption.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, renowned for its robust trade network, has also seen its exports shrink by 0.7% compared to the previous quarter. This drop in exports is indicative of global supply chain disruptions that have plagued economies since the outbreak of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The delicate web of international trade on which the Dutch economy depends has been stretched by disruptions, impeding the flow of products and services. As a result, exporters are dealing with delays, increased costs, and decreased demand from trading partners dealing with their own economic difficulties.</p>
<p>Inflation, a universal concern across economies, has played a pivotal role in the Dutch recession. While the country’s inflation rate peaked at 14.5% in September of the previous year, the figures have subsequently declined.</p>
<p>However, even with a decline, inflation remains relatively high, hovering around 6% in the second quarter of 2023. This <a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/netherlands/inflation-cpi" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">persistent inflationary pressure</a> has magnified the strain on household budgets, eroding purchasing power and contributing to the decline in consumer spending.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/intel-drops-tower-acquisition-us-china-tension/">Intel Drops $5.4B Tower Acquisition Deal amid Growing Tension between US and China</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel Corporation</a> (NASDAQ: INTC) has announced that it will not be pursuing the acquisition of Israeli contract chipmaker Tower Semiconductor any further. According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230815632091/en/Intel-Announces-Termination-of-Tower-Semiconductor-Acquisition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a>, the deal, which expired on Tuesday, August 15, will see Intel pay a termination fee of $353 million to Towers. However, the chipmaker assures that the contract termination has been mutually agreed to.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sources with inside knowledge of the matter have claimed that the decision to drop the deal borders on Intel&#8217;s failure to secure regulatory approval from China. That is after signing the $5.4 billion acquisition deal over 18 months ago.</p>
<h2>Growing Tension between China and the US</h2>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, the situation only goes to prove further, that relations between the United States and China have recently deteriorated. That is especially in the aspect of trade and technology. And now, even <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/china-chip-bans-micron/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate deal-making</a> such as the Intel/Tower acquisition is being affected.</p>
<p>DuPont De Nemours is another company that had a similar experience with Chinese regulators. Last year, Dupont also dropped an already agreed $5.2 billion acquisition deal for electronics materials maker Rogers Corp. And its reasons are quite similar to Intel&#8217;s. At the time, Dupont also claimed that there were delays in getting regulatory the Chinese regulators to approve the deal.</p>
<p>It remains unclear whether regulators would have approved the deal if Intel and Tower had extended the contract. However, Intel appears to be leaving nothing to chance.</p>
<p>According to Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, all efforts to get the Tower deal approved by the regulators proved abortive. Gelsinger, who visited the country as recently as a month ago, says even his meeting with government officials has not yielded any results either.</p>
<h2>Intel to Focus on Foundry Business</h2>
<p>According to Intel&#8217;s CEO, the goal is to regain transistor and power performance leadership by 2025. He said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our foundry efforts are critical to unlocking the full potential of IDM 2.0, and we continue to drive forward on all facets of our strategy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Away from regulations, Intel will divert its attention to its foundry business, which makes chips for other companies. Intel will hope to achieve this, by investing heavily in its foundry, says Gelsinger.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-initiative-us-lawmaker-ethics-violation/">A Political Initiative from Coinbase Features US Lawmaker with Ethics Violation</a></p>
<p>Rep. David Schweikert, listed as a lawmaker with "very supportive" views on crypto in the United States, reached a settlement requiring him to pay $175,000 in connection to breaches of House ethics regulations.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/coinbase-initiative-us-lawmaker-ethics-violation/">A Political Initiative from Coinbase Features US Lawmaker with Ethics Violation</a></p>
<p>US-based cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/coinbase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase</a> has been recently working on actively advocating for crypto holders to directly speak to lawmakers. In its latest push, Coinbase <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/coinbase-political-initiative-features-lawmaker-admited-ethics-violations" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">featured</a> a House of Representatives member who has been previously facing charges of 11 ethics violations.</p>
<p>By August 15th, over 54,000 people had joined Coinbase&#8217;s &#8220;Stand with Crypto Alliance&#8221; to connect with US lawmakers on the national level. This program enables users to track the &#8220;crypto sentiment&#8221; of members in the US Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p>As of the time of this report, the initiative&#8217;s webpage displayed Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Brad Sherman as being &#8220;strongly against&#8221; crypto policies, while Representatives Josh Gottheimer, Ritchie Torres, and David Schweikert were categorized as &#8220;very supportive&#8221;. Warren has often expressed concerns linking crypto to illicit activities like the fentanyl trade in China. Torres urged the US Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEC</a>) to limit its enforcement actions against crypto firms.</p>
<p>According to the information provided by Stand with Crypto, Schweikert has supported three pro-crypto bills during his tenure and has made four statements regarding digital assets. The alliance mentioned that &#8220;Members of Congress may have views you strongly agree or disagree with&#8221;, without specifically mentioning any non-crypto policy positions.</p>
<h2>Crypto Donations and Campaign Finance</h2>
<p>In 2020, the House Ethics Committee imposed a $50,000 fine on Schweikert for violating campaign finance rules that breached House ethics guidelines. In 2022, the Federal Election Commission fined the Arizona representative $125,000 for related allegations. The violations centered around not reporting loans and misusing campaign funds for personal purposes. Cointelegraph contacted Schweikert&#8217;s office for comment, but no response was received at the time of this report.</p>
<p>Among the donations received by the Stand with Crypto Alliance, there was a contribution of over $215 from a crypto user using the X (formerly <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/twitter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a>) handle &#8220;Jerry Mander&#8221;, which is a play on the term &#8220;gerrymander&#8221;, referring to manipulating district boundaries for political advantage. Additionally, there was a $191.98 donation from an unverified account that might be associated with Roger Bartlett, Coinbase’s head of institutional operations solutions and Coinbase Treasury.</p>
<p>This political initiative represents the latest effort by Coinbase to encourage crypto users to support &#8220;pro-crypto candidates&#8221; in the United States. Currently, the exchange is facing a lawsuit from the SEC over alleged unregistered securities offerings, prompting calls from many lawmakers and industry advocates to dismiss the case.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-inflation-sharp-drop-july/">UK Inflation Sees Sharp Drop in July as Core and Services Show Mixed Trends</a></p>
<p>The United Kingdom&#8217;s inflation rate took a step back in July, registering an annual increase of 6.8%, a considerable decline from the 7.9% <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-inflation-falls-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recorded</a> in June. The new UK inflation rate is the lowest level the country has seen since February 2022. On a monthly basis, the country&#8217;s Consumer Price Index (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-are-the-consumer-price-index-cpi-and-the-producer-price-index-ppi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPI</a>) dropped by 0.4%, in line with expectations.</p>
<p>According to the latest data <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/july2023#:~:text=The%20Consumer%20Prices%20Index%20(CPI)%20annual%20inflation%20rate%20for%20housing,price%20cap%20in%20July%202023." target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on August 16, the cooling of inflation aligns with market predictions. While the headline figure is finding some stability, underlying trends in core inflation and services inflation send mixed signals.</p>
<h2>Gas and Electricity Prices Drive Down Inflation Rates</h2>
<p>The reduction in headline inflation was influenced mainly by declining gas and electricity prices, which played a vital role in driving down the overall index. Additionally, easing food price inflation contributed to the broader drop in consumer prices.</p>
<p>Despite this moderation, it&#8217;s crucial to note that the UK still maintains one of the highest inflation rates in Western Europe, surpassed only by Iceland and Austria.</p>
<p>While the easing of headline inflation is welcome news for consumers, experts are paying closer attention to the underlying trends.</p>
<p>Core inflation, which excludes the more volatile elements of energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, remained stubbornly high at 6.9% year-on-year in July, holding steady from the previous month. This slight upward trend in core inflation contrasts with predictions of a 6.8% reading. This steadiness indicates that certain sectors of the economy continue to experience upward price pressures.</p>
<p>The services sector, a vital contributor to the UK economy, saw inflation rise to 7.4% in July, up from 7.2% in June. This upward movement in service inflation raises questions about the resilience of some industries and the potential impact on consumer behavior.</p>
<h2>Government Efforts to Curb Inflation is Working</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/16/uk-headline-inflation-rate-drops-sharply-to-6point8percent-in-july-in-line-with-expectations.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CNBC,</a> the data published by ONS prompted responses from economic experts and officials. Ruth Gregory, an economist at consultancy Capital Economics, emphasized that the UK central bank, the Bank of England (<a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-england/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoE</a>), has more work to do given the unexpected strength in wage growth and services inflation.</p>
<p>While responding to the ONS report, Finance Minister Jeremy Hunt said falling inflation shows the government&#8217;s efforts towards the economy are &#8220;working&#8221;. He further stated that while efforts to curb price rises show results, there is still a journey ahead to reach the desired finish line.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must stick to our plan to halve inflation this year and get it back to the 2 percent target as soon as possible,&#8221; Hunt said.</p>
<h2>BoE to Raise Interest Rates</h2>
<p>The ONS data also provided an intriguing backdrop to the ongoing deliberations of the BOE. The central bank has closely monitored core inflation and service prices as indicators of potential economic trends.</p>
<p>The persistence of elevated core inflation hints at potential challenges in the labor market and the broader supply chain, creating a dilemma for the central bank as it seeks to balance managing inflation and supporting economic growth.</p>
<p>With inflation exceeding the 2% target, the BoE&#8217;s efforts to manage monetary policy have become more complex.</p>
<p>During a BoE monetary policy meeting earlier this month, the government decided to raise the interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.25%, signaling the 14th consecutive increase since the last <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/uk-raises-interest-13th-time/">hike</a> in June 2022. The move shows the central bank&#8217;s commitment to addressing inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee on the other hand believes that the increase will likely be the end of high-interest rates.</p>

<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stocks-fall-global-economic-worries-weigh/">Stocks Fall as Global Economic Worries Weigh on Wall Street</a></p>
<p>In a volatile trading session on Tuesday, stocks experienced a significant downturn as strain over the global economic outlook coupled with a decline in United States banking sector performance, exerted pressure on Wall Street.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look at Market Index Performance</h2>
<p>Reports <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/14/stock-market-today-live-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reveal</a> that the stock market’s stumble was largely attributed to mounting concerns about the global economy, with China’s economic condition drawing particular attention.</p>
<p>These concerns resonated across the international financial landscape, impacting investor sentiment. As the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-dow-jones-industrial-average-index-djia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dow Jones Industrial Average</a> (INDEXDJX: .DJI) plummeted by 361.24 points, equivalent to a 1.02% drop, the prevailing unease was evident as its value is now pegged at 34,946.39.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-sp-500-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;P 500 Index</a> (INDEXSP: .INX) retreated by 1.16%, closing at 4,437.86 points. This marked a pivotal moment as the index fell below its 50-day moving average, a technical indicator that is often closely monitored by traders. Similarly, the <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/guides/what-is-the-nasdaq-composite-index/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nasdaq Composite</a> (INDEXNASDAQ: .IXIC) experienced a decline, closing down by 1.14% at 13,631.05 points.</p>
<p>US financial giants also witnessed their shares slide as credit rating downgrades cast a shadow over the sector. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/jpmorgan-chase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: JPM) and <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/wells-fargo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wells Fargo &amp; Co</a> (NYSE: WFC) saw their shares dip by 2%, while <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/bank-of-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bank of America Corp</a> (NYSE: BAC) shares declined by 3%. This move came after credit rating agency Fitch Ratings issued a warning that it might downgrade the credit ratings of several banks, including JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>The SPDR S&amp;P Regional Banking ETF (KBE) fell around 3% in trade on Tuesday. The drop followed remarks by Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari, who pushed for stricter capital regulations. Kashkari expressed concern about potential vulnerabilities in the banking industry if inflation is not sufficiently controlled and interest rates are raised further.</p>
<h2>China’s Economic Data Deepens Global Strain</h2>
<p>The report further highlighted that global investor sentiment took another hit as China reported underwhelming economic data. China’s industrial production increased by 3.7% year on year in July, falling short of expectations. Additionally, retail sales growth was weaker than anticipated.</p>
<p>In response to these challenges, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) unexpectedly lowered interest rates by 15 basis points to 2.5% from 2.65%. However, these measures failed to reassure investors and instead raised concerns about the struggling real estate market in China. The uncertainties surrounding China&#8217;s economic direction heightened market anxiety.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop of financial sector struggles and global economic concerns, earnings season for retailers commenced with a mix of results. <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/home-depot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Home Depot Inc</a> (NYSE: HD) <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/home-depot-q2-2023-earnings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> earnings per share and revenue that exceeded analyst expectations, resulting in a little increase in its stock price.</p>
<p>Amidst the prevailing uncertainty, the July retail sales report in the United States revealed a silver lining. Retail sales increased by 0.7% month over month, beating economists’ expectations of a 0.4% increase.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, August 15, cross-border payments platform Stellar announced its decision of investing in the global money-transfer company <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/moneygram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MoneyGram International</a>. By using money from its own treasury for investment, the Stellar Foundation becomes a minority holder in MoneyGram.</p>
<p>Stellar Development Foundation CEO and Executive Director Denelle Dixon called the new investing decision &#8220;an easy one&#8221;. &#8220;After years of getting to know the business and the teams, we are excited to take part in MGI’s next chapter. It’s been an awesome few years working together, and we are excited for what’s next!&#8221; she <a href="https://twitter.com/DenelleDixon/status/1691456351955025920" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">noted</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most importantly, it signifies a rededication from MoneyGram International, one of the world&#8217;s leading global financial technology, to becoming a digital-forward leader in fintech,&#8221; added Dixon. However, the Stellar Development Foundation hasn&#8217;t given enough details about the exact investment amount.</p>
<p>This investment allows SDF to support MGI&#8217;s efforts, especially in areas like growing its digital business, researching blockchain technology, and contributing to the various ways this fintech company helps people and businesses handle money worldwide. It&#8217;s also a significant commitment from MGI, a prominent global fintech, to embrace digital innovation and become a leader in the field.</p>
<h2>Stellar and MoneyGram Partnership</h2>
<p>The Stellar Development Foundation and MoneyGram started working together in 2021, but their collaboration on tools and technology goes back to 2019.</p>
<p>By November 2022, MoneyGram allowed users in the United States to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency using its mobile app. In July 2023, the company introduced a new service that lets people in Venezuela deposit funds into their accounts through its partnership with local bank Banesco.</p>
<p>Stellar&#8217;s goal is to use blockchain technology to make cross-border payments faster and more affordable. MoneyGram is one of the largest remittance companies in the United States, competing with <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/organizations/western-union/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Western Union</a>, Intermex, and Euronet.</p>
<p>Speaking to the crypto publication Decrypt, Stellar Development Foundation&#8217;s Director of Communications and Public Affairs Ellen Canale <a href="https://decrypt.co/152598/stellar-invests-in-moneygram-in-bid-to-become-a-digital-forward-leader-in-fintech" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Investment isn&#8217;t specific to any particular work&#8221; but because &#8220;we are confident in the organization, management, and board, and the company&#8217;s plans for the future focused on increasing MGI&#8217;s digital investment and bringing value to the under and unbanked through digital experiences.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Stellar Foundation has also been investing in other projects this year. Earlier in April, SDF <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/stellar-franklin-onchain-money-fund/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">invested</a> in Franklin OnChain US Government Money Fund.</p>
