										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Seychelles, seychelles, July 17th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">As part of Flipster&rsquo;s (formerly AQX) name launch, the business today announced an additional 1,500,000 USD worth of bonus rewards to encourage new users to join and trade on their exchange. Until the rewards are fully distributed, the futures exchange will run at least one campaign per week to encourage new users to signup and trade derivatives on the Flipster platform. Under the old name the exchange has already made available more than 400,000USDT worth bonus in past campaigns.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The first promotion in the series kicked off on the 17th of July, 2023 (running for seven days). A massive 110,000 USDT in bonuses has been allocated. 10,000 USDT to reward new users when completing identity verification with a 10 USDT Bonus. The remaining 100,000 USDT bonus is to incentivise and reward high volume traders that give the platform a chance. The top performer by trading volume will be rewarded with 10,000 USDT in Bonus at the end of the weekly campaign.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Flipster has reimagined futures trading with a mobile-first approach to appeal to casual crypto traders with limited experience in derivatives trading (or, as they say, Flipping).</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The method is to specialize in derivatives trading, stripping back the app experience to make it faster to learn and easier to use. Novice traders can open, close and monitor positions from any location. Potentially meaning some users may make more money on the bus to work, than from their days Labor. Beyond ease of use, the portable experience makes trading fun and feels less like a technical task.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The flip to a mobile-first approach came after initially having a web experience similar to other futures exchanges. The traditional UI for futures trading has a steep learning curve and is considerably more technical, which strongly contrasts with the UI that most contemporary apps users have become familiar with. The data concluded that users new to derivatives were not attracted to this experience as it had been built for experienced traders. The Flipster team discovered a few alternative UIs for future trading and none that have successfully been created to onboard new users to crypto futures trading at scale.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">While the focus is on simplicity, Flipster has features that will spark the interest of experienced traders as well. The exchange regularly adds new perpetual swap contracts, and as of today, over 120 assets can be traded with leverage, making Flipster a competitive exchange for traders to consider. Amongst their assets are tokens not found for futures on other exchanges and some even with low visibility in spot markets.</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Yongjin Kim said, &ldquo;The team has been working very hard on bringing this new vision for futures trading to life, and now is the right time to incentivise users to trade with us. Once users start trading on our platform, they will be coming back again and again. Rather than just copying what every other exchange has done, we are doing something fresh, and I believe the market is ready for some injection of new ideas. To our existing users, I want to thank you for being with us, and to the new guys coming in now, Welcome&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<li dir="ltr">Binance is reported to have dismissed about 1,000 of its employees recently.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The report cites sources close to the exchange and comes at a time Binance is battling regulatory pressure.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The leading crypto exchange celebrated its 6th birthday on July 14.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/binance/">Binance</a>, the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has reportedly cut its employee number by 1,000 in recent weeks.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Wall Street Journal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a> on Binance&rsquo;s layoffs on Friday, citing a source as saying the crypto exchange could still dismiss more of its workforce in coming months amid staff reorganization. According to the report, the crypto company could lay off up to a third of its workforce.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance celebrated its sixth year since it launched today, July 14, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 years ago today, a little exchange called <a href="https://twitter.com/binance?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Binance</a> launched. Everyone was telling me there is no chance for another exchange. Here are some reflections over the last few years. Thank you for your unwavering support! &#128591;<br> <a href="https://t.co/9O4UnE3G36">https://t.co/9O4UnE3G36</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CZ &#128310; Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1679895264654503942?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Binance&rsquo;s employee layoffs</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Multiple crypto and mainstream companies have in the past year or so aggressively cut on their headcount, with crypto&rsquo;s situation exacerbated by the debilitating crypto winter. Binance was among those to eye staff reduction as Wu Blockchain revealed in a May 31<a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1663890209526927373" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">&nbsp;<u>tweet</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Prior to the expected employee cut, the Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao led company had an estimated 8,000 employees globally. Reports highlighted plans to send 20% of the workforce home.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Binance remains the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume. However, the past month has been tough for the company in terms of the myriad of regulatory challenges it has faced.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The early June lawsuit by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), came as the exchange exited a number of countries due to regulatory reasons. It included Belgium and the Netherlands, and it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-drops-its-license-application-in-austria/">ended its pursuit of a license in Austria</a>. Menwhile, it also faced scrutiny in France and recently Australia.</p>
<p dir="ltr">There have also been exits by top executives, including exchange&rsquo;s former Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Fink did not talk about Bitcoin specifically, noting he&rsquo;s prohibited by virtue of BlackRock&rsquo;s spot ETF filing.</li>
<li dir="ltr">In his interview with CNBC on Friday, Fink mentioned how gold ETF changed the gold investing market.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has yet again shared bullish remarks about <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/">cryptocurrencies</a>, noting in an <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkStreet/status/1679860599780519943" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNBC&rsquo;s Squawk on the Street on Friday that crypto has the capacity to transcend any international currency.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the BlackRock CEO, who recently commented on the potential of Bitcoin as digital gold and an international investment asset, repeated the viewpoint in his latest remarks. In particular, he pointed to the global demand for crypto as something that signifies its potential.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Fink on ETFs and crypto&rsquo;s international appeal</h2>
<p dir="ltr">BlackRock filed for a spot <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin-etf/">Bitcoin ETF</a> last month and together with Fidelity Investments, Ark Invest and others, are convinced they have done everything required to have the SEC approve the first such ETF for the US market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The $9 trillion asset manager&rsquo;s recent outlook of crypto investing, and what its entry into the spot ETF market could mean for the broader industry continues to trigger positive vibes a month since its initial SEC filing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Fink said:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I</em><em>&nbsp;can&rsquo;t talk about Bitcoin because we have a SEC filing and I&rsquo;m prohibited, but I can talk about crypto in general and what we have done. We believe we have a responsibility to democratise investing. And we have done a great job and the role of ETFs in the world is transforming investing. I think we&rsquo;re only at the beginning of that</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The BlackRock chief then noted that ETFs industry is set to grow into a multiple trillion dollar market as the fixed income market expands. He also highlighted what has been achieved since the gold ETF debut 20 years ago, especially in democratising gold investing and bringing down the cost of transactions for physical gold.</p>
<p dir="ltr">An ETF will democratise the crypto investing space in the same way, Fink opined, adding that BlackRock&rsquo;s clients have over the last five years continually asked about crypto&rsquo;s role. He says he believes crypto is an &ldquo;international asset.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>It has differentiating value versus other assets. But more importantly, because it is so international, it&rsquo;s going to transcend any one currency and currency valuation</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<li dir="ltr">The ex-Celsius CEO was arrested on Thursday.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Celsius filed for bankruptcy in 2022, alongside other leading crypto lenders.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Mashinsky&rsquo;s bail must be signed by two financially recognizable persons.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Alex Mashinsky, the founder &amp; former CEO of bankrupt crypto lender <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/celsius/">Celsius Network</a>, has pleaded not guilty to fraud charges filed against him by the US Department of Justice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mashinsky was arrested on Thursday, with the DOJ charging him with securities fraud, wire fraud, and commodities fraud. The ex-Celsius CEO also faces accusations of manipulating the price of the crypto platform&rsquo;s native asset CEL.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Mashinsky pleads not guilty</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The DOJ&rsquo;s arrest and arraignment of the ex-Celsius CEO came as the SEC also brought charges against Mashinky. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has also filed complaints against him.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Mashinksy pleaded not guilty to the DOJ charges and was granted a $40 million bail. The personal recognizance bond has to be signed by two persons deemed to be financially responsible.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to court documents published on July 14, the former crypto figure&rsquo;s wife is one of two FRPs, while the second FRP needs to append their signature today. A key date in this development is July 21, which is a court-set deadline for the second FRP.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While the former Celsius boss will be released without paying the $40 million bond, there&rsquo;s a claim on his bank account and residence in New York. &nbsp;Mashinsky has also been ordered to surrender his travel documents to authorities and is prohibited from opening bank or cryptocurrency accounts unless first approved by Pretrial Services.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Mashinsky is yet another high-profile crypto figure to be arrested following the collapses and bankruptcies that hit crypto companies in 2022. Former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and Terra founder Do Kwon are others.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies had a very good week after the weak US inflation data and after the SEC vs Ripple case outcome. Ripple price surged by more than 70% while the market cap of all cryptocurrencies jumped to over $1.25 trillion. Here is the weekend prediction for key coins like Cardano, Solana, and ApeCoin.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cardano price prediction</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/cardano"><u>Cardano</u></a> ADA price made a strong bullish breakout after the SEC vs Ripple news, which we wrote about&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ripple-wins-sec-case-xrp-not-a-security/"><u>here</u></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>It jumped to a high of $0.375, the highest level since June 4th. This rally happened because the SEC had singled out Cardano as a financial security. As such, there is a likelihood that Cardano and its developers would prevail if the SEC brought charges.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Turning to the daily chart, we see that the Cardano price was in a consolidation phase before the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/"><u>Ripple news</u></a>.

<p dir="ltr">Now, Cardano has moved slightly above the 50-day moving average. It is also trading at the 200-day moving average. Therefore, while the bullish comeback has eased, there is a likelihood that it will continue rising as buyers target the next key resistance level at $0.42, which is about 20% above the current level.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SOL price has jumped above the important resistance level at $25.83, the highest level on April 17th. The coin has also risen above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. At the same time, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the overbought level of 80.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stochastic Oscillator RSI has moved above the overbought point. Therefore, the coin could keep rising as buyers target the key resistance at $38.60, the highest level on November 5th.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The token has crashed below all moving averages while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved above the neutral point at 50. Therefore, the outlook of the ApeCoin token is bearish as demand for NFTs and BAYC tokens dropped.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">US court ruled in favour of Ripple in the case initiated by SEC</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The ruling is positive for crypto, with newcomers like Chancer benefiting</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer could rise by double or triple-digit percentages in 2023</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Crypto is not a security. This was the message the US judge Analisa Torres passed in making a positive ruling on Ripple&rsquo;s XRP classification against the Securities and Exchange Commission. The classification was welcome in crypto quarters as XRP pumped by double digits. The ruling is positive for existing and upcoming digital assets as it clears legal uncertainty. Chancer could ride on this optimism to become a valuable asset, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>presale</u></a> quickly selling out in just a month.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SEC loss is a win for crypto</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The SEC&rsquo;s case against Ripple has been a long-standing issue since December 2020. It would have set a precedent for the classification of digital assets, impacting their attractiveness to investors. SEC believed Ripple violated security laws through the issuance of XRP. The court&rsquo;s verdict now clears the legal hurdle and represents a win for crypto as it limits SEC&rsquo;s action against other digital asset entities and issuers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The landmark win is positive for Chancer. Chancer is a blockchain-based predictive markets application that launched a presale on June 13th, 2023. A month later, Chancer raised more than $768,526 from investors in the presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors would be excited that the court&rsquo;s ruling creates a transparent market where future entanglements of crypto and the regulator are minimised. Chancer could benefit from the outcome. The enthusiasm that the presale has generated means the positive sentiment created by the ruling could boost demand.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What does Chancer do differently?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer taps into the power of peer-to-peer (P2P) relations to build a blockchain platform for betting. P2P has become popular with crypto and blockchain, as it allows users to exchange value in a decentralised manner across geographies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In its P2P betting model, Chancer allows users to connect with others and bet on their preferred events. Different from the existing betting methods where the bookmakers determine events, odds, and rules, Chancer lets users decide for themselves. Users create P2P markets, determine rules, fix odds, and invite other participants to bet on a decentralised platform. The bets are facilitated by the $CHANCER token, the medium of exchanging value.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But it is not just the betting element, as Chancer is designed to be a medium of investment. Users earn from creating Chancer markets, besides making successful bets on them. For investors who love passive income, there is the option to stake the native token and earn yields. Users also earn for sharing the platform with others.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is Chancer a 10x investment in 2023?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrencies are new asset classes and power innovative use cases. As we have seen in the past, cryptocurrencies can rise by more than 1,000% in a few months after launch. Chancer could be a 10x investment as it powers a user case that has not been exploited in blockchain and crypto. This also reflects the growing popularity of betting.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, a 10x prediction for CHANCER in 2023 could be too early. Chancer is still on presale, and its first listing will occur in the third quarter on Uniswap. It takes a few months for valuable tokens to surge in value 10 times, which this analysis doubts could happen in 2023. Potentially a price increase of 1,000% is likely in 2024. A double or triple-digit percentage price gain is the most realistic scenario for 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Should you buy CHANCER now?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is in its first presale stage, priced at $0.01. Once the first stage concludes, the price will rise to $0.011 in the second phase. It means buying now is attractive as the price is still low.</p>
<p dir="ltr">CHANCER is also headed for listing in the third quarter. Any explosive price move would occur after listing. Buying now allows investors to ride the price momentum when the token debuts on exchanges.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Multichain protocol says its forced to cease operations due to recent events.</li>
<li dir="ltr">CEO Zhaojun and his sister have reportedly been detained leaving the team with no operational funds.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Multichain saw $125 million stolen on July 6, with blockchain security firm Chainalysis pointing to possible rug pull by insiders.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/multichain/"><u>Multichain</u></a>, one of the world&rsquo;s largest cross-chain bridge protocols, has announced its ceasing operations. The news comes just days after the protocol saw an attacker (looked like an inside job) drained $125 million from the protocol&rsquo;s wallets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to a Chainalysis <a href="https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/multichain-exploit-july-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report</u></a>, the mysterious withdrawals on July 6 included $120 million from Multichain&rsquo;s Fantom bridge. The blockchain security firm noted in its report that the &ldquo;unusually large, unauthorized withdrawals&rdquo; looked like a rug pull.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/binance-suspends-transfers-for-several-multichain-bridged-tokens/"><u>covered here</u></a>, an earlier incident with the Multichain protocol had seen the world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange Binance halt deposits and withdrawals of Multichain bridged tokens.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Multichain halts operations</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Multichain has constantly been in the news over the past few months, particularly since May when it was reported that the CEO Zhaojun had been arrested by Chinese police.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">It was alleged authorities confiscated &ldquo;computers, phones, hardware wallets, and mnemonic phrases&rdquo; when they took the CEO into custody. Notably, Zhaojun had control over all of the protocol&rsquo;s operational funds and investments.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1. On May 21, 2023, Multichain CEO Zhaojun was taken away by the Chinese police from his home and has been out of contact with the global Multichain team ever since. The team contacted the MPC node operators and learned that their operational access keys to MPC node servers had&hellip;</p>
<p>&mdash; Multichain (Previously Anyswap) (@MultichainOrg) <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1679768407628185600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p dir="ltr">Zhaojun&rsquo;s sister, who recently transferred remaining user assets to an address under her control, has also been detained. It is this series of events and the &ldquo;lack of alternative sources of information and corresponding operational funds&rdquo; that has forced Multichain to cease operations, an announcement posted on the protocol&rsquo;s Twitter page noted.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>On July 13, according to information provided by Zhaojun&rsquo;s family, the police took Zhaojun&rsquo;s sister into custody. Now, Zhaojun&rsquo;s sister is also out of contact. The status of the assets she has preserved is uncertain, so the team believes it is necessary to inform the community about all the known circumstances. Due to the lack of alternative sources of information and corresponding operational funds, the team is forced to cease operations</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The price of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/multichain/">Multichain (MULTI)</a> was down 4% in the past 24 hours and over 16% in the past week on Friday morning. What happens next to MULTI is uncertain, but it&rsquo;s likely to plummet further. Recent suspicions of rug pull moves haven&rsquo;t helped prices.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel, July 14th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>Spacemesh is proud to announce today, that after five years of work, they will at long last be performing network genesis on July the 14th at 08.00 UTC.</p>
<p>Spacemesh chose the date of July 14th, which commemorates the storming of the Bastille, as the day to launch the People&rsquo;s Coin. The goal is to establish a cryptocurrency that can achieve widespread distribution, particularly among younger generations and underprivileged demographics who are currently unable to participate in the cryptocurrency revolution due to insurmountable barriers to entry</p>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/mbSdn8ctzVEQj3BMuiTni0N0YKQf3DTg19kRPNRd-nQCGevyBb_1689245433fExCCrVF4C.jpeg"></strong></p>
<h2>Spacemesh, The People&rsquo;s Coin, is born today</h2>
<p>Spacemesh&rsquo;s team of cryptographers, led by Prof. <a href="https://talmoran.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Tal Moran</a>, spent over 5 years building a radically novel way to achieve consensus in the permissionless setting from scratch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of the commonly-used PoW or PoStake, Spacemesh uses PoST (Proof of Space-Time)</li>
<li>Rather than a Chain topology (i.e., a blockchain), Spacemesh uses a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), a.k.a. a &ldquo;mesh&rdquo;</li>
<li>Additionally, rather than the winner-takes-all paradigm via Lottery (&ldquo;Competitive Mining&rdquo;) used by all Nakamoto-based consensus protocols, Spacemesh uses lottery-free, non-competitive &ldquo;leaderless&rdquo; voting (&ldquo;Collaborative Mining&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Lastly, instead of generating a new proof for every challenge, which is energy intensive, Spacemesh miners reuse the original proof continually&mdash;resulting in extremely low energy use and near-zero ongoing costs for operating a miner</li>
</ul>
<p>The Spacemesh protocol ensures fairness for smaller home miners by rewarding them based on their storage commitment size during each epoch, which occurs approximately every two weeks. This prevents powerful miners, including adversarial ones, from receiving a disproportionate share of rewards. Spacemesh also has significantly lower barriers to entry compared to other permissionless cryptocurrencies. To become a miner (smesher), all that is required is a PC with available storage space, any GPU with OpenCL support, and a reliable internet connection. Specialized mining equipment is unnecessary, and ongoing power usage is low, resulting in minimal electricity bills. Additionally, there is no need for deposits, bank accounts, or credit cards.</p>
<p>The combination of low entry barriers, low operational costs, and incentive compatibility, establishes a novel guarantee of fair distribution.</p>
<p>Once a miner joins the network by committing the minimum required storage, they become an active participant and receive a fair share of rewards during each epoch. This share is likely sufficient to cover any electricity expenses or hardware replacement costs. The low marginal costs for home users, coupled with the absence of competition-based rewards, encourage small miners to join the network. This leads to a diverse ecosystem where even smaller participants can actively contribute without being priced out.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many other participants join the network, every miner is guaranteed to receive their fair share of rewards consistently and predictably. There are no more races for big payouts or reliance on luck through lotteries.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://coinjournal.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image_16892455212VCRcbLas3.jpg"></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To reach its full revolutionary potential, crypto cannot be introduced as stocks, e.g. gamble money you don&rsquo;t have, nor as an elites-only hobby. We must by necessity offer these users a better deal: Come as you are, with whatever PC you already own, and the know-how already have &mdash; no other out-of-pocket expenses are needed at any time. It&rsquo;s the only conceivable way to have a widespread currency that impacts the people who need it most.&rdquo; explains Tomer Afek, the co-founder and CEO of SpaceMesh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the People&rsquo;s Coin, everything we do, everything we write&mdash;the code and apps we ship&mdash;should be understandable, accessible, legible, and usable by regular people. This has profound implications for our design, UX, engineering, and <a href="https://spacemesh.io/blog/spacemesh-economics-intro/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">economics</a>.&rdquo; he adds.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spacemesh&rsquo;s Team is dedicated to breaking down barriers that prevent the benefits of cryptocurrency from reaching more people. We are committed to continuously lowering entry barriers, ensuring that more diverse demographics can participate in the crypto revolution. Our goal is to create a more equitable world, fostering improved cooperation on local, national, and global scales. By making crypto accessible to all, we believe we can contribute to a future that is fairer and more inclusive for everyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>London, United Kingdom, July 14th, 2023, Chainwire</strong></p>
<p>Shiba Memu, a new dog-themed memecoin, has reported strong demand for its presale, raising almost $800,000 in just nine days. A total of $798,000 worth of SHMU tokens have been purchased so far ahead of the memecoin&rsquo;s official exchange launch.</p>
<p>The project is centred around combining AI with advanced memetics to create a token that can market itself. Throughout its presale, which lasts for eight weeks, the price of the token will increase every 24 hours, until it eventually launches on multiple exchanges. SHMU tokens are currently available to buy on the <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=shiba-launch&amp;utm_term=external&amp;utm_content=shiba-memu-launch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">official website</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=shiba-launch&amp;utm_term=external&amp;utm_content=shiba-memu-launch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Shiba Memu</a> aims to become the top dog by using AI to generate its own marketing, doing the work of multiple agencies in real time, and eventually becoming a crypto marketing powerhouse. Launched at $0.011125 on day one of the presale, the coin will increase in value by $0.000225 every day until launch.</p>
<p>From day one to day nine, the cost of SHMU tokens rose by 16.18%. There follows a 41% increase scheduled by day 21 and, at the end of the presale on day 60, the SHMU token will cost 119.3% more than the initial launch price.</p>
<p>Shiba Memu&rsquo;s roadmap is centered around harnessing the power of AI technology to disrupt a traditional market. Its AI will learn from successful marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself across relevant forums and social networks. Shiba Memu will be able to generate content based on the data that its AI continually analyzes, publishing this on several online platforms. It will then monitor and analyze the success of its marketing efforts and adjust them accordingly, constantly learning and improving content in order to further optimize results.</p>
<p>The automatic nature of the platform removes humans from content marketing efforts, reducing delays and eliminating time-consuming tasks. It also means that Shiba Memu will be incredibly low maintenance, just like a real-life dog.</p>
<p>Shiba Memu has earned approval from CertiK, a top-tier blockchain auditor, which gives investors assurance that the project&rsquo;s code and specifications have been reviewed and that the Shiba Memu team has passed a KYC process, reinforcing the project&rsquo;s legitimacy. SHMU token holders will also be able to stake their coins to earn additional <a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=shiba-launch&amp;utm_term=external&amp;utm_content=shiba-memu-launch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">SHMU tokens</a>. Shiba Memu has in-built, native utility, making it a potential long-term hold for meme fans and crypto enthusiasts alike.</p>
<h3>About Shiba Memu</h3>
