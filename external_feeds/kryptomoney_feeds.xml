<li>Millionaire XRP Whales rapidly fill their bags to end 2022</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-price-analysis-xrp-jumps-13-ripple-sees-backing-from-another-major-player-in-lawsuit/">XRP</a> was a top gainer among the top ten cryptocurrencies on December 26 as its price suddenly jumped 8%. At the time of publication, XRP was up 6.89% in the last 24 hours at $0.368. The cross-border token was likewise up 9% over the last seven days. According to the onchain analytics firm Santiment, millionaire XRP whales are rapidly filling their bags in preparation for the 2022 closure. It observes that XRP’s whale and shark addresses that make up the 1 million to 10 million XRP tier have been rapidly accumulating to end 2022. The onchain analytics firm noted that in December, both the number of these large addresses (1,617) and their percentage of supply held (7.23%) hit an all-time high. In other news, Matt Hamilton, Ex-Ripple developer, announced upcoming developments on XRP Ledger. He revealed that the blockchain will soon introduce smart contracts, which are currently in the &#8220;development process.&#8221; Likewise, SEC General Counsel Dan Berkovitz will depart the agency, effective January 31, 2023, with Megan Barbero, appointed subsequently.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/xrp-price-analysis-prevailing-trend-suggests-xrp-usd-might-sustain-bounce-from-0-400-as-it-marks-10th-birthday/">XRP/USD</a> pair is currently in a rebound move towards hitting the $0.3700 mark during the session. The price of the pair has increased to an intraday high of $0.3698 after falling to a low of $0.3324 on December 19. The rebound is being driven by a desire to hold onto recent gains. After the RSI retreated below its midlines, buyers saw the retracement as a chance to purchase the dip.<br /><br />Even the most positive analyst expectations haven&#8217;t been able to match XRP gains, which started the day around the $0.3457 mark. The daily chart&#8217;s bullish recovery suggests that the surge might be gaining momentum. When momentum returns, the next target would be above $0.3750 and the next high of $0.3923.</p>

<p>XRP price is within the short-term moving averages (MA 50 and MA 200), with a rise on the 4-hour chart becoming well-pronounced. The bears are now on the back foot despite the recent decline to a low of $0.3324. After the relative strength index showed overextension into the overbought zone, intraday traders look to book profit. The recent rebound may present a chance for the bulls to reorganize.<br /><br />A crucial level supporting the upswing is the demand region at $0.3510. The nearest barrier on the upside is found around $0.3750 before the moving average (MA 200). And if it is breached, a larger rally toward the high of $0.4000 may begin. A closure above the immediate resistance level of $0.3750 would indicate that the short-term trend is now ranging.</p>

<p>After a $72 million bailout offer from creditors, fears have been expressed regarding the overall sustainability of the<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-more-than-18-million-btc-now-removed-from-exchanges/"> Bitcoin</a> trading community amid a lengthy bear market in light of Basic Scientific&#8217;s recent bankruptcy proceedings. To get out of their unsustainable high debt levels, it turns out that public Bitcoin users have obligations of about $4 billion.<br /><br />During the bull market of 2021, the Bitcoin mining industry racked up a huge debt load, which negatively impacted their financial situation during the ensuing bear market. According to predictive analytics by Hashrate Index, the top 10 crypto mining debtors collectively owe more than $2.6 billion.<br /><br />The largest debtor in the group, Core Scientific, has applied for Chapter 11 insolvency protection in Texas due to dropping sales and <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-is-at-bottom-of-current-cycle-as-large-scale-bitcoin-liquidations-end/">BTC prices</a>. As of September 30th, Core Scientific had $1.3 bn in commitments on its income statement. Marathon, the second-largest debtor, is the primary owner of the $851 million in convertible note liabilities. Marathon avoids bankruptcy by allowing the debtors to convert the convertible notes into equity.<br /><br />The bulk of Bitcoin miners is going through a restructuring process to pay off debt, including Greenidge, the third biggest debtor. Publicly listed bitcoin mining companies have a high debt-to-equity ratio, which points to a significant risk for the industry.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoins-hashrate-now-at-an-all-time-high/">Hashrate</a> Index indicates that most industries consider a debt-to-equity ratio of two or above to be risky. The graph below shows how some of the more well-known Bitcoin miners currently have exceptionally high debt-to-equity ratios. Given that more than 50% of the 25 publicly traded bitcoin miners display extraordinarily high debt-to-equity ratios, the mining industry may suffer possible restructurings as well as bankruptcy procedures unless the bulls mount a comeback.<br /><br />While some companies may stop or reduce operations to save money, this will allow sustainable miners to extend their footprint by acquiring the properties and machinery of competing businesses.<br /><br />The banking institution <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/nydig-survey-46-million-americans-hold-bitcoin/">NYDIG</a>, which focuses on Bitcoin, and Greenidge reached an agreement to restructure $74 million in debt on December 20.<br /><br />As per the conditions of the NYDIG deal, a mining capacity of 2.8 exahashes per second (EH/s) or more would be obtained. The mining company would receive a debt reduction worth between $57M and $68M in exchange.</p>

<p>The Japanese government approved a measure in June <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-03/japan-passes-stablecoin-bill-that-enshrines-investor-protection#xj4y7vzkg">recognizing</a> stablecoins as digital currency. As a result, Japan established one of the first significant legal frameworks for stablecoins.<br /><br />However, they had to be backed by the fiat yen of Japan or some other kind of legal money that permitted holders to use them at face value. However, the bill did not mention foreign <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/stablecoins-were-knocked-off-their-pegs-due-to-crypto-volatility/">stablecoins</a> backed by assets like Tether.<br /><br />According to a recent development, the Japanese Financial Services Agency [FSA] may decide to lift the restriction on the circulation of stablecoins like Tether and USDC per a recent <a href="https://coinpost.jp/?p=419032">CoinsPaid</a> article in English.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2023, the Financial Services Agency will lift the ban on domestic distribution of stablecoins issued overseas.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The remittance cap will be set at 1 million yen ($7500) for each transaction, according to the newspaper.<br /><br />Issuers will need to gather collateral assets for domestically created stablecoins. Banks, trust corporations, and companies offering fund transfers are the only issuers allowed.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/japanese-fsa-cautious-about-crypto-based-etfs-cites-volatility/">FSA</a> will also require stablecoin distributors to record transaction information like user identities as a money laundering prevention tool. According to CoinsPaid, the agency will begin soliciting feedback on the proposed stablecoin criteria from January 26.<br /><br />Japan&#8217;s position on cryptocurrencies has significantly softened over time. The <em>&#8220;New Capitalism&#8221;</em> philosophy of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida aims to strengthen Japan&#8217;s economy. The nation just made public its entry into the NFT, Metaverse space. In parallel, the government is attempting to relax cryptocurrency tax laws.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/december-is-a-historic-month-here-is-what-bitcoin-btc-and-ethereum-eth-traders-could-expect/">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, is down 1.25% in the last 24 hours at $1207. According to Glassnode alerts, Ethereum’s 7-day exchange outflow volume has reached a two-year low of $10,361,174. Likewise, the number of exchange withdrawals in a 7-day timeframe is now at a 21-month low of 2,281. The number of addresses receiving from exchanges is down to a 23-month low of 1,507.

<p>Despite the pullback from the highs, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/eth-price-analysis-buyers-revive-uptrend-beyond-mid-1600-paxos-vp-says-ethereum-is-about-to-rip/">Ethereum buyers</a> continue to accumulate for the next push higher, particularly over the horizontal line at $1,200 an upward breakout might be verified on the daily chart if ETH finishes the year above here. The price trades above the ascending trendline (pattern) at $1,100. For the upside to gain traction, a sustained rise above $1,300 is required.<br /><br />A cluster of important support at $1,200 and $1,000, on the other hand, should buffer the fall. For the pair, the region is a vital confluence zone of support activity. A break below will reveal the next support level at $1,000, which will be tested. The low of $879.80 set in June will be the next target for sellers.</p>

<p>Ethereum short-term support has been set at $1,200. In the 4-hour range, the crypto&#8217;s immediate upside is restrained by the MA 200 at $1,235. The seller congestion at $1,100 is still in place, and the bearish case toward $879 will most likely be delayed. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is still at an oversold level. <br /><br />This means that the market has greater room for growth. Overall, the negative price pattern predicts that the ETH/USD pair would decline toward $1,000. The pair is only bullish when trading over $1,300; major resistance levels are identified around $1,500 and $1,700. Sellers may test the $879 low if the pair goes below $1,000.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC continues to struggle amid worries about a global recession</li>
<li>The local top for BTC/USD was set at $17,060 during the week</li>
<li>The period of large-scale liquidations is over</li>
</ul>
<p>Signs are rising that global cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin are set for a dramatic rebound after prices steadied post-panic triggered by<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-token-trading-volume-jumps-1060-as-price-rises-on-ftx-revival-proposal-supported-by-sam-bankman-fried/"> FTX collapse</a> as the FUD begins to wane. Although BTC price remains subdued at the moment, Santa Claus sentiment might begin to brighten investors&#8217; hope for a positive end-of-year rally. BTC continues to struggle amid worries about a global recession. The local top for BTC/USD was set at $17,060 during the week, but might end lower, in the $16,800 range. In the meantime, at the time of writing this analysis, BTC/USD is trading around $16,830. The total capitalization of the crypto market for the week decreased by almost 1.0% and amounted to $0.810 trillion. Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, believes that the first cryptocurrency has reached the low of the current cycle, as almost all <em>“irresponsible organizations”</em> have run out of coins to sell. At the same time, the expert believes that the period of large-scale liquidations is over.<br /><br /><strong>Key Levels</strong><br />Resistance Levels: $20,000, $18,500, $17,500<br />Support Levels: $15,000, $13,000, $10,000</p>
<h4>BTC/USD Daily Chart: Bearish</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63672 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-Daily-Dec-25-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">BTC/USD Daily Chart</span></h6>
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-price-raises-a-warning-flag-due-to-this-rare-occurrence-details/">Bitcoin price</a> is creating a continuous straight-line formation following its plunge to the $15,460 low on November 21. The BTC/USD pair dropped below $16,000, breaking through the $15,500 support that had kept the bears in check, putting the RSI near the oversold territory. The latter raises the possibility of continued consolidation or correction.<br /><br />In the event of a collapse, the bears will most likely test the $15,000 level before reaching the $13,000 support around $10,000, from which the bulls may attempt another uptrend. On the other hand, the BTC price may seek new lows somewhere between $13,000 and $11,000. The bearish aligned MA 50 and 200 maintain pessimism.</p>
<h4>BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart: Ranging</h4>
<h6><img loading="lazy" width="1436" height="688" class="alignnone wp-image-63674 size-full" src="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25.png" alt="" srcset="https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25.png 1436w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-300x144.png 300w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-1024x491.png 1024w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-768x368.png 768w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-750x359.png 750w, https://kryptomoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BTCUSD-4-Hour-Dec-25-1140x546.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1436px) 100vw, 1436px" /><span style="color: #999999">BTC/USD 4-Hour Chart</span></h6>
<p>Bitcoin has remained trapped within the four-hour moving average (MA 50 and 200) after reactivating an uptrend from the $15,460 bottom. The most recent move is restricted by the moving averages. More advances could push the price to the $18,000 territory, flirting with the $19,000 to $20,000. Otherwise, if the market falls below the $15,000 level, the $10,000 support level may come into play.<br /><br />The MA 50, which is presently at $16,800, may limit the bulls before reaching $18,000. In summary, the BTC price is considered to be in consolidation, albeit a minor rebound or correction may occur to bring the RSI above its midline. Corrective drops, on the other hand, could be viewed as the bulls&#8217; entry point into the market, since BTC may consolidate further.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-loses-almost-15b-from-its-market-cap/">SHIB</a> lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama has taken to Twitter to share expectations for the Shibarium layer 2 solutions. According to him, Shibarium is unlikely to be released during the holidays or <em>‘’the resulting New Year&#8217;s party time.’’</em><br /><br />He tweeted <em>&#8220;Happy Holidays&#8221;</em> to more than half the globe. Wen Shibarium? Please know it will come very soon, but not during a crucial time for people to spend with their family (or the resulting New Year&#8217;s party time). Enjoy these next days, next year is an important one for humanity.<br /><br />Earlier, Kusama disclosed in a Telegram update that the much-anticipated Shibarium Beta testing phase will soon launch. According to a screenshot of the Telegram message, Kusama first said, “seriously, it’s coming,” while adding that <em>“Beta is near for Shibarium’’.</em><br /><br />Meanwhile, the team has not chosen an exact date for Shibarium Beta testing. With what the SHIB lead developer stated on Twitter, it might be safe to assume that Shibarium Beta testing may go live by Q1 next year.<br /><br />Shibarium builder, Unification, had disclosed earlier this year that the beta testing for the L2 network would launch by the end of Q3. However, things did not go as planned.<br /><br />In recent weeks, several <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/shib-balance-held-by-top-100-holders-grows-even-bigger-with-fresh-53-billion-token-addition/">SHIB holders</a> believed that Shibarium’s launch was imminent after some team members shared a special countdown. The SHIB lead developer had also sparked expectations when he said his focus was on Shibarium. <br /><br />Unfortunately, many were disappointed to find out that the countdown was for the SHIB website upgrade. SHIB Trophias, a Shiba Inu developer revealed that the website upgrade was necessary for the launch of Shibarium.</p>
<h2>2.4 Trillion SHIB Moved In Between Whales’ Wallet</h2>
<p>According to WhaleAlert, 2,473,966,699,162 SHIB worth $20,533,923 was transferred between unknown wallets. At the time of publication, SHIB was marginally up at $0.0000831.<br /><br />In other news, Hero Wallet, a Web3 decentralized wallet, recently added a Guardarian payment system, allowing its customers to immediately buy and sell Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies using a bank card. <br /><br />Through this collaboration, Guardarian will provide Hero Wallet customers with more than five payment methods for processing crypto payments effortlessly and at no additional cost. Shiba Inu has recently been adopted as a default token on the Hero Wallet platform. Rather than hunting for the contract address, wallet users will now have easy access to SHIB from the add token interface.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s popularity is growing at an alarming rate all over the world. Shiba Inu has become the most popular coin of 2022 on the top Indian exchange, WazirX. Binance also ranked Shiba Inu as the third most-watched crypto asset of 2022, next to Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cryptocurrency-market-recoups-1-trillion-mark-as-btc-surpasses-24000/"> cryptocurrency market</a> has had a rough year. Core Scientific, one of the top publicly traded crypto mining businesses in the United States that predominantly mints bitcoin, filed for bankruptcy on December 21, citing dropping crypto prices and increased energy expenses.<br /><br />And the fall of FTX, a now-bankrupt crypto trading platform once valued at $32 billion, has shaken investors&#8217; trust as the company&#8217;s demise spreads throughout the crypto industry. <br /><br />According to CNBC&#8217;s estimations, the value of seven prominent cryptocurrencies moved the most in 2022 as of December 22. Terra is down -100%, Solana, -93%, AMP is also down -93%, Cardano is down -80%, Ethereum -67%, Bitcoin -63%, and Dogecoin, -55%.<br /><br />The <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/black-sunday-bitcoin-and-altcoins-in-red-except-nano-and-solana-three-things-the-markets-are-telling/">year 2022</a> marked the beginning of a new &#8220;crypto winter,&#8221; with high-profile enterprises falling across the board and digital currency prices plummeting significantly. The events of the year caught many investors off guard, making projecting bitcoin&#8217;s price even more difficult.<br /><br /><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/btc-price-analysis-btc-usd-is-at-bottom-of-current-cycle-as-large-scale-bitcoin-liquidations-end/">Bitcoin</a> has fallen over 75% from reaching an all-time high of nearly $69,000 in November 2021, and the total value of the cryptocurrency industry has been reduced by more than $2 trillion. Bitcoin was trading at a little under $17,000 at press time.<br /><br />Cryptocurrency is regarded as a highly volatile asset with unpredictable price fluctuations and falls. As a result, financial experts often advise against investing more in cryptocurrency than you are willing to lose.</p>
<h2>Predictions for 2023</h2>
<p>India’s top crypto exchange, WazirX predicts three trends for 2023.<br /><strong>Increased awareness:</strong> While multiple surveys of retail investors show that they are still enthusiastic about cryptocurrency, lack of information remains a major hurdle to its widespread adoption. Users will continue to regard Crypto as only a store of value due to their lack of understanding of its potential. It is critical to creating knowledge about the benefits and drawbacks of cryptocurrency, as well as its volatility and various applications. In this case, firms that focus on educating people about blockchain will benefit in the long run.<br /><br /><strong>Public-Private partnerships:</strong> Web3 firms are well-positioned to handle user onboarding to Crypto due to their prior experience. There may be a few more similar collaborations in the next year.<br /><br /><strong>Utility of Crypto:</strong> We will see the adoption of retail Crypto payments in enterprises, as well as the necessity for a sophisticated interface where these transactions may take place quickly and easily.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to a Dec. 23 report by <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1555219">local news outlet Tass</a>, Russia&#8217;s cryptocurrency mining bill, which would legalize crypto mining and the sale of mined crypto, could be adopted by January.<br /><br />On November 17, 2022, the <a href="https://static.consultant.ru/obj/file/doc/pr_fz_181122_585.pdf">bill</a> was introduced in the State Duma, Russia&#8217;s lower house of parliament. At the time, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma&#8217;s Financial Market Committee, <a href="https://www.pnp.ru/economics/aksakov-anonsiroval-vnesenie-v-gosdumu-zakonoproekta-o-mayninge-v-blizhayshee-vremya.html">predicted</a> that the law would pass all three parliamentary readings in December.<br /><br />As per Aksakov, the bill&#8217;s passage was postponed because of concerns that it may open the door for a capital flight out of Russia.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…according to the critics of the bill, it could create channels for capital flight from our country. Ostensibly, it will be the activity of buying cryptocurrency, but in fact, the main objective will be capital flight from our country.“</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aksakov acknowledged that the risks of capital flight are real, and he will work with the opponents to change the legislation.<br /><br />If the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-mining-operations-stopped-by-sbi-holdings-in-russia/">crypto mining bill</a> in Russia is approved, Russians would be able to mine cryptocurrencies lawfully. The measure would also enable Russian miners to sell the cryptocurrency they have mined on international marketplaces.<br /><br />The proposal would also permit Russian miners to trade cryptocurrency they have produced within the nation under an <em>&#8220;experimental legal regime,&#8221;</em> according to a Nov. 18 article from<a href="https://interfax.com/newsroom/top-stories/85091/"> Interfax</a>. Cryptocurrency payments were made illegal in the country in July.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that the Russian Federation&#8217;s Central Bank stated earlier this month that it theoretically supports the law. <a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/875737">Interfax reported</a> on December 7 that the monetary authority is opposed to enabling Russians to sell cryptocurrency they have produced domestically. The central bank believes that miners should only be allowed to sell their crypto to non-residents and on international markets.<br /><br />With the postponement, Aksakov is optimistic that the mining measure may be updated to adequately address critics&#8217; concerns and will be ready for passage in January 2023. However, he warned that if an agreement with the critics is not reached by next month, the bill&#8217;s passage could be delayed much further.<br /><br />Russia developed a <a href="https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/5572328">draft framework</a> in September to allow the use of cryptocurrencies in cross-border transactions. According to <a href="https://tass.com/economy/1552829">TASS</a>, the Russian central bank wants to test the use of cryptocurrency to settle foreign transactions within the regulatory sandbox environment on December 19.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/here-is-what-historical-data-presents-for-bitcoin-in-december-ftx-japan-to-allow-withdrawal-of-funds/">Bitcoin</a>&#8216;s circulating supply off exchanges is currently at 18.19 million coins, the highest quantity ever seen. The present data reflects an increasing trend of BTC withdrawals from centralized exchanges, which increased dramatically following the FTX crash last month. In comparison, just 1.16 million BTC tokens are now available on exchanges.<br /><br />Santiment, a cryptocurrency analytics firm, has brought the development to the public&#8217;s attention. According to Santiment statistics, BTC supply on exchanges has consistently reached all-time highs in recent months, with the current supply of 18.19 million tokens being the most recent ATH.<br /><br />Contrarily, BTC supply has been steadily falling on exchanges, and the most recent value of 1.16 million is the lowest since November 2018. This underlines a significant outflow of BTC from exchanges, which accelerated after the FTX meltdown as investors&#8217; faith in centralized exchanges decreased. Self-custody is getting more popular among investors.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1605755263083896832">Santiment</a> disclosed on Thursday through a tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Illustrated is the 10-year long-term view of Bitcoin’s funds moving on and off exchanges. The amount of coins in self custody continues creating a new AllTimeHigh, now at 18.2M $BTC. Meanwhile, coins on exchanges is at just 1.2M $BTC, a 4-year low&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Remain Positive</h2>
<p>The mass removal of BTC from exchanges is also a bullish sign, as investors frequently deposit assets and maintain them on exchanges when they intend to sell them. Taking one&#8217;s assets off exchanges, on the other hand, frequently shows a desire to keep them for an extended time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the CryptoQuant <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line">BTC Exchange Reserve</a> indicator is encouraging, as a decline in exchange reserves signals a reduction in selling pressure. The metric supports the Santiment data even more.<br /><br />Additionally, despite the current drop, the majority of BTC on-chain indicators show optimistic trends. The <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/network-indicator/binary-cdd?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=column">Binary CDD</a> shows little movement among long-term holders. In addition, investors are selling at a loss, which could point to a market bottom in a bear market, according to the <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/market-indicator/adjusted-sopr-asopr?window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=log&amp;chartStyle=line">Adjusted SOPR</a> (aSOPR) metric.<br /><br />The CEO of the trading business Factor LLC, Peter Brandt, a seasoned trader, recently sent a cryptic message that may have foretold a BTC collapse below $10K before a rally to $120K. As of the time of publication, BTC is trading at $16,836, up 1% over the previous day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-labs-launches-8-new-blockchain-projects-via-its-incubator-program/">Binance Labs</a>, the investing arm of crypto exchange Binance, purportedly achieved a historical return on investment of up to 2,100%.<br /><br />According to the most recent <a href="https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/blog/community/%E7%9B%B4%E9%9D%A2fud%EF%BD%9C%E5%AF%B9%E4%BA%8E%E8%BF%91%E6%9C%9F%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E5%8F%8A%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E8%B4%A8%E7%96%91%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9E%E5%BA%94-6174048639837904159">blog post</a>, the total assets under administration have now reached $7.5 billion. The site also informed consumers that its <em>“financial status is very healthy”</em> and that it has enough capital reserves to cover day-to-day operations and weather any difficult cycles.<br /><br />Binance claims that all assets held by users on its platform are supported 1:1. Furthermore, clients can withdraw money at any time, dispelling rumors about insufficient reserves for users to do so.<br /><br />Also, it declared that it will not pilfer such assets for any transactions or investments, a dig at FTX, whose founders are accused of misappropriating user cash. The exchange further stated that it has no obligations and is not on the creditors&#8217; list of any recently bankrupt company.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A few negative cases do not represent the entire industry. Many people started to doubt and attack the encryption industry as a whole through a few negative cases, which shows that the development of the entire industry still has a long way to go.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the demise of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-token-trading-volume-jumps-1060-as-price-rises-on-ftx-revival-proposal-supported-by-sam-bankman-fried/">FTX</a>, the crypto industry&#8217;s latest obsession has been completing proof-of-reserve attestations. As a result, Binance launched a Merkle tree-based Bitcoin and Ethereum system. Other platforms, including OKX, Crypto.com, and ByBit, have followed a similar approach in response to increased investor demand for transparency from centralized exchanges around the world.<br /><br />As of November 22nd, global audit company Mazars certified that Binance had enough bitcoins and wrapped bitcoins (WBTC) to cover all user balances on the site. Several industry experts, however, pointed out that the report focused more on telling the public about the backed assets than the indicated reserves.</p>
