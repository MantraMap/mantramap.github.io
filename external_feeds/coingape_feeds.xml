The CPI reading could very well play a role in determining the magnitude of the next <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/interest-rate/">interest rate</a> increase that the Federal Reserve decides to implement. It is anticipated that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">Consumer Price Index (CPI)</a> reading, which will be released on January 12, would lend credence to the argument that inflation is fading, hence providing a potential opening for riskier assets, like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<h2>CPI Data Of 6.5% Expected</h2>
<p>According to prominent industry experts, the CPI for December is anticipated to show annual inflation at 6.5-6.6%, which would be a decrease from November&#8217;s reading of 7.1%. This data is seen as a significant marker for investors attempting to figure out the next market movements. In a telecasted interview on CNBC, Gilman Hill&#8217;s Jenny Harrington predicts a CPI of 6.6% which she thinks to &#8220;make sense&#8221; considering the broader market overview.</p>
<p>Harrington was further quoted as saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think that kind of reading triggers a spark that drives the market way up from here.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition, the CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management pointed out that the earnings are likely not going to be particularly good, but the most important takeaway was that the 6.6% reading would set &#8220;a floor&#8221; in the market. This would give market participants the impression that the marketplace is most likely not going to further lows or highs, but that it would be just &#8220;okay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC) price</a> made a fleeting but encouraging return to $17,500 overnight on January 11 as the newly found strength from the beginning of 2023 persisted. However, if Bitcoin&#8217;s change in price can be extracted from the most recent six CPI readings, it provides us with a clearer picture of how the market has reacted to the global macroeconomic data.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135009" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/12024759/Screenshot-2023-01-12-024735.png" alt="" width="807" height="276" />The price of Bitcoin has, more often than not, strongly reacted to the CPI readings; with the strongest reaction being a drop of over 10% reported on the CPI announcement made in September. Despite this, throughout the course of the past three months, BTC has displayed a generally bullish momentum on latest CPI readings.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Reaction</h2>
<p>The release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) on January 12 could make matters more difficult, particularly in the event that inflation exceeds expectations in a positive direction. Since the beginning of 2023, BTC&#8217;s price has been benefiting from a weaker U.S. Dollar. This is due to the fact that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)</a> is leaning toward a smaller interest rate hike of 25 basis points at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on February 1.</p>
<p>However, the flagship <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> is presently trading at a major resistance level, and the next CPI data is expected to play a significant part in determining the direction of the coin&#8217;s price in near future. According to crypto trading expert Credible Crypto, Bitcoin has reached a break-even point and has warned investors and traders alike to exercise caution in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like we made it! Lots of relief on alts across the board but now is really the moment of truth with BTC at local supply.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Complementing this, another popular Bitcoin evangelist &amp; digital asset trader Johnny, who goes by the alias CryptoGodJohn on Twitter, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoGodJohn/status/1612957250951200769" rel="nofollow">cautioned</a> on witnessing massive “bull tweeting as BTC sits under higher time frame resistance at $17,600&#8243;. He further argued that the CPI data could whipsaw the prices back to &#8220;where they were last week,”.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135010" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/12031148/Screenshot-2023-01-12-031132.png" alt="cpi bitcoin price" width="895" height="671" /></p>
<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $17,555. This represents an increase of 0.43% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 4.31% during the week, as per CoinGape’s crypto market tracker.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/29163146/solana1.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="sol" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On January 9th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/">Solana coin price</a> gave a high momentum breakout from the monthly resistance of $15. This bullish breakout offers a higher footing for buyers to bolster further price recovery. Moreover, the low volume retest to the breached resistance gives an additional confirmation for price sustainability above the $15 support. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower price rejection candles at the $15 level indicate the buyers are defending the newly obtained support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the reclaimed 20-and-50-day EMAs provide an extra edge in the buyer&#8217;s favor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $59.1 Million, indicating a 33% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/h/H3Dr9U9y.png" alt="Solana coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Solana coin price walking a sideway trend for the last two months shows the formation of an <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/how-far-may-solana-coin-price-rise-after-escaping-ongoing-consolidation/">inverted descending triangle pattern.</a> During this pattern formation, the price action faces stiff resistance from a horizontal level and a downsloping support trendline which leads the lower swing laws. Moreover, the prices expanding within this pattern reflect a sense of high volatility in the crypto market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern may not be commonly observed in technical charts, but it can provide a significant bullish rally upon the Breakout of its neckline resistance. Amid the recent recovery in the market and support from the downsloping trendline, the SOL price has recently bounced back from the $8 mark.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read- <a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">Explained: What is Physical NFT? and How to Sell Physical Items as NFT</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish reversal doubled the coin’s market value within a fortnight and provided an upward breakout from the $15 neckline. The long bullish candle pierced the mentioned barrier with sufficient volume, indicating the buyer&#8217;s commitment to potential recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in the last two days, the SOL price showed a minor pullback to retest the breached resistance as potential support. Moreover, this retest phase back by decreasing volume indicates less interest of traders in selling activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, if the coin buyers manage to sustain about the $15 flip support, the resulting rally may push the prices to $18.8, followed by the $22 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily candle closing below the $15 level will weaken the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> high above in bullish territory indicates the market participants feel positive about price recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger band:</strong> the Solana coin price hitting the upper band of the indicator suggests a rapid bullish rally in the relatively short period. Thus, the coin price is likely to consolidate above $15 support until the prices stabilize enough to resume its rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana coin price intraday levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pot price: $16.02</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $18.8 and $22</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $15 and $12.8</span></li>

This failed attempt from coin buyers to break the dynamic resistance indicates a higher possibility of bearish reversal. This potential reversal may undermine the recent recovery rally and take the CRV coin to new lows.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential bearish reversal from the channel pattern resistance may tumble the CRV price by 12-22%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 100-day EMA aligned with the downsloping trendline gives additional resistance against sellers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the CRV token is $629.5 Million, indicating a 1000.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/r/rmIbK42W.png" alt="Curve Dao Coin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A f<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/parallel-channel-pattern/">alling parallel channel pattern</a> is currently governing the ongoing downfall of the Curve Dao coin. Under the influence of this pattern, the coin price has been wobbling between two falling trendlines for the past six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, with the new year recovery in the crypto market, the CRV price had recently bounced back from the $0.5 mark. The U-shaped recovery indicated a sustained rally of 30% and pushed the prices to the resistance trendline of the channel pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the CRV price traded at $0.654 and showed higher price rejection candles over the last three days. These rejection candles indicate the sellers continue to defend this resistance and could trigger a new bear cycle within the pattern.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read:  <a href="https://coingape.com/defi-lending-platforms/">Top 10 DeFi Lending Platforms In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A daily candle closing below the immediate support of $0.635 will offer additional confirmation for a downfall and plunge the prices below the $0.5 support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in theory, the falling channel is a bullish continuation pattern that provides a significant bull run upon the breakout of its resistance trendline. Thus, the trades looking for long entry opportunities should wait for a bullish breakout from the overhead trendline. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> a sharp rise in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI slope</a> reflect the positive sentiment growing among participant. If this divergence indicator sustained its bullish stance, the CRV might soon break the overhead trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the recently reclaimed 20-and-50-day EMA now stands as significant support trying to bolster price recovery. However, a breakout from these EMAs will backfire with additional confirmation for sellers.</span></p>

GALA&#8217;s token price increased by almost 70% on Monday, reaching its highest level since September 13 at approximately $0.05. However, because of the new development, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> dropped by more than 12% in the past 24  hours.</p>
<h2>Why Gala Price Is Falling?</h2>
<p>The tweet, which was published on January 9, included a screengrab from Gala Games&#8217; Discord channel. It stated that the firm was working on two films with the actors Dwayne Johnson and Mark Wahlberg, referring to them as &#8220;huge forces in the entertainment industry.&#8221; The tweet went on to explain that as part of the agreement, users who were already a member of the Gala network would be able to scan a QR code in order to win digital prizes from Netflix and purchase movie tickets for The Rock&#8217;s films.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the now-deleted tweet stated, &#8220;You’ve seen their work on screen, but I think their presence might be even more powerful off the screen and we are so happy to get the chance to work with them,&#8221;.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-134999" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11230140/MEMH2RRGUBFIRAYLXZXHYQJXWY.jpeg" alt="" width="764" height="942" /></p>
<h2>Crypto Community Questions</h2>
<p>The lack of response from the crypto startup has infuriated crypto aficionados on Twitter, where a number of accounts have called into question the authenticity of the initial announcement. One community member even went ahead to publicly state that he was ousted from the Discord server for asking questions regarding the tweet. He was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why would GALA boot me from the server for simply asking a legitimate question about a public article? I was asking if the team had any update?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Few even went ahead to advocate shorting the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a>, by taking investment positions that gamble on the value of the cryptocurrency going down. On the other hand, a few loyalists in the Gala Games Discord have levelled accusations against those who have asked for proof, saying that they are spreading <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fud/">FUD</a>, a crypto jargon used to refer &#8220;Fear, Uncertainty &amp; Doubt&#8221;; while also accusing competing businesses of employing Twitter bots to run a smear campaign on Gala Games.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-135000" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11233853/Screenshot-2023-01-11-231517.png" alt="" width="1182" height="561" /></p>
<p>All these have badly affected the token price and as things stand, the GALA price is currently being traded at $0.037. This represents a decrease of 12% on the day, in contrast to the massive gain of 105% during the last week, as per <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> tracker CoinMarketCap.</p>

However, during this consolidation, the price rebounded from the $0.76 support multiple times, validating this level as a high accumulation zone. Therefore, using the aforementioned level as a base support, the MATIC price shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a>. This pattern formation accentuates the price sustainability above a specific horizontal level and replenishes the bullish momentum for potential price recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.87 breakout could drive the MATIC price 12.5% higher to reach $0.953</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 200-day EMA wavering near the $0.888 mark will try to stall the potential price rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the MATIC is $1.35 Billion, indicating a 36.2% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/b/bbP20Qz2.png" alt="MATIC Price" width="1946" height="1104" /></strong>Source- &#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amidst the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, the MATIC price rebounded from the $0.76 support and surged 14.6% higher. By press time, this altcoin traded at the $0.85 mark and showed a power struggle to break the $0.87 barrier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a possible post-rally pullback may tumble the prices by 4% down to $0.816 local support. However, under the influence of a bullish reversal pattern, the  MATIC price should witness a sustained rally to the $0.95 mark.</span></p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-7-crypto-marketing-firms-of-the-year/">Top Crypto Marketing Firms / Agencies 2023; Here’s Best Picks</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.95 is the neckline of the mentioned pattern, and its breakout will intensify the bullish momentum. As per the technical setup, the post-breakout rally travels the same distance as the length between the base support and neckline, shot from the breakout points.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a breakout from the $0.95 barrier will drive the MATIC price 35% higher to reach the $1.15 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown from the $0.816 support invalidates the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Bollinger Band:</strong> the MATIC price hitting the upper band of this indicator suggests aggressive buying activity in a relatively short period. Thus, the indicator encourages a possible pullback before the price resume the bullish pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> The increasing gap between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and a signal line in bullish alignment indicates improving market sentiments.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">MATIC Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.84</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>

This measurement helps to assess the transaction speed of a network. TPS also measures transaction speed for other traditional networks.</p>
<h2>Transactions Per Seconds In Crypto</h2>
<p>TPS in crypto is the speed at which a blockchain network processes transactions. The higher the number, the more advanced a network is. A higher TPS is an indicator of the network’s speed and scalability. Usually, decentralized networks have a lower TPS rate than traditional centralized networks.</p>
<p>The famous online payments system PayPal&#8217;s TPS is around 193 TPS and VISA can process up to 1,700 TPS.</p>
<h2>Which network has the highest TPS?</h2>
<p>As of now, among all the blockchain networks, Solana network has the maximum TPS done in the world of crypto &#8211; 50,000 TPS. <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a>, the original cryptocurrency, only has the TPS rate of 7. One of the main criticisms of the OG cryptocurrency Bitcoin is that it is not scalable and its TPS is low. Bitcoin’s low TPS is also cited as why it can never achieve mass adoption.</p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum has a TPS rate of 27, while <a href="https://coingape.com/what-what-is-polygon-blockchain-how-does-matic-works-and-why-it-matters-explained/">Polygon</a> can process 7,000 TPS. However, Ethereum’s TPS is will scale significantly to around 100,000 after it completes its much-anticipated sharding upgrade. Known for enabling easy cross-border transactions, Ripple network handles over 1,500 TPS.</p>
<h2>What constitutes a network’s TPS?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block Time</strong> &#8211; Average time needed to mine a new block is Block Time of a network. Different blockchain networks have different block times. The leading cryptocurrency bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes. Compared to bitcoin, Ethereum has significantly less average block time of 10-20 seconds.</li>
<li><strong>Transaction Size</strong> &#8211; Data transmitted with each transaction varies on which blockchain network the transaction is done. A transaction in bitcoin can be as small as under 300 bytes or as large as 500 bytes. The higher the transaction size is, the more time it will take to execute a transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Block Size</strong> &#8211; Block size is the amount of data about transactions a block carries in a blockchain. Higher the block size means more people are needed to run a full node. It&#8217; block size is limited to mere 1 MB, but this small amount of data is enough to store over 2000 transactions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Transaction Per Second is calculated?</h2>
<p>To calculate the TPS on a blockchain, your require information of its block size, transaction size, and block time.</p>
<p><strong>TPS = (block size/ transaction size) / block time.</strong></p>
<h2>Is TPS alone enough to scale a network?</h2>
<p>Blockchain networks having a higher TPS rate is not enough to make a network successful or even compete with the likes of Ethereum and Bitcoin. To truly make a network stand out, it needs to focus on security and other important aspects and not just its TPS rate. Bitcoin uses<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/hash-rate/"> hash rate </a>to measure the security and health of its network.</p>
<p>Although, the importance of a network’s TPS can not be denied as it measures the blockchain’s capacity to process transactions. Furthermore, it is also an indicator of a network&#8217;s potential to scale to accommodate new and better use cases in future. If a blockchain network has a high TPS rate, it usually lacks in other aspects &#8211; decentralization and security. For a blockchain network to achieve all three &#8211; high TPS, security, decentralization- is not easy and that is why blockchain networks are in competition to beat each other in all three aspects and not just TPS.</p>

Despite this, the exchange is &#8220;working to rebuild transaction history&#8221;. This comes excluding the additional $425 million worth of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> that is being held by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas.</p>
<h2>FTX Recovers $5 Billion</h2>
<p>As previously reported by CoinGape, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX&#8217;s</a> total liabilities amount to $8.8 billion. The exchange was said to have limited cash and liquid digital assets at the time, which equated to an estimated $8 billion gap in its balance sheet, according to FTX&#8217;s newly appointed CEO <a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-resigns-john-ray-iii-joins-as-new-ftx-ceo/">John J. Ray III.</a></p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/sam-bankman-fried-hiding-ftx-client-names/">Why Is Sam Bankman-Fried Hiding FTX’s Client Names?</a></em></p>
<p>At the outset of Wednesday&#8217;s hearing, FTX&#8217;s attorney Andy Dietderich informed a U.S. bankruptcy judge in Delaware that:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have located over $5 billion of cash, liquid cryptocurrency and liquid investment securities measured at petition date value. Our holdings are so large relative to the total supply that our positions cannot be sold without substantially affecting the market for the token.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although the company&#8217;s finances have been labeled as inaccurate, Dietderich states that the organization has plans to liquidate non-strategic holdings that have a valuation of $4.6 billion. On the other hand, while speaking about seized assets by the Bahamian authorities, the FTX attorney estimated the assets to be worth as little as $170 million; which the government body touted to be as high as $3.5 billion. According to Dietderich, the majority of the confiscated assets are made up of FTX&#8217;s proprietary and illiquid FTT <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-tokens/">crypto token</a>, the value of which is subject to extreme price swings.</p>
<h2>The FTX Fiasco</h2>
<p>In November, the company submitted its petition for bankruptcy, and in December, prosecutors in the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> accused Bankman-Fried of masterminding an &#8220;epic&#8221; fraud that may have cost investors, consumers, and lenders billions of dollars. Currently, the insolvent firm&#8217;s advisers and attorneys are attempting to recoup funds in order to pay back creditors.</p>
<p>The discredited FTX founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> recently entered a not-guilty plea to all charges stemming from the exchange&#8217;s failures. An &#8220;FTX Task Force&#8221; has been established by the Southern District of New York Office to track &amp; recover lost customer assets and also to manage legal actions connected to the collapse of the exchange.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/29114352/XRP-token-price.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="XRP price News" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent bullish reversal from the $0.33 support revealed the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> in the daily time frame chart. Over the past six days, the XRP price has soared 10.1% and is currently trading at the $0.365 mark. Under the influence of this bullish pattern, the coin price is likely to break the $0.374 resistance, bolstering further growth potential for XRP.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price potential breakout from $0.374 will prolong the recovery rally to $0.42</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The recent price jump reclaimed the 20-day EMA, providing the coin holders additional support.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.16 Billion, indicating a 14.2% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/v/VyMM8rv3.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While a majority of major altcoins were rising higher with the new year recovery in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-ripple-sec-opposing-to-seal-in-latest-motion/">XRP price</a> was struggling to break the local resistance of $0.356. Over the past ten days, this altcoin was wobbling between $0.356 and $0.35, creating a narrow range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the daily candles resonating between the aforementioned range showed several long-wick rejections on either side, accentuating the ongoing uncertainty in the crypto market. However, today, the XRP coin witnessed a significant inflow and rose 4% on the intraday level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The long bullish candle with sufficient volume breaks the $0.359 resistance, releasing this altcoin from stagnant market sentiment. If the daily candle closes above the breached resistance, the buyers get a higher footing to continue to rally in the price chart.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-telegram-crypto-channels-list/">CRYPTO TELEGRAM CHANNELS LIST 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained buying, the XRP price may break the $0.374 neckline resistance of the double bottom pattern. In theory, this pattern in this technical setup is one of the most frequently observed patterns which encourages directional bull run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a bullish breakout from $ 0.374 will intensify the buying pressure in the market and prolong the bullish growth to $0.396 or $0.42, registering a 10-15% hike.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, a less likely yet possible reversal from the $0.374 barrier will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the downsloping 50-day EMA is currently working in the seller&#8217;s favor trying to stall rising prices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strength Index:</strong> conversely to the sideways <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">XRP price</a>, the daily RSI slope is sharply rising, reflecting the growth in bullish momentum. Thus, this bullish divergence increases the possibility of a $0.374 breakout.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP intraday price levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.39</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.374 and $0.396</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.355 and 0.</span></li>

<h2>Client Names Under Wraps</h2>
<p>In response to objections raised by leading media organizations, FTX has requested that its customer names be kept confidential for a period of at least six months. The now-defunct exchange has indicated that it may seek additional extensions, although this will be subject to assessment by the court.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/explained-what-is-physical-nft-and-how-to-sell-physical-items-as-nft/">What is Physical NFT? and How to Sell Physical Items as NFT</a></em></p>
<p>The business has contended that standard bankruptcy regulations, which call for disclosing information about creditors — among them, as many as 9.5 million clients — could expose them to fraud, breach their privacy, and give competitors access, eroding FTX&#8217;s worth as it looks for potential buyers.</p>
<h2>FTX Seeks Auctioning Assets</h2>
<p>In addition, according to court records made by FTX, the four firms that FTX seeks to sell are relatively independent of the larger FTX conglomerate. Furthermore, each entity has its own distinct customer accounts as well as management teams, devoid of any connections or links to the Bankman-Fried led core team.</p>
<p>The Bahamas-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/centralized-cryptocurrency-exchanges-cex/">centralized exchange</a> has received scores of unsolicited proposals, but it has not committed to selling any of the companies. Since FTX has plans for scheduling auctions for the months of February and March, they anticipate a rise in bids during that time. However, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/united-states/">United States</a> Trustee, which is a bankruptcy watchdog under the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/u-s-department-of-justice/">Department of Justice</a>, is opposed to selling the affiliates before a comprehensive investigation can be conducted.</p>
<p><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the 30-year-old crypto mogul, was indicted on two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy in a Manhattan federal court last month. The accusations allege that Bankman-Fried stole customer deposits to pay debts from <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/alameda-research/">Alameda Research</a>. Currently, he is maintaining his innocence at the federal court by pleading not guilty.</p>

While the community has officially passed the two-part proposals, core developer Edward Kim warned of its impact on the community pool. The move comes amid the ongoing effort to increase the LUNC burn rate.</p>
<h2>Two-Part Proposal Passed by the Terra Classic Community</h2>
<p>The proposal aims to stop the re-minting of Terra Classic (LUNC) tokens from burns by setting the seigniorage reward policy to zero and increasing gas fees by 5x to fund the community pool. The proposal was divided into two parts in order to implement the change to the Terra Classic chain.</p>
<p>Proposal 11242 will set the seigniorage reward policy to zero, effectively stopping LUNC re-minting from burns. Currently, the 10% LUNC is re-minted from the 0.2% burn tax after each epoch and added to the community pool.</p>
<p>The proposal has received 95.98% votes in favor from the community. Moreover, 51 validators have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; and 2 validators have voted &#8220;No&#8221; on the proposal. Top validators such as Allnodes, Orion.Money, Classy&#8217;s Sphere, and others have approved the proposal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Proposal 11243 will increase gas fees by 5 times and 50% of the transaction fee will go to the community pool for developer funding.</p>
<p>The proposal has received 90% of votes in favor and 11% of votes against the proposal. Moreover, 42 validators have voted &#8220;Yes&#8221; and 7 validators have voted &#8220;No&#8221; on the proposal. While validators approved the proposal, new details from Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim led validators to change their vote.</p>
<p>Terra Classic core developer Edward Kim <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/edk208/status/1612177684578050050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">warns</a> the community that the proposals could severely impact funding for the community pool as data shared in the proposal has a miscalculation. Thus, it shows extra fees being distributed. However, a fix could later witness much less going to the community pool.</p>

<h2>LUNC Price Awaits Rally to $0.00020</h2>
<p>Terra Classic (LUNC) price fell nearly 2% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $0.0001633. The 24-hour low and high are $0.0001623 and $0.0001689, respectively.</p>
<p>As per CoinGape analysis, a <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/emerging-bullish-pattern-sets-lunc-price-to-surpass-0-0002-buy-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential breakout from $0.000185</a> will intensify the buying momentum and drive the prices 40% higher to hit $0.000285.</p>

The recent developments in the long running XRP lawsuit have brought some hope to the crypto community regarding regulations. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-ripple-sec-opposing-to-seal-in-latest-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ripple lawsuit</a> is yet to see its Summary Judgment.</p>
<h2>XRP lawsuit to decide the fate of crypto industry?</h2>
<p>Charles Gasparino, FOX Business Journalist in a<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1612911302090887168" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> tweet</a> mentioned that the Coinbase crypto exchange is developing a strategy to survive SEC regulatory crackdown over the digital asset industry. This includes brokers-dealer trading coins registered as securities.</p>
<p>However, this move comes as a much anticipated Summary Judgment in the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-ripple-sec-opposing-to-seal-in-latest-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit looms in</a>. This suggests that the SEC win in the Ripple lawsuit might force coins aside from Bitcoin (BTC) to register.</p>
<p>He added that the crypto community seeks another bloodbath if the US SEC registers a win against Ripple in the XRP lawsuit. This will motivate the commission to push tougher rules.</p>
<p>FOX Business Journalist highlighted that the SEC oversight will impact nearly every sector including the crypto exchanges. However, this will fulfill Gary Gensler, SEC Chair’s desire to force regulations on every crypto.</p>
<h2>XRP lawyer highlights SEC&#8217;s most important argument</h2>
<p>John Deaton, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amicus Curiae</a> in the Ripple lawsuit stated this deserves to be covered widely. As the XRP case is one of the most important non-fraud enforcement actions since 1946.</p>
<p>However, he mentioned that SEC has produced one of the strongest general arguments in the case. It has mentioned software sales compared to XRP sales to fund the business and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11182830/Woo-price.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Woo price" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>The twitter space for the WOO Network ecosystem informed that 705 million WOO tokens have been burned as they complete the first step towards token improvement. This accounts for approximately 24% of the total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tokens</a> in supply.</p>
<p>WOO Network website had earlier claimed that the network will work towards the betterment of the token. Citing the reason of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-crash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crash of FTX</a> and Terra Sisters in 2022, WOO Network will be working to create an environment that will not be harshly impacted by the adverse market situation.</p>
<p>Hence, they decided to burn a total of 705 million WOO tokens. WOO Token, WOO DAO, and WOO insurance were the fund tokens that were burned. However, the procedure is supposed to stop now.</p>
<h2>WOO takes a step toward transparency</h2>
<p>The network stated that they are working towards the transparency of token distribution as the first step, which will be their “recipe for success”. They also addressed the concerns being raised by the customers and members about the large supply of tokens which eventually led to an increase in inflation.</p>

<p>There has been a wide gap in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market cap</a> and the fully diluted value of the token. To solve this issue, WOO Network has decided to transfer approximately 545 million WOO reward tokens to a time locked smart contract for vesting. On being vested, they will be in custody until required.</p>
<h2>WOO trading vol spikes by 532%</h2>
<p>The price of the token has surged by 29.56% in the last 7 days. In the last 24 hours, the price of the token hiked by 6.43%. Each WOO token is costing 0.1644 USD. The market cap has gone upwards and stands at 269.094 million USD. The trading volume is seeing a boost of 532.39% as compared to the previous day. <img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134974" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/11182407/WOO_7D_graph_coinmarketcap.jpeg" alt="WOO Price" width="1858" height="800" />Source: coinmarketcap</p>

Investors should be aware of the many risks associated with cryptocurrencies in addition to their fundamental understanding of them. The fact that price changes have occurred even for the most well-known cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>The market, however, lacks much transparency, and all transactions are final. Even so, there are either no or very few consumer protections in place, and regulators still haven&#8217;t specified how they plan to control them.</p>
<h2>5 Points to Remember Before Investing In Crypto</h2>
<h3>Crypto Portfolio</h3>
<p>Investors must allocate their funds among a variety of digital assets in order to invest in cryptocurrencies. The mix should include some volatile but high-reward assets like <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a></strong> along with potentially less volatile cryptocurrencies. Investors can ride out profits for longer by maintaining a diversified portfolio.</p>
<h3>Utility</h3>
<p>The utility of a cryptocurrency is one of the crucial elements that can drastically alter its value. You can read about use cases for the coin in the white paper. When it comes to luring customers and investors, this is a crucial element. Therefore, it&#8217;s a plus for your investment if it has some high-quality use cases or great potential for more use cases. The same holds true for the reverse. The value will decrease if the coin&#8217;s use cases are decreasing.</p>

<h3>White papers</h3>
<p>Always check to see if the cryptocurrency you&#8217;re thinking about investing in has a white paper. The coin, its uses, and its goals are all covered in detail in the white paper, along with the technology that underpins it. This will not only provide you with crucial details about the coin but also reassure you of its legitimacy. In general, it&#8217;s critical to pay close attention to the legitimacy of coins and brokers in the current <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a></strong>.</p>
<h3>Market Capitalization</h3>
<p>Examining the current market capitalization is one way to decide which cryptocurrency to invest in next. This will display the curve of their value in addition to which cryptocurrencies are currently ranked the highest. Keep track of global events that have an impact on cryptocurrency prices. This can be both a pro and a con, so think about it before making a choice.</p>
<h3>Crypto Developments</h3>
<p>Blockchain technology, which is open-source, is the foundation of cryptocurrencies. Investors can do this to get a better idea of how the cryptocurrency might be used in the future by looking at the most recent developer activity.</p>

<h2>Whale Withdraws Over 15K Ethereum from Liquidity Pools</h2>
<p>On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain in a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1613079233668222976" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet</a> on January 11 reported multiple withdrawals of Ethereum from liquidity pools.

<p>Thereafter, the whale transferred 15,500 ETH to crypto exchange Binance. The <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x29110eaaab1cd5ea263aa1b08dff0deac86dcf01923a1e1bd85e919756c2c38c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etherscan data</a> also confirms a transaction of 15,499<b>.</b>99 ETH to Binance at 7 AM UTC.</p>
<p>Further on-chain analysis revealed that the whale held 30,000 ETH in September last year. Now, the whale has Ethereum worth only $19.58. Thus, the whale sold all its holdings during the crypto winter.</p>
<p>In the last 10 days, the whale has transferred over 20,000 ETH to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/Binance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance</a>. Crypto Twitter believes a dump in the Ethereum price is likely expected. A lack of whale activity has been noticed despite a slight crypto market rally.</p>
<h2>ETH Price Dump Coming?</h2>
<p>In the last 24 hours, the Ethereum price is trading under pressure as compared to the Bitcoin price. While BTC price jumped nearly 2% on Wednesday, ETH price has recorded just a 0.5% jump.</p>
<p>ETH price is currently trading at $1,335. The 24-hour low and high are $1,324 and $1,342, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has declined by 12% in the last 24 hours, indicating a decrease in interest.</p>

Traders are awaiting the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPI</a> data on Friday as prices are getting into resistance areas.

<h2>Whales move 200 mln XRP</h2>

<h2>Ripple drops crypto 2023 report</h2>
<p>Ripple Labs dropped a 2023 crypto report “A Focus on Real-World Utility”. It mentioned that Ripple&#8217;s executive predicts that from Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)</a> will involve their application for real world utility.</p>

<p>2022 saw a horrible collapse of crypto firms like FTX, Celsius, Voyager and Three Arrows Capital. This has led to declining valuations and distressed asset which will present more opportunities for acquisition.</p>

<p>A generative art <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFTs</a></strong> is a form of generative art that is created using a smart contract and stored as an NFT on a <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockchain</a></strong>. Artists frequently produce a set of images and add a few rules to the code. The underlying artwork is then produced automatically by the algorithm by randomly combining the images or patterns in accordance with the guidelines provided by the artist.</p>
<p>The degree of uniqueness in the minted piece is what makes these NFTs so appealing. There&#8217;s also the element of surprise, as neither the artist nor the collector will be aware of the final design.</p>
<p>The popularity of generative art NFTs has increased due to the NFT industry&#8217;s continued expansion. NFTs make it simple for people to acquire and own works of generative art. Now that generative art NFTs are widely used, both art collectors and enthusiasts are taking notice. This might contribute to the growth of the market for generative art as a whole.</p>

<h2>What Is Generative Art?</h2>
<p>Art produced with software is referred to as &#8220;generative art.&#8221; A pleasing work of digital art is produced by the program using shapes, patterns, and colors that are generated at random. It is typically a collaborative effort between man and machine where the artist defines the process and the final piece of art is produced by the software or program of choice.</p>
<p>The 1960s marked the beginning of generative art. There was no internet or blockchain at the time. Generative art developed into a distinct art form over time. The terms algorithmic art, computer art, and computer graphics were then used to refer to this &#8220;new&#8221; artistic technique. Today, depending on the situation, the terms algorithmic art and generative art are sometimes used interchangeably. However, the 1960s were also a time when numerous art movements and trends, including Conceptual Art, Feminist Art, Pop Art, etc., began to emerge; as a result, generative art sort of fell by the wayside.</p>

<h2>Generative Art NFTs: How Are They Made?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart contracts</a></strong> are used to create generative art NFTs, which are then stored on a blockchain in the form of an NFT. A smart contract is a piece of secured code that, when certain conditions are met, executes itself. It is stored on a blockchain. They are ideal for making art that is algorithm-driven and random because of this feature.</p>
<p>You can start by locating an <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI</a></strong> tool and a relevant blockchain if you&#8217;re a creative who wants to produce NFT generative art. Your NFT will then be composed of a number of traits, and you will design one or more variations for each trait. Copying smart scripts into your NFT design will allow you to produce new NFT variations. The total <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/5-reasons-why-nfts-sales-were-successful-last-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">number of NFTs</a></strong> that can be produced is also subject to a cap.</p>
<p>Additionally, by producing generative art NFT, artists can further distinguish their works of art. You can add various codes to your artwork, such as wallet ID, transaction ID, or gas price, based on your artistic goals.</p>

<h2>How to purchase generative NFT art</h2>
<p>A number of specialized platforms have now emerged to serve fans of generative art as generative art NFTs gain popularity. In the midst of this, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum</a>-based Art Blocks have become the preferred platform for generative art. The platform focuses on &#8220;genuinely programmable on-demand generative content,&#8221; according to its website.</p>
<p>Fxhash is another famous <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/blog/best-nft-marketplaces-where-to-create-and-sell-nfts-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFT marketplace</a></strong>. Fxhash is an &#8220;open platform to create and collect generative NFTs&#8221; that is built on the <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-100-investment-in-tezos-will-be-worth-if-xtz-reaches-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tezos</a> blockchain. Of course, there are other well-known NFT marketplaces where you can purchase NFT art, including OpenSea, LooksRare, and KnownOrigin.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if the sales figures are any guide, generative art NFTs are in high demand. Although there is a good chance that this demand will persist, it is still too soon to predict how they will fare in the long run. There is no doubt that the popularity of the artist and the historical importance of the works are important factors in deciding their value, as shown by the majority of top generative art collections.</p>

<h2>The most popular NFT generative art projects</h2>
<p>After discussing the fundamentals of generative art, let&#8217;s look at some of the most popular generative art NFT projects:</p>
<h3>Autoglyphs</h3>
<p>Larva Labs, the company behind <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/education/what-are-cryptopunks-how-to-buy-cryptopunks-nfts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryptoPunks</a></strong>, is credited with producing the first generative NFT art project called Autoglyphs in 2019 on-chain.</p>
<p>Autoglyphs, which run on the Ethereum blockchain, are described by their creators as &#8220;an experiment in generative art, each one unique and created by code.&#8221; Anyone who paid about $35 was able to create their own Autoglyph thanks to Larva Labs. The collection as a whole is thought to have produced sales of $41 million. However, the most expensive Autoglyph NFT fetches a price of $941,428.</p>
<h3> Lost Poets</h3>
<p>One of the most well-known and prosperous NFT artists Pak is the creator of the generative art NFT and strategy game Lost Poets. The Lost Poets project is regarded as Pak&#8217;s most involved NFT endeavor. It is a multi-stage collectible and strategy game.</p>
<p>The release of Lost Poets will happen in stages beginning in September 2021. A total of 65,536 single, multiple-edition NFTs made up the first stage, dubbed &#8220;Pages,&#8221; which went on to sell $70 million in total. Subsequent stages were made up of similar NFTs. The collection&#8217;s NFTs were all produced by AI.</p>
<h3>Art Blocks</h3>
<p>A platform called Art Blocks is used for collecting and producing generative art. The project, started in 2020 by Erick Calderon, is regarded as the most prosperous generative art NFT project, having generated more than $994 million in sales. Chromie Squiggles was the first piece of art ever created on Art Blocks by Calderon. Other than Chromie Squiggles #4697, Ringers #109, and Ringers #879. Some of the most expensive art NFTs on Art Blocks are Fidenza #313 and Fidenza #77.</p>
<h3>Solvency</h3>
<p>The Solvency project is a limited edition collection by Ezra Miller that includes WebGL simulations. The WebGL artwork is created using layered colors that depend on information from the minting transaction, 500 editions of the artwork, and textured feedback loops that are derived from a GAN trained on 35 mm photographs. The final work of art is influenced by the hash of the token used in the Solvency project, some being rarer than others.</p>

<h2>Are NFTs of generative art worthwhile for collecting?</h2>
<p>Your personal preference and end goal will finally determine whether you decide to collect generative art NFTs or not. Even though generative art has been around for a while. However, the addition of NFTs to it makes it a relatively new field. It&#8217;s also difficult to predict how the market for generative art NFTs will fare a few years from now. The market for generative art NFTs alone brought in $2.57 billion in 2021. However, it is an increase from $20 million in 2020. This development suggests that generative art NFTs may explode in the future if the market manages to maintain its upward trend despite the ongoing crypto winter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite all the hype and the potential profits investors could realize by purchasing generative art NFTs. NFTs are a highly speculative asset class, so keep market trends in mind. Always, do your own research, and only invest what you can afford to lose.</p>
<h3>Future of generative art NFTs</h3>
<p>Although the market for NFTs experienced a downturn in 2022, after more than 50 years of being largely ignored, NFTs have given generative artists a shopfront and an audience. The work of generative artists like Kvix Studio is constantly fascinating and occasionally unsettlingly beautiful. In the meantime, the market was further expanded in 2021 when Tezos, an Ethereum rival, that introduced the generative art stage Fxhash.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Digital art has become more widely available while also gaining collectability, scarcity, and provenance thanks to NFT and blockchain technology. The generative art form will develop alongside the NFT art market. Even though the NFT market is still developing, its current growth trajectory indicates that it will continue to offer new chances and experiences for emerging art forms, artists, and collectors.</p>
