<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Samsung bans employees from using generative AI tools, including ChatGPT, due to security risks.</em></li>



<li><em>The company is concerned about the data sent to AI platforms, which could potentially be stored on external servers with little control to retrieve or erase.</em></li>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Samsung has become the latest organization to take a firm stance against the increasing use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in various industries.</strong></h5>

<p>According to a Bloomberg report on May 2, the company has decided to prohibit its employees from using such tools, including ChatGPT, due to security risks. The decision was made after a sensitive code was uploaded to the platform by Samsung staff.</p>



<p>An internal memo sent to employees stated that the company is concerned about the data sent to AI platforms, which could potentially be stored on external servers with little control to retrieve or erase. Until the security measures are in place, Samsung will temporarily restrict the use of generative AI, including a ban on using these tools on Samsung-owned devices and networks.</p>



<p>In addition, employees were warned against using these tools on personal devices for company information or face disciplinary action, including termination of employment. A recent internal survey conducted by Samsung revealed that 65% of respondents believed that generative AI tools pose a security risk.</p>



<p>Other major companies such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup have also expressed concerns about the emerging technology and have either banned or restricted their employees from using ChatGPT and other similar tools. However, some of these companies are developing their own AI tools, such as JPMorgan&#8217;s ChatGPT-based tool for analyzing statements from the Federal Reserve to decipher trading signals and Samsung&#8217;s AI tool for translation and document summarization.</p>

<p>Their decision could severely impact the universe of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and the standing of the important NFT marketplace, which started on Monday.</p>



<p>When Chastain was accused of making $50,000 in unauthorized gains in Manhattan in June of last year, he found himself in legal danger. US prosecutors claim that he purchased some NFTs, immediately put them on OpenSea&#8217;s website, and then sold them when their value increased.</p>



<p>Using covert accounts on OpenSea and anonymous digital currency wallets, he allegedly realized gains of two to five times the original purchase price.</p>



<p>On May 2, Chastain&#8217;s attorney, Daniel Filor, contended that the issue at hand wasn&#8217;t whether his client&#8217;s trades were dubious but rather if he had a cunning scheme to defraud OpenSea.</p>



<p>The attorney continued by saying that none of the trades violated any business policies.</p>



<p>Though OpenSea may have been a little slow to update its rules—it did so only after Chastain was accused—they weren&#8217;t afraid to fire him.</p>



<p>They requested that he leave the company in September 2021 because his transactions went against their &#8220;core values and principles.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the heat of the trial&#8217;s closing remarks on Monday, the prosecution&#8217;s Thomas Burnett charged Chastain with acting irrationally out of greed.</p>

<p>The lawsuit, which was filed on May 1 in a California District Court by a Coinbase user, claims that the exchange&#8217;s requirement that a customer uploads pictures of a valid ID and a self-portrait in order for the firm to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC) checks is violating certain provisions of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA).</p>



<p>The lawsuit argues that COIN needed to gain permission from users when collecting their biometrics, and to provide information about the purpose for collecting such data, how long it would be stored, how it would be used, and how Coinbase would permanently destroy it. However, COIN had no written policy, made available to the public, establishing a retention schedule and guidelines for permanently destroying biometric information.</p>



<p>In a similar process used by other exchanges, COIN scans the photographs and creates a biometric template of a user’s face, which it uses to confirm a match between the self-portrait and the face on the supplied ID. The suit claims that &#8220;thousands&#8221; of &#8220;highly detailed geometric maps of the face&#8221; and fingerprints from Illinois residents were illegally collected and stored by the exchange.</p>



<p>The lawsuit also alleges that biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint or face scan, is used on Coinbase’s mobile app to verify the user when logging into their account. This, according to the suit, exposes users to serious and irreversible privacy risks, and Coinbase should have &#8220;permanently destroyed&#8221; biometric data after a user opened a Coinbase account, as such information was used for the sole purpose of opening the account.</p>



<p>As of now, the suit is seeking damages of $5,000 per intentional BIPA violation or $1,000 if the court finds the alleged violations were not wilful along with paying the attorneys fees and court costs of the class action. If Coinbase’s database containing facial geometry scans or other sensitive, proprietary biometric data is hacked, breached, or otherwise exposed, Coinbase users have no means by which to prevent identity theft.</p>

<p>This announcement followed Sun&#8217;s deposit to Binance on May 1, which prompted speculations that he was attempting to farm the SUI token through Binance&#8217;s LaunchPool.</p>

<p>However, CZ came forward to allay the community&#8217;s concerns, stating that the exchange&#8217;s LaunchPool is designed for airdrops for retail users, not just for whales. According to the CEO, Binance would take action against Sun if the latter attempted to farm the tokens.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The Binance Sui LaunchPool offers users the opportunity to stake TUSD and BNB to farm SUI tokens over the next two days. Reports show that $558.8 million TUSD and 9.2 million BNB tokens were staked in the pool as of press time.</p>



<p>Sun responded to CZ&#8217;s statement, explaining that Tron DAO Venture made the transfer as a cooperative market maker for TUSD. He added that the deposit was meant to level the TUSD price difference and increase the liquidity of pending orders and trading volume. Although Sun claimed that the funds were not intended for participating in activities on exchanges, it was later discovered that part of the funds had been staked on the SUI LaunchPool. Sun stated that this was a mistake by colleagues who did not understand the purpose of the funds and that the funds had already been refunded in full.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="zh" dir="ltr">作为TUSD的合作做市商，TRON DAO Venture充值进入交易所的主要目的是为了搬平各大TUSD的价差，提高流动性挂单与交易量，目的不是参加相关交易所内的活动。请周知。</p>&mdash; H.E.

</div></figure>



<p>Despite Sun&#8217;s explanation, some believe that he is only backtracking after being called out publicly. However, Sun has made profitable trades in the past, such as capitalizing on the USDC depeg to profit around $3 million.</p>

<p>Coincu data revealed that 91 coins recorded a price fall in the last 24 hours. The largest decreases were recorded by XinFin (XDC), SingularityNET (AGIX), and Stacks (STX) with -6.68%, -6.37%, and -5.71%, respectively. In addition to BTC, which lost -2.49% of its value, ETH, XRP, Cardano, and Solana lost -3.05%, -2.83%, and -5.4%, respectively.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>IBM is expecting to pause hiring for &#8220;back-office&#8221; roles that could be potentially automated by AI.</em></li>



<li><em>IBM CEO Arvind Krishna expects 30% of &#8220;back-office&#8221; positions to be replaced by AI over the next five years.</em></li>



<li><em>AI-based automation has already helped IBM save well over $1 billion in business expenses and maintenance costs.</em></li>

<p>This move is part of the company&#8217;s effort to adopt AI technology to improve its operations, reduce business expenses, and increase efficiency.</p>



<p>IBM CEO Arvind Krishna explained in a May 1 interview with Bloomberg that many &#8220;back-office&#8221; positions such as those in the human resources and accounting departments will likely be the first to be automated by AI. According to Krishna, AI has the potential to replace around 30% of these positions over a five-year period. This means that around 7,800 jobs could be handed over to AI, out of the 26,000 non-customer-facing staff that IBM has.</p>



<p>Despite this, Krishna thinks that human resource roles that evaluate workforce composition, measure productivity, and other tasks that benefit from human judgement likely won&#8217;t be replaced over the next decade. Many industry pundits remain at crossroads on whether AI actually has the potential to leave humans without work on a mass scale.</p>



<p>A recent study found that 62% of Americans think that implementing artificial intelligence in the workplace will have a &#8220;major impact&#8221; on workers within the next 20 years, leaving many employees feeling &#8220;wary&#8221; and &#8220;worried&#8221; about what their future holds. However, more tech-savvy employees feel slightly more secure about their future, believing that AI will only serve as a tool to increase efficiency, rather than wipe out their jobs.</p>



<p>In fact, some blockchain developers such as Salman Arshad and Syed Ghazanfer believe that the combination of human input and AI technology offers much more versatility than a complete transition to AI automation. They view ChatGPT and AI tools as a &#8220;blessing&#8221; rather than enemies, and that they are not here to end the career of a developer.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Dominik Schiener, the founder of the IOTA Foundation, believes that AI will take away employment opportunities from humans, but at the same time, AI and robotic process will create new jobs. He predicts that we&#8217;ll see more and more humans being forced to pivot to new roles that may look nothing like anything they&#8217;ve ever done.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Poloniex will pay $7.6 million in fines for numerous sanctions breaches.</em></li>



<li><em>The exchange permitted consumers in sanctioned nations to trade and transfer more than $15.3 million in digital currencies in approximately 66,000 transactions.</em></li>



<li><em>The relevant offenses occurred between January 2014 and November 2019 and included activities in four countries.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced on Monday that it had reached a settlement with Poloniex LLC, a U.S. entity previously affiliated with the encryption exchange Poloniex, for violations of sanctions.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The exchange agreed to pay a $7.59 million settlement. OFAC said the platform had nearly 66,000 violations of the sanctions program.</p>



<p>Poloniex was founded in January 2014, however, it did not implement a sanctions compliance program until May 2015. According to a Treasury document, the compliance program was also not retroactive, enabling consumers from sanctioned nations who were already on the site to continue using it.</p>



<p>Between January 2014 and November 2019, the exchange allowed clients in Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria to conduct transactions totaling up to $15 million.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Although Poloniex made efforts to identify and restrict accounts with a nexus to Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Crimea and Syria pursuant to its compliance program, certain customers apparently located in these jurisdictions continued to use Poloniex’s platform to engage in online digital asset-related transactions,&#8221; OFAC said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Poloniex had enough KYC (know-your-customer) information and IP address data to know that the sanctions breaches occurred, according to the Treasury and OFAC. Despite the fact that it began monitoring IP addresses and collecting KYC information data in 2015, the exchange did not begin banning forbidden IP addresses until 2017.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="538" src="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12-1024x538.png" alt="Poloniex Settles $7.6 Million Breach Charges With OFAC" class="wp-image-184918" srcset="https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12-1024x538.png 1024w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12-300x158.png 300w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12-768x403.png 768w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12-750x394.png 750w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12-1140x599.png 1140w, https://news.coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-12.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Poloniex Settles $7.6 Million Breach Charges With OFAC 26"></a></figure></div>


<p>Poloniex implemented limits by late 2017, which began to dramatically decrease infractions, according to OFAC. Circle purchased the exchange in February 2018 before selling it in 2019, according to the regulator, and the short takeover resulted in new regulations on the exchange.</p>



<p>Poloniex previously reached an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August 2021. It was found to be operating an unregulated digital currency exchange by the authority, and a $10.4 million settlement was struck.</p>



<p>Prior to the SEC settlement, Canada&#8217;s Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) started action against the corporation in May 2021. Despite these issues, Poloniex is still a popular exchange with a moderately high volume. In recent months, the site has also incorporated additional trading capabilities.</p>

<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to broaden market participation by processing trial applications for digital exchanges. While the Central Bank of Nigeria restricts cryptocurrency trading, the SEC is considering allowing tokenized coin offerings on licensed digital exchanges backed by assets such as equity, debt, and property. This move is expected to attract digitally-savvy individuals in the nation of over 200 million, including 43% of the population below the age of 14, to local assets like equities that have been shunned for years.</p>



<p>Paxful reports that Nigeria has the highest volume of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions outside the US. Other countries are also experimenting with similar tokens. For example, DBS Bank Ltd., JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Marketnode Pte are leading &#8220;Project Guardian&#8221; in Singapore, which aims to explore the potential uses of asset tokenization. It involves creating a permissioned liquidity pool with tokenized bonds and deposits.</p>



<p>The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) plans to register fintech firms as digital sub-brokers, crowdfunding intermediaries, robo-advisors, fund managers, and tokenized coin issuers. Digital exchanges, however, will not be registered until standards are agreed upon with the central bank, which has banned cryptocurrency transactions. </p>



<p>Digital exchanges in the country will undergo a year of regulatory incubation, during which they will offer only skeletal services that will be monitored by the SEC. The SEC will study their operations and determine by the tenth month whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period, or ask the firm to stop operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a cooperative market maker of TUSD, the main purpose of TRON DAO Venture&#8217;s deposit of TUSD is to promote market making among TUSD&#8217;s leading exchanges, thereby improving liquidity and trading volume, rather than participating in any exchange promotions,&#8221; <a href="https://news.coincu.com/181358-justin-suns-withdrawal-sparks-crypto/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.coincu.com/181358-justin-suns-withdrawal-sparks-crypto/">Justin Sun</a> tweeted in response to Changpeng Zhao. Our market maker has reached a total trading volume of 40 million US dollars in the last several hours, contributing to the stability of the TUSD price. </p>



<p>According to him, certain team members did not fully comprehend the intended use of these money and, as a result, used some of them mistakenly to participate in exchange activities. When they realized their error, they immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund. He also expressed regret for the oversight.</p>

<p>Today, Justin Sun sent 405 million TUSD to Binance in ten transactions, according to reports. Changpeng Zhao indicated that Justin Sun has been told not to use his TUSD in SUI new currency mining or he will take action against him.</p>



<p>Changpeng Zhao (CZ) issued a warning. CZ stated that if Sun uses TUSD to join Sui LaunchPool, he would face consequences. CZ further stressed that the Binance LaunchPool is intended for retail consumers, not just a few whales.</p>



<p>This event emphasizes the significance of transparency and effective money management in the cryptocurrency business. It is critical that all individuals involved understand the intended use of the funding and act properly and ethically. It is worth noting that TRON DAO Venture acts as a TUSD partner market maker, facilitating market-making between prominent TUSD exchanges rather than participating in exchange advertising.</p>
