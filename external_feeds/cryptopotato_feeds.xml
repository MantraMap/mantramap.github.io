			            <description><![CDATA[Now that the court has partly cleared Ripple’s name, the company behind XRP is expecting business to pick up.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple that had been raging for 3 years was finally settled, at least partially.</p>
<p>Although Judge Analisa Torres ruled that some primary sales of XRP should have been registered as securities offerings, the secondary sale of the asset does not count as unlicensed securities.</p>
<h2>Open for Business Again</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">case</a> may yet go to trial, and financial penalties for the primary sales of XRP may still occur. However, the ruling cleared Ripple’s name as far as using XRP to facilitate money transfers, which in the past not only made potential customers cautious against engaging with the company – it also lost them its biggest customer, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripple-and-moneygram-part-ways-amid-sec-litigation-while-xrp-eyes-0-50/" data-wpel-link="internal">Moneygram</a>.</p>
<p>Brad Garlinghouse – Ripple’s CEO – previously stated that the court’s decision will allow the firm to pursue new moneymaking avenues again.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse says that a federal court&#8217;s decision means that its crypto token XRP “is not a security,” giving the digital-payments company more freedom to pursue various business opportunities <a href="https://t.co/lpNFuakr6K" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/lpNFuakr6K</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZKmb1nt4Ac" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ZKmb1nt4Ac</a></p>
<p>— Bloomberg Crypto (@crypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/crypto/status/1679931605165694977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">July 14, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Furthermore, Garlinghouse believes the outcome of this landmark case will be beneficial for the entire industry, not just Ripple.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the SEC, it is really an overreach to suggest, as the Chair has said many times, that basically, everything in the crypto space is a security. Well, you now have a judge who is very clearly saying that is just not true and very clearly saying XRP is not a security on exchanges and all these different use cases, which I think helps the whole industry, for sure.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Ripple to Explore Deals Regarding Cross-Border Transactions</h2>
<p>Now that the dust has settled, Stu Alderoty, Ripple’s general counsel, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/17/ripple-hopes-judge-ruling-in-sec-case-will-lead-to-us-banks-using-xrp.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the company will begin talks with new potential clients starting in the third quarter, which is only 2 weeks away.</p>
<p>According to Alderoty, Ripple will seek to enter deals with firms in the American banking sector. Chief among target customers are banks and payment processors who do business abroad, as Ripple’s XRP token eliminates the need for pre-funded banks on the receiving end.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think we’re hopeful that this decision would give financial institution customers or potential customers comfort to at least come in and start having the conversation about what problems they are experiencing in their business. […] Hopefully, this quarter will generate a lot of conversations in the United States with customers, and hopefully some of those conversations will actually turn into real business.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Although most of Ripple’s revenue is reportedly generated outside of the U.S., this was more a matter of necessity due to the legal troubles. Now that those have largely been done away with, Ripple is looking to pivot strongly towards U.S. business partners yet again.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The pricing structure for .eth domains on Unstoppable will remain consistent with that of the ENS website with optional add-on services such as the Vault feature and auto-renewal. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Web3 domain provider Unstoppable Domains is extending support to .eth domains enabling users to purchase via the official website. Unstoppable Domains typically offer domain endings such as .crypto, .blockchain, .nft, etc, while the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is the only place Ethereum enthusiasts have been able to purchase the .eth domain names.</p>
<p>The addition of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) based .eth domains to the Unstoppable website aligns with its broader plans to become the first &#8220;one-stop shop&#8221; for Web3 domains with support for all leading naming systems and blockchains.</p>
<h2>Unstoppable Domains&#8217; New Functionality</h2>
<p>According to the official press release shared with <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the launch will allow anyone to natively buy .eth domains via Unstoppable for the first time. New functionalities such as will be incorporated to attract and engage a fresh audience to .eth.</p>
<p>For one, users can access the optional Unstoppable Vault &#8211; Domain Vault &#8211; to secure their .eth or other Web3 domains within a private vault managed by Unstoppable. This feature enables users to acquire .eth domains without the immediate need to connect them to a crypto wallet.</p>
<p>Besides offering an added layer of security, the domains stored in the vault are entirely owned by the users themselves and not by Unstoppable, which can be easily transferred to a self-custodial wallet whenever desired.</p>
<p>To address the challenge of remembering on-chain Ethereum renewals and preventing the accidental loss of .eth domains, Unstoppable will also introduce an optional auto-renewal feature specifically for .eth domains. This functionality will let users choose the duration of renewal, with each auto-renewal priced at $4 per renewal period.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the platform will also offer new options for buying.eth domains, including credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, and Apple Pay, along with Bitcoin and 11 other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In an exclusive statement, Unstoppable Domains&#8217; COO Sandy Carter said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The ultimate mission of Unstoppable Domain is to become the first universal “one-stop shop” for every user’s web3 domain and digital identity-related needs. To achieve this goal, we are constantly striving to offer support for all leading naming systems and blockchains, and the recent addition of .eth functionality was a big step in this direction.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>In a bid to ensure no naming collisions, every .eth domain acquired from Unstoppable&#8217;s website will be registered through the ENS smart contract with the same full functionality as other .eth domains.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Unstoppable domains will enable users to manage .eth domains, including setting crypto addresses, managing on-chain profile data, and transferring .eth domains.</p>
<p>The development comes more than a year after the platform <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/web3-registrar-unstoppable-domains-secures-65-million-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> closing $65 million in Series A funding, making it a unicorn. The capital infusion was said to have been deployed to fuel product innovation and forge partnerships in the Web3 space.</p>
<h2>Addressing Challenges</h2>
<p>Despite being a novel technological advancement, the Web3 domain sector initially faced a lack of adoption. While the tides are indeed turning, challenges still persist.</p>
<p>To that extent, Carter believes that blockchain-based platforms still require a higher tech acumen than major centralized services, intentionally designed to be as accessible as possible even as the former offers countless innovative features that were &#8220;simply untenable&#8221; just a few years ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;To address these issues, Unstoppable Domains and other web3-native companies focus on making the web3 ecosystem user-friendly and easy to understand, allowing users to easily navigate web3 via decentralized domains and self-owned digital identities.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[1inch Network's native token has soared 45% daily and 90% weekly. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin continues to trade sideways after last week&#8217;s enhanced volatility and has not made a major move for a third consecutive day.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are also relatively quiet, with XRP surging the most from the larger caps, while BNB has retraced by over 2%.</p>
<h2>BTC Gets Boring</h2>
<p>The last few business days of last week were quite eventful for the entire crypto space. This came as Judge Analisa Torres, president over the legal battle between the SEC and Ripple, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/history-in-the-making-with-ripple-scoring-massive-win-in-court-in-xrp-security-case-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled in favor</a> of the blockchain project in regard to its XRP sales. This has a profound and immediate effect on all assets, including bitcoin.</p>
<p>The primary cryptocurrency shot up by $1,500 to a 13-month peak at over $31,800 (on Bitstamp). However, it failed to keep its momentum going and retraced by several hundred dollars almost immediately.</p>
<p>More violent moments <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-btc-rejected-at-31k-again-ripple-xrp-dumps-8-daily-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">followed</a> on Friday when BTC dumped to just under $30,000. The bulls finally managed to intervene and pushed the asset to around $30,300 by Saturday. Bitcoin <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/weekend-watch-bitcoin-btc-defends-30k-cardano-ada-drops-4-daily/" data-wpel-link="internal">stalled</a> for the next 48 hours and has not made a move since.</p>
<p>As such, its market capitalization remained at $590 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins is still at 48.5%.</p>

<h2>1INCH Steals the Show</h2>
<p>Needless to say, XRP was the most significant gainer after Ripple&#8217;s win over the SEC. The asset almost doubled in value within the first 24 hours after the ruling and neared $1. However, it failed there and retraced to $0.7 yesterday. It has bounced off and added 4.5% in a day now and trades at $0.75.</p>
<p>In contrast, BNB, which was outplaced by XRP, is down by 2.3% and struggles to remain above $240. SOL, ADA, MATIC, LTC, AVAX, and BCH are also slightly in the red from the larger-cap alts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Uniswap, Arbitrum, and Aptos have all jumped by between 4-5% in a day.</p>
<p>The best performer from the top 100 alts, though, is 1inch Network&#8217;s native asset. 1INCH has soared by 45% in a day and over 90% weekly and sits well above $0.5.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has seen a minor increase and stands above $1.220 trillion on CMC.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[Press Release &#8211; Seychelles, Seychelles, July 17th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">As part of Flipster&#8217;s (formerly AQX) name launch, the business today announced an additional 1,500,000 USD worth of bonus rewards to encourage new users to join and trade on their exchange. Until the rewards are fully distributed, the futures exchange will run at least one campaign per week to encourage new users to signup and trade derivatives on the Flipster platform. Under the old name the exchange has already made available more than 400,000USDT worth bonus in past campaigns.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The first promotion in the series kicked off on the 17th of July, 2023 (running for seven days). A massive 110,000 USDT in bonuses has been allocated. 10,000 USDT to reward new users when completing identity verification with a 10 USDT Bonus. The remaining 100,000 USDT bonus is to incentivise and reward high volume traders that give the platform a chance. The top performer by trading volume will be rewarded with 10,000 USDT in Bonus at the end of the weekly campaign.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Flipster has reimagined futures trading with a mobile-first approach to appeal to casual crypto traders with limited experience in derivatives trading (or, as they say, Flipping).</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The method is to specialize in derivatives trading, stripping back the app experience to make it faster to learn and easier to use. Novice traders can open, close and monitor positions from any location. Potentially meaning some users may make more money on the bus to work, than from their days Labor. Beyond ease of use, the portable experience makes trading fun and feels less like a technical task.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The flip to a mobile-first approach came after initially having a web experience similar to other futures exchanges. The traditional UI for futures trading has a steep learning curve and is considerably more technical, which strongly contrasts with the UI that most contemporary apps users have become familiar with. The data concluded that users new to derivatives were not attracted to this experience as it had been built for experienced traders. The Flipster team discovered a few alternative UIs for future trading and none that have successfully been created to onboard new users to crypto futures trading at scale.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">While the focus is on simplicity, Flipster has features that will spark the interest of experienced traders as well. The exchange regularly adds new perpetual swap contracts, and as of today, over 120 assets can be traded with leverage, making Flipster a competitive exchange for traders to consider. Amongst their assets are tokens not found for futures on other exchanges and some even with low visibility in spot markets.</p>
<blockquote><p>CEO Yongjin Kim said, &#8220;The team has been working very hard on bringing this new vision for futures trading to life, and now is the right time to incentivise users to trade with us. Once users start trading on our platform, they will be coming back again and again. Rather than just copying what every other exchange has done, we are doing something fresh, and I believe the market is ready for some injection of new ideas. To our existing users, I want to thank you for being with us, and to the new guys coming in now, Welcome&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Aave DAO has successfully launched <a href="https://twitter.com/GHOAave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">@GHOAave</a> on the Ethereum Mainnet. Congrats to the Aave community on this historic moment! <a href="https://t.co/Br3QGqMU8X" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Br3QGqMU8X</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>$2.2 Million GHO Minted</h2>
<p>The team said GHO was slightly different from other stablecoins because repaid interest on it is redirected to the Aave DAO treasury, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This supports the sustainability of the protocol and the ongoing development of new features.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It added that AAVE token stakers would get a discount for minting GHO. According to the official website, 2.2 million have already been minted on Ethereum. However, at the time of writing, the stablecoin was trading just below its peg at $0.992, according to CoinGecko.</p>
<p>Aave explained that minting GHO requires “Facilitators” that are approved and governed by Aave Governance. “Governance-approved facilitators will be able to mint up to a specified amount of GHO agreed upon by the DAO,” it added.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the multi-collateral token can be minted with any collateral on the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/aave-token-holders-vote-on-proposal-seeking-conversion-of-1-6k-eth-from-protocols-treasury/" data-wpel-link="internal">Aave</a> v3 protocol.</p>
<p>Aave’s native token of the same name was trading flat on the day at $77.51 but has gained 10% over the past week.</p>
<p>GHO is entering an already crowded stablecoin market, with one player commanding the lion’s share of it.</p>
<h2>Stablecoin Ecosystem Outlook</h2>
<p>The stablecoin market is currently worth around $128 billion, which represents about 10% of the total crypto market capitalization.</p>
<p>Tether is the dominant player with a 65% market share and $83.7 billion USDT in circulation. Its supply has grown by 27% since the beginning of 2023 as its U.S. treasury collateral has made a steady income.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Conversely, rival stablecoin issuer Circle has seen its supply of USDC decline by 38% over the same period as regulatory pressure in the United States mounts.</p>
<p>USDC has a market share of 21%, with $27.3 billion in circulation. The third largest stablecoin in the market is DAI, with $4.3 billion.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Guilds has attracted more than 230 beta testers since June 29, with traders earning nearly $330,000 in PnL last week.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Seychelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX launched a dedicated space where traders can actively engage with each other. The new solution, dubbed Guilds, is currently in beta (testing) phase.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The upcoming development could be considered a breath of fresh air for the company that went through some serious setbacks during the crypto winter. It dismissed a chunk of its employees last year while its CEO Alexander Höptner stepped down.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enter Guilds</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a document seen by <em>CryptoPotato</em>, the social trading option will be available to all BitMEX users. Guilds will allow them to exchange ideas, talk about trading strategies, and share insights. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Each Guild will consist of a leader who will take responsibility for customizing and defining its identity. Other customers can join once the feature is established and discuss in a private chat room integrated into the trading UI.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Any verified BitMEX user with at least 10,000 BMEX staked can become a leader, while each Guild can host up to 49 members.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Stephan Lutz &#8211; CEO and Group CFO of BitMEX &#8211; stated that Guilds aims to &#8220;drive collaboration&#8221; amongst the platform&#8217;s community and &#8220;stands as a testament to our commitment to helping our traders thrive.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">He noted the progress made by leading companies in the ETF field, saying BitMEX must comply with the high expectations in the current crypto industry:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;As industry veterans, we understand the expectations and unique requirements of professional traders, especially during times when more Wall Street players enter the space and ETF applications are being made more accessible by institutions.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The initial success of BitMEX&#8217;s latest offering gives me the confidence in the direction we are taking with product development and in our ability to empower and support traders through our comprehensive ecosystem.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The feature (introduced at the end of June) has already amassed over 230 beta testers, with traders earning approximately $330,000 in PnL last week. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last Year&#8217;s Turbulence</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The bear market in 2022 harmed the operations of BitMEX, which saw its previous CEO Alexander Höptner </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitmex-ceo-alexander-hoptner-steps-down-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">resigning</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> from his post.

			            <description><![CDATA[The men who stole investor funds to live like millionaires will most likely spend some years behind bars.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The American authorities have reportedly arrested Brandon Austin and his father, Eugene &#8220;Hugh&#8221; Austin, over accusations that they run a massive crypto fraud, embezzling over $10 million from investors.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brandon, who has already pleaded guilty, will hear his sentence on September 6.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conning Investors to Fund a Lavish Lifestyle</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to recent <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/father-son-duo-hugh-and-brandon-austin-accused-of-scamming-dollar10-million-in-crypto" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">coverage</a>, federal agents detained the 27-year-old Brandon Austin in April and his dad on July 5. US Attorney Damian Williams said the duo &#8220;victimized both sophisticated and novice cryptocurrency investors alike out of millions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Specifically, the family encouraged people to purchase cryptocurrencies through them by promising great returns. However, they swindled every cent and used the money for their own benefit. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The officials claimed the wrongdoers stayed in posh hotels, bought luxurious cars, and visited expensive restaurants. They also gifted funds to their loved ones via wire transfers. Brandon sent $50,000 to the mother of his children and $32,000 to his girlfriend, while Hugh handed $10,000 to his dad and lover. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The duo went further, organizing glamorous trips to New York, Miami, and Europe, inviting investors as special guests who would later understand that those parties were thrown so the Austin family could amass new victims. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Each investor parted with a different sum, with one losing over $500,000. At one point, they got angry with Hugh, urging him to keep his promise and send him the assets and return on the investment. The alleged criminal replied plainly:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;I w call u (sic) in about 25 minutes. Thanks, Hugh.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Brandon has pleaded guilty, agreeing to forfeit $3.4 million and to pay $2 million in restitution. The federal agents also confiscated a 2022 E-Pace P250 Jaguar that was said to be worth over $60,000.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The two men face up to 20 years in prison on charges like money laundering and wire fraud. The magistrates are expected to decide Brandon&#8217;s punishment on September 6.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Mini Version of OneCoin?</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The aforementioned case looks similar to one of the biggest frauds in the history of crypto &#8211; OneCoin. The Ponzi scheme, orchestrated by Ruja Ignatova (a.k.a. &#8220;The Cryptoqueen&#8221;), ran between 2014 and 2016, draining approximately $4 billion from investors. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The head of the scam mysteriously disappeared shortly after the authorities launched an investigation against OneCoin. Ignatova was last spotted in Athens, Greece, in 2017, and her whereabouts have been the subject of conspiracy theories from that moment.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some believe she is hiding on a luxurious yacht in the Mediterranean Sea, away from the coast (where law enforcement agencies are unauthorized to arrest her).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Other sources have </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/was-fbis-most-wanted-cryptoqueen-brutally-murdered-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">hinted</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that Ignatova might have been brutally murdered in 2019 after a Bulgarian drug lord got burned from investing in her scheme. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The numbers reported by CNBC and WSJ are "way off," said CZ.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several traditional media outlets reported recently that Binance, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange, has or will have to dismiss thousands of employees in the wake of its legal battle with US regulators.</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s CEO confirmed the layoffs but disagreed with the &#8220;FUD&#8221; reported numbers of terminated staff members.</p>
<h2>CNBC, WSJ Reports</h2>
<p>Citing a person familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-lays-off-over-1-000-employees-d59ff6ad" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">claimed</a> on Friday that Binance had already dismissed over 1,000 people as it prepares for a lengthy and costly legal fight with US regulators.</p>
<p>Former company workers asserted that more layoffs will follow in the upcoming weeks, with the customer support team being hit the hardest.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As we prepare for the next major bull cycle, it has become clear that we need to focus on talent density across the organization to ensure we remain nimble and dynamic. This is not a case of rightsizing, but rather, re-evaluating whether we have the right talent and expertise in critical roles,&#8221; &#8211; commented a Binance spokesperson.</p></blockquote>
<p>CNBC took it a step further, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/binance-could-lay-off-thousands-in-response-to-doj-probe-source.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">indicating</a> that the overall cut-offs within the exchange could reach 3,000, which is almost half of the firm&#8217;s <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/binance-statistics/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reported</a> employees.</p>
<p>The media outlet&#8217;s source noted that the DOJ battle could change Binance &#8220;fundamentally,&#8221; as if the firm decides to settle, it could cost it billions of dollars.</p>
<h2>CZ Confirms But Not Everything</h2>
<p>Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, started this year with a message for all of his followers that they should learn to ignore much of the FUD coming from traditional media outlets. In the next seven months or so, he had to use that phrase quite a lot.</p>
<p>When it came down to the layoff reports, CZ actually confirmed that his company had to undertake such actions, which he referred to as &#8220;involuntary terminations.&#8221; However, he said Binance is doing so as it strives for &#8220;talent density.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, CZ strongly disagreed with the aforementioned number of laid-off employees.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As we continuously strive to increase talent density, there are involuntary terminations. This happens in every company. The numbers reported by media are all way off. 4 FUD.</p>
<p>On the bright side, they just can’t resist talking about us.</p>
<p>We are still hiring. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png" alt="🤝" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Let's see what ChatGPT thinks of XRP reaching $1 this year. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ripple&#8217;s XRP has undoubtedly been the hottest story throughout the past few weeks. T</p>
<p>he legal battle between the company and the US Securities and Exchange Commission culminated last week when US Judge Analisa Torres ruled that secondary sales of XRP didn&#8217;t constitute investment contracts.</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe title="BREAKING: XRP PRICE EXPLODES as RIPPLE WINS HUGE VICTORY AGAINST SEC | CRYPTO WIN!" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pUTDJAy0Kxs" width="743" height="418" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div></p>
<p>Expectedly, XRP <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" data-wpel-link="internal">exploded</a> by over 70% and is seemingly on its way to $1. The question is, will it be able to achieve this massive feat in 2023?</p>
<p>We decided to ask none other than the world&#8217;s most popular  AI-based chatbot. Here are four factors that ChatGPT outlined for XRP on its course to reaching $1 in 2023.</p>
<h2>Market Demand</h2>
<p>According to ChatGPT, &#8220;increased demand for XRP can drive its price higher.&#8221; Duh&#8230; the chatbot, however, takes it a bit further, outlining that &#8220;factors such as increased adoption by financial institutions, partnerships, and use cases that demonstrate the value of Ripple&#8217;s technology may generate greater demand for XRP.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that many investors have been holding back when it comes to buying XRP because of the uncertainty regarding its legal status in the face of the US regulators.</p>
<p>While the battle with the SEC might not yet be over, and it might just be headed for trial, the fact is that the recent ruling of Judge Analisa Torres did scatter some of the uncertainty and provided fresh hope for Ripple.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Developments</h2>
<p>Speaking of regulatory clarity, ChatGPT puts it as number two on the list.</p>
<blockquote><p>Regulatory clarity and positive developments regarding cryptocurrencies, particularly regarding Ripple&#8217;s ongoing legal issues with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, could positively impact its price. Resolving regulatory concerns and gaining widespread acceptance may boost investor confidence.</p></blockquote>
<p>It appears that we saw a major step toward the above last week.</p>
<h2>Market Sentiment</h2>
<p>Market sentiment is detrimental to the performance of individual cryptocurrencies, and XRP is no exception.</p>
<p>The AI says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The overall sentiment within the cryptocurrency market can heavily influence individual coin prices. Positive market sentiment, driven by general optimism, favorable news, or positive industry developments, could contrbiute to an in crease in Ripple&#8217;s price.</p></blockquote>
<p>ChatGPT also added that the performance of other cryptocurrencies, as well as &#8220;the global economic climate, can impact Ripple&#8217;s price.&#8221;</p>
<p>In essence, if the overall market is bullish, the price of XRP has a better chance of reaching $1 in 2023.</p>
<h2>Technology Enhancements</h2>
<p>Last but not least, the chatbot determined that improvements or developments in Ripple&#8217;s core technology, including increased transaction speed, scalability, or adding new features, could also have a positive impact on attracting more investors.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The landmark decision by Judge Torres in the legal battle between Ripple and the US SEC could positively impact the entire crypto industry, said the former&#8217;s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse.</p>
<p>He also hopes that the ruling will serve as a wake-up call to US Congress for the upcoming regulations.</p>
<h2>A Win for Everyone</h2>
<p>Nearly three years after the SEC sued Ripple for allegedly selling its native cryptocurrency (XRP) as unregistered security, Judge Analisa Torres, presiding over the case, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-secondary-sales-of-xrp-not-an-investment-contract-judge-rules-following-over-3-year-long-legal-battle/" data-wpel-link="internal">ruled</a> earlier this week that almost all sales do not, in fact, constitute securities transactions.</p>
<p>This was considered a major win for the blockchain project, and the hype sent XRP flying to a 19-month peak at $0.95.</p>
<p>However, Ripple&#8217;s CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1680005238017908736" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">believes</a> this landmark ruling could benefit the entire industry, and especially other assets, which were recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ripples-partial-win-in-xrp-case-sparks-alt-rally-as-pos-coins-post-impressive-gains/" data-wpel-link="internal">put in the same boat</a> by the securities regulator in its latest lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;For the SEC is really an overreach to suggest, as the Chair has said many times, that basically, everything in the crypto space is a security. Well, you now have a judge who is very clearly saying that is just not true and very clearly saying XRP is not a security on exchanges and all these different use cases, which I think helps the whole industry, for sure. This is a win for Ripple, it&#8217;s also a win for the entire crypto industry.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Wake-Up Call</h2>
<p>Ripple, along with many other US-based crypto companies, has urged the US government to provide more regulatory clarity for years, but to no avail so far. Garlinghouse raised hopes that Judge Torres&#8217; ruling in the case against his company will be a &#8220;wake-up call&#8221; for the decision-makers in Washington and Congress will finally act.</p>

This ruling directly undercuts the SEC’s claims that nearly all tokens are inherently securities – likely to set a positive precedent for other digital tokens in the US. <a href="https://t.co/ZlSXbTigxK" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://t.co/ZlSXbTigxK</a></p>

<p>The US has dropped the ball when it comes down to regulating the crypto industry, and many other nations have taken more decisive steps. At the same time, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has gone out of its way to target multiple crypto projects, companies, and exchanges, but whether the agency has the legal right to do so is still undetermined.</p>
