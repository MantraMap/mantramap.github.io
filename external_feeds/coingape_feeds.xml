And as per the official statement, they have introduced a new policy that permits banks to now hold 2% of their reserves in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Increase In Crypto Reserves</h2>
<p>Following the second consultation on the prudential regulation of banks&#8217; exposure to crypto assets over the summer, the new policy has been drafted, wherein, it permits banks to hold 2% of their reserves in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p>The policy, which covers several aspects of how cryptoassets are to be defined and processed, will take effect on January 1st, 2025.</p>

<p>Earlier in June, the BIS announced the introduction of crypto assets in reserves which limited banks to hold not more than 1% of their reserves in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d545.pdf">announcement</a> segregates cryptocurrencies under two groups viz. Group 1 and Group 2.  Tokenized traditional assets and digital assets &#8220;with effective stabilization mechanisms&#8221; are both included in the first category. Whereas, digital assets that &#8220;fail to meet any of the classification conditions&#8221; are referred to as Group 2 assets.</p>
<h2>Bank of International Settlement&#8217;s Crypto Push</h2>
<p>In addition, the document states that a bank&#8217;s exposures to Group 2 crypto assets should not exceed 2% of the bank&#8217;s Tier 1 capital, within their reserves. This criterion has been specifically mentioned under the reserves section of the report. And, with this new development, financial institutions will now be able to venture into different cryptocurrencies and in turn, grow their reserves.</p>

<p>While detailing about risks and supervision of these assets, the report further states that:</p>
<blockquote><p>The required process has been modified to remove the supervisory pre-approval element; instead, in the final standard banks are required to notify supervisors of classification decisions and supervisors will have the power to override these decisions if they disagree with a bank’s assessment.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Dismal Year For Crypto</h2>
<p>The crypto market has received a relatively low traction this year, with many crypto firms either shutting down or in process of filing <a href="https://coingape.com/the-impact-of-blockfis-bankruptcy-on-the-top-10-cryptocurrencies/">bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>The fall of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> giant signaled a downward trend for a number of digital assets and the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crashes-after-fed-slows-down-rate-hike-to-50-bps/">U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s recent rate hike</a> announcement came as the final nail in the coffin. This news, however, comes as a breath of fresh air to the plaguing crypto market.</p>

This reversal looks like a triangle and, in theory, indicates aggressive selling in the market. This steady downfall may undermine the recent recovery and could plunge this memecoin back to $0.0735. mark.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A possible retest to the $0.0735 support may stall the ongoing downfall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The RSI indicator, which reflects the strength of the recent price action, projects a negative outlook as its slope slips deeper into a bearish zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $1.03 Billion, indicating a 42% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/uWoFDcII.png" alt="Dogecoin Price" width="1946" height="1109" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 5th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/dogecoin-price-prediction-bullish-pattern-sets-doge-to-reach-0-15/">Dogecoin price</a> showed a sharp rejection from the $0.11 barrier. The resulting reversal and weakness in the crypto market tumbled the coin price by 26% in the last two weeks.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This downfall breached the $0.1 and $0.8242 support levels indicating the sellers are ready to lower the prices. Today, the Dogecoin price is 5% down and shows a decisive breakdown from the mentioned $0.824 support. </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the daily candle closes below this support, the short-selling may get an additional resistance level to prolong a deeper correction. Thus, if the selling pressure persists, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> may drop 10% to revisit the $1100-$1080 support zone.</span></p>
<p>However, the <span style="font-weight: 400;">$1100-$1080 support level is a strong accumulation zone and could replenish the bullish momentum.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> The increasing spread between the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and the signal line indicates the rising selling pressure in Dogecoin. Moreover, these slopes on the verge of dropping below the midline will provide additional confirmation for sellers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> The daily RSI slope dives deeper into the bearish territory, accentuating the increasing bearishness in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> with the recent downfall, the coin price nosedive below the crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 20), suggesting the sellers have trend control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.08</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.082 and $0.89</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $0.072 and $0.066</span></li>

According to reports, owner authority was overtaken by attacker on the Raydium Protocol. Meanwhile, this led to a sharp fall in the Solana (SOL) token price. This comes in the wake of huge losses the cryptocurrency faced after the FTX liquidity crisis emerged.</p>

<h2>Exploiter Took Over Authority</h2>
<p>The crypto community reported on Twitter that the attacker&#8217;s account received thousands of Solana tokens following the exploit. The Solana attack comes at the back of several instances of blockchain network halts for many hours. In June 2022, the Solana network halted block production, leading to several hours of outage. It was ninth such time when the blockchain witnessed a halt. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/RaydiumProtocol/status/1603762271028748289?s=20&amp;t=EGhNNZ57d2ZExdhyJlIyqg" rel="nofollow">Raydium confirmed the attack</a> saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;An exploit on Raydium is being investigated that affected liquidity pools. Details to follow as more is known. Initial understanding is owner authority was overtaken by attacker, but authority has been halted on AMM &amp; farm programs for now.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>As of writing, SOL token price stands at $12.84, down 7.86% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. Among the tokens that were transferred by the exploiter include $USDC, $SOL, $ZBC and $UXP.</p>

<h2>Decreasing Social Activity For SOL token</h2>
<p>Earlier, <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-price-prediction-heres-why-sol-seems-ready-to-surpass-15-barrier/">reports</a> based on technical indicators suggested that the SOL token was about to breach the $15 level.

On CNBC’s new episode of “Squawk Box”, Kevin also defended his position as a paid spokesperson for the now-bankrupt crypto firm <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a>.</p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary Defends SBF</h2>
<p>O&#8217;Leary was questioned by CNBC anchors Andrew Ross Sorkin in the days leading up to FTX founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</a> arrest about his paid ambassadorship for FTX, his career in venture capital, and his unwithering support for SBF.</p>

<p>When asked why he didn&#8217;t denounce Bankman-Fried more vehemently, O&#8217;Leary responded by saying,</p>
<blockquote><p>This is America. The justice system provides the presumption of innocence unless proven otherwise</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;I don’t have the facts. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/ftxs-new-ceo-john-j-ray-making-1300-an-hour.html" rel="nofollow">John Ray</a> doesn’t have them yet. He’s going to get them. I’m looking through my records &amp; I’m also willing to fund a forensic account of our accounts&#8221;, O&#8217;Leary said.</p>
<h2>Responding To CZ&#8217;s Liar Tag</h2>
<p>While coming to the topic of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cz/">CZ</a> and his latest remarks about calling him a liar, the 68-year old investor insisted that he couldn&#8217;t risk perjuring himself in front of the U.S. Senate for 2 hours held this week. &#8220;I can assure you that was not the case&#8221; he further stated.</p>
<p>This comes after the Binance CEO yesterday came on air on the same show of <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1603734152553046016?t=xeCrC-aIh1pMZztHfR4aUA&amp;s=08" rel="nofollow">Squawk Box</a>, to talk about <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-cz-financially-strong-interview/">Binance&#8217;s withdrawal issues</a>, insolvency rumors and Kevin&#8217;s statements at the Senate hearing.</p>
<p>CZ was quoted saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kevin O’Leary is making a bunch of nonsense claims. They don’t make sense, they don’t make any logic. I think he is a liar. I think he’s lying about a bunch of stuff.</p></blockquote>
<h2>O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s Senate Testimony</h2>
<p>On Dec. 14, Kevin testified to the senate panel that as per Bankman-Fried, CZ would not comply with the data requirements imposed by a number of different jurisdictions.</p>

<h2><b>Key points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the ongoing downfall, the Ethereum price breaks the combined support of $1300 and an ascending trendline.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily-RSI slope reentering the bearish increases the likelihood of a deeper downfall.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $7.3 Billion, indicating a 10% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/pHmQao0F.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the last recovery cycle in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-expert-predicts-ethereum-eth-price-range-time-to-buy/">Ethereum price</a> breached a monthly resistance of $1300. However, the buyers were unable to sustain higher prices which led to an immediate breakdown from the mentioned resistance and a support trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This fake breakout scenario of $1300 resistance must have trapped several long traders who believed the prices would rise from $1300. Thus, this ongoing downfall may cause long traders hit their stop loss, and the forced liquidation will increase the selling orders in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the Ethereum coin price trades at $1200, and with an intraday loss of 4.57%, it gave a massive breakout from local support of $1237-$1222. A daily closing below this support will confirm this breakdown and encourage sellers to pull prices lower.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The potential downfall may plummet this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> 10.3% down to hit the $1100-$1080 support zone.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the in-between support of $1160 and the $1100-$1080 stand as significant support where buyers may try to wrest trend control.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative Strenght index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which measures the speed and magnitude of coins&#8217; recent price action, shows a bearish outlook for Ethereum. Moreover, the RSI slope plunged below the midline and 20 SMA line, accentuating the weakness in bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the coin sellers get additional confirmation as prices lose 20-and-50-day EMA support.</span></p>

This can be attributed to the company&#8217;s cooperation with noteworthy businesses like Reddit and more recently with the launch of the former U.S. President <a href="https://coingape.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-launches-nft-collection-at-99/">Donald Trump&#8217;s NFT Trading Cards</a>.</p>
<h2>Polygon Pushes To #2</h2>
<p>Currently, as per the NFT data aggregator <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cryptoslam.io/blockchains/polygon" rel="nofollow">Cryptoslam</a>, the Polygon blockchain is trading just second to <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> in NFT trading volume and ranks tenth by overall market capitalization.</p>

<p>According to statistics obtained from the blockchain analytics platform Nansen, the number of first-time and returning purchasers each day in Polygon&#8217;s non-fungible token (NFT) market set new all-time highs during the last month of the year.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131907" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/16194724/NftGlobal-NftGlobal.png" alt="" width="1200" height="900" /></p>

<p>This was the case despite the ongoing <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-winter-2/">crypto winter</a> and the fact that NFT ecosystems on other chains, like Ethereum and <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-price-prediction-heres-why-sol-seems-ready-to-surpass-15-barrier/">Solana</a>, are seeing a weekly decrease in the number of users.</p>
<h2>Polygon&#8217;s NFT Explosion</h2>
<p>Another major reason that pushed Polygon&#8217;s NFT sales was due to yesterday&#8217;s NFT launch announcement centering on the former president and billionaire Donald Trump; with a retail price of “only $99 each”. Trump publicly announced it on his Truth Social platform along with a 2-minute video explaining the different NFTs.</p>
<p>According to the site hosting these <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/nft-non-fungible-token/">NFTs</a>, the collection is minted on the Polygon <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain</a>, and a total of 45,000 NFTs will be created during the first run of the collection.</p>

<p>Also, an increased whale activity has been recorded in the Polygon chain, where <a href="https://coingape.com/top-eth-whales-buying-polygon-matic-will-matic-price-surge/">ETH whales have bought MATIC</a> worth $3.7 million in the past few days. Furthermore, as per data published by WhaleAlert, MATIC tokens worth $9.2 million were transferred from Binance to another wallet.</p>
<h2>Polygon (MATIC) Price</h2>
<p>With strong technical indicators suggesting a trend reversal after being in the &#8220;oversold zone&#8221; and coupled with the favorable fundamental factors stated above, the MATIC token is due for a rally, as per leading crypto analysts.</p>
<p>The price of the Polygon (MATIC) token is currently trading close to $0.85, which is down by 0.43% in the past 1 hour and by 4.1% in the last seven days, at the time of writing. The decline in price comes after the whole crypto market slumped on the news of the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-crashes-after-fed-slows-down-rate-hike-to-50-bps/">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> increasing interest rates by 50 basis points, followed by the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-ecb-and-bank-of-england-lift-interest-rates-crypto-market-reacts/">ECB and the Bank Of England.</a></p>

<p>Ethereum price plummeted over 5% in an hour after the news. The ETH price is currently trading at $1,212, down over 6% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $1,210 and $1,287, respectively.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH) Price Witnesses Largest Liquidation of the Month</h2>
<p>According to data by Coinglass, Ethereum recorded nearly $41 million in total liquidations. Over $40 million longs and 1.5 million shorts were liquidated. In fact, over $30 million longs were liquidated in just an hour, which caused the sudden fall in ETH price today. This is the largest liquidation witnessed yet in December.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin’s daily chart has shown the inverted flag pattern several times, and it all led to a deeper correction in its price. The above chart shows this bearish continuation pattern was observed from Jan 2020 to April, then from May to June, from late June to mid-Aug, and from late November to the current time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, with the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-can-btc-miners-survive-amid-bitcoin-price-drop/">mining industry suffering</a> from losses with constant downfall, Bitcoin could face further negativity. According to a recent report, the average cost for mining one bitcoin reached $19,463 on December 15th, and by the press time, it&#8217;s currently trading at $170009</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 14th, the daily chart showed a long higher price rejection candle, indicating the sellers are defending the higher price aggressively. The following downfall registered a 4% loss in the last two days and breached the Flag pattern’s support trendline.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily candle closing below the trendline will signal the pattern completion and the likelihood of a deeper correction. With sustained selling, the Bitcoin price will drop 8.5% lower to revisit $15600 support.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the $16800 and $16125 are significant support levels where buyers could wrestle for trend control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI:</strong> the RSI indicator reflects the strength of the coin’s recent price behavior. Thus, with the recent downfall, the RSI breached the midline and 20-SMA, indicating weak bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> the Bitcoin price nosedived below the 20-and-50-day EMA, offering an additional edge for short selling.</span></p>

Digital fashion refers to clothing, accessories, and other fashion items that are created and worn in a digital world (Metaverse), rather than in the physical world.

<p>Digital fashion refers to clothing, accessories, and other fashion items that are created and worn in a digital world (<a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/metaverse/">Metaverse</a>), rather than in the physical world. Digital fashion can take many forms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual clothing and accessories for avatars in the metaverse, such as <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> or The Sims</li>
<li>3D models of clothing for use in video games or virtual reality experiences</li>
<li>Digital fashion projects or art installations that use technology, such as wearable technology or augmented reality, to create immersive fashion experiences</li>
</ul>
<p>Digital fashion can be created using a variety of tools, including computer-aided design (CAD) software, 3D modelling software, and programming languages. It can be purchased, traded, and customized just like physical fashion items, and is often used to express style and creativity in a digital world.</p>

<h4>Benefits of Digital Fashion</h4>
<p>Digital fashion in the metaverse has several benefits compared to traditional fashion.</p>
<p>1. It is more environmentally friendly. The production, transportation, and disposal of physical fashion items contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and pollution.</p>
<p>Digital fashion, on the other hand, has a much smaller environmental impact because it does not require physical production and transportation.</p>
<p>2. Digital fashion allows for greater creativity and expression. With physical fashion, there are limits to the colours, patterns, and styles that can be produced.</p>
<p>In the metaverse, designers have limitless creative freedom to create unique and innovative fashion items. Digital fashion also allows users to easily and quickly change their avatar&#8217;s appearance to match their mood or the occasion.</p>
<p>3. Digital fashion can be more inclusive. Physical fashion is often limited to specific sizes, shapes, and abilities. In the metaverse, avatars can be customized to have any body type, skin tone, or physical ability, and virtual fashion items can be made to fit any avatar.</p>
<p>This can make fashion more accessible and inclusive for people who may feel marginalized by traditional fashion.</p>

<h4>Is the Metaverse the Future of Fashion?</h4>
<p>Despite these benefits, digital fashion in the metaverse is still in its early stages. Many people are not familiar with the concept, and there is a limited selection of virtual fashion items available. There are also concerns about the sustainability of digital fashion, as virtual items require server space and energy to maintain, and there is a risk of virtual items being lost or deleted.</p>
<p>Overall, it is still unclear whether digital fashion will fully replace traditional fashion or coexist alongside it. However, it is clear that digital fashion in the metaverse is an exciting and promising trend that has the potential to revolutionize the fashion industry and the way we think about fashion.</p>

With this football world cup coming at a time when the crypto adoption grew leaps and bounds, the fan token trading activity showed reasonably good enthusiasm. However, it could also be said that the real potential of crypto&#8217;s combination with the world&#8217;s biggest sporting event, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/fifa-world-cup-2022/">FIFA World Cup</a>, is yet to be unlocked. Meanwhile, the Argentine Football Association Fan Token (ARG) rose significantly ahead of the big final.</p>

<h2>Argentina Football Fan Token Skyrockets</h2>
<p>The fan token appears to be on the road to reach its new all time high in the lead up to Argentina&#8217;s second consecutive FIFA final. The high interest in ARG could also be attributed to the presence of football superstar Lionel Messi in the Argentina fold, making them favorites to clinch the trophy. As of writing, ARG price stands at $6.65, up 32.01% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/argentinefootballassociationfantoken/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

<p>This price range is not too far away from its all time high it reached ahead of the tournament start of $8.50. The Argentina fan token has been on a rising curve since the Lionel Messi team reached quarterfinals. In a trend that was below expectations amid an interest world cup, all fan tokens including ARG went stagnant in the middle of the tournament.</p>

<blockquote><p>“Heading into 2023, we believe some of these top and bottom line pressures will ease, and most importantly, Meta is showing encouraging signs of increasing cost discipline, we believe with more to come.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shares of Meta increased 1.5% in pre-market trading to 117 USD. The stock has dropped by approximately 65% year to date, giving it the FAANG (Meta/Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) complex&#8217;s worst-performing part.</p>
<p>Anmuth changed his rating from neutral to overweight. He now believes that Meta is worth 150 USD, up from the previous 115 USD.</p>
<h2>Meta&#8217;s astonishing downfall</h2>
<p>Meta had a tumultuous year, as it ran into heavy criticism from people all around the world. The sales of Meta has dipped down, <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-meta-layoffs-11000-employees-mentions-vision-for-metaverse/">laid off employees in extensive numbers</a> and a poor implementation by the CEO Mark Zuckerberg.</p>
<p>In last year October, Zuckerberg announced of changing Facebook’s name to Meta for setting a clear vision of it entering the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-metaverse/">Metaverse</a>. Since then Meta had a massive fall in terms of wealth. Meta is investing huge sum of money into virtual reality. The company has shrunk a little over 650 billion USD as of October, 2022. It was also shown the way out from the top 20 global companies.</p>
<p>The upgrade would have definitely come as a relief to Meta. Despite the update there has been no impact on Meta’s falling market.</p>
<h2>The few drivers for its upgrade are:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The business will be able to outperform its booming competition TikTok. TikTok has been a platform that has seen a massive rise in recent years, especially in Asia.</li>
<li>Continuous improvement expense controls over both capital spending and total expenses.</li>
<li>By the end of 2023, reels monetization may pick up momentum and become at the minimum neutral to sales.</li>
<li>Following the significant 2022 decline, the stock&#8217;s valuation is engrossing.</li>
</ul>

Among such many rumors around the Ripple vs US SEC case, hearsay of Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson on Summary Judgment made it to the internet. However, experts and attorneys linked to the case <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-whales-add-more-xrp-amid-lawsuit-settlement-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debunked his claims.</a></p>
<h2>XRP lawsuit not ending?</h2>
<p>Charles Hoskinson in an AMA session that happened on December 10, claimed that the settlement in the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-where-is-1-38-billion-lawsuit-between-ripple-and-sec-headed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit will be done by December 15</a>, 2022. However, Eleanor Terrett, FoxBusiness Journalist discard his claims.</p>
<p>Terrett highlighted that her sources have assured her that this is no such truth in the settlement rumor. She also mentioned that the same kind of XRP lawsuit ending rumor came out to be around November 15.</p>
<p>In a recent tweet, FoxBusiness Journalist affirmed that this rumor turned out to be false. To a tweet stating that “Must be an incredible source to have confirmed it’s not true. That’s a bold statement”, she <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1603716743934881793" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">replied, “A correct one, nonetheless.&#8221;</a></p>
<h2>Crypto whales moving Ripple token despite rumors</h2>
<p>However, crypto whales seem to be unaffected by the building rumors around the XRP lawsuit. According to the whale alert, more than 267 million XRP tokens (approx worth $97.7 million) were moved by the whales in a<a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1603730899807469568" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> single transaction.</a></p>
<p>Coingape reported that other than this huge transaction <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-amicus-curiae-files-request-whales-add111-mln-xrp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whales moved 111 million XRP</a> to their wallets or crypto exchanges. This depicts that around $42.6 million worth of XRP tokens were moved amid the price dump.</p>
<p>However, attorney Rodrigo Seira filed a motion to appear as Pro Hac Vice on the behalf of Amicus Curiae Paradigm in the XRP lawsuit.</p>

In the December FOMC meet that concluded earlier in the week, the U.S. Fed said it expects to continue increasing the rate. This led to a fall in stock prices as well as cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, as the stock market continues to perform in bearish environment, it remains to be seen how BTC will respond going forward.</p>

<p>In the recent quarters, BTC had increasingly displayed stronger correlation with the traditional markets. While the macroeconomic situation appears to maintain prolonged bearish trend for considerable future, the crypto market also has its share of troubles like the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> related contagion.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction</h2>
<p>On chain metrics point to a weak sentiment for BTC price in the near term. This is holding more strength after the announcement on rate hikes by the Fed. There have been high crypto liquidations this week, mainly owing to the criticism around Binance proof of reserves. Meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/iftikharpost/status/1603730180765552645?s=20&amp;t=TVFqhvZMpMS5vrF0j_QXbA">Jackis</a>, a crypto trader, said the BTC chart for the week was looking weak.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Bitcoin Weekly candle (still ongoing) is currently looking very weak. We were looking for a reclaim of 17,600$ but instead got a rejection there post FOMC.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The top cryptocurrency is on a downward slide from the peak it reached ahead of the Fed rate hike announcement. With the central bank projecting a continued rate hike for a long time, the crypto market responded negatively. As of writing, BTC price stands at $17,016, down 3.93% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

In an anticipation of some positive outcome, crypto whales are continuing their<a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-411-million-xrp-on-the-move-xrp-reclaims-6th-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> XRP accumulation spree.</a></p>
<h2>Amicus Curiae files motion in XRP lawsuit</h2>
<p>Attorney <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1603487350180438023" target="_blank" rel="noopener">James Filan reported</a> that attorney Rodrigo Seira filed a motion to appear as Pro Hac Vice on the behalf of Amicus Curiae Paradigm Operations LP. Paradigm is a firm that supports digital asset-related and Web3 companies.</p>
<p>The firm in its motion mentioned that in the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-news-where-is-1-38-billion-lawsuit-between-ripple-and-sec-headed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP lawsuit</a> the SEC rhetoric goes further than its claims require or the law supports. The commission asserts that the XRP tokens and by their extension many other crypto assets are securities.</p>
<p>It added that the distinction between offer and sale transactions and underlying crypto assets is critical.</p>
<h2>Whales moving Ripple&#8217;s token</h2>
<p>However, the crypto whales have moved more than 111 million XRP tokens in the last 24 hours. As per data around $42.6 million worth of XRP tokens have been moved over the past day.</p>
<p>A whale has bought $15.9 million worth of XRP tokens in a single transaction from the Bitso crypto exchange. This major accumulation has come amid the recent price dump.</p>
<p>XRP price has dropped by around 5% in the last 24 hours. Ripple’s native token is trading at an average price of $0.364, at the press time. XRP is holding 24 hour trading volume of around $851.9 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  some whales have moved some 70 million XRP tokens to the Bitstamp crypto exchange in the last 24 hours. Around $26.6 million worth of XRP tokens were moved in multiple transactions to dump.</p>

Later he said that the audio service &#8220;should be working tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier that evening, Musk&#8217;s network suspended journalists for seven days. However, including those from CNN, the Washington Post, and the New York Times, for allegedly leaking the location of his private jet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe title="Twitter Abruptly Suspends Journalists Who Cover Elon Musk" width="678" height="381" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_z_hT49Y9fg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Elon Musk&#8217;s conversation drew 40,000 listeners</h2>
<p>Two of the suspended reporters are Matt Binder of Mashable and Drew Harwell of the Washington Post. They both joined BuzzFeed News reporter Katie Notopoulos on Twitter Spaces to discuss the sudden wave of bans. This ban came without warning to either the journalists or their publications. They could no longer post new tweets, and their old ones were no longer accessible. However, they could still communicate using the Spaces service.</p>
<p>Elon Musk also joined the session after it attracted thousands of listeners to bluntly state that anyone who &#8220;doxxes,&#8221; or divulges another person&#8217;s personal location, will be suspended. He countered that the journalists had not published any real-time flight data, but by that time the billionaire had ended the call. At its height, the conversation drew more than 40,000 listeners.</p>
<h3>Germany&#8217;s reaction to Musk&#8217;s decision</h3>
<p>According to a later tweet from Notopoulos, <a href="https://coingape.com/jack-dorsey-reveals-biggest-mistake-he-made-as-twitter-head-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> Spaces crashed while her session was still going on, disconnecting everyone. There is currently no recording or information on Twitter about that session.</p>
<p>Whether Spaces is back tomorrow or not, Twitter&#8217;s recent lofty declarations about Twitter 2.0. However, its &#8220;continued commitment to the public conversation&#8221; is wholly inconsistent with what has happened over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Elon Musk&#8217;s decision to block journalists on Twitter is being discussed by the German foreign ministry. They said press freedom could not be switched on and off at will.</p>
