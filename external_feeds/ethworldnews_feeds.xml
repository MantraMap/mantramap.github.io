<ul><li>Hong Kong remains undeterred in its ambition to establish itself as a crypto hub, despite the prolonged bear market.&nbsp;</li><li>The local government is inviting technology and crypto startups to set up their international headquarters in the island city.</li><li>The regulatory agencies are currently involved with multiple pilot projects, including tokenized green bonds for institutional investors.&nbsp;</li><li>Hong Kong recently set up a licensing system for virtual asset service providers.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The ongoing <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/nft-marketplace-superrare-downsizes-30-of-staff-due-to-extended-crypto-winter/">crypto winter</a> seems to have had little impact on the Hong Kong government’s ambitions to establish the region as a crypto hub. Unlike neighboring countries including Singapore, which have moved to limit their exposure to the volatile crypto industry, Hong Kong has ramped up its efforts to attract talent and enterprises from this space.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Hong Kong to issue tokenized green bonds</strong></h2>



<p>While speaking at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cyberport.hk/files/63bbe1bc906dc198207375/20230109%20Hong%20Kong%20Web3%20Innovator%20Summit%20&amp;%20Web3%20Hub@Cyberport%20Inauguration%20Ceremony.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cyberport</a>, a state-sponsored tech incubator, Financial Secretary Paul Chan revealed that the local regulatory agencies and the government are currently involved in several pilot projects in the crypto space. This includes tokenized green bonds that will be issued by the government for subscription by institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Hong Kong is at the golden starting point for financial developments in respect of Web3 and virtual assets. Our thinking is to put in place appropriate and proportionate supervision to unleash the potential of Web3..” Secretary Chan stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The secretary also revealed that the government is in active communication with multiple companies and start-ups in the crypto space. These companies have been invited to set up their international headquarters in Hong Kong. The listing of the companies on the local stock exchange is also on the table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Joseph Chan, the Under Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://news.rthk.hk/rthk/ch/component/k2/1683088-20230109.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">highlighted</a>&nbsp;the need to develop the required technology for virtual currency, virtual asset exchange, metaverse exploration, and innovative applications in which securities issuance and trade finance can be conducted through tokenization.</p>



<p>Just last month, the government of Hong Kong concluded the legislative process of setting up a licensing system for virtual asset service providers. Under this system, proper safeguards have been put into place to prevent money laundering and terror financing activities, while enhancing consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The U.S. CFTC has filed manipulation charges against Avraham Eisenberg.</li><li>In October 2022, Eisenberg exploited Mango Markets to the tune of $110 million.&nbsp;</li><li>The exploiter was arrested last month and is facing criminal charges filed by the US Department of Justice.&nbsp;</li><li>Eisenberg has maintained that his actions were legal.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The U.S Commodities and Futures Trading Commission has filed charges against Avraham Eisenberg, the man responsible for <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mango-markets-avraham-eisenberg-arrested/">exploiting</a> Mango Markets in October 2022. The self-proclaimed game theorist was arrested last month in Puerto Rico for his role in the exploit that led to $110 million being drained from the decentralized exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The exploit had left Mango Markets facing liquidity issues. Within days of the attack, the DEX had negotiated a settlement with Eisenberg, as per which he returned $67 million worth of stolen tokens. He walked away with nearly $47 million.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>CFTC alleges manipulation of swaps on Mango Markets</strong></h2>



<p>Per the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66707334/1/unknown-case-title/" rel="nofollow noopener">court filing</a> made by the CFTC, Avraham Eisenberg allegedly violated federal commodities law by deploying a “manipulative and deceptive scheme” to artificially inflate the price of the MNGO token through swaps, and subsequently manipulate the swap contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Mango Markets exploiter is currently in custody and facing criminal charges from the U.S. Department of Justice, precisely one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation. Eisenberg has maintained that his actions were legal, going as far as calling the exploit a “highly profitable trading strategy”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I believe all of our actions were legal open market actions, using the protocol as designed, even if the development team did not fully anticipate all the consequences of setting parameters the way they are.</p>&mdash; Avraham Eisenberg (@avi_eisen) <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326199682265088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener">October 15, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Avraham Eisenberg’s public acknowledgment of his role in the exploit has been cited as an admission of the crime by the CFTC in the court filing. This includes his <a href="https://twitter.com/avi_eisen/status/1581326197241180160" rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter thread</a> that addressed the exploit. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Contrary to his purported belief that his actions were legal, in fact, they constituted blatant manipulation of spot prices and swaps” </p><cite>the CFTC alleged.&nbsp;</cite></blockquote>



<p>The CFTC&#8217;s decision to file separate charges in a matter involving  swaps on decentralized exchanges is being viewed as a power play for jurisdiction by some in the crypto community. The agency has been going back and forth with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the matter of oversight of the crypto industry. </p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The Korean division plans to operate on its own and separate from Huobi Global, the parent company of the Singapore-based crypto exchange.</li><li>Local media house News1 reported ongoing negotiations for an equity deal between major shareholders.</li><li>The separation comes on the heels of staff cuts and changes to the company&#8217;s operational structure.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Huobi Korea is on the verge of separating from its parent entity amid internal restructuring and staff cuts, local media outlet News1 reported on Monday. According to the report, the Korean division of the major crypto exchange plans to operate a standalone business moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the process, major stakeholders within the company will negotiate an equity deal. Huobi Global Founder Leon Lin currently who owns roughly 72% of the platform’s Korean subsidiary, will reportedly split ownership between Chairman Jo Guk-Bong and other majority shareholders at the crypto exchange per New1’s <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/4919434" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lin founded the crypto exchange over a decade ago in 2013. Since then, the platform has grown into an authority in the digital asset trading ecosystem. According to data pulled from CoinMarketCap, the platform ranks among the top 20 cryptocurrency exchanges by daily trading volume.</p>



<h2>Huobi Crisis</h2>



<p>Monday’s news came amid a raft of developments at the crypto exchange giant. Similar to other virtual currency trading venues like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-operational-efficiency-plans/">Coinbase</a> and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-crypto-exchange-reportedly-lays-off-an-additional-7-of-its-staff/">Gemini</a>, Huobi announced staff layoffs of about 20% at the start of January 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to reducing the team size, Huobi also restructured the payment method for local employees. According to a company email, employees will receive their salaries in Tether’s USDT, the largest stablecoin currency in crypto at press time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Huobi Advisor Justin Sun Backs Crypto Exchange Amid Massive Withdrawal</h2>



<p>Indeed, Tron Founder Justin Sun <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/justin-sun-transfers-100-million-into-huobi-amid-insolvency-rumors/">transferred</a> $100 million in the stablecoin to the platform as users bombarded the crypto exchange with withdrawal requests. Security firm PeckShield reported that Sun moved 50 million USDT and 50 million in Circle USD Coin (USDC) in a bid to restore confidence in the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sun’s monster asset transfer happened in the middle of rumors that claimed Huobi might be insolvent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Brett Harrison said he will share what he knows about the defunct crypto exchange &#8220;in time”.</li><li>Harrison resigned from FTX in September 2022 after serving as president of the platform&#8217;s U.S. division for over a year.</li><li>The tweet came amid investigations into Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s sunken empire, including criminal charges and probes on former employees like Nishad Singh. </li></ul>



<p>Brett Harrison, former President of FTX U.S., said he plans to share information about Sam Bankman-Fried’s bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange “in time”. Harrison disclosed his intentions via Twitter on Monday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On January 9, a Twitter user asked Harrison what he knew about FTX U.S. and when he knew about operations at the company. Harrison replied saying “I’ll share in time”, leading observers to believe that the former crypto exchange executive will cooperate with prosecutors in the criminal case against Sam Bankman-Fried.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Who is Brett Harrison?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Harrison joined FTX’s ranks in May 2021, serving as President of the platform’s American division for over a year. In September 2022, Harrison resigned from his role roughly two months before Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion empire crumbled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before joining SBF’s company, Harrison was a top executive at Citadel Securities. Cital is the largest designated market maker on the New York Stock Exchange and services over 50 countries. Harrison also worked at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm where SBF worked as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per reports from December 2022, Harrison’s latest business endeavor involved bootstrapping a crypto trading software startup.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FTX Executives Under Investigation</h2>



<p>U.S. agencies opened a myriad of inquiries into FTX’s crash after the crypto exchange filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022. The company’s founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, was arrested in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States shortly after.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bankman-Fried faces eight counts of criminal charges including fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-lawyer-prosecutor-sam-bankman-fried/">allege</a> that SBF knowingly stole FTX customer funds to finance Alameda Research, his trading giant led by Caroline Ellison.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, Ellison is reportedly working with investigators and has admitted to illegal operations across Bankman-Fried’s comingled empire. Co-Founder and former CTO Gary Wang also took a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahemerson/2022/12/21/ftx-alameda-gary-wang-and-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-fraud/" rel="noopener">plea deal</a> alongside Ellison, per reports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prosecutors were also investigating former FTX lead engineer Niashad Singh and his role in the company’s activities. A complaint filed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/cftc-alameda-ftx-client-funds-insolvency/">claimed</a> that Singh wrote code that obscured Alameda’s debts and liabilities on the crypto exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Shanghai Upgrade</h2>



<p>The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network will focus on allowing users to withdraw their ether (ETH) from the network. This upgrade, set to launch in March, will enable users to access coins that have been staked on the network as part of the transition to proof-of-stake consensus, which occurred in September.</p>



<p>In order to meet the March deadline, the developers plan to release a public test network for the Shanghai upgrade by the end of February. During the recent core developers call, it was decided not to consider adding the Ethereum Virtual Machine Object Format (EOF) to the upgrade due to concerns that it may delay the rollout. The priority for the Shanghai upgrade is to ensure the smooth implementation of the withdrawals feature.</p>



<p>The Shanghai upgrade of the Ethereum network, scheduled for March 2023, has generated excitement among some as they anticipate competition between LSD (Liquid Staking Derivatives).  </p>



<p>There are a few anticipated potential outcomes following the upgrade. </p>



<p><strong>Potential Sell Pressure</strong>: A possibility is that there could be increased sell pressure from large investors or those looking to sell their assets. </p>



<p><strong>Stakers Will Not UnStake</strong>: Another possibility is that stakers may continue as per usual, with no change in their behavior. </p>



<p><strong>Stakers Will move their unstaked ETH in LSDs</strong>: Another anticipated possibility is that investors may move their newly unstaked Ethereum to Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDs) in order to benefit from higher returns and decentralized finance functionality. This could potentially result in new innovations and developments in the space. </p>



<h2>What is Liquid Staking?</h2>



<p>Liquid staking, also known as &#8220;soft staking,&#8221; is a way to earn rewards by locking up funds while still retaining access to them. This is in contrast to traditional staking on the Beacon Chain, which involves a larger investment of 32 ETH (around $40,000) and does not allow for funds to be withdrawn until the staking period is over. With liquid staking, any amount can be staked and the funds can be withdrawn at any time.</p>



<p>Once staked ETH becomes available for withdrawal, the revenue of liquid staking providers is expected to increase. Liquid staking derivatives allow for participation in decentralized finance without sacrificing staking yields. Examples of this include Lido, which offers stETH staking and LDO tokens that earn yields, though it does take a 10% cut of the staking rewards. Rocket Pool is another well-known provider that emphasizes decentralization and offers competitive returns. Other notable providers in this space include Stakewise and Frax Finance, both of which have seen rapid growth. Stader Labs is also planning to launch an Ethereum liquid staking derivative in the first quarter of the year, and it is possible that other companies may follow suit.</p>



<p>The LDO token, which is associated with the Lido DAO, has experienced strong performance recently, with a 71% increase in value over the past week according to CoinGecko.</p>

<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, refers to a growing movement in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that aims to use smart contracts and decentralized networks to create financial products and services that are more accessible, transparent, and secure. This includes everything from lending and borrowing, to trading and investing, to payment processing and insurance.</p>



<p><br>If you&#8217;re new to DeFi, it can be a little overwhelming at first. There are so many different projects, protocols, and platforms to choose from, and it&#8217;s not always clear how they all fit together. In this article, we&#8217;ll go over some of the basics of DeFi and provide some guidance on how to get started.</p>

<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is DeFi?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>At its core, DeFi is about using blockchain technology to enable financial transactions and applications that are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity or organization. </p>
<p>This has several key benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Censorship resistance:</strong> Because DeFi applications are built on top of decentralized networks like Ethereum, they can&#8217;t be shut down or censored by any one party, including governments or financial institutions. This makes them ideal for people in countries where traditional financial services are limited or unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> DeFi applications are built on top of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Because the code is open and transparent, it&#8217;s easy to see exactly how a DeFi application works and what it does with your money.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: DeFi applications are secured by the same cryptographic techniques that protect cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes them resistant to fraud and hacking, and helps to ensure that your money is safe.</p>

<p><br></p>



<h2>Getting Started with DeFi</h2>



<p><br>So, how do you get started with DeFi? Here are a few steps to follow:<br>Learn about the different DeFi projects and protocols: The first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is familiarize yourself with the different DeFi projects and protocols that are out there. This will give you a sense of what&#8217;s possible with DeFi and help you decide which projects and protocols you&#8217;re interested in. Some popular DeFi projects include MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap, while some popular DeFi protocols include Ethereum, EOS, and TRON.</p>



<p><br>Get a wallet: To use DeFi applications, you&#8217;ll need a digital wallet that can hold and manage your cryptocurrency assets. There are many different wallet options to choose from, including hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S and software wallets like MyEtherWallet and MetaMask. Make sure to do your research and choose a wallet that is secure, user-friendly, and compatible with the DeFi projects and protocols you&#8217;re interested in.</p>



<p><br>Buy some cryptocurrency: To use DeFi applications, you&#8217;ll need to have some cryptocurrency to work with. This usually means buying some Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are the two most popular cryptocurrencies and are widely supported by DeFi applications. There are many different exchanges and platforms you can use to buy cryptocurrency, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Make sure to do your due diligence and choose a reputable exchange that is secure and has good liquidity.</p>



<p><br>Start experimenting with DeFi applications: Now that you have a wallet and some cryptocurrency, you can start experimenting with DeFi applications. This might mean borrowing or lending money through a platform like Compound, trading cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, or investing in a DeFi project through a yield farming protocol like Harvest Finance.</p>



<p>As you start exploring DeFi, it&#8217;s important to keep a few things in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Understand the risks:</strong> DeFi is still a relatively new and experimental space, and there are many risks to be aware of. This includes the risk of losing your cryptocurrency due to hacks or fraud, the risk of losing money due to market volatility, and the risk of investing in projects that may not succeed. Make sure to do your own research and understand the risks before you invest any money.</p>



<p><strong>Diversify your investments</strong>: To minimize your risk, it&#8217;s generally a good idea to diversify your investments in DeFi. This might mean investing in a variety of different projects and protocols, or using different strategies (like lending, trading, and yield farming) to spread your risk.</p>



<p>Start small and learn as you go: Finally, it&#8217;s a good idea to start small and learn as you go when it comes to DeFi. Don&#8217;t feel like you have to invest a lot of money right away. Instead, start with small amounts and gradually increase your investment as you become more comfortable with DeFi and understand the risks and rewards.</p>



<h2>DeFi Applications</h2>



<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of DeFi, let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the different applications that are available.</p>



<p><strong>Lending and Borrowing<br></strong>One of the most popular DeFi applications is lending and borrowing. Platforms like Compound, allow you to lend your cryptocurrency to other users in exchange for interest, or borrow cryptocurrency from other users in exchange for collateral. This is a great way to earn passive income with your cryptocurrency or access liquidity when you need it.</p>



<p><strong>Trading and Exchanges<br></strong>Another popular DeFi application is trading and exchanges. Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Curve allow you to trade cryptocurrency directly with other users without the need for a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase. This can be a great way to access a wider variety of trading pairs and avoid the fees and restrictions that come with centralized exchanges.</p>



<p><strong>Yield Farming<br></strong>Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, is a popular DeFi strategy that involves providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges or other DeFi protocols in exchange for rewards. By staking your cryptocurrency as collateral, you can earn a share of the fees generated by the protocol and potentially earn a higher return on your investment. Yield farming can be complex and risky, but it can also offer some of the highest returns in DeFi.</p>



<p><strong>Insurance</strong><br>DeFi is also starting to offer insurance products that use smart contracts and decentralized networks to provide more transparent and affordable coverage. For example, Nexus Mutual allows users to buy insurance coverage for smart contract vulnerabilities, while Etherisc offers flight delay insurance that is powered by data from oracles and smart contracts.</p>



<p><strong>Payment Processing<br></strong>Finally, DeFi is also being used to enable faster and cheaper payment processing for both online and offline transactions. Protocols like Lightning Network and Raiden Network use off-chain transactions and smart contracts to enable near-instant payments with low fees, while projects like Flexa and Spedn allow users to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrency at traditional point-of-sale terminals.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>As you can see, DeFi offers a wide range of financial applications that are built on top of decentralized networks and smart contracts. From lending and borrowing, to trading and investing, to payment processing and insurance, DeFi is revolutionizing the way we think about financial services. If you are interested in getting involved in DeFi, the steps to getting started are relatively simple: learn about the different DeFi projects and protocols, get a wallet, buy some cryptocurrency, and start experimenting with DeFi applications.</p>



<p><br>However, it&#8217;s important to remember that DeFi is still a relatively new and experimental space, and there are many risks to be aware of. This includes the risk of losing your cryptocurrency due to hacks or fraud, the risk of losing money due to market volatility, and the risk of investing in projects that may not succeed. Make sure to do your own research, understand the risks, diversify your investments, and start small to minimize your risk and maximize your chances of success.<br>As the DeFi space continues to grow and evolve, it will be interesting to see what new financial applications and innovations emerge. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned investor or a complete newcomer, DeFi offers an exciting opportunity to participate in the decentralized future of finance.</p>

<ul><li>A wallet associated with Justin Sun has transferred more than $100 million into crypto exchange Huobi.</li><li>The funds originated from Just Lend, a lending platform on Tron.</li><li>Huobi is under scrutiny as it undergoes a restructuring program following the acquisition by Sun.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange has decided to lay off 20% of its staff as it navigates the crypto bear market.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Justin Sun, the man behind Tron, has reportedly transferred over $100 million into crypto exchange <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/huobi-may-soon-lay-off-employees-under-its-rumored-ceo-justin-trons-leadership-report/">Huobi Global</a>. News of the transfer comes amid growing concerns over the crypto exchange’s health and overall solvency.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Justin Sun Moves $100 million from Binance to Huobi</strong></h2>



<p>According to an alert by on-chain analytics firm&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1611335245445623809" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PeckShield</a>, a wallet associated with Justin Sun transferred $100 million worth of stablecoins to Huobi. This includes 50 million USDT and another 50 million USDC. Data from Etherscan shows that the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ddfa8ec3052539b6c9549f12cea2c295cff5296" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wallet</a>&nbsp;also contains $16.5 million worth of USDD, a stablecoin issued by Sun’s Tron DAO Reserve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A user on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScopeProtocol/status/1611287459723374592?t=g812VcDBfDqgNM0E2sTxFw&amp;s=19" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>&nbsp;pointed out that these funds originated from Just Lend, a lending platform on Tron. The funds were then transferred to Binance and subsequently moved to Huobi, which is rumored to have been acquired by Sun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Concerns surrounding Huobi’s financial health reached a new high today. The crypto exchange revealed earlier today that it will be laying off 20% of its workforce. Justin Sun, who is also a member of Huobi’s Global Advisory Board, had denied rumors about a mass lay-off earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s investment firm, Ark Invest, has demonstrated confidence in Coinbase even as the crypto exchange&#8217;s share price falls. On Thursday, Ark Invest purchased $5.8 million worth of Coinbase shares, with the ARKW fund buying 27,813 shares and the ARKF fund buying 144,463 shares. Coinbase&#8217;s share price closed at $33.53 on Thursday, a drop of 11% from the previous day.</p>



<p>ARK Invest&#8217;s ARKF fund was established in 2019 and invests in the equity securities of companies that Ark believes are using technology to transform financial services and economic transactions. Coinbase is a major holding in the fund, representing 7.7% of its total assets. The ARKW fund, which was launched in 2014, focuses on equities of companies relevant to Ark&#8217;s investment theme of the next generation internet. As of January 5th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Coinbase were among the top 10 holdings of the ARKW fund, representing 5.4% and 4.8% of its total assets, respectively.</p>



<p>Ark&#8217;s latest purchases of Coinbase stock mark a bullish move by the company, as Ark has previously been active in buying dips in the market. In November 2022, Ark invested $12.1 million in Coinbase shares despite market turmoil caused by the FTX collapse. As of late November, Ark&#8217;s total stake in Coinbase reached almost 8.7 million shares, approaching all-time highs.</p>
