<ul><li>FTX has filed an objection to the mediation extension proposed by Genesis Global.&nbsp;</li><li>As Genesis’ largest creditor, the crypto exchange took issue with not being included in the mediation process.&nbsp;</li><li>The bankrupt exchange has also objected to having its unliquidated claims estimated at zero by Genesis.</li></ul>



<p>FTX Trading Ltd. and its debtor-affiliates have joined a group of creditors of bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Global to oppose the extension of the mediation period proposed by the latter. Claiming to be Genesis’ largest unsecured creditor, the Bahamas-based bankrupt crypto exchange filed an objection to Genesis’ proposed mediation extension.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>FTX Objects To Genesis Marking Down Its $3.9 Billion Claim</strong></h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/reIlzLM9ae4Q/v0" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> made with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York earlier today, the FTX debtors asserted that they were the largest creditors in Genesis’ Chapter 11 proceedings with claims of a whopping $3.9 billion. The filing was made in response to a motion filed by Genesis Global late on Thursday night, which sought to estimate the FTX debtors’ claims at $0.00. </p>



<p>FTX stated in the filing that Genesis’ motion was filed without any advance notice to the bankrupt crypto exchange and its affiliated debtors. Genesis described the motion as critical in order to avoid undue delay and “expeditiously pursue confirmation of a chapter 11 plan”. FTX highlighted that the Chapter 11 plan in question remained undisclosed and was under negotiation among creditors in the mediation party that were hand-picked by Genesis.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The mediation is a waste of estate resources without the inclusion of the FTX Debtors and should not continue without the FTX Debtors’ involvement.” </p><cite>FTX Trading and affiliated debtors</cite></blockquote>



<p><a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/ftx-prosecutors-drop-criminal-charges-sbf/">FTX</a> also took issue with not being included in Genesis’ court-appointed mediation process that took place in May. The mediation process included other parties to the bankrupt crypto lender’s Chapter 11 process including Genesis&#8217; parent firm Digital Currency Group and the Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange Gemini. FTX’s objection to the mediation extension was accompanied by over a dozen other parties who are owed millions by Genesis. A hearing on the mediation extension is scheduled for June 5, 2023. </p>

<ul><li>Marathon Digital’s Bitcoin mining output in May is up 77% from the previous month.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bitcoin mining firm mined a record 1,245 BTC during May 2023 thanks to increased hash rates and transaction fees.&nbsp;</li><li>The Bitcoin miner has increased its Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 12,259 BTC, worth roughly $333 million.&nbsp;</li><li>Marathon’s stock (MARA) surged by almost 7% following the latest mining metrics.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital has reported optimistic metrics for the month of May 2023. The Fort Lauderdale-based firm mined 77% more BTC in May as compared to the previous month. The increase in mining output was attributed to surging hash rates and transaction <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/bitcoin-fees-2-year-high-as-brc-20/">fees</a> thanks to the growing popularity of Bitcoin ordinals. The Bitcoin miner revealed that in some cases transaction fees were so high that they exceeded the 6.25 BTC block reward. </p>



<h2><strong>Marathon Digital’s Share Price Up 7%</strong></h2>



<p>According to the unaudited Bitcoin production and miner installation updates <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/02/2681012/0/en/Marathon-Digital-Holdings-Announces-Bitcoin-Production-and-Mining-Operation-Updates-for-May-2023.html" rel="nofollow noopener">published</a> by Marathon Digital Holdings, the Bitcoin mining firm mined 1,245 BTC during May 2023, marking a 77% increase from April. The latest BTC addition brought the firm’s year-to-date mined BTC number to 4,141 BTC. The bitcoin miner also increased its operational hash rate by 9% to 15.2 EH/s and installed hash rate by 13% to 20.1 EH/s in May. The Bitcoin miner has increased its Unrestricted Bitcoin Holdings to 12,259 BTC, worth roughly $333 million. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>With the construction of Applied Digital’s facility in Ellendale, ND progressing and optimizations across our fleet continuing, we believe we are on track to reach our 23 EH/s target near the middle of this year.” </p><cite>Fred Thiel, Chairman and CEO of Marathon Digital Holdings</cite></blockquote>



<p>Marathon’s CEO Fred Thiel stated that apart from the Bitcoin mining operations, the firm also collaborated with Brink to raise nearly $800,000 for Bitcoin core developers, of which $500,000 was contributed by the Bitcoin miner. The latest Bitcoin mining metrics had a bullish impact on Marathon Digital’s stock (MARA). The share price gained nearly 7% after the numbers for May 2023 were released. At the time of writing, the stock was trading at $10.03.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>U.S. lawmakers Rep. Patrick McHenry and Rep. Glenn Thompson have introduced a new bill calling for clear crypto regulations.&nbsp;</li><li>The proposed legislation would protect crypto assets from enforcement actions until regulators set up new rules for the industry.&nbsp;</li><li>The bill would also allow broker-dealers to take custody of crypto assets.&nbsp;</li><li>U.S. House Republicans are also calling for studies on decentralized finance and NFTs.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>U.S. House Republicans have introduced a new bill in Congress that calls for a comprehensive regulatory regime for digital assets and oversight of the crypto industry in the interest of regulatory clarity. The legislation, put forward by Congressman Patrick McHenry and Congressman Glenn Thompson, has emerged as the most important draft bill for crypto this year.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>New Crypto Bill Would Let SEC Decide Which Assets Are Securities</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/02/us-house-republicans-push-for-crypto-oversight-with-bill-to-make-sec-play-ball/" rel="nofollow noopener">Coindesk</a>, the draft bill was unveiled in Congress earlier today by Republican lawmakers. In what is being described as the most important legislation for crypto this year so far, the bill meets a lot of the demands that have been made by the crypto industry. The proposed legislation would help crypto exchanges operating in the United States to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-sec-settle-civil-charges/">SEC</a>). It would also allow the exchanges to trade digital securities, commodities, and stablecoins under the same roof. </p>



<p>However, the draft bill put forward by House Republicans would also allow the SEC to continue having the power to determine which assets qualify as securities and remain under the regulator’s jurisdiction. The proposed legislation also stated that regulated crypto firms dealing with tokens or cryptocurrencies can assert that the assets and commodities. That would involve explaining the working of the concerned assets and proving that they’re decentralized by certifying that no one controls more than 20% of the assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per the draft bill, token projects aiming to be treated as commodities would have to provide details about their operations and go through a certification process with the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The bill would also protect crypto assets from enforcement actions while federal agencies like the SEC and CFTC come up with a new regulatory regime for the crypto industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Binance suspended Australian Dollar deposits and withdrawals on June 1 after announcing the decision in May. </li><li>Australian users can still buy and sell crypto tokens using their debit or credit cards, the exchange clarified in today&#8217;s announcement. </li><li>The platform&#8217;s derivatives license was withdrawn in April following controversy with Binance user accounts and a request from the crypto exchange.</li></ul>



<p>Binance Australia will no longer allow users to deposit and withdraw AUD on the exchange weeks after first <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-suspend-aud-withdrawal/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-australia-suspend-aud-withdrawal/" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing</a> the decision in May. The apex centralized exchange suspended bank transfers in Australian Dollars after on/off ramp issues with a local banking partner. </p>



<h2>Binance Australia Searching For Banking Partner</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1664173402930950144?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/Binance_AUS/status/1664173402930950144?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspension</a> of AUD bank transfers to commence on June 1st, means users cannot directly deposit or withdraw money from their bank accounts on the Binance Australia platform for now.</p>



<p>Binance Australia said the reason for this decision is that they are actively looking for a trustworthy alternative provider who can facilitate secure user transactions from fiat currency (AUD) into cryptocurrencies and vice versa.</p>



<p>Australian users can still buy and sell crypto tokens using their debit or credit cards on the platforms&#8217; peer-to-peer or p2p marketplace, the exchange clarified in today&#8217;s announcement. </p>



<p>Difficulties with AUD transfer follow a derivatives debacle that saw several user positions liquidated on the exchange. Binance Australia reportedly resolved the issue and asked the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to withdraw its derivatives license. ASIC granted the request. </p>



<h2>Regulatory Conundrum</h2>



<p>Binance has also faced regulatory challenges in other countries like the US, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-probed-canadian-regulator/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-probed-canadian-regulator/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Canada</a>, and the UK where they have also been accused of operating without proper registration. </p>



<p>Despite facing legal action in some jurisdictions as a result, Binance remains one of the biggest centralized crypto exchanges in the world with its daily spot trading volume ranging over $7 billion, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/binance/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a> data showed.</p>



<p>The exchange has continued to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-crypto-approval-in-abu-dhabi/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-crypto-approval-in-abu-dhabi/" rel="noreferrer noopener">expand</a> its services to regions like the United Arab Emirates, launching new products and features to meet the needs of its users. </p>

<h2>TRX On Ethereum Via BitTorrent Bridge</h2>



<p>Sun tweeted that Tron&#8217;s token &#8220;is now fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem&#8221;. The asset will use BitTorrent Bridge to expand its reach and boost Tron liquidity on Ethereum. Friday&#8217;s announcement provided a contract address for Tron users utilizing TRX on Ethereum&#8217;s blockchain. </p>



<p>Tron&#8217;s native token is ranked in the top 100 cryptocurrencies at #12, per CoinMarketCap. The token&#8217;s market cap was above $8 billion as of the time of writing and boasted over $162 million in 24-hour trading volume. TRX&#8217;s price jumped 2% after Sun shared the news. </p>

<p>Data also shows that Tron is somewhat of an authority in DeFi with the second-largest total value locked (TVL) worth $5.6 billion and over $45 billion in stablecoins. Only Ethereum $27 billion in TVL and $69 billion in stables ranks higher, <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Tron?tvl=true" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://defillama.com/chain/Tron?tvl=true" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DeFiLlama</a> shows. </p>



<p>Developer activity on Tron seems to move at a modest pace compared to other top networks like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC). 22 protocols run atop Tron&#8217;s network and JustLend dominates the TRX ecosystem accounting for over half of Tron&#8217;s TVL. </p>

<h2>Sun Apes Into Memecoin </h2>



<p>Justin Sun said he would trade memecoins and <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/memecoin-frenzy-justin-sun-donate-profits/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/memecoin-frenzy-justin-sun-donate-profits/" rel="noreferrer noopener">donate</a> the profits to charity amid a frenzy led by tokens like Pepe, a memecoin inspired by the popular &#8220;Pepe The Frog&#8221;. At the time, fees on marquee networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum hit ATHs as speculative traders aped into these memecoins. </p>



<p>Though obviously risky, the trading trend may spotlight the gambling nature or &#8220;degenerate/degen&#8221; side of the crypto community. </p>

<p>Coinbase Derivatives Exchange recently announced the launch of institutional futures offering with Bitcoin and Ether contracts. The CFTC-regulated derivatives trading platform will begin offering BTC and ETH futures contracts to its institutional clients starting June 5, 2023. The new crypto offerings come less than a year after the derivatives exchange launched its nano Bitcoin and nano Ether derivatives. </p>



<h2><strong>Coinbase Responds To Institutional Demand For Crypto Derivatives</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-exchange-will-launch-institutional-sized-bitcoin-and" rel="nofollow noopener">blog post</a> by Coinbase, the institutional-sized contacts will be sized at 1 BTC and 10 ETH, allowing the derivatives exchange’s clients to manage their exposure to the crypto assets. The Bitcoin futures contracts (BTI) and Ether futures contracts (ETI) will be made available to clients through leading third-party institutional futures commission merchants (FCMs) and brokers. Institutional clients who adopt the new derivatives products early on may be eligible for various incentive programs. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“With the launch of these institutional-sized USD-settled contracts, we look to empower institutional participants with greater precision in managing crypto exposure, expressing directional views, or tracking Bitcoin and Ether returns in a capital-efficient way.”</p><cite>Coinbase Derivatives Exchange</cite></blockquote>



<p>The new derivatives products will be offered as USD-settled index futures and will have a monthly expiry. Each BTI and ETI contract represents 1 Bitcoin and Ether respectively. <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-manager-sec-settle-civil-charges/">Coinbase</a> stated in its offering documents that in case of a hard fork, the new token will not be added to the Index unless it becomes the “dominant coin.” The platform introduced the BTC and ETH futures contracts amid growing demand from institutional clients for advanced derivatives products. In June 2022 Coinbase Derivatives Exchange launched nano Bitcoin futures contracts for its retail clients. This was followed by the launch of nano Ether futures contracts in August 2022</p>

<ul><li>The MakerDAO community has voted in favor of a proposal to purchase $1.28 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries.&nbsp;</li><li>The proposal, dubbed Project Andromeda, was put forward by crypto investment firm Blocktower Capital.</li><li>Maker is set to exchange 1.28 billion DAI stablecoins for short-dated U.S. Treasuries with maturities ranging from 0-6 months.&nbsp;</li><li>The DeFi protocol purchased $1.1 billion of government and corporate bonds earlier this year.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>DeFi lending platform MakerDAO is set to purchase a whopping $1.28 billion worth of U.S. Treasuries in a bid to diversify the reserve assets that back its DAI stablecoin. The community behind Maker voted in favor of a proposal, dubbed Project Andromeda, to deploy a new vault with a debt ceiling of 1.28 billion DAI.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>MakerDAO To Purchase Short-Dated US Treasuries</strong></h2>



<p>According to the proposal submitted on MakerDAO’s <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/project-andromeda-risk-legal-assessment/20969" rel="nofollow noopener">governance forum</a> earlier this month, Project Andromeda was put forward by Blocktower Capital Advisors LP under MIP90. As per the proposal, 1.28 billion DAI would be deployed to purchase short-dated U.S. Treasuries that will be held in custody by Wedbush Securities Inc. The maturities of the government bonds will range from zero to six months. As per the asset purchases schedule posted on the governance forum, 1/6th (16.67%) of the total DAI vault will be allocated to 0-1 month US Treasuries. Identical allocations have been listed for 1-2 month bonds, 2-3 month bonds, and so on. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling/QmbudkVR#vote-breakdown" rel="nofollow noopener">polling page</a> showed that the MakerDAO community approved the proposal with an overwhelming majority, with 99.99% of the votes in favor of Project Andromeda. Blocktower Capital will receive an arranger fee equivalent to 0.15% of the vault, which comes out to over $1.9 million. Coinbase and Galaxy Digital will serve as exchange agents on the transaction, facilitating the conversion between stablecoins and U.S. Dollars.</p>



<p>The approval for the $1.28 billion U.S. Treasuries purchase comes just months after Maker’s community approved a proposal to increase its portfolio holdings of United States Treasury bonds by 150%, from $500 million to $1.25 billion. The latest approval comes just a day after fellow stablecoin issuer Circle <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-dumps-us-treasuries-usdc-reserve/">eliminated</a> all U.S. Treasury bonds from the reserve fund backing its USDC stablecoin. </p>

<ul><li>Dogecoin investors have accused Elon Musk of insider trading and manipulating the price of DOGE.&nbsp;</li><li>The investors have requested to amend the class action lawsuit filed against Musk last year to include the latest allegations.&nbsp;</li><li>The DOGE holders alleged that Musk used Twitter posts and his online influence to manipulate the meme token’s price.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Dogecoin investors have accused Elon Musk of insider trading and manipulating DOGE. In a proposed amendment to an ongoing class action lawsuit, investors of DOGE accused the billionaire businessman of costing them billions of dollars by using his influence to manipulate the price of the world’s largest meme token and profiting himself in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Musk Accused Of Using Twitter To Manipulate Dogecoin</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/elon-musk-is-accused-insider-trading-by-investors-dogecoin-lawsuit-2023-06-01/" rel="nofollow noopener">Reuters</a>, Dogecoin investors filed a request with the Manhattan Federal Court to amend the class action lawsuit that was initially filed against Elon Musk in June 2022. In what was the third amendment to the lawsuit, investors stated that the Twitter CEO used multiple Twitter posts, paid online influencers, and public appearances to manipulate DOGE’s price in order to trade profitably at their expense. </p>



<p>The investors included several instances of Musk’s alleged acts of manipulation, including his appearance on NBC&#8217;s Saturday Night Live in 2021 and showcasing Dogecoin’s Shiba Inu mascot on Twitter’s homepage last month. The filing alleged that Musk sold nearly $124 million worth of DOGE after it gained 30% thanks to its logo being displayed on <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/dogecoin-down-8-twitter-removes-doge-logo/">Twitter</a>. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>This is a securities fraud class action arising from a deliberate course of carnival barking market manipulation and insider trading by the world’s richest man Elon Musk”</p><cite>Court Filing by Dogecoin investors</cite></blockquote>



<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein reportedly said that he would “likely” allow the latest amended complaint, noting that the defendants would not likely be prejudiced. Elon Musk’s lawyer declined a request for comment by Reuters. A lawyer for Musk’s EV giant Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier this year, Musk and Tesla requested the court to dismiss the second amended complaint filed by the Dogecoin investors, describing it as a &#8220;fanciful work of fiction.&#8221;</p>

<ul><li>Open Exchange (OPNX) has issued a new governance token for its bankruptcy claims exchange.&nbsp;</li><li>The exchange’s native token FLEX added 20% to its price following the announcement.&nbsp;</li><li>Holders of Open Exchange’s OX token can enjoy up to 100% discount on trading fees.&nbsp;</li><li>The ERC-20 OX token has a maximum supply of 9.86 billion.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Open Exchange (<a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/opnx-investors-deny-funding-the-exchange/">OPNX</a>), the bankruptcy claims exchange launched by 3AC’s Su Zhu and Kyle Davies, has issued a governance token called the Open Exchange token (OX). The exchange has also launched its staking and governance platform called The Herd. OX token’s launch comes almost four months after the platform was set up by the disgraced founders of the defunct crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC). </p>



<h2><strong>OX Token Holders Can Get 100% Rebates On OPNX’s Trading Fees</strong></h2>



<p>As per the <a href="https://opnx-public-files.s3.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/pdf/OX_Token.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">whitepaper</a> released by OPNX, as the platform’s governance token OX will offer a “Stake To Trade For Free&#8221; rebate model in an attempt to promote alignment between the bankruptcy claims trading platform and its users. According to Open Exchange, a convention fixed discount model only incentivized short-term holding of the token to pay trading fees while high minimum volume/holding bands are only accessible to whales &amp; require constant adjustment, causing confusion.</p>



<p>By staking the OX token, traders on the platform will be able to avoid paying trading fees irrespective of their trading volume. Traders will get a 100% rebate on trading fees if their percentage of total staked OX is equal to or greater than their percentage of total OPNX trading volume. Traders who exceed their 100% rebate-free trading volume will get a 50% trading fee rebate on the remainder. Open Exchange claims that with enough staked governance tokens, traders can engage in feeless trading in perpetuity.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In one week, if Alice stakes 2% of total staked $OX and trades up to 2% of the total OPNX trading volume, she will receive a 100% trading fee rebate.” </p><cite>Example of trading fee rebate based on staked OX tokens</cite></blockquote>



<p>News of the OX token’s launch sent OPNX’s native token FLEX soaring. The native token has gained more than 20% over the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, the token was trading at $1.15. Meanwhile, the OX token has lost nearly 8% of its value since it was issued earlier today. Data from Etherscan shows that 150 people have either purchased or minted the governance token, which has a maximum supply of 9.86 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Circle Internet Financial, the crypto giant behind the world’s second-largest stablecoin, has ditched all U.S. Treasury bonds from the reserve fund backing its USDC stablecoin. The move was made to shield USDC from any potential damage from the ongoing concerns surrounding the United States debt ceiling.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Circle Holds Assets In Overnight Repo Agreements</strong></h2>



<p>According to Circle’s <a href="https://www.circle.com/hubfs/USDCAttestationReports/2023/2023%20USDC_Circle%20Examination%20Report%20April%202023.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">monthly attestatio</a>n released by independent accountants at Deloitte, the last Treasury bond worth nearly $4 billion matured earlier today, effectively removing all long-term Treasuries from the reserve fund. As of May 30, 2023, the <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/circle-move-usdc-avalanche-ethereum/">Circle</a> Reserve Fund, managed by Wall Street giant Blackrock, held 100% of its $24.7 billion fund in overnight U.S. Treasury Repurchase Agreements. </p>



<p>The latest move marks a significant change in the fund’s holdings as compared to April 2023 when the USDC issuer held over $30 billion in U.S. Treasury Bonds. The changes to the Reserve fund came in light of the debt ceiling crisis in the United States, which could have had a devastating impact on all government securities. Lawmakers in the U.S. are set to vote on the fate of the country’s $31.4 trillion debt ceiling later today in a desperate attempt to avert a default by the U.S. government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The decision to eliminate U.S. Treasury bonds was in line with the goal set by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. Allaire told <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-money/2023/05/10/rewriting-crypto-00096124" rel="nofollow noopener">Politico</a> earlier this month that his crypto firm would ditch the asset class in favor of short-dated U.S. Treasuries in a bid to protect its USDC stablecoin from a potential U.S. debt default. </p>
