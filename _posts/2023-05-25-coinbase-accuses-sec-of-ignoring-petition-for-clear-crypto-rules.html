<p>Crypto exchange Coinbase filed a writ of mandamus against the US SEC shortly after the SEC stated it was in no hurry to respond to Coinbase&rsquo;s demands for regulatory clarity. </p>
<p>In the ongoing dispute between cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), tensions have reached a new high as the exchange submits its third filing to the Third Circuit of the US Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, announced the news on Twitter:</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Late last night Coinbase replied in the Third Circuit to the SEC&rsquo;s arguments against our petition for a writ of mandamus. Mandamus is the tailor-made remedy for the extraordinary facts presented here. We continue to appreciate the Court's consideration. https://t.co/OD02kX3524</p>

<p>In the filing, Coinbase accused the SEC of purposefully ignoring its petition for adopting clear rules for the cryptocurrency industry despite the SEC&rsquo;s decision not being made public yet. The exchange also referred to public comments by Gary Gensler, saying, &ldquo;the SEC&rsquo;s and its Chair&rsquo;s words and actions leave no doubt of the agency&rsquo;s plans,&rdquo; according to reports by Decrypt.</p>
Coinbase Files Writ Mandamus Petition
<p>In its mandamus petition, Coinbase&rsquo;s main arguments state:</p>

<p>Mandamus Is Warranted Because The SEC Has Made Up Its Mind To Deny Coinbase&rsquo;s Petition.</p>
<p>The SEC does not deny that its delay in responding to Coinbase&rsquo;s rulemaking petition would be unreasonable, and that mandamus would be warranted, if the agency has determined not to engage in the rulemaking process Coinbase request.</p>

<p>A writ of mandamus refers to a legal petition that compels a government agency to fulfil its statutory obligations.</p>
<p>Coinbase&rsquo;s latest petition comes after the SEC refused to entertain the exchange&rsquo;s request for immediate clarity of cryptocurrency regulations. In its May 15 brief, the SEC filed a response to Coinbase&rsquo;s petition in April, and it was not prepared to provide clarity on current crypto regulations.</p>
<p>The agency further stated it is not obligated to meet the requirements set out in Coinbase&rsquo;s petition. It said the exchange requested complex rulemaking in an unreasonably short amount of time.</p>
<p>In that filing, the SEC asked the court to deny Coinbase&rsquo;s petition for mandamus, arguing it is an &ldquo;extraordinary remedy&rdquo; that Coinbase does not, and cannot, demonstrate a right to relief. The exchange filed a narrow action lawsuit at the end of April, compelling the SEC to give a &lsquo;yes or no&rsquo; answer&rsquo; to a petition filed in July 2022, which went unanswered for nine months.</p>
