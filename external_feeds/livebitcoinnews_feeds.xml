										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/us-department-of-justice-arrests-engineer-over-9m-crypto-theft-1032438620">arrested security engineer</a> Shakeeb Ahmed for engaging in the $9 million theft of an unnamed decentralized crypto exchange (DEX).</p>
<h2>The DOJ Has a Suspect</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/doj/">DOJ</a> alleges Shakeeb created fake pricing data to generate fees through the exchange, which later allowed him to make ongoing withdrawals. He was arrested in mid-July of this year – approximately 12 months after he took part in the attack – following several days of tracking his online behavior. A DOJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-security-engineer-international-technology-company-arrested-defrauding">press release explained</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In July 2022, Ahmed carried out an attack on the crypto exchange by exploiting a vulnerability in one of the crypto exchange’s smart contracts and inserting fake pricing data to fraudulently cause that smart contract to generate approximately $9 million dollars’ worth of inflated fees that Ahmed did not legitimately earn, which fees Ahmed was able to withdraw from the crypto exchange in the form of cryptocurrency.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the DEX hasn’t been identified at the time of writing, authorities have confirmed it sits atop the Solana blockchain. Discussing the case in an interview, U.S. attorney Damian Williams commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the second case we are announcing this week to shed light on fraud in the cryptocurrency and digital asset ecosystem. As alleged in the indictment, Shakeeb Ahmed, who was a senior security engineer at an international technology company, used his expertise to defraud the exchange and its users and steal approximately $9 million in cryptocurrency. We also allege that he then laundered the stolen funds through a series of complex transfers on the blockchain where he swapped cryptocurrencies, hopped across different crypto blockchains, and used overseas crypto exchanges, but none of those actions covered the defendant’s tracks or fooled law enforcement, and they certainly didn’t stop my office, or our law enforcement partners from following the money.</p></blockquote>
<p>HIS special agent in charge Chad Plantz also threw his two cents into the mix, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Financial crime strikes at the core of our national and economic banking security.  With an attack of this magnitude, it’s crucial we ensure continued consumer confidence in our financial system.  Ruthless and reckless attempts aimed [at sabotaging] legitimate commerce for greed must be stopped.  It’s cases like these that demonstrate HSI’s commitment and ability to work with a coalition of the willing to dismantle these complicated and technical fraud schemes and identify those responsible regardless of where they operate.</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Match for Law Enforcement</h2>
<p>Lastly, IRS-CI special agent in charge Tyler Hatcher mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>As alleged, Mr. Ahmed used his skills as a computer security engineer to steal millions of dollars.  He then allegedly tried to hide the stolen funds, but his skills were no match for [the] IRS Criminal Investigation&#8217;s Cyber Crimes Unit.  We, along with our partners at HSI and the Department of Justice, are at the forefront of cyber investigations.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Former heads of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Timothy Massad and Jay Clayton feel the U.S. is <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/former-cftc-chairman-says-crypto-regulations-can-t-wait-until-litigations-concludes-we-need-standards-today/ar-AA1dGLxH">seriously falling behind</a> when it comes to crypto regulation, and they’re calling for legislators to step up and create valid rules once and for all.</p>
<h2>Timothy Massad on the Lack of Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Right now, the U.S. is arguably one of the worst places for crypto activity. This largely has to do with the idea that men like Gary Gensler – the current head of the SEC – are engaging in “regulation through enforcement” tactics, in which crypto companies are targeted and charged with crimes when they don’t partake in activities or ideologies the attacking financial agencies deem fit or correct.</p>
<p>The problem with this, however, is that these same agencies are not working to establish long-term legislation that would make the crypto rules in this country easier to understand or live by. Instead, they are just on the offensive 24 hours a day, and many crypto companies cannot take the pressure anymore.</p>
<p>Right now, for example, Coinbase – which is currently <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">being sued by the</a> SEC for allegedly operating as an illegal exchange broker – has opened a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-is-now-active-in-bermuda/">new office in Bermuda</a>, claiming it will not focus on U.S. relations or activities regarding crypto until the regulatory environment becomes clearer and more stable.</p>
<p>Massad is one of the many individuals that isn’t happy about the way things are going in America. In a recent interview, Massad explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>We strongly support enforcement of the laws, but what we&#8217;re saying is we need more than that, and the reason is twofold. One is litigation takes a long time and, quite frankly, the crypto industry may find it&#8217;s in their interest to stretch these cases out because they may be hoping for a change in regulatory attitude with the 2024 election. The second reason is it won&#8217;t resolve all the issues that we need to get resolved.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Try Putting the Securities Argument Aside</h2>
<p>Regarding the ongoing arguments surrounding crypto assets as potential securities, he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are saying that&#8217;s an important question but put that aside for a moment if you will. Let&#8217;s not get hung up on that, or rather, let&#8217;s have a parallel track which says, regardless of the classification issue, we need standards today… Because when you get into rewriting the securities laws or the derivatives laws, you risk creating, you know, a lot of unintended consequences, a lot of loopholes that you didn&#8217;t mean to create. This is a way to get investor protection standards into the industry as [that industry] exists today without having to fundamentally change the securities or the derivatives laws.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another company being sued by the SEC is Binance, which <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">is alleged to have commingled</a> customer and corporate funds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a lot of legal back-and-forth jabber, the Winklevoss Twins of the Gemini exchange in New York are moving forward <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/business/article/digital-currency-group-sued-winklevoss-twins-18193734.php">with their lawsuit against</a> Barry Silbert and his company Digital Currency Group. The Twins allege that the firm and its CEO Silbert engaged in massive fraud.</p>
<h2>The Winklevoss Twins Are Taking DCG to Court</h2>
<p>The problems stem from a program introduced by Gemini called Earn, which allowed users to loan their assets to Genesis, a division of the Digital Currency Group. By loaning their assets, they would earn interest on them, though Genesis later froze all withdrawals following the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">collapse of FTX</a> last November.</p>
<p>This is alleged to have affected more than 230,000 Earn customers, thus leaving $1.2 billion of crypto stuck in the Genesis platform. Not long after, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/genesis-is-next-crypto-firm-to-go-bankrupt/">Genesis filed for bankruptcy</a>. The lawsuit states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The assets involved, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, are relatively novel, but the fraud and deception committed by defendants are all too familiar. Defendants DCG and Silbert engaged in a fraudulent scheme to induce a variety of depositors, including Gemini users for whom Gemini acted as custodian and agent, to continue to lend huge amounts of cryptocurrency and U.S. dollars to DCG’s subsidiary Genesis Global Capital. This lawsuit seeks to recover from defendants the damages and losses that Gemini has incurred [due to] DCG’s and Silbert’s false, misleading, and incomplete representations and omissions to Gemini, and defendants’ role in encouraging and facilitating Genesis’ fraud against Gemini.</p></blockquote>
<p>Digital Currency Group is denying it did anything wrong and trying to shift the blame onto the Winklevoss brothers, claiming in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is yet another publicity stunt from Cameron Winklevoss and Gemini. Any suggestion of wrongdoing by DCG or any of its employees is baseless, defamatory, and false. From day one, Genesis has remained committed to reaching an amicable solution for all parties to the Genesis bankruptcy… The mediation process is nearing a close, and we expect to bring the Genesis Chapter 11 bankruptcy case to a conclusion soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, both Genesis and Gemini are facing charges from the SEC. Even before these charges came, Cameron Winklevoss believed the Digital Currency Group and Silbert were to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cameron-winklevoss-pens-letter-calling-for-dcg-heads-resignation/">blame for many</a> of the problems his exchange was enduring. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is no path forward [so] long as Barry Silbert remains CEO of DCG. He has proven himself unfit to run DCG and unwilling and unable to find a resolution with creditors that is both fair and reasonable.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Looking for Publicity?</h2>
<p>Representatives of Digital Currency Group, however, were quick to dismiss his words as part of a “publicity stunt.”</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time the Winklevoss Twins have engaged in a lawsuit against another party, as their suit against Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was the subject of the 2010 Oscar-winning film “The Social Network.”</p>

<li>The price could continue to move down if it stays below the $0.275 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cardano price is struggling below $0.280 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-below-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. ADA price could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.270 and $0.280 resistance levels.</em></p>
<h2>Cardano Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Cardano price saw a rejection pattern near the $0.285 zone against the US Dollar. The ADA/USD pair declined below the $0.275 and $0.262 support levels.</p>
<p>The price even declined below the $0.260 support and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours). It revisited the $0.2520 support zone. A low is formed near $0.2520 and the price is consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3025 swing high to the $0.2520 low.</p>
<p>It is now trading below $0.275 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cardano-ada-price-analysis-bears-in-active-below-0-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.270 zone. The first major resistance is near the $0.275 level.</p>
<p>There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.2750 on the 4-hour chart. It is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3025 swing high to the $0.2520 low.</p>
<p>The next key resistance could be $0.280. A clear upside break above the $0.280 level might send Cardano price toward the $0.300 resistance. Any more gains could start a steady increase toward the $0.305 level or even $0.320.</p>
<p>On the downside, immediate support is near the $0.2585 level. The next major support is near the $0.252 level, below which the price may perhaps decline toward the $0.235 support level. Any more losses might call for a test of the $0.220 level.</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Ethereum price is declining below $1,700 against the US Dollar. ETH/USD remains at a risk of more downsides below the $1,640 support zone.</em></p>
<h2>Ethereum Price Analysis</h2>
<p>This past week, Ethereum started a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-revisits-key-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh decline</a> below $1,800 against the US Dollar. ETH price moved into a bearish zone below the $1,850 level.</p>
<p>There was a sharp move below the $1,700 level. A low was formed near $1,540 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is now trading below $1,780 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/ethereum-price-analysis-eth-could-resume-increase-above-1885/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key contracting triangle forming with resistance near $1,690 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>It is trading above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,859 swing high to the $1,540 low. On the upside, the price is now facing resistance near the $1,690 level.</p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $1,700 level. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,859 swing high to the $1,540 low is also near $1,700. A clear move above the $1,700 resistance could send the price toward $1,760.</p>
<p>Any more gains could even send the price toward the $1,800 resistance zone or even $1,850 in the near term. On the downside, initial support is near the $1,630 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is now near the $1,600 level. A break below the $1,600 support could push the price to $1,540. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,540 support, the price might decline toward $1,420.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not long ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/grayscale-cries-foul-over-sec-000239686.html">approved a different</a> kind of bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF), and crypto conglomerate Grayscale isn’t happy about that.</p>
<h2>Grayscale is Seeing Red</h2>
<p>The ETF that garnered approval is called 2X Volatility Shares, and it became open for public trading on June 23. For many players out there, the move was the right one and a big step in a powerful new direction that’s likely to make crypto mainstream and legitimate in many traders’ eyes, but Grayscale is a little ticked off that the SEC would allow such a product to be made available while going quite far to say “no” to its own application.</p>
<p>2X Volatility is not a bitcoin spot ETF, but even still, Grayscale says it went through hell and high water to ensure its application was fully compliant with all SEC laws. As usual, the financial agency was quick to issue a stamp of disapproval on the company’s application form, and Grayscale has now engaged in a <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/could-grayscale-actually-defeat-the-sec-in-court/">lawsuit against the SEC</a>.</p>
<p>One of the crypto company’s lawyers, Donald Verilli, said the SEC broke its own rules to permit the trading of 2X Volatility, thus giving the product an unfair advantage and creating harsher competition for Grayscale. He commented in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fact that the Commission has allowed a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP to begin trading demonstrates that the Commission continues to arbitrarily treat spot bitcoin ETPs differently than bitcoin futures ETPs… While the Commission could theoretically correct its discriminatory treatment of spot bitcoin ETPs by rescinding its approval of all bitcoin ETPs, the Commission&#8217;s apparent willingness to permit even a leveraged bitcoin futures ETP, a particularly high-risk version of a bitcoin futures product, makes clear [it] has no intention of doing so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin ETFs have been all the rage over the past few years, though steam has really picked up in recent months following the introduction of a new bitcoin ETF application <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/blackrock-etf-application-causes-btc-eth-to-surge/">from standard financial</a> firm BlackRock. The company has a solid track record with the SEC, with more than 500 applications approved in the past by the financial agency.</p>
<p>While the SEC was quick to reject BlackRock’s initial documentation, the papers <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sends-blackrock-btc-etf-application-back-for-revisions/">were swiftly revised</a> per the agency’s advice and they’re now awaiting further evaluation.</p>
<p>The Grayscale ETF founder Justin Young threw his two cents into the mix by commenting on the double standards and hypocrisy the SEC appears to exhibit. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think it brings to a lot of people&#8217;s attention the thought that if the SEC has let a leveraged bitcoin-linked product through, why on Earth wouldn&#8217;t they allow spot bitcoin through?</p></blockquote>
<h2>A Stronger Desire for BTC</h2>
<p>On Twitter, Grayscale wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Investors are eager for $BTC exposure with the protections of the ETF wrapper.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many gaming companies out there that have joined hands with <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/blockchain/">blockchain</a> technology as a means of enhancing experiences for many players, but Sega is not (and likely <em>will not</em> be) one of them.</p>
<h2>Sega Doesn&#8217;t Think Much of Blockchain</h2>
<p>Sega, as we all know, is a major competitor to Nintendo and has produced some of the world’s most recognized titles such as the “Sonic the Hedgehog” series, “Golden Axe,” and many others. In several ways, Sega has been ahead of its time and has introduced us to playable characters and stories that much of the population (particularly younger people) still enjoy talking about today.</p>
<p>However, in a recent interview, the company’s co-COO Shuji Utsumi said <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/sega-coo-backs-away-from-blockchain/ar-AA1dHuUB">he doesn’t know</a> what blockchain is good for, and it’s not likely the company will ever utilize the technology or the services that come with it in future product releases. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are trying to figure out what is the best way to entertain the audience. [We are] evaluating, searching, [and] learning.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair, the company is not shutting the door completely on blockchain. It even put out a statement saying that it has some potential. However, there are some issues with it given that several players have said they do not care for the play-to-earn outlets that other gaming companies have offered, and Sega clearly doesn’t want to diminish its returns by disappointing its players. Utsumi said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are very careful because we understand that especially western gamers are not big fans of our web3 initiative.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, Sega is announcing the introduction of what it’s calling a “super game,” which will be brought to the public in the year 2026. There are very few details available about the product, though according to the company, the release is going to be unlike anything any gamer has ever seen or experienced before.</p>
<h2>A Huge Change of Pace?</h2>
<p>However, things are not fully set in stone, and Sega is still not sure if blockchain will be a valid part of the so-called “super game” it plans to establish. This marks a whole change of pace for the game company, as back in 2022, Utsumi said Sega was eagerly “focusing on new areas such as [the] metaverse and web3.” He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sega has invested in several web3 and metaverse startups as part of its open innovation efforts. Through these companies, we are accumulating various know-how, and we are researching every day what we can achieve by combining web3 technology and Sega&#8217;s resources, and what kind of business we can build.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many analyst companies – such as Gartner – feel Sega would be making a mistake by turning its back on blockchain entirely, as the firm still labels gaming as a top arena for metaverses.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Bitcoin Family – run by patriarch Didi Taihuttu, who has been discussed several times on <em>Live Bitcoin News</em> – has made a real name for itself in the crypto community. Six years ago, they sold everything they had and traded <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/didi-taihuttu-and-his-family-are-putting-everything-they-have-into-btc/">everything in for bitcoin</a> so they could enjoy a life of travel and exploring exotic places.</p>
<h2>Didi Taihuttu Has Created a New Way to Predict BTC&#8217;s Price</h2>
<p>Not long ago, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/didi-taihuttu-opens-bitcoin-bar-in-portugal/">the family settled</a> in Lagos, Portugal, which is considered one of the most crypto-friendly places in Europe. Taihuttu is also adding to his bitcoin legacy and influence after having developed a new algorithm that helps him <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-bitcoin-family-has-a-special-algorithm-that-tracks-moon-cycles-and-its-helped-them-gain-50-since-the-bear-market-bottom/ar-AA1dJ3Sk">determine the cycles</a> of the moon, which he believes helps his bitcoin decisions and to determine where the asset’s price will go next.</p>
<p>Discussing his family’s long journey with crypto, Taihuttu said in a recent interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We just need a few thousand per month to live on, so our performance is not really important to us.</p></blockquote>
<p>He and his family enjoy relatively moderate living conditions, though to be fair, they sound relatively luxurious in many ways. For example, Taihuttu resides in a villa on the coast that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean. You can’t exactly say this is “moderate.” Most people in the U.S. would kill to have such a view.</p>
<p>Regarding his new “moon” algorithm, he says he developed it prior to the COVID pandemic, and it has aided all his crypto investing decisions from that day on. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>From mid-November to the start of December 2022, we saw the first signs the bear market was completely over. It was confirmed in January 2023 when the long flag appeared in the model. People should have been buying bitcoin already because every bitcoin you bought at $16K, it&#8217;s at $30K now, so that&#8217;s almost 90 percent upside.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since last year’s bottom, he says his BTC investments are up roughly 50 percent. He also says being in Portugal has really helped his family maintain their wealth and status and keep up appearances in the crypto arena. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>You don&#8217;t pay any capital gains tax or anything else in Portugal on cryptocurrency. [So] long as you don&#8217;t earn cryptocurrency for providing services in Portugal, you&#8217;re in the clear. That&#8217;s a very beautiful bitcoin heaven.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>Taihuttu created the “moon” algorithm because he said there wasn’t much out there that could truly help him the way he wanted. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s not just enough to know which indicators go into a formula. What you can&#8217;t see is the calculus and the code that [are implemented] over the stock conditions. Those calculations [are displayed] in charts… It&#8217;s a combination of Bollinger bands, lower and upper bands, NMA, red/green ribbon, Norm Stoch, RSI, price oscillator, plot, MACD, cross, Chande momentum oscillator, RSI-EMA, full moon, and new moon.</p></blockquote>

<li>Stellar lumen price is struggling below the $0.135 resistance zone against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>XLM price is now trading below $0.130 and the 55 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.131 on the 4-hour chart (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.135 resistance.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Stellar lumen price is trading below $0.135 against the US Dollar, similar to <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-at-risk-below-30k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a>. XLM price could extend losses if it trades below the $0.120 support.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Lumen Price Analysis (XLM to USD)</h2>
<p>After a sharp decline below $0.135, Stellar Lumen price moved into a bearish zone against the US Dollar. The XLM/USD pair traded below the $0.120 level.</p>
<p>There was also a spike below the $0.105 support zone. A low was formed near $0.100 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $0.105 and $0.120 levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1460 swing high to the $0.1000 low.</p>
<p>However, the bears were active near the $0.13 zone. XLM is now trading below $0.130 and the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/stellar-lumen-xlm-price-faces-uphill-task-near-0-145/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">55 simple moving average (4 hours)</a>. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $0.131 on the 4-hour chart.</p>
<p>The next key resistance is seen near the $0.135 level. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1460 swing high to the $0.1000 low. A clear upside break above the $0.135 zone might send the price toward $0.144.</p>
<p>Any more gains could lead the price toward the $0.1525 level. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.124 level. The next major support is near the $0.120 zone.</p>
<p>Any more losses could lead the price toward the $0.1120 level in the near term, below which the price might even retest $0.1050. The next major support is near $0.10.</p>
