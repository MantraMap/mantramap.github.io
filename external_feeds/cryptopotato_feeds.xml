			            <description><![CDATA[The crypto lending platform pleaded guilty to ASIC’s charges, and the regulator considered the plea during sentencing.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has sentenced Melbourne-based cryptocurrency lending firm Helio for falsely claiming it held an Australian credit license (ACL) in August 2019.</p>
<p>According to an official release from the ASIC, Helio was <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-223mr-cryptocurrency-lender-sentenced-for-false-licence-claims/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">sentenced</a> to a non-conviction bond and entered into a recognizance of A$15,000 ($9,600) for 12 months on the condition of good behavior.</p>
<h2>ASIC Sentences Helio</h2>
<p>The Australian securities regulator <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-085mr-cryptocurrency-lender-charged-for-false-australian-credit-licence-claims/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">charged</a> Helio in April 2022, accusing the firm of falsely representing in a news article on its website that it held an ACL, whereas it did not. The lender also <a href="https://www.fundingstrategies.com.au/assets/resources/Helio_Lending_secures_Cash_Flow_Investments__Final_16nov18.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in an investor update that it obtained the license through the acquisition of CashFlow Investments.</p>
<p>However, on both occasions, Helio, which offered crypto-backed loans, was neither an ACL holder nor a representative of an ACL holder, according to the ASIC. The firm’s conduct violated section 30 of the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.</p>
<p>The crypto lender pleaded guilty to ASIC’s charges, and the regulator considered the plea during the sentencing. The Commission withdrew a second charge relating to alleged content on Helio’s website in February 2019 and sentenced the firm under section 19B(1)(d) of the Crimes Act 1914(Cth).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">ASIC Deputy Chair Sarah Court said: “We expect entities and individuals to provide accurate information to their customers and potential customers. Helio falsely claimed that it held an Australian Credit license, misleading their customers to believe that they had the protections afforded by such a license.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>ASIC’s Crackdown on Crypto Firms</h2>
<p>The ASIC has recently initiated a crackdown on several crypto firms. Helio’s sentencing comes just two weeks after the regulator sued crypto-related trading platform eToro over claims that its contract for difference (CFD) product could harm investors.</p>
<p>A CFD is a leveraged derivative product that enables users to speculate on the prices of digital assets. eToro was among the first firms to allow bitcoin trading via CFDs and later added support for other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/australias-financial-regulator-sues-etoro-details/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that the Aussie regulator argued eToro’s CFD products might not have been tested properly before they were introduced to users due to their high risk and volatility.</p>
<p>The agency also estimated that roughly 20,000 eToro customers lost money between October 2021 and June 2023 while trading CFDs.The crypto lending platform pleaded guilty to ASIC’s charges, and the regulator considered the plea during sentencing.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC claims an appeal is justified given the grounds for "difference of opinion" on crypto's relationship with securities law between different courts. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a motion requesting permission to appeal a federal court ruling last month claiming that secondary sales of Ripple’s XRP token are not securities.</p>
<p>The agency argued that there are still “substantial grounds for difference of opinion” regarding how securities laws apply to crypto, making frequent reference to a similar case involving Terraform Labs where the judge ruled differently.</p>
<h2>Ripple Case Not Over?</h2>
<p>The motion, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.893.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filed</a> on Friday, contested two of Judge Analisa Torres‘s rulings last month: one that “Programmatic Sales” of XRP (ex. secondary market sales) did not satisfy Howey, and another that “Other Distributions” (ex. Payments for services) also failed to do so.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are significant grounds for difference of opinion on the correctness of both rulings,” wrote the agency. “Since this Court’s decision, another court in this district explicitly disagreed with the Order’s ruling on the Programmatic Sales.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Shortly after the Ripple ruling, Terraform Labs attempted to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/judge-rejects-terraforms-attempt-to-capitalize-on-ripple-precedent-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">capitalize</a> with a motion to dismiss a similar SEC case against the firm, alleging securities fraud for failing to register its now failed TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin.</p>
<p>District Judge Jed Rakoff rejected the group’s reasoning, however, refusing to distinguish “institutional” and “secondary” market sales in regards to being a security. “Howey makes no such distinction,” he wrote at the time.</p>
<p>The agency referenced numerous prior cases – including its charges against Telegram and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/can-ripple-xrp-lose-against-the-sec-lawyers-debate-following-lbry-lawsuit-judgment/" data-wpel-link="internal">LBRY</a> – as proof that courts have already identified securities act violations when transactions occurred through intermediaries, including through exchanges.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the opinion of the Terraform court, for example, the inquiry turns on what the issuer objectively invites investors to understand, and not on the method of carrying out the transaction,” argued the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>The agency added that the source of purchase for XRP should not affect whether Ripple had established a reasonable expectation of profit for investors – one of the core pillars defining an investment contract.</p>
<h2>Lawyers Give Their Take</h2>
<p>Bitcoin-supportive litigator Joe Carlesare expressed support for the SEC’s appeal on Friday, agreeing that a crypto issuer’s promotions equally impact both direct purchasers and secondary market buyers.</p>
<blockquote><p>“This is the economic reality of the crypto market — where most participants are relying on the team/devs to promote/develop the token,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeCarlasare/status/1692614892790919367" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, XRP supportive lawyer Sandy Seth called the SEC’s position “utterly ridiculous,” given that the agency didn’t appeal Torres’s ruling that XRP itself is a security.</p>
<blockquote><p>“So if XRP is not a security how can sales of XRP be a sales of a security?” he <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoDukeji/status/1692651462264750313" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">asked</a>.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A United States judge has ruled that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can seek assistance from the South Korean government in interviewing Daniel Shin, co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with Do Kwon.</p>
<p>US District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled on Thursday that the SEC is permitted to utilize a procedure outlined in a 1970 treaty that regulates international evidence-gathering requests. Despite denying any misconduct, Kwon did not contest SEC&#8217;s request.</p>
<ul>
<li>As part of the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820843/45/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-terraform-labs-pte-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">motion</a> granted by Judge Rakoff, the SEC also intends to obtain evidence from Chai Corp., the Seoul-based payments company founded by Kwon.</li>
<li>The move is part of the SEC&#8217;s strategy to validate the accusations made in the lawsuit against Terraform and its former CEO.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66820843/45/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-terraform-labs-pte-ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">lawsuit</a>, filed in February by the SEC, accuses TFL and Kwon of orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto asset securities fraud involving the now-defunct algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and other alleged crypto securities.</li>
<li>The relationship between Chai and Terra has been a bone of contention. Several reports have hinted that Kwon may have overstated the extent and duration of the relationship between Terra and the e-commerce system.</li>
<li>The SEC made a startling allegation that Chai Payments did not use the Terraform blockchain to process and settle payments as per the partnership deal of 2019.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Rather, Defendants deceptively replicated Chai payments onto the Terraform blockchain, in order to make it appear that they were occurring on the Terraform blockchain, when, in fact, Chai payments were made through traditional means.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In addition to the SEC lawsuit, Kwon is facing criminal charges in the US as well as in South Korea.</li>
<li>The disgraced exec had previously <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/do-kwon-sorry-for-cocky-tweets-takes-full-responsibility-for-terras-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">stated</a> that the charges leveled against him by the prosecutors of his home country are &#8220;politically motivated.&#8221;</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Ordinals have seen a consistent decline in sales volume and transactions since June, possibly signaling waning interest in Bitcoin NFTs.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">The fervor that surrounded Bitcoin Ordinals seems to have waned, with sales volume dropping more than 97% from its all-time high in May 2023.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, some community members believe Bitcoin Ordinals are not dead, some others state that the earlier hype was a major cause of its crash, arguing that Bitcoin is better off maintaining its primary function as a store of value.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">A 97% Crash Within 3 Months</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin Ordinals have seen a sharp decline in sales volume from its peak of $452 million recorded in May 2023 to $3 million in mid-August, signaling a 97% drop within three months, according to a <a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/ordinals-sales-down-97-since-may-are-bitcoin-nfts-over" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> by DappRadar.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After an impressive performance in May, Bitcoin Ordinals&#8217; sales volume began to nosedive in June, falling 76.5% to $100 million. July did not fare any better, with sales volume further plunging 66.9% to $35 million. Data for August so far shows a 91.4% drop in sales to $3 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Apart from sales volume, transactions have also reduced since May, with the report revealing that transactions have plummeted to 88.1% in August at 20,571, compared to 832,648 three months ago.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there has been a downward trend in the general non-fungible token (NFT) market, Bitcoin Ordinals seem to be the worst hit compared to other blockchains like Ethereum and Polygon, which have long been in the NFT market and enjoy wider applications.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the DaapRadar report, the number of unique active wallets (UAW) rose from 696 in February to 79,261 in May. However, the upswing did not last long, with the current figure at 6,708 in mid-August.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Is Bitcoin Ordinals Dead?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the sharp decline in sales volume and transactions could indicate a waning interest in Bitcoin Ordinals and also poses a question about its sustainability in the NFT sector.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notably, the performance within a short period has led to speculations that Bitcoin Ordinals are dead, with some community members stating that the early hype around them was too big for it to last long.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, some remain bullish and believe it is <a href="https://twitter.com/John_4P3/status/1691313193274978304?t=A8YrCSziblo7oisJZ6cAcw&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">too early</a> to call Bitcoin Ordinals a failure, stating that the project is still in its early stages. Some others, meanwhile, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimHaldorsson/status/1691067832832831488?t=4ZeJ3SoTruobGX2Ihyk90g&amp;s=19" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">argue</a> that Bitcoin and Ethereum are two different blockchains that have different missions and functions, adding that Bitcoin is better off remaining a store of value while Ethereum runs the digital economy.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin in July <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/vitalik-buterin-lauds-bitcoin-ordinals-believes-brc-20-standard-could-revive-stagnancy/" data-wpel-link="internal">praised</a> Bitcoin Ordinals, saying that it helped to bring back the &#8220;culture of actually doing things&#8221; on the network.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Crypto miners are experimenting with high-performance computing, which may be more profitable than mining itself.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As crypto mining firms rapidly expand infrastructure ahead of the 2024 Bitcoin halving, the industry is also branching out into another growing tech frenzy: artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>A report from JP Morgan on Thursday explained how mining businesses are now repurposing their infrastructure to provide high-performance computing services.</p>
<h2>Miners Pivot to AI</h2>
<p>As led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, the analysts wrote that miners are partly funding their <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mining-2-0-crypto-miners-embrace-artificial-intelligence-ai-as-the-new-frontier/" data-wpel-link="internal">shift to AI</a> by selling BTC netted from their mining business.</p>
<p>One miner making the transition is Texas-based firm Applied Digital, which has signed a $460 million deal to host cloud computing in its data center. “As the AI industry continues to grow at unprecedented levels, we continue to see extraordinary demand for our new cloud service as a result,” wrote the company in a press release surrounding the deal in June.</p>
<p>British Columbia-based miner Iris Energy has also <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-miner-iris-energy-expanding-capacity-in-pivot-to-ai/" data-wpel-link="internal">revived plans</a> to host HPC services, given its access to cheap renewable energy and large data center capacity. “Recent discussions with market participants have further validated this previous work and that the time may be right to expand into this sector, utilizing Iris Energy’s four existing operating sites,” the firm said in June.</p>
<p>Yet it isn’t just Bitcoin miners: former Ethereum miners left stranded after the network’s merge upgrade in September may now have a new purpose in the sector.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;With the rapid growth of AI, the increased demand for HPC is now opening a new and perhaps more profitable avenue for utilizing GPUs previously used for Ethereum mining,&#8221; JP Morgan said.</p></blockquote>
<h2>More Profitable Than Mining?</h2>
<p>The analysts claim that several miners have already conducted beta tests for offering HPC services using small portions of their computer fleet. At present, each machine appears to be far more profitable per unit of power consumption than it would otherwise be from mining BTC.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If the profitability reported in beta tests is able to be repeated in a large scale it would overshadow in the future the revenues coming from bitcoin mining at the moment,&#8221; analysts added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Miners aren’t only diversifying by industry, but by geography: analysts say the industry is moving into Russia, where there has been a massive energy surplus since the nation’s war with Ukraine began.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Coupled with a colder climate, Russia is thus able to offer significantly cheaper energy resources to bitcoin miners,&#8221; they said.</p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the crypto market becoming increasingly volatile, two leading altcoins, Cardano ($ADA) and Solana ($SOL), have seen a significant dip in price.</p>
<p>Now that established tokens like these are stumbling, traders are looking for the next breakout star with more evident price prospects.</p>
<p>Amid this shifting market dynamic, some investors are pinning their hopes on Launchpad XYZ ($LPX), believing it could lead the next crypto bull run.</p>
<h2>$ADA Price Crashes Amid Investor Uncertainty</h2>
<p>It’s been a terrible few days for $ADA holders, with the token’s value plunging 17% between Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Although the price has pulled back slightly, $ADA is still hovering around the $0.263 level – the lowest since mid-June.</p>
<p>This drop has left many investors scrambling to reassess their portfolios, questioning the sustainability of Cardano’s previous bullish momentum.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-25.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-267449" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-25.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="285" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-25.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-25-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture1-25-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The sentiment around the token has shifted, with factors ranging from macroeconomic woes to regulatory concerns weighing on the crypto market as a whole.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/#Analytics" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CoinMarketCap</a> show that the number of unique wallet addresses holding $ADA has either stagnated or, in some instances, decreased.</p>
<p>This suggests a slowdown in new user adoption, which can cause concern, given that a growing user base often indicates a healthy ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Bearish Technicals Align to Send Solana Lower</h2>
<p>Likewise, Solana hasn&#8217;t escaped the bearish sentiment, witnessing a 13% drop in its value since Tuesday.</p>
<p>$SOL is now trading around $21.95 – a far cry from July’s high of $32.30.</p>
<p>The token’s price has also broken through the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) in the past few days, indicating strong bearish momentum.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-28.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-267448" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-28.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="285" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-28.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-28-300x142.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture2-28-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Such breaches of significant EMA levels can signal potential longer-term downtrends unless there&#8217;s a considerable reversal soon.</p>
<p>Adding to Solana’s woes, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">data from CoinGecko</a> shows that Solana’s trading volume actually increased in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This suggests that the sell-off is not just a result of passive market movements but rather an active decision by traders to get rid of their $SOL holdings.</p>
<p>If this trend continues, Solana could face further downward pressure in the coming days.</p>
<h2>Rising Star Launchpad XYZ Provides Hope Amid Bear Market as Presale Nears $1.5 Million</h2>
<p>Amid the gloom surrounding established tokens like $ADA and $SOL, the crypto world has set its sights on newer projects – with <a href="https://shrt.care/11df4205?referrer=cardano-solana-prices-tank-amid-bearish-market-but-traders-are-backing-lpx-token-to-hit-1-5-million" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ ($LPX)</a> becoming a focal point.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ presents itself as a beacon of potential amid the bearish sentiment, with the project&#8217;s presale going from strength to strength.</p>
<p>This presale has now raised over $1.3 million in early funding, with prospective investors able to buy $LPX tokens for $0.0445 before they are debuted on exchanges later this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-27.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-267447" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-27.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="344" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-27.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-27-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Picture3-27-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Given its aim to streamline the transition to Web3 for millions globally, Launchpad XYZ&#8217;s unique use cases have garnered significant attention from crypto investors.</p>
<p>As outlined in <a href="https://launchpad.xyz/assets/documents/LaunchpadXYZ_Whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Launchpad XYZ’s whitepaper</a>, the platform will include a super-quick crypto trading terminal, an AI-powered trading assistant called &#8220;Apollo,&#8221; and even various decision-making frameworks for finding the next breakout crypto star.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ will also debut the “Launchpad Quotient” – a ranking system that delivers a simple score for crypto assets showcasing their price potential going forward.</p>
<p>Recently, prominent YouTuber Michael Wrubel uploaded a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZNoNDble3s&amp;pp=ygUNbGF1bmNocGFkIHh5eg%3D%3D" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video praising Launchpad XYZ</a>, stating it “changes everything” in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>With such influential voices backing the project, it’s clear that Launchpad XYZ is poised to make waves in the market soon.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The mass liquidation was contained by the proposal passed by Venus and BNB Chain after the hack last year.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A crypto wallet connected to the October 2022 BNB Chain $600 million exploit has lost roughly $63 million on the decentralized lending platform Venus Protocol due to liquidation that resulted from the massive bloodbath in the market yesterday.</p>
<p>According to a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1692401690526556516?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">tweets</a> by blockchain security firm PeckShield, the exploiter’s wallet was first liquidated of 1.1 million Venus BNB (vBNB) worth around $9.9 million with the asset’s price as $9.4. The second liquidation was approximately 5.6 million vBNB worth $52.3 million.</p>
<h2>BNB Chain Hacker’s Loan Position Liquidated</h2>
<p>During the 2022 BNB Chain hack, the attacker <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-smart-chain-paused-following-600-million-bnb-hack-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">minted</a> two million BNB tokens, using 900,000 to borrow roughly $150 million worth of Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) against Venus. As BNB’s price continued to decline over the past few months, the loan’s health rate deteriorated and raised concerns about cascading effects of the BNB Chain upon liquidation.</p>
<p>To contain the situation, BNB Chain and Venus passed a proposal in November that authorized only the core team to liquidate the exploiter’s position. To that effect, the duo whitelisted a wallet, exclusively permitting it to implement the liquidation in a manner that would prevent a shortfall on Venus and provide additional support during the process.</p>
<p>In June, the wallet was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bnb-chain-to-take-over-venus-protocols-150m-position-as-loan-approaches-liquidation-threshold/" data-wpel-link="internal">funded</a> with $30 million in USDT in preparation for the liquidation as BNB continued to plummet amid legal issues between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and crypto exchange Binance.</p>
<p>As soon as BNB tumbled below $220 alongside other cryptocurrencies, the collateral positions linked to the hacker’s wallet got liquidated, and the 900,000 BNB was sent to Venus. The assets were worth around $196.2 million at writing time, with BNB trading at $218 per CoinMarketCap.</p>
<h2>No Resulting Shortfall on Venus</h2>
<p>The mass liquidation was contained by the proposal passed by Venus and BNB Chain after the hack last year. There was no shortfall on Venus or cascading effects on BNB or the broader market.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Following today’s market movement, the BNB Bridge exploiter account was made healthy as promised by @BNBCHAIN using whitelisted liquidation without any resulting shortfall or further impact to $bnb,” the Venus team <a href="https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1692421277762412586?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">said</a>.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[This week was a bloodbath. Bitcoin is crashing and XRP is leading the altcoin decline.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market is going through hard times. It&#8217;s been a complete disaster for the past seven days, and the worst took place today.</p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price plummeted by a whopping 7.6% in the past 24 hours alone, bringing its total losses to above 11% for the week. The crash also led to a massive wave of liquidations worth over $1 billion in terms of leveraged positions. The volatility wiped off both short and long open interest, and the market is left crumbling.</p>
<p>BTC is far from being the only cryptocurrency that&#8217;s having bad times. In fact, the total market capitalization dropped to below $1.1 billion, losing over $130 million in the past 24 hours alone.</p>
<p>Ethereum is down by 10%, BNB &#8211; by 9.7%, while Ripple&#8217;s XRP crashed by close to 20% in the past seven days. This might also have to do with the fact that the SEC received approval for its request to file an interlocutory appeal. The case between the Commission and Ripple Labs rages on, and there&#8217;s no guessing what might happen in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The rest of the altcoins are all trading in the red for the past 7 days. In fact, out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies, only RUNE and TON are in the green. Everything else has been charting considerable declines ranging between 5% and 25%.</p>
<p>All in all, the market is in shambles, and it&#8217;s interesting to see if the sentiment will reverse at some point or continue this decline.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s some silver lining to all of it, it&#8217;s that BitGo &#8211; a leading cryptocurrency custodian &#8211; raised a whopping $100 million this week. This puts its valuation at just shy of $2 billion, showcasing that there&#8217;s a lot of institutional interest in the space.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The specifics of the exploit have not been disclosed by the DeFi project. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Optimism network-based decentralized credit market Exactly Protocol became the target of exploitation on August 18th. The breach resulted in a significant drop in the platform&#8217;s total value locked (TVL).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Exactly&#8217;s recently-announced native token &#8211; EXA &#8211; slumped by more than 27% over the past day. The protocol was halted temporarily.</p>
<h2>Another DeFi Project Hacked</h2>
<p>Blockchain security firm PechShield was the first to <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1692469871962202522" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">alert</a> Exactly Protocol of the attack and warned users to take necessary actions. Preliminary investigation suggested a loss of 4,300 ETH, equivalent to $7.3 million. However, the latest <a href="https://twitter.com/DeDotFiSecurity/status/1692494879580991528" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">update</a> by De.Fi, a Web3 antivirus platform, revealed that more than 7,160 ETH, worth nearly $12.04 million, has been drained from the protocol.</p>
<p>The security firm also explained that the exploitation strategy appears to involve funding an exploiter contract on Ethereum, transferring deposits to the layer-2 blockchain, Optimism, before ultimately bridging stolen funds back to Ethereum.</p>
<p>Exactly Protocol has not yet confirmed the attack but said it is investigating a security issue, as a result of which the platform has been halted temporarily. Users can still withdraw their assets. Its official <a href="https://twitter.com/ExactlyProtocol/status/1692509323690184966" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a> regarding the same read,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re actively investigating a security issue within our protocol. To ensure user safety, the protocol is temporarily paused (you can still withdraw assets). Our team is on top of this and will share more details asap.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/exactly" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stats</a> by DeFiLlama, the total value locked in Exactly Protocol nosedived from $37 million to $11.74 million following the attack, representing a decline of nearly 70%.</p>
<h2>Rampant Security Attacks on DeFi</h2>
<p>The latest development comes amidst rampant exploitation across the DeFi sector. Solana-based DEX Cypher Protocol was <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cypher-protocol-exploited-will-the-hacker-return-the-funds-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">hacked</a>, where the exploiters netted close to $1 million in crypto-assets earlier this month.</p>
<p>However, more than half of the stolen funds were later <a href="https://twitter.com/cypher_protocol/status/1692266915387814275" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">frozen</a> in collaboration with centralized crypto exchanges as well as private blockchain investigators, while seizure warrants have been issued by law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>But not all exploits have a happy ending. More recently, the DeFi project Zunami Protocol <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/zunami-protocol-exploited-for-over-2-million-native-stablecoin-uzd-plunges-99/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">suffered</a> more than $2 million in losses via price manipulation made possible by donating to the protocol.</p>
