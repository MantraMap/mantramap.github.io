<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, refers to a growing movement in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology that aims to use smart contracts and decentralized networks to create financial products and services that are more accessible, transparent, and secure. This includes everything from lending and borrowing, to trading and investing, to payment processing and insurance.</p>



<p><br>If you&#8217;re new to DeFi, it can be a little overwhelming at first. There are so many different projects, protocols, and platforms to choose from, and it&#8217;s not always clear how they all fit together. In this article, we&#8217;ll go over some of the basics of DeFi and provide some guidance on how to get started.</p>

<h3 class="rank-math-question ">What is DeFi?</h3>
<div class="rank-math-answer ">

<p>At its core, DeFi is about using blockchain technology to enable financial transactions and applications that are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity or organization. </p>
<p>This has several key benefits:</p>
<p><strong>Censorship resistance:</strong> Because DeFi applications are built on top of decentralized networks like Ethereum, they can&#8217;t be shut down or censored by any one party, including governments or financial institutions. This makes them ideal for people in countries where traditional financial services are limited or unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency:</strong> DeFi applications are built on top of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. Because the code is open and transparent, it&#8217;s easy to see exactly how a DeFi application works and what it does with your money.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: DeFi applications are secured by the same cryptographic techniques that protect cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. This makes them resistant to fraud and hacking, and helps to ensure that your money is safe.</p>

<p><br></p>



<h2>Getting Started with DeFi</h2>



<p><br>So, how do you get started with DeFi? Here are a few steps to follow:<br>Learn about the different DeFi projects and protocols: The first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is familiarize yourself with the different DeFi projects and protocols that are out there. This will give you a sense of what&#8217;s possible with DeFi and help you decide which projects and protocols you&#8217;re interested in. Some popular DeFi projects include MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap, while some popular DeFi protocols include Ethereum, EOS, and TRON.</p>



<p><br>Get a wallet: To use DeFi applications, you&#8217;ll need a digital wallet that can hold and manage your cryptocurrency assets. There are many different wallet options to choose from, including hardware wallets like the Ledger Nano S and software wallets like MyEtherWallet and MetaMask. Make sure to do your research and choose a wallet that is secure, user-friendly, and compatible with the DeFi projects and protocols you&#8217;re interested in.</p>



<p><br>Buy some cryptocurrency: To use DeFi applications, you&#8217;ll need to have some cryptocurrency to work with. This usually means buying some Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are the two most popular cryptocurrencies and are widely supported by DeFi applications. There are many different exchanges and platforms you can use to buy cryptocurrency, including Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken. Make sure to do your due diligence and choose a reputable exchange that is secure and has good liquidity.</p>



<p><br>Start experimenting with DeFi applications: Now that you have a wallet and some cryptocurrency, you can start experimenting with DeFi applications. This might mean borrowing or lending money through a platform like Compound, trading cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, or investing in a DeFi project through a yield farming protocol like Harvest Finance.</p>



<p>As you start exploring DeFi, it&#8217;s important to keep a few things in mind:</p>



<p><strong>Understand the risks:</strong> DeFi is still a relatively new and experimental space, and there are many risks to be aware of. This includes the risk of losing your cryptocurrency due to hacks or fraud, the risk of losing money due to market volatility, and the risk of investing in projects that may not succeed. Make sure to do your own research and understand the risks before you invest any money.</p>



<p><strong>Diversify your investments</strong>: To minimize your risk, it&#8217;s generally a good idea to diversify your investments in DeFi. This might mean investing in a variety of different projects and protocols, or using different strategies (like lending, trading, and yield farming) to spread your risk.</p>



<p>Start small and learn as you go: Finally, it&#8217;s a good idea to start small and learn as you go when it comes to DeFi. Don&#8217;t feel like you have to invest a lot of money right away. Instead, start with small amounts and gradually increase your investment as you become more comfortable with DeFi and understand the risks and rewards.</p>



<h2>DeFi Applications</h2>



<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of DeFi, let&#8217;s take a closer look at some of the different applications that are available.</p>



<p><strong>Lending and Borrowing<br></strong>One of the most popular DeFi applications is lending and borrowing. Platforms like Compound, allow you to lend your cryptocurrency to other users in exchange for interest, or borrow cryptocurrency from other users in exchange for collateral. This is a great way to earn passive income with your cryptocurrency or access liquidity when you need it.</p>



<p><strong>Trading and Exchanges<br></strong>Another popular DeFi application is trading and exchanges. Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Curve allow you to trade cryptocurrency directly with other users without the need for a centralized exchange like Binance or Coinbase. This can be a great way to access a wider variety of trading pairs and avoid the fees and restrictions that come with centralized exchanges.</p>



<p><strong>Yield Farming<br></strong>Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, is a popular DeFi strategy that involves providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges or other DeFi protocols in exchange for rewards. By staking your cryptocurrency as collateral, you can earn a share of the fees generated by the protocol and potentially earn a higher return on your investment. Yield farming can be complex and risky, but it can also offer some of the highest returns in DeFi.</p>



<p><strong>Insurance</strong><br>DeFi is also starting to offer insurance products that use smart contracts and decentralized networks to provide more transparent and affordable coverage. For example, Nexus Mutual allows users to buy insurance coverage for smart contract vulnerabilities, while Etherisc offers flight delay insurance that is powered by data from oracles and smart contracts.</p>



<p><strong>Payment Processing<br></strong>Finally, DeFi is also being used to enable faster and cheaper payment processing for both online and offline transactions. Protocols like Lightning Network and Raiden Network use off-chain transactions and smart contracts to enable near-instant payments with low fees, while projects like Flexa and Spedn allow users to pay for goods and services using cryptocurrency at traditional point-of-sale terminals.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>As you can see, DeFi offers a wide range of financial applications that are built on top of decentralized networks and smart contracts. From lending and borrowing, to trading and investing, to payment processing and insurance, DeFi is revolutionizing the way we think about financial services. If you are interested in getting involved in DeFi, the steps to getting started are relatively simple: learn about the different DeFi projects and protocols, get a wallet, buy some cryptocurrency, and start experimenting with DeFi applications.</p>



<p><br>However, it&#8217;s important to remember that DeFi is still a relatively new and experimental space, and there are many risks to be aware of. This includes the risk of losing your cryptocurrency due to hacks or fraud, the risk of losing money due to market volatility, and the risk of investing in projects that may not succeed. Make sure to do your own research, understand the risks, diversify your investments, and start small to minimize your risk and maximize your chances of success.<br>As the DeFi space continues to grow and evolve, it will be interesting to see what new financial applications and innovations emerge. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned investor or a complete newcomer, DeFi offers an exciting opportunity to participate in the decentralized future of finance.</p>

News of the transfer comes amid growing concerns over the crypto exchange’s health and overall solvency.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Justin Sun Moves $100 million from Binance to Huobi</strong></h2>



<p>According to an alert by on-chain analytics firm&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1611335245445623809" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PeckShield</a>, a wallet associated with Justin Sun transferred $100 million worth of stablecoins to Huobi. This includes 50 million USDT and another 50 million USDC. Data from Etherscan shows that the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ddfa8ec3052539b6c9549f12cea2c295cff5296" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wallet</a>&nbsp;also contains $16.5 million worth of USDD, a stablecoin issued by Sun’s Tron DAO Reserve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A user on&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScopeProtocol/status/1611287459723374592?t=g812VcDBfDqgNM0E2sTxFw&amp;s=19" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>&nbsp;pointed out that these funds originated from Just Lend, a lending platform on Tron. The funds were then transferred to Binance and subsequently moved to Huobi, which is rumored to have been acquired by Sun.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Concerns surrounding Huobi’s financial health reached a new high today. The crypto exchange revealed earlier today that it will be laying off 20% of its workforce. Justin Sun, who is also a member of Huobi’s Global Advisory Board, had denied rumors about a mass lay-off earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-huobi-lay-off-20-staff-justin-sun-2023-01-06/" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, employees of Huobi have been asked to take their salaries in stablecoins. &#8220;With the current state of the bear market, a very lean team will be maintained going forward,&#8221; the exchange said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>James Hume, Global Head of Sales at Huobi, addressed the concerns about the exchange. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/james-hume-5193b512b_huobi-security-activity-7017060272271937537-4UZL/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;post, Hume stated that despite the ongoing rumors, internal communications at the Huobi were intact. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“Most if not all the current rumors flying around are either totally false or inaccurate. Our internal communications platform is not down and it&#8217;s business as usual apart from a few layoffs.”</p><cite>Hume stated.</cite></blockquote>

<p>Cathie Wood&#8217;s investment firm, Ark Invest, has demonstrated confidence in Coinbase even as the crypto exchange&#8217;s share price falls. On Thursday, Ark Invest purchased $5.8 million worth of Coinbase shares, with the ARKW fund buying 27,813 shares and the ARKF fund buying 144,463 shares. Coinbase&#8217;s share price closed at $33.53 on Thursday, a drop of 11% from the previous day.</p>



<p>ARK Invest&#8217;s ARKF fund was established in 2019 and invests in the equity securities of companies that Ark believes are using technology to transform financial services and economic transactions. Coinbase is a major holding in the fund, representing 7.7% of its total assets. The ARKW fund, which was launched in 2014, focuses on equities of companies relevant to Ark&#8217;s investment theme of the next generation internet. As of January 5th, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Coinbase were among the top 10 holdings of the ARKW fund, representing 5.4% and 4.8% of its total assets, respectively.</p>



<p>Ark&#8217;s latest purchases of Coinbase stock mark a bullish move by the company, as Ark has previously been active in buying dips in the market. In November 2022, Ark invested $12.1 million in Coinbase shares despite market turmoil caused by the FTX collapse. As of late November, Ark&#8217;s total stake in Coinbase reached almost 8.7 million shares, approaching all-time highs.</p>

<p>Fidelity, an investment firm, has recorded a significant reduction in the value of its initial investment in Twitter after supporting Elon Musk&#8217;s acquisition of the social media platform. The Fidelity Blue Chip Growth Fund reported in November 2022 that the carrying value of the Twitter investment had been decreased by more than 50%. </p>



<p>This is known as a write-down, which occurs when an asset&#8217;s market value falls below its recorded book value on a company&#8217;s balance sheet. Fidelity&#8217;s initial stake in Twitter, valued at $19.66 million in October 2022, has now been reduced to $8.63 million. It is reported that Fidelity provided $316 million to assist Elon Musk&#8217;s bid to acquire Twitter in October 2022.</p>



<p>Fidelity has held its Twitter investments through X Holdings I Inc., a holding company utilized by Musk in his bid to acquire Twitter. The controversial takeover, which has been marked by layoffs and significant changes at the social media company, has prompted speculation that other investment firms may also reduce the value of their Twitter holdings.</p>

The exchange, which has advocated for widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, believes that Twitter can contribute to making crypto more accessible. According to Bloomberg, Elon Musk has completed the acquisition of Twitter and is reportedly planning to lift lifetime bans on the platform and implement new changes to make it a global social hub.</p>

Gox Repayment Deadlines Postponed Till September 2023 13">
<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>The defunct exchange received court permission to extend repayment deadlines by two months each.</li><li>The latest update will allow users to complete &#8220;Selection and Registration&#8221; until March 10.</li><li>Repayment Deadline, Early Lump-Sum Repayment Deadline, and Intermediate Repayment Deadlines were extended to September 30 as well. </li></ul>



<p>Defunct Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox extended creditor registration and repayment deadlines by two months each after receiving court permission. The Rehabilitation Trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi shared details on the extension in a January 6 announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Kobayashi’s update, creditors will have until March 10 to complete the ‘Selection of Repayment Method’. The extension also applies to ‘Registration of Payee Infomation’. This means that creditors will have two extra months to pick their preferred platforms for repayment. The previous deadline was reportedly set for January 10.</p>



<p>The Rehabilitation Trustee reiterated that the repayment structures include early lump-sum repayment, repayment for a portion of cryptocurrency rehabilitation claims in cryptocurrency, repayment by Bank Remittance, and repayment by remittance through a fund transfer service provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creditors were also advised to meet the new ‘Selection and Registration’ deadline or risk having to submit documents at the Mt. Gox head office in Japan. </p>



<p>Additionally, September 30 will serve as the new deadline for base repayment, early lump-sum repayment, and intermediate repayment. The Rehabilitation Trustee secured a court order to push back the deadline from its previous July 31 date,&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Having obtained the permission of the court, the Rehabilitation Trustee has also changed the Base Repayment Deadline, Early Lump-Sum Repayment Deadline, and Intermediate Repayment Deadline from July 31, 2023 (Japan time) to September 30, 2023 (Japan time) following the change of the deadline for the Selection and Registration.</p></blockquote>



<h2>Mt. Gox Bitcoin Hack </h2>



<p>Mt. Gox was once one of the largest Bitcoin trading venues of its time, handling approximately 70% of all BTC transactions at the peak of its dominance. All that changed in February 2014 after a hacker <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/03/09/hackers-hit-mt-gox-exchanges-ceo-claim-to-publish-evidence-of-fraud/" rel="noopener">stole</a> over 750,000 Bitcoin valued at roughly $400 million at the time.</p>



<p>The official report said the hacker(s) <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/mtgox-bitcoin-repayment-plan-delayed/">drained</a> Mt. Gox after stealing access credentials from an auditor. Creditors hope to recover some 100,000 BTC from the repayment process. </p>

<p>A software vulnerability that could have potentially resulted in the theft of up to $200 million from three Ethereum-compatible parachains on the Polkadot network (Moonbeam, Astar Network and Acala) was discovered by a security researcher known as pwning.eth according to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/199718/immunefi-researcher-saves-200-million-from-potential-theft-on-three-polkadot-parachains?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theblock.co/post/199718/immunefi-researcher-saves-200-million-from-potential-theft-on-three-polkadot-parachains?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>. The vulnerability was found in June in Frontier, a software used for &#8220;wrapping&#8221; native tokens on the three blockchain projects, also known as parachains, on the Polkadot network. Pwning.eth reported the critical vulnerability on Immunefi, a crypto-focused bug-hunting platform, on June 27, but the report was only recently made public.</p>



<p>According to a representative from Immunefi speaking to <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/199718/immunefi-researcher-saves-200-million-from-potential-theft-on-three-polkadot-parachains?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.theblock.co/post/199718/immunefi-researcher-saves-200-million-from-potential-theft-on-three-polkadot-parachains?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" rel="nofollow noopener">The Block</a>, pwning.eth discovered a bug that could have had a significant impact on the entire Polkadot ecosystem and potentially allowed hackers to steal over $200 million across Moonbeam, Astar Network, and Acala. The representative added that all three were vulnerable to a bug that could have permitted malicious users to mint wrapped native tokens.</p>



<p>In crypto, &#8220;wrapping&#8221; refers to the process of converting the native crypto assets of a blockchain into tokens that can be more readily supported by apps. This is typically done through the use of a smart contract, which holds the native tokens in escrow and issues the wrapped tokens to the user. Wrapped tokens are essentially a representation of the native tokens, but they can be more easily traded and used on other platforms that may not natively support the original asset. Wrapping tokens can be useful for increasing the liquidity and usability of certain assets, but it also introduces additional risks, such as the possibility of smart contract vulnerabilities.</p>



<p>Immunefi estimated that the value of assets exposed to the vulnerability was around $200 million across the three parachains. The teams behind the three parachains worked to fix the issue and released an emergency patch before any malicious actors could exploit it, and as a result, no funds were lost. </p>



<p>Moonbeam and Astar, which have active bug-bounty programs with Immunefi, awarded pwning.eth a $1 million bounty through the platform. In addition, Parity, the developer of the Frontier Library, decided to contribute $250,000 towards the $1 million reward, despite not having a bug bounty with Immunefi. Pwning.eth has previously been rewarded for finding critical bugs in the past, such as in early 2022 when the white-hat hacker received a $6 million bounty for discovering a vulnerability in Aurora, an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible blockchain for NEAR Protocol, which saved approximately 70,000 ETH worth $210 million at the time.</p>

<ul><li>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a financial system built on top of blockchain technology that allows for financial services without traditional intermediaries</li><li>DeFi is open, transparent, and secure, and offers greater financial inclusion and potentially more efficient and cost-effective services</li><li>Potential drawbacks include complexity, lack of regulation, risk of losses, risk of hacking, and limited adoption</li><li>DeFi tools competing with traditional finance include lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, stablecoins, and payment platforms</li></ul>



<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a financial system that is built on top of blockchain technology. It allows people to access financial services without the need for traditional financial intermediaries, such as banks.</p>



<p>One of the main benefits of DeFi is that it is open and accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This is especially important in countries where access to traditional financial services is limited. With DeFi, people can easily send and receive money, borrow and lend money, and trade financial assets without having to go through a bank or other financial institution.</p>



<p>Another benefit of DeFi is that it is built on top of blockchain technology, which means that it is transparent and secure. Transactions on the blockchain are recorded on a public ledger, which means that anyone can see what is happening. This helps to reduce the risk of fraud and other types of financial crimes.</p>



<p>DeFi also allows for greater financial inclusion, as it enables people to access financial services that may not be available to them through traditional financial institutions. For example, DeFi platforms may offer loans to people with poor credit scores, or they may allow people to trade financial assets that are not typically available through traditional exchanges.</p>



<p>In addition, DeFi has the potential to make financial services more efficient and cost-effective. Because it is built on top of blockchain technology, DeFi can process transactions faster and at a lower cost than traditional financial institutions. This can help to reduce the fees that people have to pay when they access financial services.</p>



<p>Overall, DeFi offers a number of benefits over traditional financial systems. It is open and accessible to anyone, transparent and secure, and has the potential to make financial services more efficient and cost-effective. As the technology continues to develop, it is likely that DeFi will play an increasingly important role in the global financial system.</p>



<h2>What are the Drawbacks of Defi?</h2>



<ol><li>Complexity: DeFi can be complex and difficult to understand, especially for those who are not familiar with blockchain technology. This can make it challenging for people to use DeFi platforms and services.</li><li>Lack of regulation: Because DeFi is decentralized and not controlled by a single entity, it is not subject to the same level of regulation as traditional financial systems. This can make some people hesitant to use DeFi platforms, as they may be concerned about the lack of oversight.</li><li>Risk of losses: As with any financial system, there is a risk of losses when using DeFi. For example, if you lend money through a DeFi platform and the borrower defaults on the loan, you may lose the money you lent.</li><li>Risk of hacking: DeFi platforms are built on top of blockchain technology, which is generally considered to be secure. However, there have been instances where DeFi platforms have been hacked and funds have been stolen. This can be a concern for people who use DeFi platforms.</li><li>Limited adoption: DeFi is still a relatively new field and it is not yet widely adopted. This can make it difficult for people to find others to trade with or borrow from.</li></ol>



<h2>DeFi Compared to Traditional Finance</h2>



<p>Overall, while DeFi offers many potential benefits, it is important to carefully consider the potential drawbacks before using DeFi platforms and services. It may be helpful to do your own research and seek out the advice of financial professionals before making any decision.</p>



<p>Lending platforms: DeFi lending platforms, allow people to lend and borrow money using cryptocurrencies as collateral. These platforms offer an alternative to traditional lending institutions, such as banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Decentralized exchanges (DEXs): DEXs, such as <a href="https://uniswap.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uniswap.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Uniswap </a>and Kyber Network, allow people to trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets in a decentralized manner. This means that the exchange is not controlled by a single entity, and trades are facilitated through smart contracts on the blockchain. DEXs offer an alternative to traditional centralized exchanges, such as Coinbase and Binance.</p>



<p>Stablecoins: Stablecoins, such as Tether and USDC, are digital assets that are pegged to the value of a real-world asset, such as the US dollar. They can be used as a way to store value and make transactions in a stable manner, as the value of the stablecoin is less likely to fluctuate compared to other cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins offer an alternative to traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar and the euro.</p>



<p>Payment platforms: DeFi payment platforms, such as Alipay and PayPal, allow people to make and receive payments using cryptocurrencies. These platforms offer an alternative to traditional payment methods, such as credit cards and bank transfers.</p>



<p>Overall, DeFi tools are beginning to compete with traditional finance tools in a number of areas. As the DeFi space continues to grow and evolve, it is likely that more and more DeFi tools will emerge to challenge traditional financial services.</p>

<ul><li>Liquidators of Three Arrows Capital have demanded key documents from the firm’s founders.</li><li>The subpoena was delivered over Twitter through the liquidator’s official Twitter handle.&nbsp;</li><li>The liquidators have alleged that both Su Zhu and Kyle Davies have not been cooperating.&nbsp;</li><li>The founders have been vocal on Twitter about their firm’s relationship with FTX and the Digital Currency Group.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>In a strange turn of events, the liquidators of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) have resorted to a rather unconventional avenue to subpoena the founders of the defunct crypto hedge fund. Teneo, the advisory firm appointed by a British Virgin Islands court to oversee 3AC’s liquidation, has delivered a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/3ACLiq/status/1611018579532742657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1611018579532742657%7Ctwgr%5E3f560200887619e2dcef4b5125db73d777405e83%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fthree-arrows-capital-founders-subpoenaed-on-twitter" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subpoena</a>&nbsp;to Kyle Davies and Su Zhu over Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Liquidators demand information from Three Arrows Capital founders</strong></h2>



<p>The Twitter handle named 3ACLiquidation, which is the official account for the court-appointed joint liquidators of the defunct crypto hedge fund, tweeted the subpoena earlier today. The subpoena requires 3AC founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu to turn over sensitive documents related to the downfall of Three Arrows Capital.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per a report by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/three-arrows-capital-liquidators-demand-documents-via-twitter-1.1866228" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Teneo is diligently advancing the liquidation process for 3AC. “The founders have unfortunately resisted cooperating in these efforts, and as such, we have received authority from courts in both the US and Singapore to serve them targeted and comprehensive discovery demands through email and their frequently-used Twitter accounts”, a spokesperson for Teneo stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The liquidators are seeking key information related to Three Arrows Capital’s liquidation process, including account information, private keys for the crypto hedge fund’s digital and fiat assets, details pertaining to securities and unregistered shares, seed phrases, and information on accounts held on centralized as well as decentralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both founders have been active on Twitter over the past few months. The bulk of their content focuses on blaming other firms for the downfall of The Arrows Capital. Earlier this week,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/zhusu/status/1610093549651136512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1610093549651136512%7Ctwgr%5E8203793179c240afb6d7e930ae3c520f7b5b04da%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbeincrypto.com%2F3ac-co-founder-su-zhu-alleges-dcg-ftx-conspired-attack-luna-steth%2F" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Su Zhu</a>&nbsp;took to social media to blame the Digital Currency Group for conspiring with bankrupt crypto exchange FTX to launch an attack against LUNA and stETH. In November 2022,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/kyleldavies/status/1591704190900109312" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyle Davies</a>&nbsp;alleged that Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried’s quantitative trading firm, had “hunted” 3AC’s positions before Terra’s collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teneo has been trying to deliver subpoenas to Three Arrows Capital’s founders since as early as October 2022. The firm had&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/three-arrows-capital-founders-to-subpoenas-on-twitter-bloomberg/" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a>&nbsp;a U.S. judge for permission to serve both the founders with subpoenas through their Twitter accounts as well as their email addresses. The liquidators resorted to this measure following futile attempts to serve said subpoenas through conventional methods.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Attorney General Letitia James accused former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky of leading investors &#8220;down a path of financial ruin&#8221;.</li><li>James&#8217; lawsuit seeks to ban Mashinsky from doing business in New York and secure restitution for aggrieved customers.</li><li>Mashinsky stepped down as CEO in September 2022 amid over $1.2 billion in bankruptcy claims from creditors. </li></ul>



<p>Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky is being sued for fraud by New York Attorney General Letitia James. According to Attorney General James’ lawsuit filed on Thursday, Mashinsky “promised to lead investors to financial freedom but led them down a path of financial ruin”.</p>



<p>The Crypto lender declared bankruptcy in July 2022 shortly after TerraUSD (UST) and Terra Luna (LUNA) imploded, plummeting digital asset prices and wiping out over $40 billion from the crypto market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mashinsky later <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-network-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-network-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped</a> down as CEO of the company amid reports of massive withdrawals from Celsius custodial wallets by Mashinsky himself and other top-ranking executives. </p>



<p>Attorney General James argued that Mashinsky continued to bait investors into depositing billions in crypto assets despite the company losing millions of dollars in risky investment strategies. Per Thursday’s <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-sues-former-ceo-celsius-cryptocurrency-platform-defrauding" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filing</a>, James said Mashinsky failed to register as a securities and commodities dealer. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The law is clear that making false and unsubstantiated promises and misleading investors is illegal. Today, we are taking action on behalf of thousands of New Yorkers who were defrauded by Mr. Mashinsky to recoup their losses. My office will stay vigilant and ensure that bad actors trying to take advantage of New York investors are held accountable.</p><cite>&#8211; Attorney General Letitia James</cite></blockquote>

<p>The lawsuit against Mashinsky seeks to ban the Celsius founder from conducting business in New York. Attorney General James’s lawsuit is also after damages, disgorgement, and restitution.</p>



<h2>$4.2 Billion In Earn Accounts Belongs To Celsius, Not Investors</h2>



<p>Judge Martin Glenn ruled that $4.2 billion in crypto assets deposited to Celsius yielding bearing accounts belongs to the bankrupt crypto lender. The ruling means that some 600,000 account holders in Celsius’ earn program must wait until bankruptcy proceedings play out which could take months or years.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>The Court concludes, based on Celsius’s unambiguous Terms of Use, and subject to any reserved defenses, that when the cryptocurrency assets (including stablecoins, discussed in detail below) were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius’s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates (the “Estates”).</p></blockquote>



<p>The beleaguered crypto lender is expected to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/celsius-extend-bankruptcy-reorganization/">submit</a> a restructuring plan to the bankruptcy court by February 15, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
