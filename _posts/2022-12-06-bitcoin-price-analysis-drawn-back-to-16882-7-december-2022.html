<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) continued to trade closely to the 16882 area early in the Asian session as the pair encountered technical resistance around the 17102 level, right around the 50-hour simple moving average.&nbsp; Traders had previously pushed BTC/USD lower to the 16865 level, representing another test of the 16882 area that represents a downside price objective related to selling pressure that commenced around the 52100 area.&nbsp; &nbsp;If BTC/USD is able to extend its upward trajectory, upside areas of potential technical resistance and selling pressure include the 17791, 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp; If recent upside momentum reverses, traders may test recent two-year lows around the 15460 level established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area, a previous relative low that represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.
