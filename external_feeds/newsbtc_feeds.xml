					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu (SHIB) coins have been creating a buzz in the cryptocurrency market, particularly with the recent surge in popularity of meme coins. However, the popular meme-inspired token has experienced a downtrend in its price recently, leaving investors wondering about its future prospects.  With the uncertainty surrounding SHIB coins, the question on many investors&#8217; minds is whether now is the right time to invest in this cryptocurrency. Let’s explore the potential of Shiba Inu coins and whether now is the right time to jump on board.

Amid the volatility of the cryptocurrency market, Shiba Inu coins continue to make headlines. As of the latest update on CoinGecko, the price of SHIB stands at $0.000008896, down 1.19% over the last 24 hours. However, the coin has experienced an 11.56% slump in the past seven days, reminding us of the unpredictable nature of the market.

This has raised concerns among investors regarding whether the token is still a viable investment option. Positive Signs Amid A Turbulent Market For The Meme Coin In the wake of the recent downward spiral of the Shiba Inu token, there are still some positive indicators that investors should take note of. According to a report by IntoTheBlock, large holders are showing a high level of buying activity amidst the current market turbulence. The report shows there has been a significant increase in net inflow from large holders since Sunday. The data shows that the net inflow has risen by 1.35 trillion SHIB, indicating that investors who hold more than 0.1% of the coin are actively accumulating the token.

					<description><![CDATA[According to CryptoQuant&#8217;s data on May 10, Bitcoin reserves in centralized exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase experienced a significant decline in Q4 2022. The reserves remained stable in April despite the prices soaring from $20,000 to $31,000 during that period. Exchange Bitcoin Reserves Rapidly Shrinking Bitcoin exchange &#8220;reserves&#8221; is a metric that tracks the amount of BTC held by centralized exchanges at any given time. Typically, the interaction between coin holders and exchanges can be used to gauge sentiment and their price expectation of the coin shortly.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply Is Moving From American Holders To Asian Wallets: Glassnode An example of reserves falling is when there is a sudden outflow from exchanges. This could indicate that users are optimistic and store their assets in non-custodial wallets. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this may not always be the reason for outflows. They can also be caused by fundamental factors such as hacks or regulatory concerns &#8211; as seen recently with Binance. Conversely, Bitcoin inflow to exchanges may drive the ramp&#8217;s reserves higher. Even so, this is interpreted as bearish since holders might quickly liquidate their assets for cash or stablecoins. With Bitcoin reserves across centralized exchanges falling, it could mean traders expect prices to rise shortly. In Q4 2022, the total Bitcoin exchange reserve in all tracked ramps fell sharply, especially in November 2022. This coincided with the collapse of FTX and questions emerging about the stability of Binance and other centralized exchanges. Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, led other platforms in publishing proof-of-reserve statements to assuage fears and re-instill confidence. Though reserves have stabilized, there was a marked drop in late March 2023.  Then, the bank run at Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and the closure of Signature Bank, banks that served crypto projects, including Circle, the issuer of USDC, appeared to have triggered coin outflows. From March 20 to early April, the Bitcoin exchange reserve fell from around 2.2 million to 2.1 million. Will BTC Rally? The general trend of Bitcoin exchange reserves remains negative, and prices are relatively firm, trading below $31,000. While this correlation between rising prices and falling exchange reserves is still valid, whether regulatory actions against crypto exchanges may cause a divergence is yet to be seen. Binance is reportedly being investigated by several United States agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The CFTC alleges that Binance, the world&#8217;s largest exchange, flouted trading laws in the country. Still, whether charges will be brought forward is being determined when writing.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Slides 5% From Recent Highs Amidst Binance CFTC Probe Revelation Any official charge might dent users&#8217; confidence in the exchange, possibly triggering more outflows and lowering BTC reserves.

					<description><![CDATA[Marathon Digital Holdings Inc, a crypto mining company, recently announced its partnership with digital assets firm Zero Two.  This announcement marks a major milestone in Marathon Digital&#8217;s plan for global expansion. The creation of the &#8220;Abu Dhabi Global Markets JV Entity&#8221; will involve joint ownership between both companies, with Zero Two holding 80% ownership and Marathon Digital holding 20%. Related Reading: Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall Marathon plans to capitalize on the advantageous climate and energy costs in Abu Dhabi while forging valuable partnerships through its expansion efforts. Marathon Digital Expands Into The Middle East The newly formed joint venture with Zero Two will develop and operate two digital mining sites with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts. The sites will be located at two different places in Abu Dhabi. The larger 200MW site will be located at a feasible hub in Masdar City. The second site of 50MW will be located in the port zone of Mina Zayed, Abu Dhabi. Marathon and Zero Two anticipate leveraging the excess energy in Abu Dhabi to power the sites. According to the firms, this approach will increase the base load and sustainability of the Abu Dhabi power grid.  In the past, the two firms ran a trial project to see if Abu Dhabi, where the desert temperature has historically made air-cooled digital asset mining unattainable, might be a viable location for a large-scale operation. As such, Marathon Digital and Zero Two developed a custom-built immersion solution that’ll cool the ASIC miners and also developed the right mining software. Notably, the infrastructure and mining equipment needed has already been requested, and construction is underway.

According to the current construction timelines, both sites might be operational by 2024, with a total hash rate of about 7 EH/s. The news of the mining operation surfaced as executives from Coinbase visited the UAE to assess the region&#8217;s potential as a &#8220;strategic hub&#8221; for its global operations. The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, spoke at the Dubai FinTech Summit and met decision-makers in UAE. Several U.S.-based crypto companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, are considering relocating their operations abroad due to the unfavorable regulatory environment in the United States. The UAE appears to be a favorable jurisdiction for crypto companies seeking a more welcoming regulatory climate. Marathon Digital&#8217;s Crypto Mining Operations Might Boost Local Economies The latest advancement in immersion technology, coupled with the expertise of those involved, will be a significant benefit to the companies involved and the local economy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marathon Digital Holdings Inc, a crypto mining company, recently announced its partnership with digital assets firm Zero Two. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1312/marathon-digital-holdings-and-zero-two-to-develop-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement</a> marks a major milestone in Marathon Digital&#8217;s plan for global expansion. The creation of the &#8220;Abu Dhabi Global Markets JV Entity&#8221; will involve joint ownership between both companies, with Zero Two holding 80% ownership and Marathon Digital holding 20%.</p>

<p>Marathon plans to capitalize on the advantageous climate and energy costs in Abu Dhabi while forging valuable partnerships through its expansion efforts.</p>
<h2>Marathon Digital Expands Into The Middle East</h2>
<p>The newly formed joint venture with Zero Two will develop and operate two digital mining sites with a combined capacity of 250 megawatts. </p>
<p>The sites will be located at two different places in Abu Dhabi. The larger 200MW site will be located at a feasible hub in Masdar City. The second site of 50MW will be located in the port zone of Mina Zayed, Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Marathon and Zero Two anticipate leveraging the excess energy in Abu Dhabi to power the sites. According to the firms, this approach will increase the base load and sustainability of the Abu Dhabi power grid. </p>
<p>In the past, the two firms ran a trial project to see if Abu Dhabi, where the desert temperature has historically made air-cooled digital asset mining unattainable, might be a viable location for a large-scale operation.</p>
<p>As such, Marathon Digital and Zero Two developed a custom-built immersion solution that’ll cool the ASIC miners and also developed the right mining software. Notably, the infrastructure and mining equipment needed has already been requested, and construction is underway.</p>

<p>These mining sites are <a href="https://ir.marathondh.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1312/marathon-digital-holdings-and-zero-two-to-develop-and" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">projected</a> to be among the most technologically advanced and energy-efficient mining hubs globally. According to the current construction timelines, both sites might be operational by 2024, with a total hash rate of about 7 EH/s.</p>

<p>The news of the mining operation surfaced as executives from Coinbase visited the UAE to assess the region&#8217;s potential as a &#8220;strategic hub&#8221; for its global operations. The CEO of Coinbase, Brian Armstrong, <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/the-uae-recognising-the-transformative-potential-of-the-cryptoeconomy" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke</a> at the Dubai FinTech Summit and met decision-makers in UAE.</p>
<p>Several U.S.-based crypto companies, including Coinbase and Ripple, are considering relocating their operations abroad due to the unfavorable regulatory environment in the United States. The UAE appears to be a favorable jurisdiction for crypto companies seeking a more welcoming regulatory climate.</p>
Marathon Digital&#8217;s Crypto Mining Operations Might Boost Local Economies
<p>The latest advancement in immersion technology, coupled with the expertise of those involved, will be a significant benefit to the companies involved and the local economy.</p>
<p>As Marathon partners with local businesses, it can create new job opportunities and enhance economic growth in the region. With immersion technology, the firm can help minimize the worries about the negative effect of cryptocurrency mining.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Arbitrum (ARB), one of the recently launched Ethereum-based Layer 2 scaling solutions, has seen a surge in its price by almost 10% in the past 24 hours. The surge comes when the global crypto market seems to be in an upward trend. However, the Arbiturm spike can be tied to a different factor. The recent increase in ARB&#8217;s value can be linked to the protocol&#8217;s announcement about how it plans to manage the fees generated on its platform. Arbitrum Update On DAO Revenue In the Twitter announcement posted earlier today, the Arbitrum team noted it is &#8220;the only rollup that sends all surplus revenue generated by transaction fees to their respective DAO. It is time for the DAO to collect the funds so far.&#8221; Related Reading: Arbitrum Soars 44% To Record Highs As Whales Splash Millions On ARB Tokens Notably, the Arbitrum protocol allows users to transact on the platform with reduced transaction fees and faster speeds than the Ethereum network. The protocol requires users to pay a fee when transacting on the network.  The fee paid is split into two sections, including Layer 1 (L1) fees for covering transactions on Ethereum and L2 fees for Arbitrum fees. As per the protocol&#8217;s mechanism, surplus tokens are generated by the fees and are accumulated before being sent to the DAO. The DAO revenue mechanism on Arbitrum now enables token holders to reap the rewards of accumulated surplus fees. When the organization collects the tokens, members of the Arbitrum community DAO will receive their share of the fees. This substantial increase in benefits has contributed to the current surge in the token&#8217;s value and the value of becoming its long-term holder. It is worth noting that the distribution of rewards resulting from this development will benefit members of the Arbitrum community DAO, which could lead to a significant increase in demand for ARB as users aim to capitalize on the opportunity to earn rewards. ARB Surges Nearly 10% Following the DAO revenue mechanism announcement, the price of ARB has recorded a bullish uptick, up by 8.7%, with a trading price of $1.19 at the time of writing. The assets have also seen a surge in its market cap, surging by over $100 million in the past 24 hours. Despite the surge, Arbitrum has fallen from its previous rank of #32 among the global crypto market to ranking #38. However, according to the activity in its trading volume, the token might soon be quick to reclaim its spot. CoinMarketCap data shows Arbitrum’s trading volume hasn’t moved much in the past 24 hours. Instead, it has only continued to range between $300 million and $400 million, indicating a possible accumulation.  Related Reading: Bullish Momentum Expected For ARB As Arbitrum Completes DAO Airdrop Notably, the DAO revenue mechanism incentivizes platform users to hold ARB tokens, and it could increase the demand for ARB. This, in turn, will benefit the protocol and its users as it increases the network&#8217;s value and liquidity. Featured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Chief Legal Officer of Coinbase, Paul Grewal, spoke to lawyer John Deaton, host for the Twitter-based podcast CryptoLaw, regarding the exchange&#8217;s decision to continue offering Algorand (ALGO).  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier classified Algorand as a security in its charges against the Bittrex crypto exchange. Related Reading: PEPE Token Futures Cast Gloom For Investors As Prices Plummet By 45% Notably, Coinbase delisted XRP based on regulatory scrutiny in 2021. But it has yet to do the same with ALGO, even as the cryptocurrency faces a similar issue. Paul Grewal Explains Coinbase Position On Algorand In his interview, John Deaton discussed the confusion among XRP&#8217;s community regarding Coinbase&#8217;s approach to making and reviewing listing decisions.  Paul Grewal stated that secondary sales of assets do not make them securities. However, Deaton believes that the same argument regarding secondary sales applies to XRP tokens.  According to Deaton, XRP&#8217;s suspension from trading on Coinbase was due to the argument that the token is a security under U.S. law.  However, Coinbase still offers ALGO to traders, frustrating XRP holders who feel penalized. In response, Grewal reiterated Coinbase’s commitment to upholding the rule of law equally for everyone. He sympathized with the plight of XRP holders who believe that a double standard applies to various situations.  Further, Grewal states that laws and circumstances changed and referred to Coinbase&#8217;s amicus brief supporting Ripple in November 2022. He believes crypto exchanges and projects must &#8220;team up to withstand a solid adversary,&#8221; the U.S. SEC.  According to Grewal, the SEC is not &#8220;above mistakes&#8221; in interpreting the law, and the recent enforcements from the body are politically motivated.  Teamwork Necessary Moving Forward These remarks come after a meeting between Paul Grewal and Ripple’s General Counsel, Stuart Alderoty. John Deaton remarked that the meeting showed two great General Counsels leading the front line in the battle to improve crypto regulation in the United States.  Two great GCs leading the front line in battle.

					<description><![CDATA[Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin, USDT, has published its Q1 2023 Assurance Report, attested to by BDO Italia, a top five-ranked global independent public accounting firm. The report re-affirms the accuracy of Tether&#8217;s Consolidated Reserves Report (CRR), which details the assets held by the group as of March 31, 2023. The CRR includes additional categories for the first time, including physical gold, overnight repo, corporate bonds, and Bitcoin ownership, which aim to increase transparency into Tether&#8217;s reserves reporting. Furthermore, the report reveals an increase in Tether&#8217;s excess reserves, reaching an all-time high of $2.44 billion, up from $1.48 billion in the previous quarter. Related Reading: Should You Worry About Bitcoin Withdrawals On Exchanges? New Data Sheds Light Tether Q1 Net Income Surpasses Blackrock, Leading Hedge Fund Manager The recently released Q1 2023 Assurance Report highlights the stablecoin&#8217;s impressive performance in the year&#8217;s first quarter. The report shows that Tether&#8217;s net profit for the quarter was a staggering $1.48 billion, contributing significantly to strengthening its reserves. Moreover, the report reveals that the token in circulation increased by 20% during the quarter, indicating the high trust that Tether&#8217;s customers have in the stablecoin.  In addition, the company ended the first quarter of 2023 with consolidated total assets of $81.8 billion, with most of its reserves invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Tether is also taking steps to reduce its reliance on pure bank deposits as a source of liquidity. It utilizes the repo market as an additional measure to ensure a higher protection standard for its users by maintaining the necessary liquidity. The report demonstrates Tether&#8217;s commitment to transparency, with most of its investments being held in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits (approximately 85%).  It also highlights a 25% reduction in secured loans from 8.7% to 6.5% of this asset class within the overall reserves and the highest percentage of assets allocated in US Treasury Bills to date. Gold and Bitcoin represent 4% and 2% of the total reserves, respectively. All new issuance of tokens has been invested in US Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo. Last but not least, Tether has outperformed BlackRock, one of the world&#8217;s leading providers of investment, advisory, and risk management solutions, in terms of net income in Q1 of 2023. While BlackRock reported a net income of $1.16 billion for the quarter, Tether reported a net income of $1.48 billion, highlighting the confidence investors had in the stablecoin issuer and the crypto market as a whole. Cementing Its Position As Leading Stablecoin Tether’s report reveals that its consolidated total liabilities amount to $79.4 billion, of which $79.3 billion relates to digital tokens issued. Despite this, the group&#8217;s consolidated assets exceed its consolidated liabilities, demonstrating the strength and stability of the platform. Tether&#8217;s success in Q1 2023 is evident, with its reserves&#8217; surplus reaching an all-time high of $2.44 billion and net profits for the quarter of $1.48 billion. Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, attributes this success to the strength and stability of the platform, as well as the company&#8217;s ongoing risk management processes. Per the report, Looking ahead to Q2, Tether has an extremely positive outlook. It evaluates the global economic environment to ensure its customers&#8217; funds are not exposed to high-risk scenarios.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world&#8217;s largest stablecoin, USDT, has <a href="https://tether.to/en/tethers-latest-q1-2023-assurance-report-shows-reserves-surplus-at-all-time-high-of-244b-up-148b-in-net-profit-new-categories-for-additional-transparency-reveals-bitcoin-and-gold-allocations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published </a>its Q1 2023 Assurance Report, attested to by BDO Italia, a top five-ranked global independent public accounting firm. The report re-affirms the accuracy of Tether&#8217;s Consolidated Reserves Report (CRR), which details the assets held by the group as of March 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The CRR includes additional categories for the first time, including physical gold, overnight repo, corporate bonds, and Bitcoin ownership, which aim to increase transparency into Tether&#8217;s reserves reporting. Furthermore, the report reveals an increase in Tether&#8217;s excess reserves, reaching an all-time high of $2.44 billion, up from $1.48 billion in the previous quarter.</p>

<h2><b>Tether Q1 Net Income Surpasses Blackrock, Leading Hedge Fund Manager</b></h2>
<p>The recently released Q1 2023 Assurance Report highlights the stablecoin&#8217;s impressive performance in the year&#8217;s first quarter. The report shows that Tether&#8217;s net profit for the quarter was a staggering $1.48 billion, contributing significantly to strengthening its reserves. Moreover, the report reveals that the token in circulation increased by 20% during the quarter, indicating the high trust that Tether&#8217;s customers have in the stablecoin. </p>
<p>In addition, the company ended the first quarter of 2023 with consolidated total assets of $81.8 billion, with most of its reserves invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Tether is also taking steps to reduce its reliance on pure bank deposits as a source of liquidity. It utilizes the repo market as an additional measure to ensure a higher protection standard for its users by maintaining the necessary liquidity.</p>
<p>The report demonstrates Tether&#8217;s commitment to transparency, with most of its investments being held in cash, cash equivalents, and other short-term deposits (approximately 85%). </p>
<p>It also highlights a 25% reduction in secured loans from 8.7% to 6.5% of this asset class within the overall reserves and the highest percentage of assets allocated in US Treasury Bills to date. Gold and Bitcoin represent 4% and 2% of the total reserves, respectively. All new issuance of tokens has been invested in US Treasury bills or placed in overnight Repo.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Tether has outperformed BlackRock, one of the world&#8217;s leading providers of investment, advisory, and risk management solutions, in terms of net income in Q1 of 2023. While BlackRock reported a net income of $1.16 billion for the quarter, Tether reported a net income of $1.48 billion, highlighting the confidence investors had in the stablecoin issuer and the crypto market as a whole.</p>
<b>Cementing Its Position As Leading Stablecoin</b>
<p>Tether’s report reveals that its consolidated total liabilities amount to $79.4 billion, of which $79.3 billion relates to digital tokens issued. Despite this, the group&#8217;s consolidated assets exceed its consolidated liabilities, demonstrating the strength and stability of the platform.</p>
<p>Tether&#8217;s success in Q1 2023 is evident, with its reserves&#8217; surplus reaching an all-time high of $2.44 billion and net profits for the quarter of $1.48 billion. Paolo Ardoino, CTO of Tether, attributes this success to the strength and stability of the platform, as well as the company&#8217;s ongoing risk management processes.</p>
<p>Per the report, Looking ahead to Q2, Tether has an extremely positive outlook. It evaluates the global economic environment to ensure its customers&#8217; funds are not exposed to high-risk scenarios. With its reserves remaining extremely liquid and diversified across various asset classes, Tether remains a leading stablecoin issuer in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Data from Glassnode reveals the Bitcoin supply has been observing a shift from wallets based in America to those in Asia recently. Bitcoin Supplies Held By Asian And US Investors Have Gone Opposite Ways Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, an interesting dichotomy has formed between the different regional supplies of the cryptocurrency recently. Glassnode has divided the Bitcoin addresses into different regions based on the hours they have been making transactions in. &#8220;Geolocation of Bitcoin supply is performed probabilistically at the entity level,&#8221; notes Glassnode. An &#8220;entity&#8221; here refers to one or more wallets that are under the control of a single investor (or an investor group). &#8220;The timestamps of all transactions created by an entity are correlated with the working hours of different geographical regions to determine the probabilities for each entity being located in the US, Europe, or Asia,&#8221; explains the analytics firm. The three main regions are the US (13:00 to 01:00 UTC), Europe (07:00 to 19:00 UTC), and Asia (00:00 to 12:00 UTC). In the context of the current discussion, however, only the supplies based in the US and Asia are relevant.

The change slowed down in the second half of the year, but still remained positive, suggesting that the supply was still growing, albeit at a slower pace. In 2022, however, the supply started decreasing, as the bear market took over and the LUNA and 3AC crashes took place. The year-over-year change of the US-based BTC supply has continued to grow more negative since then and today stands at a value of -7.5%, suggesting that the supply has shrunken by 7.5% since May 2022. The Asian Bitcoin supply, however, has displayed a very contrasting behavior, as it started going up just as the American investors started shedding their holdings.

Currently, the year-over-year change in the Asian supply stands at +6.9%. The fact that the Asian investors have bought a similar amount to what the US holders have sold suggests a direct transfer of coins between the two supplies. Now, as for why this continued transition of supply has taken place, the main reason is likely to be the fact that the US has been tightening up regulations related to the cryptocurrency sector recently.

					<description><![CDATA[Polygon Network is one of the top players in the blockchain industry. However, its native token MATIC has steadily declined in the last few weeks. This comes as no surprise as many other altcoins are also experiencing the same downward movement due to negative market sentiment. But while the volatility of MATIC&#8217;s price can present profitable opportunities for traders, it can also pose a risk for inexperienced investors. Current Market Sentiment For MATIC In the past day and the previous seven days, MATIC has fallen 6.9% and 20.3%, respectively. According to an on-chain analytics platform, Santiment, millions of MATIC tokens were transferred between on-exchange addresses.  Related Reading: Check One, Two: Is Bitcoin Ready For A Mic Drop Rally? These large whale transactions on the Polygon network might be fuelling the downtrend as it suggests that holders are selling off their MATIC tokens. At the time of writing, MATIC&#8217;s price is $0.8675, representing a 44.53% drop since February 18, 2023. At the time of writing, the CFGI indicator also confirms the bearish sentiment around the MATIC price as its shows 38, indicating Fear among investors. This suggests that MATIC is in a phase where investors and traders are afraid to hold the asset. This may result in more dumps if the bulls remain stagnant. Meanwhile, MATIC&#8217;s 24-hour trading volume is down by 15.38% to $375 million. A drop in daily trading volume shows fewer activities are on the network. However, MATIC still maintained its #9 position with its market cap of $8 billion on CoinMarketCap. Polygon (MATIC) Price Analysis MATIC is trading below both the 50-Day and 200-Day SMAs, indicating a bearish trend in the short and long term. Traders may utilize this current trend to sell or avoid MATIC until it recovers fully. MATIC’s RSI reading of 22.99 suggests that MATIC is currently in the oversold zone. This also implies that the price of MATIC has rapidly declined and may be due for a possible retracement. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin May Have Completed The “Perfect” Pullback The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) below the signal line confirms the bearish trend. This suggests that MATIC is currently in a downtrend movement. The histogram also is below zero, confirming the bearish momentum. MATIC trades between the significant support and resistance levels at $0.7438 and $01.0306, respectively. The asset has already breakthrough the first primary support of $0.9335 and is heading strongly to the next support level. With this strong bearish momentum, the bears might break the next support and eventually hit the last support of $0.51. However, if the bull could take back control, we might see MATIC hit the strong resistance level at $1.1900. Featured image from Pixabay and chart from Tradingview]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The bear market has been brutal on cryptocurrencies in the market such as Shiba Inu. As a result, the profitability levels of investors in the meme coin have dropped drastically during this time. Even now, SHIB holders continue to see a decline in profitability, bringing it to one of the highest levels of losses since inception. Only 18% Of Shiba Inu Holders Are In Profit Data from on-chain aggregators show Shiba Inu investors are not faring well in the current market. Unlike other top tokens in the space, the meme coin has seen its percentage of holders in profit actually drop below 20% while others maintain their positions above 40%. Related Reading: Matrixport Report: Here’s What Happens To Bitcoin If Inflation Continues To Fall Currently, there are only 18% of SHIB investors seeing a profit, which is one of the lowest margins recorded since the token was first launched in 2020. This puts the vast majority of investors in losses, some more severe than others. To be more precise, a total of 78% of all addresses holding SHIB are nursing losses at current prices. This leaves only a meager 4% of investors sitting at breakeven, meaning that these coins were last moved at prices similar to current market prices. Only 18% of SHIB holders in profit &#124; Source: IntoTheBlock However, unlike holder profitability, the duration of which these investors are holding their coins has been growing. There are now more long-term SHIB holders than there have ever been with 68% of holders having held their coins for more than a year. Mid-term holders that have held between 1-12 months make up 29%, while only 3% can be classified as short-term holdings, having held for less than a month. SHIB Price Struggles To Hold Up Shiba Inu continues to struggle after falling below support at $0.00001. Since then, the digital asset seems to be in free fall with bulls unable to establish any significant support since then. However, it has not been entirely bad for the meme coin given that it has seen 1.06% gains in the last 24 hours. Although small compared to what investors are used to in the crypto market, it shows some resistance from bulls against sellers. SHIB struggles to recover &#124; Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView.com Now, SHIB is well below its 50-day and 100-day moving averages which puts it well on a bearish trend in the short to mid-term. The only hope would be for bulls to rally support t $0.0000085 which could eventually serve as a bounce-off point for future increases. Otherwise, a fall to $0.000007 could be programmed.
