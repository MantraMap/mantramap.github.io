										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/04163352/solana-price.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="SOL Price Prediction" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-price-prediction/">SOL Price Prediction</a>: Amid the increasing bearishness in the market, the Solana price witnessed a significant correction last week. In fact, this retracement was a retest phase to the recently breached resistance which carried a downtrend in this coin for nearly eleven months. Moreover, the price showing sustainability above the trendline indicates buyers defend the newly reclaimed level and can use it as a stepping stone to rise higher.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The triple bottom pattern is a strong reversal pattern that could assist buyers to trigger a fresh recovery rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A breakout above the $23 barrier may set the Solana price for a 16.6% rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $773.2 Million, indicating a 108.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/1/1SkyMrHP.png" alt="SOL Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">                                               </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the base of the recent correction phase, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/solana/">Solana price</a> shows the formation of a triple bottom pattern. In theory, this pattern formation itself reflects a strong accumulation from buyers which bolsters a trend reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the Solana price traded at $21.6 with an intraday gain of 2.35%. With sustained buying, the coin price should rise 5.5% and hit the immediate resistance of $23. A potential breakout above this resistance will accelerate the buying pressure and surge the price by 16.6% to reach a two-month high of $26.68.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/best-crypto-future-trading-bot/">Best Crypto Future Trading Bot 2023 ; Here’s The List</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, if the price continues to consolidate sideways, a breakdown below the lower trendline will invalidate the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contrary to the sideways action, the daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> shows evident growth indicating the buying pressure at the lower levels is rising.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMAs</a>(20, 50, and 100) accumulated between the current price and the aforementioned resistance of $23, create multiple barriers trying to undermine the bullish growth.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Coin Price Intraday Level</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $21.68</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels: $23 and $25.3</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $19.6 and $15.9</span></li>

This came on top of the price correction in <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> amid weakening macro economic scenario followed by some positive momentum due to the falling First Republic Bank stock price.</p>

<p>Earlier, popular Twitter account focused on crypto news, DB (tier10k), tweeted quoting an Arkham Intelligence alert that said Mt Gox and US government wallets were making transactions. Although the Bitcoin price had already fallen by the time the tweet was <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1651317391626846214?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a>, Arkham later clarified that the alert was erroneously set to a &#8220;small subset of users,&#8221; which apparently included DB.</p>
<h2>Arkham Explains Bug Fix</h2>
<p>Following this, Arkham explained that they had just fixed a bug related to Bitcoin alerts. The fix effectively made them to no longer send alerts to a the users. Further, Arkham <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamIntel/status/1651366459547713537?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> DB had earlier set alerts on Bitcoin transactions above $10,000, with names “Mt Gox” and “US Gov”. Hence, when the bug was fixed, users received the alerts set previously.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When we fixed a bug causing us to not send alerts on configs like this, he then correctly received many alerts based on his parameters. No one received inaccurate alerts, they simply began receiving the alerts they had previously set.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Although it is entirely possible that the Bitcoin price crash happened irrespective of the erroneous Arkham alerts, incidents like these could give regulators further scope for tightening laws on crypto market transactions.</p>

While the very news of Musk acquiring Twitter pumped $DOGE price in October 2022, the rally was short lived due to the FTX collapse impact. Despite the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bear-market-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bear run</a> dominating the sentiment, the memecoin stood benefited from Twitter takeover. Hence, after 6 months of the acquisition, DOGE might be well placed for further action in a much better environment.</p>

<p>Long before the Tesla CEO took over the social media platform, it was speculated that the company would initiate crypto based payments for various purposes, including for Twitter&#8217;s paid services. Musk introduced subscriptions for creators, paid verification and got rid of legacy blue ticks. More importantly, the list of changes is long and not yet over, as Twitter looks to enable encrypted direct messages and payments. All of the above have scope for money transfer and hence, leave potential for crypto payments, especially stablecoins and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">memecoins</a>.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin In The Mix Of Things For Elon Musk&#8217;s Twitter</h2>
<p>Although the company is yet to make it official about introducing crypto payments, more specifically Dogecoin payments, Musk had unofficially dropped hints in his tweets. In fact, Musk &#8216;liked&#8217; a tweet from a user that talked about the possibility of crypto based payments on the platform. Above all, Dogecoin enjoys the privilege of being the billionaire&#8217;s preferred choice among cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>However, overall <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a> conditions are yet to favor a full blown DOGE bull run after it hit the peak in November 2022 after change of guard at Twitter. Meanwhile, much has been happening around overall adoption for the memecoin. Earlier, CoinGape reported that Binance <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-adds-bitcoin-shiba-inu-dogecoin-stablecoins-to-liquid-swap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> new liquidity pools including for Bitcoin and Dogecoin.</p>

Cruz stated that he periodically buys Bitcoin every Monday morning and that he recently &#8220;bought the dip&#8221; when the price of Bitcoin dropped a few days back.</p>
<h2>Ted Cruz Ultra Bullish On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The Texas Republican commented that the comparison between Bitcoin and digital gold was compelling, and he was adamant in his belief that Bitcoin is &#8220;the alpha in the crypto sphere.&#8221; Moreover, he mentioned that he has a standing order to buy more Bitcoin next Monday morning and is willing to tolerate the volatility that comes with a long-term investment in risk-assets like <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Just-In: First Republic Bank Crisis Deepens As US Govt. Refuses Intervention" href="https://coingape.com/us-govt-wont-intervene-in-first-republic-bank/" rel="bookmark">First Republic Bank Crisis Deepens As US Govt. Refuses Intervention</a></strong></em></p>
<p>Furthermore, he remains confident of the 21-million Bitcoin cap that was hard-coded into the digital currency during its creation. Addressing the panel, Cruz noted that he sees this number as a hedge against inflation, especially when U.S. politicians have been printing money at an alarming rate, coupled with <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve&#8217;s</a> incessant rate hikes.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old Republican was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>I bought the dip which I was quite happy with, and I am also a long-term investor, so I am fine with some volatility, and I recognize there are going to be ups and downs, but 21 million is a firm number.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Cruz Advocates Bitcoin Over CBDC</h2>
<p>Cruz also brought attention to the fact that big governments like Russia and China were strongly opposed to the concept of cryptocurrency. &#8220;I like Bitcoin for the same reason why the Chinese communist government doesn&#8217;t like Bitcoin,&#8221; he continued to say. However, Cruz&#8217;s relationship with digital assets isn&#8217;t something new as it dates back quite some time.</p>
<p>In particular, the senator attracted a lot of media attention after he advocated making it mandatory for Capitol Hill to accept cryptocurrency payments. Additionally, the proposal &#8212; which was released earlier this year &#8212; would make it mandatory for food service providers and vending machines to accept cryptocurrency payments. In recent months, Cruz has vociferously argued against the establishment of a national <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc/">Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)</a> on concerns of privacy breaches.</p>
<p>As things stand, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin">Bitcoin’s price</a> is currently exchanging hands at $28,144 which represents a gain of 0.78% over the past 24 hours in comparison to a loss of 3.49% recorded over the past seven days.</p>

With this, users can now choose their preferred digital identities to easily send and receive cryptocurrencies instead of using conventional alpha-numeric <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/wallet-address/">wallet addresses</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance.US Offers Branded Web3 Domains</h2>
<p>With the new service, customers will be able to create &#8220;.BinanceUS&#8221; domains, giving them unique identities for their <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">cryptocurrency wallets</a> that are simple to comprehend and can be used in the Binance.US app to buy, sell, and transfer digital assets.</p>

<p>According to the official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/unstoppableweb/status/1651265867441754113?s=20" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, the .BinanceUS domain names will soon be made available entirely through the exchange&#8217;s app; and it&#8217;s for the first time, Unstoppable will provide customers with two-digit domain names like &#8220;00.BinanceUS&#8221; or &#8220;99.BinanceUS&#8221;. Additionally, it already provides two-letter domains such as &#8220;ok.BinanceUS&#8221;.</p>
<h2>BinanceUS Addresses To Start From $10</h2>
<p>Furthermore, under the new partnership, customers of Unstoppable Domains will be able to withdraw <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrency</a> to a variety of domain addresses, including &#8220;.crypto,&#8221; &#8220;.nft,&#8221; and &#8220;.x&#8221; domains, using Binance US. According to official statements released, users will be able to purchase &#8220;.BinanceUS&#8221; domain names for as little as $10.</p>

Similar to what the crypto investors experienced in Mid March, the First Republic Bank is now facing massive outflow, driving the market participant more toward the crypto market. Thus, the XRP price rebounded from the $0.44 local support and surged 7.5% to hit the immediate resistance of $0.48 </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price still above the 50% retracement level keeps the overall market trend bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price needs a breakout from either level of the ongoing range to a direction rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $1.2 Billion, indicating an 18% gain.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/Ugkhdc8m.png" alt="XRP Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A descending resistance trendline is currently carrying the ongoing correction phase in the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a>. Under the influence of this trendline, altcoin plunged from a high of $0.586 to a low of $0.44, registering a 24.6% loss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the $0.44 support aligned with the 50% retracement level created strong support and turned the falling trend sideways. Over the last six days, the XRP price has been wobbling between the $0.48 and $0.44 levels and formed a narrow price range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the daily chart showing a rejection candles on both sides indicates the coin price is struggling to sustain beyond this range which reflects uncertainty among market participants. </span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-carbon-negative-cryptos/">Top 10 Carbon Negative Cryptos For 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, if the XRP price managed to breach $0.44 support with a daily candle closing, the selling pressure will intensify and may drive the altcoin 6% down to reach $0.4.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakout above the overhead resistance is needed to resume the bullish recovery. This potential breakout may drive the coin price back to the last swing high of $0.58.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The falling <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) nearing closer reflect the decreasing bearish momentum. Moreover, these slopes moving above the midline reflect the overall trend is bullish.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> moving near $0.48 impose additional selling pressure on the XRP price.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.477</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>

Earlier, users of Avalanche who had USDC on Ethereum had to send their coins to a Circle partner or use a third-party bridge to move their USDC from one blockchain to another. With the debut of the new protocol, Circle claims to have eliminated the requirement of such <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/stablecoin-news/">stablecoin</a> bridges.</p>
<h2>Circle Unveils New CCTP Protocol</h2>
<p>According to the company&#8217;s official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.circle.com/en/cross-chain-transfer-protocol" rel="nofollow">statement</a>, the new protocol, unlike a conventional bridge system, does not lock tokens sent to its smart contract. In contrast, it enables the transfer of USDC between different <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/blockchain/">blockchain networks</a> by minting the same amount on one chain while burning native USDC on another and thereby enabling asset transfers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the protocol can be integrated into a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-wallets/">crypto wallet</a>, bridge, or app, allowing users to transfer any quantity of USDC to an ecosystem that supports it. The official statement released by the firm was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>A user accesses your app to initiate a transfer of USDC from one blockchain to another, and specifies the recipient wallet address on the destination chain.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to Circle, the protocol has already been implemented into other crypto projects, including Celer Network, Layer Zero, Li.Fi, Multichain, Router Protocol, and others, allowing users to move USDC through their interfaces. Circle has previously stated that CCTP will eventually be accessible on additional blockchain networks in addition to Ethereum and Avalanche.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>Can This Push USDC To #1 Spot?</h2>
<p>Over the past few years, bridge hacks have caused users to lose billions of dollars worth of USDC and other <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency/">cryptocurrencies</a>, as attackers have consistently mastered the skill to extract locked funds from <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/smart-contract/">smart contracts</a> and fill-in with duplicate copies on the receiving network without any kind of backing. This in turn has become a major headache for crypto startups and developers alike on figuring out ways to circumvent the issue.</p>
<p>With this new feature, USDC hopes to stand out in the larger <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> and among U.S. legislators who recently held a congressional <a href="https://coingape.com/congress-weighs-legislation-stablecoin-hearing/">hearing on stablecoins</a>. While market participants appreciate the new initiative, it might not be enough topple the current market leader, Tether (USDT). Boasting a market cap of nearly $81 billion, the <a href="https://coingape.com/category/news/stablecoin-news/">stablecoin</a> has been the most liquid and although it has repeatedly been mired in litigations, accusations and controversies, it has still managed to retain its number one spot over the years.</p>
<p>In light of this crypto news, the price of USDC remained pegged to its $1 value while witnessing a 35% surge in trading volume over the past 24 hours.</p>

Taking to his Twitter account, the vocal crypto leader and entrepreneur noted that the regulators are </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/cameron/status/1651233871537623041"><span style="font-weight: 400">showing double standards</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with respect to their handling of the embattled First Republic Bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recall that First Republic Bank has been facing deep liquidity crisis at the time Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank met their waterloos last month. Through the help of top banking giants, a $30 billion deposit was lodged into First Republic Bank to help it shore up its liquidity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, recent events that has seen the share price of the regional bank collapse by more than 65% since the start of the week has drawn more concerns from shareholders and depositors. As </span><a href="https://coingape.com/us-govt-wont-intervene-in-first-republic-bank/?utm_source=cgtelegram"><span style="font-weight: 400">reportedly</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> recently by Coingape, the US government has refused to bail out the ailing bank, further dragging down its liquidity crunch across the board.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Cameron, assuming First Republic Bank is crypto focused, regulators would have handled the fallout differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First Republic Bank is down another 35% and falling fast. If this was a &#8220;crypto&#8221; bank it would have been assassinated weeks ago. The fact that is hasn&#8217;t been taken into receivership shows just how blatant the double standard is,” he said in his tweet.</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2><b>FRC Crisis: The Case for Bitcoin</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The broad crisis that First Republic Bank (FRC) is facing is notably fueling a growing trust for Bitcoin (BTC) and other major altcoins. Despite starting the week with a relatively bearish momentum, Bitcoin is now </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400">trading at a price of $29,838.72</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, up by more than 9% over the past 24 hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With investors now exploring more safe bets, Bitcoin as a risk asset is now becoming more attractive, a trend that has helped push up the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-gold-correlation-hits-all-time-high/?utm_source=cgtelegram"><span style="font-weight: 400">correlation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> between the digital currency and Gold. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the waning trust for centralized banking, the alternative means to safeguard money as proffered by Bitcoin is one of the biggest fundamentals that is helping to drive the price of the premier digital currency to a new height at this time.</span></p>

A reversal pattern at crucial support increases the possibility for the coin price to undermine the prior correction and resume price recovery. A post-correction rally along with the news spread for another U.S bank at risk of collapse caused a significant uptick in the crypto market.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, a correction to 38.2% is considered an established uptrend to prolong the price rally</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The coin buyers need a breakout above the $2000 psychological barrier to accelerate the underlying bullish momentum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Ether is $11.4 Billion, indicating a 38.5% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/p/Py5Aj8lF.png" alt="TradingView Chart" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the recent reports, the First Republic Bank is facing massive capital outflows resembling the Banking crisis witnessed during Mid-march. As a result, the crypto market received <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-up-by-3-5-can-shoot-to-42000-amid-us-banking-crisis/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">significant buyer pressure</a> and surged several major cryptocurrencies higher in the last two days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the Ethereum price surged 5.5% and is currently trading at the $1946 mark. With sustaining the buyers should soon hit the $2000 as potential resistance. A breakout above this level is crucial for ETH holders as it will encourage a further 7.5% rally to challenge the last swing high resistance of $2138.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the coin price shows a reversal sign at $2000, the potential buyers must be cautious as it may lead to the formation of a new lower high to prolong the correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The daily <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI slope</a> rise above the midline reflects the positive sentiment in returning to the Ethereum coin</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the recent correction, the 50-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope acted as excellent pullback support in an established uptrend.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $1946</span></li>

The banking crisis led investors to put their money in Bitcoin rather than gold as it gave higher returns than gold and US equities.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BTC price</a> currently trades near the $30,000 psychological level, recording a strong rally of 85% this year. Experts believe the BTC price can hit over $135k after the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin-halving-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin halving</a> next year.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin-Gold Correlation Rises Higher</h2>
<p>Bitcoin 30-day correlation with gold has surpassed the 50% level and now stands at 57%, as per <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1651173606796263424" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> by market analytics firm Kaiko. The correlation is rising since March after regulators closed crypto-friendly banks causing a banking crisis.</p>
<figure style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fuok8TgXgAAabLz?format=jpg&amp;name=large" alt="Bitcoin Correlation With Gold" width="734" height="396" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text dfdfdf1">Bitcoin Correlation With Gold. Source: Kaiko</figcaption></figure>
<p>It indicates Bitcoin has emerged as a safe haven for its hedge against inflation and a store of value characteristics. During inflation and uncertainty, investors put their money in gold, but Bitcoin witnessed more inflow of money than gold.</p>
<p>For a long period of time, BTC has shown a close correlation to US equities. However, it has outperformed all three indices by nearly four times in Q1 2023.</p>
<p>Amid concerns over the potential economic collapse, “<em>Rich Dad Poor Dad</em>” author Robert Kiyosaki, warned about the state of the global economy. He claims that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> will be a catalyst for an imminent market crash.</p>
<p>The banking crisis is not over yet as <a href="https://coingape.com/us-govt-wont-intervene-in-first-republic-bank/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">First Republic Bank shares fell</a> over 25% today after a decline of 50% on Tuesday, with the government not inclined to participate in the negotiations.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Gains Momentum</h2>
<p>BTC price is currently trading at $29,756, up 10% in the last 24 hours. The 24-hour low and high are $27,284 and $30,000, respectively. Furthermore, the trading volume has increased by 70% in the last 24 hours, indicating a rise in interest among traders.</p>
<p>Experts predict Bitcoin can hit $35k amid the latest rally in the next few weeks. The Fed will announce its rate hike decision on May 2, with most probably a 25 bps rate hike as per the current data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to its existing rules, the SCB said it has strengthened the financial and reporting standards for trading platforms, custody service providers, staking operators and asset managers in the space. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disguised in the Digital Assets and Registered Exchanges (DARE) Bill, the SCB noted that it will increase its monitoring and evaluation for crypto companies and benchmark its standards in line with what is applicable in other advanced jurisdictions like the European Union, Hong Kong and the United States.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-146325" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/26204310/SCB.jpg" alt="The Bahamas SCB Press Release" width="609" height="769" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SCB is taking a definitive approach where it will require exchanges to maintain adequate systems and controls that are a true reflection of their growth. The SCB came under fire after the collapse of the FTX Exchange as its oversight role was called into question by industry leaders and observers including the bankrupt exchange’s </span><a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-resigns-john-ray-iii-joins-as-new-ftx-ceo/"><span style="font-weight: 400">new CEO, John Ray III.</span></a></p>
<h2><b>Bahamas SCB Bans Algorithmic Stablecoin</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The genesis of the broader digital currency ecosystem’s collapse stems from the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/is-tether-usdt-following-terras-ust-in-losing-its-dollar-peg/"><span style="font-weight: 400">depegging of the TerraUSD</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> (UST) stablecoin from the Terraform Labs about a year ago. The collapse of these stablecoin had such a ripple effect that cascaded to the declaration of bankruptcy by Genesis Trading.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a way to prevent related collapse from entities operating on its shores, the Bahamas SCB has banned algorithmic stablecoins altogether. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The DARE Bill 2023 establishes a new and comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins. The amendments provide a clear definition for stablecoins, provide for the registration of existing stablecoins, specify acceptable forms of reserve assets and establish new requirements for custody and management, segregation, reporting and redemption of reserve assets. The issuance of algorithmic stablecoins is expressly prohibited,” the announcement reads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The SCB said the rules are currently open for public consultation until the end of May. Additionally, the SCB is counting on pushing the proposals in the DARE Bill to become law by the end of the second quarter.</span></p>

However, reports suggest that at this point in time, the government is not inclined to participate in the negotiations.</p>
<h2>U.S. Govt. Backs Out Of FRC</h2>
<p>According to a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/26/first-republic-rescue-pitch-help-now-or-pay-more-later-when-it-fails.html" rel="nofollow">report</a> by CNBC, advisors to First Republic will now attempt to persuade larger U.S. banks that have already bailed it out to extend their assistance by asking for one more favor. As things currently stand, First Republic&#8217;s survival depends on the level of persuasion that one group of bankers can exert over another group of bankers.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="Bitcoin Price Jumps Nearly 10%; Looks To Regain $30K" href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-jumps-nearly-10-looks-to-regain-30k/" rel="bookmark">Bitcoin Price Jumps Nearly 10%; Looks To Regain $30K</a></strong></em></p>
<p>First Republic advisors are confident that other parties will step up to assist the bank in recapitalizing itself &#8212; if they are successful in persuading large banks to buy bonds for more than they are worth &#8212; to accept the brunt of investment losses for the benefit of the banking system as well as for their own welfare.</p>
<h2>Broadening US Banking Fiasco</h2>
<p>The abrupt failure of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/silicon-valley-bank/">Silicon Valley Bank</a> last month served as the catalyst for a weeks-long drama that has since taken several turns. A few days after the government seized SVB and Signature, which were both large-scale banks plagued by major bank runs, the largest lenders in the country came together to deposit $30 billion into First Republic.</p>
<p>However, after the company&#8217;s most recent earnings conference revealed the extent of its issues, that remedy proved to be temporary. The crumbling financial institution admitted on Wednesday, as was previously <a href="https://coingape.com/rumors-states-first-republic-bank-collapse-bitcoin-price/">reported</a> on CoinGape, that it had lost nearly $100 billion in deposits during the banking crisis that occurred a month ago.</p>
<p>The most recent report does not appear to have taken the market by surprise, as can be seen in the share price of FRC which dropped by a whopping 36% on Wednesday after witnessing a similar fate yesterday. As of now, further trading has been temporarily halted with the stock price falling to its all-time low of $5.17 at the time of writing.</p>

This sudden change in market sentiment could be associated with the news spread of the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-btc-price-up-by-3-5-can-shoot-to-42000-amid-us-banking-crisis/?utm_source=24hrsupdateall">First Republic Bank collapse</a> as it faced massive outflow. Amid the US bank crisis in March 2023, the Bitcoin price witnessed a significant rally suggesting its hedge power against the falling banking sector. Can this fresh recovery regain the $30000 mark?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price reversal from the 23.6% FIB indicates a higher possibility for uptrend continuation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $291510 encourages BTC price to a 6% jump</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in Bitcoin is $21 Billion, indicating a 37% gain.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 24th the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/">Bitcoin price</a> rebounded from a combined support of $27000 and a 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The bullish rally driven by the possibility of First Republic Bank collapse surged the coin price by 8% where it hit the immediate resistance of $29150.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish reversal from 23.6% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">FIB</a> is considered healthy as the excessive selling pressure gets absorbed and the buyers recuperate the bullish momentum at a price dip. However, the buyers would need a bullish breakout with the candle closing above the $29150 barrier to bolster the resumption of prior recovery.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/new-cryptocurrencies-to-buy/">15 New Cryptocurrencies To Buy In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout from the aforementioned resistance will surge the Bitcoin price 6% higher to rechallenge the last swing high resistance of $30750.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, any signs of rejection near $29150 could lead to the formation of a new lower high and threaten BTC for longer correction.</span></p>

Wahi&#8217;s sentencing hearing is scheduled on May 9, which is crypto&#8217;s first-ever insider trading case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with Coinbase repeatedly challenging the SEC.</p>
<h2>Former Coinbase Employee Requests 10-Months Prison Sentence</h2>
<p>According to the court <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63889439/91/united-states-v-wahi/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">filing</a> on April 26, Ishan Wahi has filed a sentencing memorandum in the US District Court for the South District of New York. Ishan Wahi faces a sentencing hearing on May 9, which could send him to jail for many years.</p>
<p>Defendant Ishan Wahi requested a sentence of no more than 10 months for his insider trading charges, considering his social and personal responsibilities, and good history. Lawyers representing Wahi believe it would be sufficient to impose 10-months jail term, but not excessive, punishment for the crimes of conviction.</p>
<p>The SEC accused former Coinbase executive Ishan Wahi, along with Ishan&#8217;s brother Nikhil and their friend Sameer Ramani of engaging in insider trading. Both Wahi brothers have pled guilty, with Nikhil being sentenced to 10 months. Ishan Wahi is also seeking a similar sentence next month.</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="https://coingape.com/juts-in-coinbase-challenges-us-sec-regulation-by-enforcement-as-crypto-recovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Coinbase filed an amicus brief</a> in the SEC v. Wahi insider trading case asking the court to dismiss the misguided lawsuit. Coinbase strongly argues that it doesn’t list securities and petitioned the SEC to make rules on digital asset securities as the existing rules don’t apply to digital assets.</p>
<p>The Blockchain Association and the <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-crypto-body-takes-action-against-us-sec-chair-gary-gensler-for-crypto-crackdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chamber of Digital Commerce also filed</a> amicus briefs separately asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit as old securities rules don’t adhere to digital assets.</p>
