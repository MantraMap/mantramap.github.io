<p>Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate conducted a round of layoffs after the SEC charged the exchange with securities violations last week. </p>
<p>Crypto giant Binance&rsquo;s US affiliate, Binance.US, has reportedly laid off some of its staff after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the exchange with securities violations and sought a temporary restraining order to freeze the exchange&rsquo;s assets.</p>
<p>Reuters reports that around 50 people, or 10%, have been laid off. Sources say employees in the exchange&rsquo;s legal, compliance, and risk departments have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Media outlet CoinDesk cites documents in which Binance.US management described the SEC as a &ldquo;politically motivated regulator&rdquo; that forced the company to become a &ldquo;crypto-only exchange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The documents read:</p>

<p>As part of this transition, and because of our preparation for a multi-year and very costly litigation process, the Board has asked Management to shrink the size of our teams across the company and reduce our burn rate.</p>

<p>Adding:</p>

<p>Unlike every other US crypto company, we have been working to avoid this scenario, but circumstances have now shifted. This was a very hard decision &ndash; one that we didn&rsquo;t take lightly. We are sad to see our colleagues depart, but we wish them the best and will do what we can to assist them in this transition.</p>

Binance.US Suspends USD Deposits and Withdrawals
<p>Last week, the SEC sued Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao, accusing the exchange of allegedly mishandling customer funds and lying to investors and regulators about its operations.</p>
<p>The next day, the agency filed a motion for a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of two of Binance&rsquo;s US units.</p>
<p>Days after the SEC filed suit against Binance and requested to freeze Binance.US&rsquo;s assets, the exchange announced that it was suspending US dollar deposits, and its banking partners were preparing to halt fiat withdrawals from June 13.</p>
