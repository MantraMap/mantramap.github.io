			            <description><![CDATA[The launch of the Shibarium blockchain is slated for August. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Amidst a lack of bullish cues in the market, SHIB rose by almost 6% over the past day, which pushed its monthly gains to nearly 12%.</p>
<p>The meme coin&#8217;s surge can be attributed to the Shibarium Beta Bridge, which went live for public testing this week. The move is part of an ambitious roadmap that seeks to transform the Shiba Inu project into a complete ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>The team behind SHIB <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1684252125704880131" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">announced</a> the release of the Shibarium Bridge beta version for public testing, which would allow users to transfer tokens between the two networks.</li>
<li>Initially, the bridge will enable users to transfer testnet ether tokens to the layer-2 network, with each transfer expected to take a maximum of up to 30 minutes.</li>
<li>The bridge is also compatible with the ERC-20 token standard and focuses on enhancing the scalability factor.</li>
<li>The development comes weeks after developer Shytoshi Kusama <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-pumps-after-lead-developer-shares-shibarium-update-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">revealed</a> that Shibarium is slated to go live after a Toronto conference in August this year.</li>
<li>The updates regarding the much-anticipated layer-2 have sparked several minor <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-pumps-after-lead-developer-shares-shibarium-update-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">rallies</a>, but Shibarium code concerns <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/shiba-inu-shib-tumbles-7-on-concerns-about-shibarium-code/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dragged</a> SHIB&#8217;s value significantly in March.</li>
<li>Despite this, Shibarium has been touted to be crucial for the meme coin to place it among more serious contenders in the Web3 space. The addition of layer-2 specifically is aimed at increasing throughput, allowing the project to handle significant growth. A considerable boost in transaction speed could attract more users.</li>
<li>Shibarium will leverage four tokens, namely, BONE, TREAT, SHIB, and LEASH, for applications developed on top of the blockchain.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[The CFTC alleged that the Tennessee couple managed to persuade 100 individuals to entrust them with their money despite having no trading experience. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Tennessee couple was charged for operating a $6 million digital assets commodity pool scheme by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) this week.</p>
<p>The United States derivatives market regulator charged the owners of a Clarksville real estate company, Michael and Amanda Griffis, for allegedly defrauding more than 100 people across the country. The couple was also accused of failing to register with the CFTC in connection with a multi-million dollar commodity pool scheme they operated between July 2022 and January 2023.</p>
<h2>&#8216;Blessings of God Thru Crypto&#8217; Fraud</h2>
<p>The CFTC&#8217;s complaint alleged that Michael and Amanda Griffis lured their colleagues and customers of their real estate business by offering them the opportunity to pool funds with others to trade digital asset commodity futures contracts.</p>
<p>The couple did not have any trading or other relevant experience but managed to convince over 100 individuals to send them more than $6 million to participate in a commodity pool called &#8220;Blessings of God Thru Crypto.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of the scheme, the pool participants sent more than $4 million in funds to the &#8220;Apex Trading Platform.&#8221; However, the funds were instead quickly transferred to several digital wallets &#8220;outside the control&#8221; of the Griffises and are now &#8220;beyond recovery.&#8221; The couple also misappropriated nearly $1 million of pool funds to pay their debts and purchase various items, including expensive jewelry and an all-terrain vehicle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the remainder of pool funds were misappropriated by the Griffises to issue Ponzi-like payments in an attempt to carry on the scheme for as long as possible.</p>
<h2>CFTC Statement</h2>
<p>In a statement, Director of Enforcement Ian McGinley said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As alleged, the defendants promised pool participants a safe investment in digital asset futures contracts with huge profit potential. The promises were underpinned by the trust the victims placed in the defendants. The defendants betrayed their pool participants, and they profited from that betrayal. Today’s filing reinforces the CFTC’s long-standing commitment to hold accountable those who take advantage of victims.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The CFTC has sought restitution to defrauded pool participants, civil monetary penalties, and permanent trading and registration bans. In its complaint, the agency also requested the imposition of a permanent injunction against further violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p>The agency, however, warned that the victims may not be able to recover the lost funds because the defendants may not have sufficient assets.</p>
<p>Prior to this case, the CFTC had <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cftc-charges-man-for-defrauding-investors-of-21m-in-crypto-ponzi-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">charged</a> William Koo Ichioka for allegedly defrauding investors of $21 million by claiming to be a digital asset and foreign exchange (forex) trader a month ago.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Congressmen Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis are some of the people that scolded the SEC for its actions on the crypto scene. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its Chairman, Gary Gensler, have received a significant wave of criticism from numerous organizations and individuals (including some American politicians) for the way they have treated the cryptocurrency industry over the years. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ripple&#8217;s recent court victory against the Commission prompted even more lawmakers to castigate the regulator. In the next lines, we will name some of the most vocal opponents of the SEC and their reasons.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Lengthy List of Politicians</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">United States Representative Warren Davidson was among the first to <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/rep-davidson-declares-war-on-sec-boss-gary-gensler-over-long-series-of-abuses/" data-wpel-link="internal">display</a> his dissatisfaction with Gary Gensler&#8217;s anti-crypto campaign this year. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawmaker raised his concerns after the SEC announced new rules that could &#8220;modernize&#8221; the concept of an &#8220;exchange&#8221; so it could be more closely referred to as a system that &#8220;brings together buyers and sellers of securities that offer the use of non-firm trading interest and provide another type of non-discretionary method.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Davidson </span><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claimed</span><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> this proposal is another example of the agency&#8217;s &#8220;long series of abuses&#8221; toward the cryptocurrency sector. He went further, introducing legislation that could remove the current Chair of the SEC from his post.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Apart from applying enhanced supervision on digital asset exchanges, the watchdog </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">filed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> lawsuits against two of the behemoths in the industry &#8211; Binance and Coinbase. It insisted they had violated certain rules and offered trading services with alleged unregistered securities, such as BNB, BUSD, ADA, SOL, MATIC, and more.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senator Cynthia Lummis (a keen proponent of bitcoin and even a HODLer) was quick to react to that move. She </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1666181240167317507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">believes</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the SEC had failed to provide &#8220;a path&#8221; for crypto marketplaces and did not offer &#8220;adequate legal guidance on what differentiates a security from a commodity.&#8221; She also scolded the agency for the lack of comprehensive crypto rules in the USA, which could push the industry offshore or &#8220;into the shadows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The SEC was involved in the cryptocurrency space again in mid-June when multiple finance giants, including BlackRock, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/blackrock-files-bitcoin-spot-etf-application-taps-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> with it to release a spot BTC ETF in the States. The Commission was initially unsupportive of the idea of such monetary products, calling the applications &#8220;inadequate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">US Congressman Patrick McHenry </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/PatrickMcHenry/status/1674876179344392195" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opposed</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> the SEC&#8217;s vision, maintaining that the only reason Gensler would be against spot BTC ETFs is &#8220;if he wants to kill crypto&#8221; in America. </span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Effect of Ripple&#8217;s Victory</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One groundbreaking event for the entire cryptocurrency field was Ripple&#8217;s recent court win against the SEC. A US judge </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cryptopotato.com/xrp-price-explodes-16-as-judge-rules-in-favor-of-ripple-in-sec-case/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">ruled</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in favor of the enterprise blockchain provider in mid-July, stating that most XRP sales do not constitute securities transactions. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The regulator filed its lawsuit against Ripple more than three years ago, alleging the entity&#8217;s native token should be treated as a security, similar to bonds or stocks, and therefore it should become subject to SEC regulation. Interestingly, Gensler has claimed over the past few years that the only digital currency with the status of a commodity is bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Representative Ritchie Torres wrote a letter a few days after Ripple&#8217;s landmark victory, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/18/nys-torres-asks-if-sec-will-ease-up-on-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">claiming</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the SEC (under the rule of Chair Gensler) has failed to issue &#8220;a single rule on crypto assets, nor has it given any clear guidance.&#8221; He also asked whether the watchdog will end its war on the industry following its court loss.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Senator Lummis was once again vocal on the topic, </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1683845466306252801" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">opining</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that the outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC legal battle has &#8220;reinforced the need for Congress to create a regulatory structure for crypto assets.&#8221; She pointed out the bill, introduced by her and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, which aims to categorize most digital currencies as commodities (or in the same bracket as gold, silver, oil, and natural gas).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Last but not least, US Representative Dusty Johnson </span><a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/4117714-the-ripple-effect-a-new-wave-in-digital-asset-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">argued</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> in a recent statement that Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;consistent efforts to project an air of certainty&#8221; in the crypto sector and outline that almost every digital asset is a security were put to the test by the result of the case against Ripple. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lawmaker believes the court ruling was a double-edged sword since it damaged Gensler&#8217;s approach to the industry and created even bigger confusion. He concluded that the only solution to that problem is the implementation of crypto legislation coming from Congress. </span></p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is all the rage owing to the success of OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT, which has taken conversations about the space to a whole new level. Off late, several AI-related crypto tokens have sprung up, capturing the imagination of investors amidst a dull market.</p>
<p>After initial gains, however, these assets underwent significant value reductions. Prominent blockchain analytical firm Kaiko also echoed a similar sentiment.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price performance continues to be quite underwhelming, but the asset managed to sustain above $29,000 at least.</p>
<p>The altcoins are also slightly in the green, with gains of up to 2% from the likes of DOGE and SOL. SHIB has jumped the most from the top 20.</p>
<h2>BTC Stalls Above $29K</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that there have been more exciting times in the crypto ecosystem when it comes down to price performances. Bitcoin started the week with a nosedive that drove it from over $30,000 to a monthly low of just under $29,000.</p>
<p>The bulls intervened at this point and pushed the asset to just above that line. The next several days saw little-to-no movements, and even the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/federal-reserve-raises-rates-again-by-0-25-bitcoin-trades-flat/" data-wpel-link="internal">US Fed&#8217;s interest rate hike</a> on Wednesday failed to deliver enhanced volatility as they did in the past.</p>
<p>Aside from a few hundred dollar<a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-loses-30k-as-us-federal-reserve-hikes-interest-rates-by-another-25bps-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal"> pumps and dumps</a>, BTC spent the whole business week in a tight range between $29,000 and $29,500. Its market capitalization has remained below $570 billion, but its dominance over the altcoins has taken another slight hit and is down to 48.1% on CMC.</p>

<h2>SHIB Pumps 5%</h2>
<p>Although more volatile by nature, the alternative coins have also failed to produce any major moves in either direction in the past several days. The charts since yesterday, though, seem a bit more positive, with minor gains.</p>
<p>Ethereum and XRP have added less than 0.5% on a daily scale and trade above $1,870 and $0.7, respectively. Dogecoin and Solana have jumped by just over 1% to $0.078 and $25. Tron, MATIC, and Polkadot are also slightly in the green, while BNB, ADA, and LTC have charted insignificant losses.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu has increased the most from the larger-cap alts following the release of the Shibarium beta version. Quant follows suit from the top 36, with a 7.5% daily surge.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has remained relatively still at just over $1.180 trillion.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prominent companies and figures part of the digital asset industry, such as the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange Binance and Tron&#8217;s founder Justin Sun, have also contributed to the nation&#8217;s efforts.</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The authorities have used the funds to purchase ammunition, medical equipment, weapons, and other war supplies to continue resisting the Russian invasion. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It is worth mentioning that the largest chunk of the total contributions came in 2022, as they stagnated at the end of last year and the beginning of 2023. The country has received less than $10 million worth of crypto since May.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">March 2022 was the most successful month in terms of donations when Ukraine racked up almost $100 million.

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Crystal Blockchain estimated that the most contributions ($83 million) came in the form of USDT. Ethereum (ETH) donations were second, comprising $79 million of the amount, whereas Bitcoin (BTC) ranked third ($41 million).<br />

			            <description><![CDATA[The SEC claims that if exchanges present their proof of reserve reports as audits, their accountants may be liable.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paul Munter – principal advisor to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on accounting and auditing matters – issued a warning on Thursday to crypto accounting firms whose work is inappropriately marketed as a substitute for “audits.”</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/munter-statement-crypto-072723#_ftnref3" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">statement</a>, titled “The Potential Pitfalls of Purported Crypto “Assurance” Work”, claimed that clients of such firms often promote their work as being at “parity” with a financial statement audit.</li>
<li>
<blockquote><p>“Such suggestions are false,” he asserted. “Non-audit arrangements are neither as rigorous nor as comprehensive as a financial statement audit, and may not provide any reasonable assurance to investors.”</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li>The advisor referenced a March <a href="https://pcaobus.org/resources/information-for-investors/investor-advisories/investor-advisory-exercise-caution-with-third-party-verification-proof-of-reserve-reports" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which warned investors of accounting firms providing Proof of Reserves (PoR) reports for crypto exchanges.</li>
<li>PoR is a blockchain-based accounting method that <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/okx-releases-industry-leading-9th-consecutive-proof-of-reserves-in-july-showing-11-3-billion-in-primary-assets/" data-wpel-link="internal">some exchanges</a> have used to verify the number of crypto assets they have on hand. The PCAOB warned that such reports “are not audits,” as they do not account for a crypto firm’s liabilities, among other factors.</li>
<li>Munter’s statement added that accountants servicing crypto firms that mislead investors about the nature of the former’s work could be found liable under securities laws.</li>
<li>If accounting firms find that their clients make misleading statements, the Office of the Chief Accountant (OCA) recommended a “noisy withdrawal, disassociating itself from the client, including by way of its own public statements.”</li>
<li>A similar withdrawal <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/binance-and-crypto-com-auditor-mazars-group-pauzes-work-with-crypto-clients/" data-wpel-link="internal">occurred</a> with Mazars Group in December 2022, when the firm distanced itself from all crypto firms shortly after releasing a PoR report on Binance.</li>
