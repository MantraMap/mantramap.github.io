										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ethereum developers are working to take <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/distributed-validator-technology-marks-last-key-milestone-in-ethereums-current-era-1032389563">their digital baby</a> to the next level. They’re now establishing something called “distributed validator technology” or DVT.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Continues Its Trek Forward</h2>
<p>Right now, there are more than 600,000 Ethereum validators in the world. The problem is they are too independent of each other, so what one might see as a successful pushing of transactions forward, another might see as a failure. Also, these validators are still prone to several financial penalties known as “slashing.” This can occur whenever validators go offline for extended periods.</p>
<p>The idea is to ensure validators become decentralized and work in a fully decentralized environment. To do this, developers are making it so that private keys – usually only associated with separate or individual validators – can be split amongst all validators. They can be used to sign in by multiple people, thus allowing validators’ data to be shared across clusters of node operators.</p>
<p>Steven Quinn – the head of research at the staking service provider P2P – explained in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>From a technical perspective, what [this] means is you can geographically distribute the machines.</p></blockquote>
<p>To aid in the deployment of these distributed validators, Ethereum is employing the assistance of two open-source networks. The first is Obol; the second is SSV. The goal is to have two minds regularly agreeing with each other, so success somewhere cannot be seen as failure in another region.</p>
<p>Obol documents read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Should &lt;33 percent of the participating nodes in a DV cluster go offline, the remaining active nodes can still come to consensus on what to sign and can produce valid signatures for their staking duties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding DVT, Messari research analyst Stephanie Dunbar explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>What I’m most excited about is the idea of increasing resiliency on Ethereum and in the future, potentially on other blockchains as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ethereum has come quite a long way over just the last few months. While it was hyped long before it officially occurred, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/merge/">Merge update</a> – which took place in September of last year – was one of the final building blocks in establishing the world’s second largest digital currency by market cap as a proof of stake rather than a proof of work module.</p>
<p>The idea was to ensure Ethereum could continue running and garnering more developer attention by enforcing quicker transaction times and thinner gas fees. From there came the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/shapella/">Shapella upgrade</a>, which occurred just a few months ago in April of 2023.</p>
<h2>Withstanding All That&#8217;s Thrown at It</h2>
<p>Walter Smith of the technology firm Galaxy mentioned that the importance of DVT revolves around making the ETH blockchain more “resilient,” and that the network should be able to withstand whatever “external or internal disturbances” it faces. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>This can be from geopolitics, regulation, markets, or even less intuitive disruptions like fires or earthquakes.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon – the nefarious founder of the now failed stable coin company Terraform Labs – will spend the <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/kwon-south-korean-cryptocurrency-boss-093016848.html?ref=upstract.com">next four months</a> behind bars in Montenegro after he was detained at one of the nation’s airports with forged documents and phony passports.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon Heads to Prison</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/disgraced-crypto-executive-do-kwon-pleads-not-guilty-following-arrest/">passports allegedly held</a> by Kwon at the time of his detainment included ones from Costa Rica and Belgium. He attempted to board a flight that was on its way to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from Montenegro’s capital city of Podgorica. He was found guilty and sentenced to four months in jail. His former chief financial officer Han Chang-joon was found guilty of the same thing and will serve the same amount of time behind bars.</p>
<p>Terraform Labs created an algorithmic stable currency known as Terra USD. The problem with an algorithmic stable coin is that it’s not backed by any physical collateral the way a standard stable coin (i.e., Tether, USD Coin, etc.) is. There is no fiat currency, gold, or other proven financial product supporting it. Rather, it’s simply up because the people investing in it believe it should be up. It’s backed by “spirit” or investor confidence if you will.</p>
<p>This is a dangerous situation because if that investor confidence ever goes down (which it clearly did), the currency in question runs the risk of vanishing overnight, and that’s exactly what happened with Terra USD, though the circumstances surrounding the token’s demise appear more complicated in their own ways.</p>
<p>The Terra USD asset ultimately collapsed over the course of about 24 to 48 hours. Within that time, more than $40 billion in wealth vanished. As it later turned out, Kwon and his fellow executives began taking their Terra reserves and placing them into bitcoin just weeks before the crash occurred, suggesting that Kwon and those behind the currency were engaged in a rug pull of sorts or some other form of malicious activity designed to hurt investors while they walked away without a scratch.</p>
<p>This raised serious suspicions <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/crypto-executive-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro/">with law enforcement</a> officials in South Korea, where Terraform Labs was based. An arrest warrant for Kwon was issued after it was determined he was responsible for a multi-billion-dollar fraud scheme, though it was explained in news headlines that he eventually became a fugitive that sought to avoid capture and time in prison. Kwon was quick to deny this on social media, claiming he was coding in his living room and that he was willing to cooperate with law enforcement in any way he could.</p>
<h2>Trying to Appeal</h2>
<p>Following his detainment and prison sentence, a defense lawyer for Kwon named Goran Rodic explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once we receive the verdict in writing, we will consult with our client about [a] possible appeal.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Canada has just finished having <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/first-ever-canadian-bitcoin-conference-wraps-up-in-toronto-1032397885">its first ever</a> bitcoin conference. Taking place at the Chelsea Hotel in mid-June in downtown Toronto, the event was a huge success and is one of the first of its kind in the Great White North.</p>
<h2>Canada and Bitcoin&#8230; Growing Stronger Together?</h2>
<p>Canada has had a relatively mixed history with bitcoin and crypto. Between <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/quadriga-cx/">Quadriga CX</a> – which is being labeled as some as the <em>first</em> <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> given the amount of money that’s been lost – and the harsh regulations it’s enforced that have caused some crypto <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/binance-will-proactively-withdraw-canada-2023-05-12/">exchanges and related companies</a> to leave, it’s not always considered the best region for crypto innovation, so it’s always positive to see things like this occur.</p>
<p>The Canada event was organized by Daniel and Manuela Carlin, with over a dozen volunteers also giving their time. More than 300 people attended, and tickets were available for between $136 and $377. Daniel expressed great enthusiasm for the industry, and he thinks it’ll go quite far. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin adoption has been steadily growing over the last number of years, and that will continue. I think it will accelerate. One day, we’ll wake up and it’ll just be a big green candle to the moon.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the event, Francis Pouliot – the CEO of Bull Bitcoin – unveiled a new mobile app for his enterprise that would allow customers to purchase BTC directly from the Canadian exchange. He released a tweet about the product that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Still a bunch of work to do before I&#8217;m happy with a release, but testing is still appreciated!</p></blockquote>
<p>Another startup to make an appearance at the event was called Panties for Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with technology. Rather, creators design underwear with bitcoin logos and images on it. The founder is a man named Pablo, who hails from Argentina and later immigrated to Canada to work as an industrial engineer, though he has 50 years’ experience in fashion and is now getting his son Michael involved in the company. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Before bitcoin, I was a panty manufacturer. Now, I&#8217;m a bitcoin nerd who manufactures panties.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael also threw his two cents into the mix, claiming:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, we have one style of bra and three styles of panties. The next step will be to get a boxer around the time of pacific bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Getting Rid of the Pond Scum</h2>
<p>Stephan Livera of D-Central was also at the conference. He offered a discussion about self-custody in bitcoin. He was also quick to say that the industry has become saturated with what he called “sh*t coin casinos.” He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you sit by the bank of the river long enough, you can watch the bodies of your enemies float by. So, I think we’ll see that with some of these sh*t coin casinos.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Wharton – a former campaign manager to Boris Johnson that’s now leading an education quango – is being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/18/tory-peer-james-wharton-working-for-crypto-lobbying-firm-northpoint-strategy">questioned over his alleged</a> ties to a crypto lobbying firm.</p>
<h2>James Wharton Criticized for Ties to Crypto</h2>
<p>Wharton presently leads an organization known as the Office for Students (OFS). However, he’s also launched a new public affairs company designed to help clients “navigate the complexities” of Westminster. He also provides legal counseling on regulated sectors.</p>
<p>That company – known as North Point Strategy – is managing a group called the UK Crypto Asset Business Council (UKCBC). It emerged a few years back and began working in the lobbying sector while trying to build connections within the UK Parliament. The main goal of the UKCBC is to establish the United Kingdom as a leading crypto hub.</p>
<p>Among the tactics it’s undertaken to create this future have been writing to both civil servants and ministers and meeting with Treasury officials. Wharton was appointed to the organization about two years ago in 2021, but his attachment to the group is now being criticized by the UK Labor Party, which says Wharton is placing his own interests above those involved in education (people he’s purportedly trying to help through the quango mentioned above).</p>
<p>Matt Western – the shadow minister for higher education with the Labor Party – explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the latest in a long line of examples of the chair of the Office for Students putting his political interests above the interests of students. Students rightly expect swift action from the independent regulator on matters that affect them the most. It is less than clear how Lord Wharton’s additional commitment helps further those interests.</p></blockquote>
<p>Over the past several months, crypto has taken a new lead on regulators’ priorities lists in the UK. Not long ago, it was believed that crypto trading should fall under the same <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-wants-gambling-laws-to-apply-to-crypto-trading/">rules and guidelines</a> that apply to gambling. In other words, buying bitcoin, in lawmakers’ eyes, was a lot like sitting down and betting one’s money at a blackjack table, a metaphor that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/finance-professor-disagrees-with-united-kingdom-sentiment-towards-crypto/">has been criticized</a> by many.</p>
<p>The main idea behind the gambling comparison, however, stems from regulators’ blatant feelings that crypto assets like bitcoin have no intrinsic value and are very risky endeavors.</p>
<h2>The UK Is Leading the Way to Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>After the UKCBC’s work with the Treasury came to public attention, a Treasury spokesperson emerged and issued the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Government officials have consulted with well over 50 crypto organizations, including one meeting with UKCBC, to ensure our new crypto asset regulatory regime achieves robust, transparent, and fair standards.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the disastrous <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">fall of FTX</a> last November, the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/the-united-kingdom-announces-plans-for-new-crypto-regulations/">became one of the first</a> regions in the world to get serious about crypto regulation and impose strict new laws designed to regulate trading and keep investors protected.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Ben Zhang – a former banker at JPMorgan and the co-founder of Node Real – believes blockchain and crypto are <a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/23/06/32905479/ex-jp-morgan-banker-says-cryptocurrency-is-a-long-term-investment-opportunity">long-term investments</a>, and he thinks entrepreneurs and startups alike need to get involved now before things really explode.</p>
<h2>Ben Zhang on How Crypto Should Be Viewed</h2>
<p>Over the last year or so, the crypto market has been subjected to haphazard conditions that have really caused prices to sink. Bitcoin, for example, was trading 70 percent less at the end of last year from where it was at the end of 2021. The crypto industry’s overall valuation dropped by more than $2 trillion during a 12-month period, and things really took ugly (and unexpected) turns.</p>
<p>However, while it’s easy to blame <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/inflation/">inflation</a> and all these other economic factors, Zhang is confident the industry fell the way it did due to a lack of innovation. In an interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>So far, I think business innovation for some specific areas is very good, but there are a lot of areas which lack innovation. I think crypto or web3 or blockchain is still in the very early stages. It&#8217;s the perfect time to start your journey as a startup, entrepreneur, or developer in crypto. You can learn some of blockchain&#8217;s fundamental technology and some of MetaMask’s wallet management.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also said that the crypto space needs to be looked at as a long-term investment opportunity. One of the big issues, in his opinion, is that everyone wants to rush in, make a little money, and then sell their stashes as soon as they see some gains. This is the wrong idea, Zhang commented. People need to be in it for the long run. Otherwise, the arena is not going to succeed. He says:</p>
<blockquote><p>We should put more money in the crypto market and look for long-term investment. Crypto and blockchain are still getting a lot of attention. Now we have so many different regulatory frameworks, and it helps improve the downturn movement of crypto. I don&#8217;t think too many regulations cause a downturn. The downturn is caused by many factors including the macro economy&#8217;s instability worldwide, but there are so many regulatory frameworks, and [they’re] very difficult to follow.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Growth of Web3</h2>
<p>Discussing the implantation of web3, Zhang said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Web3 marks the next significant advancement in the evolution of the internet. Building upon the foundations of web1 and web2, which introduced user interaction[s] and social media, web3 represents a transformative leap forward. Powered by blockchain technology, NFTs, and cryptocurrencies, web3 is set to revolutionize the online landscape. Web3 environments are revolutionizing the gaming industry by enabling the creation of video games that utilize blockchain technology. Through these games, players can leverage the power of non-fungible tokens and token rewards within the game to earn profits.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been in a bit of a slump over the last month and a half or so, but according to Michael Saylor – the former CEO of MicroStrategy – and the Winklevoss Twins, this slump could soon be coming to an end, and the world’s number one digital currency by market cap <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/17/it-could-happen-very-quickly-crypto-bulls-issue-huge-10x-price-prediction-amid-wild-bitcoin-and-ethereum-price-swings/?sh=5fd9a4fc6a35">is going to reach</a> new levels of bullishness.</p>
<h2>The Winklevoss Twins Have High Hopes for BTC</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Saylor mentioned that the bitcoin price could hit a new height “very quickly,” and the weakened behavior we’ve been so accustomed to over the last six or seven weeks may be ending sooner than we think. He commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have confidence that the crypto exchanges will come around to realizing that bitcoin really is the dominant asset in this space, and their business models are fine when bitcoin goes up by a factor of ten.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right now, bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market stands at about 50 percent. However, he’s confident that this dominance could soon hit the 80 percent mark, meaning roughly 80 percent of the market will be entirely composed of bitcoin. He is also confident that this will happen at around the time that the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/michael-saylor-sec-lawsuits-are-paving-the-way-to-btc-dominance/">lawsuits from the</a> SEC against leading digital currency exchanges Binance and Coinbase reach their pinnacles in the coming months. Saylor said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire industry is kind of destined to be rationalized down to a bitcoin-focused industry, with maybe a half a dozen to a dozen other proof of work tokens.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s not the only one who feels this way. This sentiment is shared by both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the bitcoin billionaires that run the Gemini exchange in New York. They are firm believers that bitcoin is going to “disrupt” the gold market, and that the world’s primary form of crypto will eventually hit a price of about $500K per unit. This would give it a market cap of about $10 trillion.</p>
<p>Cameron Winklevoss chimed in with:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you look at the value increases in bitcoin, it is this punctuated equilibrium where it is steady, steady, steady, and then boom! It reaches a new price level. That is the new normal. So, it could happen very quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>2022 was badly marred by a harsh crypto winter. Things really fell into the depths, with some coins – like BTC – losing approximately 70 percent of their overall value, and the valuation of the general crypto market wound up shedding about $2 trillion over the course of a year.</p>
<h2>Forget About the Crypto Winter!</h2>
<p>However, the brothers were quick to toss this over their shoulders, with Cameron saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is still going to be the best investment of this decade. Bitcoin is [like] a honey badger. Whatever does not kill it makes it stronger, and it has been through a lot.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coin Ex is a digital currency exchange based in Hong Kong. Not long ago, the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/leticia-james-sues-coin-ex-alleging-crypto-fraud/">company was faced</a> with a lawsuit from New York Attorney General Leticia James, who said the firm had violated various financial laws and put traders and investors in danger.</p>
<h2>Coin Ex Settles, Set to Exit America</h2>
<p>Now, it looks like Coin Ex has <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/coinex-settles-for-17-million-ceases-new-york-operations/ar-AA1cCyIJ">agreed to settle with James</a> for nearly $2 million to get the suit off its back. In addition, the company is also ceasing all its U.S. operations, and the American branch of the exchange is facing imminent shutdown.</p>
<p>The lawsuit against Coin Ex was filed in February of this year. Allegations came about that the company had violated what’s known as the Martin Act, which was enacted in 1921 (over 100 years ago). The law disallows the selling and offering of any securities by companies that haven’t registered as dealers, brokers, or salesmen within specific regions or states (in this case, New York).</p>
<p>By allegedly failing to register either with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the company was in violation of the Act and therefore subject to penalties. Leticia James issued a statement regarding the matter that read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s agreement should serve as a warning to crypto companies that there are hefty consequences for ignoring New York’s laws. My office will continue to crack down on crypto companies that brazenly disregard the law, mislead investors, and put New Yorkers at risk… Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency, and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coin Ex has also mentioned that while the lawsuit ultimately contributed to the decision to leave the U.S., the regulatory atmosphere in America has become too convoluted and confusing for it to handle anymore. Thus, the country will no longer be privy to the exchange’s services or product offerings.</p>
<h2>So Many Crypto Companies Victimized</h2>
<p>This sentiment is shared by several digital asset enterprises at the time of writing. For the past several months, agencies like the SEC have employed harsh methods of enforcing regulation. For example, the SEC has filed major lawsuits against large crypto companies like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a>, and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">Kraken</a>. Not long ago, Coinbase even opened an <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-is-now-active-in-bermuda/">office in Bermuda</a> and said it would be focusing more on international crypto trading and activities until the U.S. can get its rules and priorities in place.</p>
<p>Also, Leticia James can act like she’s concerned for investors’ safety all she wants, but the fact remains that, like the SEC, she’s simply made a habit of going after crypto every chance she can. Several firms – including <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-yorks-leticia-james-sues-crypto-firm-nexo/">Nexo</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-york-attorney-generals-office-now-suing-ku-coin-exchange/">Ku Coin</a> – have fallen victim to her wrath and been subjected to heavy financial penalties or other punishments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where will non-fungible tokens (NFTs) <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/nfts-beyond-the-hype-the-future-of-blockchain-identity/ar-AA1cDeXW">be in the next few</a> years?</p>
<h2>NFTs&#8230; Where Will the Future Take Them?</h2>
<p>NFTs were, at one point, the big rage of the crypto industry. They saw a lot of action and activity, and within two or three years, the arena was worth billions of dollars and was all the rage of crypto fanatics. However, since then, NFTs have <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-ordinals-nfts-are-bringing-the-space-back-from-disaster/">taken a serious dive</a>, and we’re not seeing that many people engaged with them anymore.</p>
<p>In a recent roundtable that saw the participation of several NFT creators and experts, the topic of where these pixelated art tokens are going to be in the next five to ten years raised a lot of questions and delivered a few answers. Each of the participants gave their thoughts and ideas on where these tokens will arrive and what traders can potentially expect.</p>
<p>One of them was Jordan Fried, who introduced the idea of a “soul bound token.” This item would be an NFT that is permanently tied to a single person. It cannot be transferred, sold, or disposed of through conventional means. He commented to the moderator of the panel Rob Nelson:</p>
<blockquote><p>It would be the Rob Nelson coin. It&#8217;d be you. It&#8217;d be the roundtable coin for the brand, but it can&#8217;t be transferred. It&#8217;s non-transferrable. Its soul bound. It&#8217;s bound to this account forever, and that&#8217;s likely what will capture identity as it&#8217;s a version of a non-fungible token, but it&#8217;s a non-transferable, non-fungible token… The greatest problem in the NFT space right now is that there&#8217;s no one sitting anywhere in the world saying, ‘If I just had an NFT, that would be the solution to my problem.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of having a token permanently tied to you is a little scary, but Jordan clarified his thoughts a tad more by commenting that these tokens would also be built to resolve various problems being faced by the individual or by the public. He mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>To have a crypto punk meant something about you, but for the technology to actually live up to its promise, you&#8217;re going to have to have NFTs that solve real problems. NFTs that actually have real-world value.</p></blockquote>
<h2>No Real-World Value</h2>
<p>Right now, most non-fungible tokens are simply seen as collectibles. While some have sold for hundreds of thousands of dollars, the “collectible” nature of most NFTs is what Jordan thinks has led to the demise of the space. He commented that they need to be able to tackle certain issues. They must have real-world use if they’re going to carve out a legitimate space for themselves. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;ve got to tokenize actual value as NFTs. Otherwise, the whole purpose of buying an NFT, it&#8217;s just not going to be there for most people.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. government appears to be very anti crypto as of late. Everywhere you look, regulators in the Biden administration are doing what appears to be all they can to ensure bitcoin and crypto don’t have futures in America.</p>
<h2>The U.S. Government and Bitcoin&#8230; It&#8217;s Complicated!</h2>
<p>The SEC, for example, is suing or criminally charging every <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">single digital currency</a> company it can, while Biden is looking to initiate an Obama-era policy that will <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-biden-using-an-obama-era-program-to-ban-btc/">potentially shut all crypto</a> firms out of the traditional finance fray. Thus, it seems like the U.S. government wouldn’t hold much bitcoin and it wouldn’t be <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/us-government-owns-way-more-bitcoin-than-any-other-country-so-why-aren-t-they-selling-it/ar-AA1cDjZk">keeping a private bitcoin</a> stash somewhere… Right?</p>
<p>Wrong. As it turns out, the U.S. government has more than $5 billion in bitcoin secretly hocked away. It’s all illicit bitcoin that representatives have gathered following various seizures over the years, and for one reason or another, they’ve been reluctant to get rid of it or sell it. Why?</p>
<p>Perhaps one reason is because they know <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/inflation/">inflation</a> (which they’re responsible for) is a major issue in the country. They know the dollar is flailing, and they want to have bitcoin as a “backup plan” of sorts because they’re worried about what the prospects of traditional finance are. In many ways, the U.S. government has likely come to see bitcoin as the “safe haven” so many others view it as.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s estimated the U.S. Treasury has more than 207,000 individual bitcoin units stored away somewhere. The money has been garnered over the course of several years through several events, a big one being a Justice Department seizure of more than $1 billion in BTC in 2020. A doctoral thesis written by Sachin Jaitly, a general partner at investment advisory firm Morgan Creek Capital, states the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>By matching publicly available information through the media and blockchain, Elementus is able to map out the universe of sovereign digital wallets and maintain this map over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Elementus is the blockchain startup Morgan Creek is working with to track the history of the U.S.’s bitcoin collecting habits. CEO Max Galka was also quick to throw his two cents in. He commented that the company has, thus far, recorded at least 11 world governments that are holding bitcoin. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>All of that bitcoin is held by those government agencies, but that does not mean that that is the only bitcoin that is held by those governments, nor that other governments are not using bitcoin.</p></blockquote>
<h2>What Other Entities Hold BTC?</h2>
<p>Jaitly concluded with:</p>
<blockquote><p>As money supply was increasing, and as fear of inflation was increasing, bitcoin adoption on a sovereign level was also increasing, and so there was a relationship that was statistically significant.</p></blockquote>
<p>They have also worked to gather information for North Korea, but that data has proven largely unobtainable.</p>
