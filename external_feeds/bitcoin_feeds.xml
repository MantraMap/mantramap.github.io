Putin also called for a cohesive response to the West&#8217;s economic aggression, emphasizing that Russia will strengthen its partnerships with friendly nations and collaborate with foreign partners.</strong></p>
<h2>Putin Plans to Expand Partnerships With Friendly Countries</h2>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin slammed policies in the U.S. and Europe while calling for a cohesive response to the West&#8217;s economic aggression at a meeting with the Council of Legislators on Friday, Russian news outlet Tass reported.</p>
<p>“We are not going to isolate ourselves. On the contrary, we will expand pragmatic, equitable, mutually beneficial relations that are nothing less than partnerships with friendly countries in Eurasia, Africa, Latin America,” Putin said, adding:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the United States, by the way, we have a lot of people that think along the same lines as we do. Same with Europe. The elites behave differently. But we know that the elites in these countries are far from always conducting the policies that benefit the interest of their own people. It will backfire on them.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Russian president also expressed his government&#8217;s willingness to collaborate with foreign partners, including global companies and corporations that &#8220;value their business reputation and want to cooperate with Russia.&#8221;</p>

<p>Putin further stressed: &#8220;Amid the West’s economic aggression, the parliament, the government, and all regional and local authorities must act clearly and quickly and work as one cohesive, well-coordinated team.”</p>
<p>Following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war, Western countries imposed aggressive <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/syrian-official-says-us-imposes-sanctions-to-steal-nations-assets-and-exert-control/">sanctions</a> on Russia. Moreover, the U.S. and its Western allies have seized over $300 billion in Russian central bank foreign currency assets frozen by sanctions.</p>
<p>The economic sanctions and the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/dollar-to-play-lesser-role-due-to-its-weaponization-digital-currencies-economist-jeffrey-sachs-says/">weaponization</a> of the U.S. dollar have led a growing number of countries to <a href="https://news-bitcoin-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/news.bitcoin.com/ecb-president-lagarde-on-de-dollarization-reserve-currency-status-should-no-longer-be-taken-for-granted/">de-dollarize</a> and settle trade in non-USD currencies. The BRICS nations are also working to create a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a>. This week, the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, urged all countries to make efforts to ensure that the “threat of global confrontation, of a hot, full-scale World War III” does not materialize. “World tensions are white-hot indeed,” he <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-calls-for-prevention-of-full-scale-world-war-iii-official-warns-world-tensions-are-white-hot/">warned</a>.</p>

<h2>Member Countries Discuss BRICS Expansion</h2>
<p>Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, stated during a news briefing on Thursday that Russia has been holding regular negotiations with its BRICS partners regarding the group&#8217;s possible expansion, local news outlet Tass reported. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.</p>
<p>Zakharova explained:</p>
<blockquote><p>The entire range of issues associated with this is being discussed at BRICS sherpas and sous-sherpas meetings, and, of course, this requires a thorough analysis and delicate internal work by the five countries to reach a consensus.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Foreign Ministry&#8217;s spokesperson added that while the discussions occur regularly, it is premature to reveal any specifics about the approval procedure at this time.</p>
<p>Emphasizing that the BRICS nations are focusing their attention on the group&#8217;s expansion as the topic is highly relevant at present, Zakharova noted that these issues &#8220;are discussed by the five heads of state and foreign ministers,&#8221; noting that &#8220;Specifically, the declaration adopted at the 14th BRICS summit in Beijing issued instructions to work out appropriate guiding principles, standards, criteria, and procedures.”</p>

<p>Earlier this week, South Africa’s ambassador to the BRICS group, Anil Sooklal, revealed that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-getting-applications-to-join-every-day-attracts-19-requests-before-summit/">19 countries</a> have expressed an interest in joining the BRICS economic bloc. &#8220;What will be discussed is the expansion of BRICS and the modalities of how this will happen,&#8221; he said, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thirteen countries have formally asked to join and another six have asked informally. We are getting applications to join every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BRICS nations have been pushing to gain <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-push-to-expand-global-influence-to-counter-the-wests-destructive-actions/">global influence</a> and shifting away from U.S. dollar reliance. In addition, the economic group is working on creating a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">common currency</a> for member countries. Some economists have warned that a BRICS currency could <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/gofrom/most_popular/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns">erode the USD’s dominance</a>.</p>

While the plan is to abandon the U.S. dollar in mutual payments, participating nations are yet to consider a common currency.</strong></p>
<h2>Shanghai Cooperation Organization to Abandon Dollar in Favor of National Currencies</h2>
<p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is preparing to move away from the U.S. dollar and switch to settlements in the national currencies of its member states. In an interview with the Belarus 1 state TV channel, the bloc’s Deputy Secretary General Grigory Logvinov stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>A roadmap for the transition to settlements in national currencies is being developed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Also quoted by the Interfax news agency, the Russian diplomat emphasized that efforts in that direction are “serious and substantive.”</p>
<p>“The process is far from simple because, unfortunately, the dollar as a world reserve currency is too deeply embedded, including in national currency systems,” Logvinov remarked. To completely abandon the dollar, “there is still a lot to be done and quite a long way to go,” he elaborated.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://eng.sectsco.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCO</a>, which was established in Shanghai in 2001 as a political, economic, and defense alliance, is the world’s largest regional organization, covering approximately 60% of the territory of Eurasia as well as 40% of the planet’s population.</p>
<p>China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan hold full membership at the moment while over a dozen other countries, including Iran, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/saudi-arabia-strengthens-bond-with-china-by-joining-sco-bloc-as-dialogue-partner/">Saudi Arabia</a> and Turkey, are among its observers and partners.</p>

<p>Despite the planned departure from dollar settlements, the introduction of a single currency is not yet being considered by SCO members, Grigory Logvinov noted. “As for the introduction of some kind of single SCO currency, this is not yet the case, and such a goal has not yet been set,” he explained.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reports have <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-nations-working-on-creating-new-currency-to-be-discussed-at-next-leaders-summit/">unveiled</a> that the BRICS group of leading emerging economies, of which China, Russia and India are also members, is working to create a new currency for cross-border payments, with intentions to discuss its development at the BRICS leaders’ summit in August. The prospect of a BRICS currency has fueled concerns in the U.S. about <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-will-erode-us-dollars-dominance-former-white-house-economist-warns/">eroding</a> the dollar’s dominance.</p>

<h2>Terra Classic Community Plans to Take Action to Restore USTC&#8217;s Peg With USD</h2>
<p>Terra Classic blockchain supporters aim to revive the algorithmic stablecoin&#8217;s ecosystem by restoring the token <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terraclassicusd">USTC</a>’s value parity with the U.S. dollar. A Terra Classic community member using the pseudonym &#8220;Redlinedrifter&#8221; submitted the <a href="https://classic-agora.terra.money/t/ustc-incremental-repeg-buybacks-staking-swaps/50966">proposal</a>, affirming that Do Kwon&#8217;s decentralized money creation was a positive initiative but that &#8220;serious issues need to be addressed&#8221; for the community to re-establish the token&#8217;s value peg with the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>Redlinedrifter presented the “Divergence Protocol” idea, which &#8220;operates by applying an algorithmic/dynamic fee equivalent to the difference between the peg and the market price.&#8221; The innovative mechanism would implement a dynamic fee structure to impose a fee proportional to the deviation between the $1 peg and the token&#8217;s market value. The divergence fee structure represents a fresh strategy to tackle previous challenges that hindered the USTC&#8217;s ability to maintain its U.S. dollar peg.</p>

<p>This is not the first time members of the Terra community have proposed revamping Do Kwon&#8217;s stablecoin idea. In October 2022, a new &#8220;soft-pegged stablecoin&#8221; concept built on the Terra Phoenix network was introduced in a <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/following-the-great-ust-collapse-a-defi-project-plans-to-launch-a-soft-pegged-stablecoin-built-on-terra/">white paper</a>. Following the news of USTC&#8217;s revitalization plan, the once-stablecoin asset has increased in value by 9% against the U.S. dollar. After reaching a low of $0.0195 per unit on Friday, USTC has risen to a high of $0.0218 per coin by 1:15 p.m. Eastern Time.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think of Terra Classic&#8217;s proposed Divergence Protocol to re-establish USTC&#8217;s value parity with the U.S. dollar? Do you believe this innovative approach will solve the challenges faced by algorithmic stablecoins? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

Additionally, 11 banks <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bank-outflows-and-concerns-mount-11-banks-bail-out-first-republic-bank-from-collapse/">injected $30 billion</a> into First Republic Bank to strengthen its reserves.</p>

<p>On Friday, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-officials-lead-urgent-rescue-talks-first-republic-sources-2023-04-28/">reported</a> that the U.S. government is coordinating with the bank’s advisers to possibly save First Republic Bank, as talks led by the advisers have yet to reach a deal in the private-sector. This development comes after <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1650944355316772865?s=20">rumors emerged</a> three days earlier that the bank would enter federal receivership. According to Reuters reporters Nupur Anand, Andrea Shalal, and Greg Roumeliotis, three sources familiar with the situation say:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. officials are coordinating urgent talks to rescue First Republic Bank.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Reuters report notes that two sources have revealed that executives from First Republic Bank are actively searching for a rescue deal, and U.S. officials are of the opinion that a private-sector agreement would be &#8220;preferable.&#8221; The collapse of First Republic Bank, the 14th largest bank in the U.S., could lead to further contagion in the banking sector. Moreover, the U.S. central bank is set to release a post-mortem on Silicon Valley Bank this afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are engaged in discussions with multiple parties about our strategic options while continuing to serve our clients,&#8221; First Republic said in a statement to Reuters.</p>

In total, inscription minting fees have amounted to 196.22 bitcoin, equivalent to $5.78 million.</strong></p>
<h2>More Than 2 Million Ordinal Inscriptions Are Now Engraved Into the Bitcoin Blockchain</h2>
<p>The trend of Ordinal inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain continues to grow, with over <a href="https://ordinals.com/inscription/a9084d6e7a83d765a291579de1d5c8bec08114852f87d3089988157abfad5f35i0">2,116,396</a> inscriptions discovered at the time of writing. These inscriptions are composed of various formats such as text, video, images, applications, and audio.</p>
<p>Dune Analytics <a href="https://dune.com/dgtl_assets/bitcoin-ordinals-analysis">statistics</a> reveal that 67.6% of all inscriptions are in text form, while 22.6% are images in the form of JPG or PNG files. Moreover, more than 13,000 Ordinal inscriptions include an application, and over 6,000 image inscriptions are animated. There are several collections of Ordinal inscriptions that have gained popularity and have established floor values and weekly trade volumes.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://ordinalswallet.com/collections">data</a> from ordinalswallet.com, the highest trade volume this week was observed for Clay Pepes, with 4.57 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> or $134,082 in seven-day trade volume. The collections following Clay Pepes in terms of trade volume are Sub-100K, Bitcoin Punks, Pixel Pepes, Sub-10K, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> Machines, respectively. While the Ordinal inscription trend surpassed 2 million inscriptions, it coincided with the discovery of a bug that resulted in the orphaning of 1,200 inscriptions from the index.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT">Leonidas.og</a>, a historian of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), explained that the orphaned inscriptions occurred just before inscription number 420,285. &#x201C;The bug was caused by the ordinals protocol only counting inscriptions that were in the first input of a transaction,&#x201D; the NFT historian added. Furthermore, even with the introduction of new blockchain features such as <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-stamps-emerge-as-new-image-storage-trend-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-over-8000-stamps-minted-so-far/">Bitcoin Stamps</a> and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/litecoin-network-adopts-ordinal-inscriptions-following-bitcoins-lead/">Litecoin-based</a> Ordinal inscriptions, the trend of BTC-based Ordinal inscriptions has not been affected.</p>

<p>Currently, there are just over <a href="https://stampchain.io/">18,500 stamps</a> on the Bitcoin blockchain since the project&#x2019;s inception. On the other hand, Litecoin Ordinal inscriptions have seen more activity with <a href="https://litecoin.earlyordies.com/inscription/4f74af87ecf0d884449ed2f5a5e94f874e5cbd4bbccc2c104dd1ef2e20872480i0">224,060</a> inscriptions, but the trend of LTC-based inscriptions has slowed down in recent times. Despite the introduction of these new features, the popularity of Ordinal inscriptions continues to grow, indicating a strong and resilient market for this type of digital collectible scheme.</p>

The grounds for the raid remain unknown, and neither Salame nor his legal representative have offered any statement concerning the situation.</strong></p>
<h2>FBI Conducts Mysterious Search on Home of Former FTX Executive Ryan Salame</h2>
<p>On April 27, 2023, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/27/technology/ftx-ryan-salame-sam-bankman-fried.html">report</a> from the New York Times revealed that Ryan Salame, the former co-chief of FTX Digital Markets, had his $4 million house in Potomac, Maryland searched on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Salame, who was a key figure at FTX, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/court-documents-say-ftx-boss-ryan-salame-snitched-on-sbf-2-days-before-the-bankruptcy-filing/">informed regulators</a> in the Bahamas that the company was misusing customer funds just days before its collapse, according to court documents. The raid was disclosed by two individuals with knowledge of the matter, as noted by reporters Matthew Goldstein and David Yaffe-Bellany of the Times.</p>
<p>The reason for Thursday’s search remains unknown leaving the motive behind the search a matter of speculation. Ryan Salame, who <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-execs-gave-70-million-to-both-democrats-and-republicans-heading-into-the-2022-us-midterms/">donated</a> more than $22 million to Republican campaigns during the 2022 U.S. election cycle, was a prominent political donor.</p>
<p>Additionally, Salame played a part in FTX Ventures Ltd., a subsidiary of FTX, which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftxs-odd-relationship-with-vertical-farming-firms-a-look-at-exchange-boss-ryan-salames-and-bahamian-pm-philip-davis-trip-to-80-acres/">invested $25 million</a> in 80 Acres Farms, an Ohio-based vertical farming company. While it&#8217;s unclear what the investment&#8217;s objective was, Salame was involved in the process.</p>

<p>According to The Times&#8217; report, Salame&#8217;s legal representative declined to provide a statement in response to the request, and the FBI also refused to comment on the issue. At 7 a.m. Eastern Time, the search was conducted, and sources forwarded snapshots of FBI agents stationed outside Salame&#8217;s residence in Maryland during the operation.</p>
<p>Salame has not faced any criminal charges or been formally accused of wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, is currently awaiting trial for multiple criminal counts. Three executives from FTX and its affiliate trading company, Alameda Research, have pleaded guilty to charges related to their activities.</p>
<p><em><strong>What could be the possible reasons behind the FBI&#8217;s search of Ryan Salame&#8217;s home, and how might this development affect the ongoing investigations and trials related to FTX and its executives? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.</strong></em></p>

The assessment refers to a period prior to the rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS when the authority viewed the troubled giant’s preparedness in positive terms.</strong></p>
<h2>2 Swiss Banks Unable to Implement Recovery Plans, Finma Finds</h2>
<p>The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (Finma) considers insufficient the crisis plans of two of Switzerland’s main banks, Reuters reported. The regulator is not certain if Zürcher Kantonalbank (ZKB) and Postfinance will be manage to continue to operate in case of a crisis.</p>
<p>ZKB’s emergency plan is not yet ready to implement as the bank has not reserved sufficient capital for recapitalization while Postfinance “must realign its emergency recapitalization strategy,” Finma stated in an <a href="https://www.finma.ch/en/news/2023/04/20240406-mm-resolution-berichterstattung/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The two are among the country’s five “systematically important banks,” along with Credit Suisse, UBS, and Raiffeisen. The assessment is based on their crisis planning documents submitted in 2022 and evaluated at the end of the year. It does not take into account the merger of Credit Suisse and UBS.</p>
<p>In mid-March, Credit Suisse <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/on-the-brink-of-a-new-trend-credit-suisse-receives-50-billion-swiss-franc-bailout-from-swiss-national-bank/">shares dropped</a> to a record low amid loss of investor confidence. The bank borrowed $54 billion from the Swiss National Bank and UBS came to its rescue with a state-backed acquisition <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ubs-considers-acquiring-credit-suisse-requests-government-backstop-in-deal/">proposal</a>. Last year, Finma still viewed its emergency plan as ready to implement.</p>
<p>Finma CEO Urban Angehrn commented that the events surrounding Credit Suisse show how important it is to make concrete preparations for crises. “The authorities had options on the table with the restructuring plan and with the emergency plan that simply did not exist 10 years ago,” he pointed out while also emphasizing:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear that there are important lessons to be learned from the Credit Suisse crisis for future crisis preparations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finma will contribute to this objective, Angehrn insisted. His statements come after the regulatory body rejected accusations for the problems at Switzerland’s second-largest bank. Its representatives insisted that their reaction has been quick and asked for even more powers.</p>
<p>In its Resolution report, the authority also noted that for the first time Raiffeisen’s emergency plan meets its requirements to be able to perform critical functions even it was facing the risk of insolvency. “Raiffeisen can provide sufficient capital to be recapitalized and continue in the event of a crisis,” Finma concluded.</p>
