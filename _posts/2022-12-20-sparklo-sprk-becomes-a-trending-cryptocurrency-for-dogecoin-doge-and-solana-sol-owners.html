<p class="s3">Because of the recent bear market, most cryptocurrency investors are quite scared to get their hands on investments. </p>
<p class="s3">While the bear market has affected some of the best-performing cryptocurrencies, such as Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE), new cryptocurrency projects, such as Sparklo, have emerged to fill in the gap. </p>
<p class="s3">Solana (SOL) Growth Drops By Almost 90%</p>
<p class="s3">Solana (SOL) creates a layer-one smart contract for taking cryptocurrency investments to the next level. With this, many cryptocurrency investors started paying attention to Solana (SOL). </p>
<p class="s3">However, the recent market conditions have been terrible for Solana (SOL) investors. The current trading value of SOL token is around 90% low when compared to its previous all-time high. And according to experts, this will not rise in the near future. </p>
<p class="s3">Dogecoin (DOGE) Value Has Also Dropped By Around 90%</p>
<p class="s3">Another similar cryptocurrency struggling from the bear market is Dogecoin (DOGE). This is a cryptocurrency that has an excellent history as a meme coin. Even though Dogecoin (DOGE) is still the most popular meme coin in the world, there will be better decisions than investing in it. That&rsquo;s because the market value has dropped by around 90%. Even active investors of Dogecoin (DOGE) are giving up on their investments.</p>
<p class="s3">Sparklo (SPRK) Is An Ideal Option For Investment</p>
<p class="s3">With Dogecoin (DOGE) and Solana (SOL) dropping their value significantly due to the bear market, investors are looking for a more promising alternative investment, like Sparklo. Sparklo, currently in its presale stage, was able to grab the attention of newbies and professional crypto investors. </p>
<p class="s3">As a cryptocurrency protocol, Sparklo aims to be the first investment platform to allow its members to invest in gold, silver, and platinum bars. Each investment will result in an NFT being minted and fractionalized.</p>
<p class="s3">The current price of Sparklo is only $0.013, and it is expected to increase by 4,000% soon.</p>
<p class="s3">Given its potential growth, there is no doubt that Sparklo will eventually become a blue-chip crypto.</p>
