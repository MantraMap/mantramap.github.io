<p>Last weekend&#8217;s recovery in the Shiba Inu price faced supply pressure at a downsloping resistance trendline.

If no improvement is initiated in market sentiment, the dynamic resistance may pressurize the Dog-themed memecoin to lower prices. <a class="mh-excerpt-more" href="https://coingape.com/markets/shiba-inu-price-recovery-halts-at-0-0000077-resistance-breakout-or-reversal/" title="Shiba Inu Price Recovery Halts at $0.0000077 Resistance; Bullish Breakout or Reversal? "></a></p>
