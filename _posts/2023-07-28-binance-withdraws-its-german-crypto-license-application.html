<p>Binance officially withdrew its application for a crypto license in Germany after regulators denied the exchange&rsquo;s application in June. </p>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance confirmed it has &ldquo;proactively withdrawn&rdquo; its application for a crypto license in Germany.</p>
German Regulators Deny Binance&rsquo;s Application
<p>Reports indicate that Binance officially withdrew its BaFin application. Reuters cites a spokesperson for the exchange who said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance confirms it has proactively withdrawn its BaFin (Germany&rsquo;s financial regulator) application. The situation, both in the global market and regulation, has changed significantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance still intends to apply for appropriate licensing in Germany, but it is essential that our submission accurately reflects these changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Crypto news website CoinDesk first reported Binance&rsquo;s application withdrawal.</p>
<p>German-based Finance Fwd website reported last month that Germany&rsquo;s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) either officially denied Binance crypto custody licence application or verbally informed the exchange of its decision. A spokesperson for the exchange said at the time:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if we cannot share details of our discussions with the regulators, we will continue to work to meet Bafin&rsquo;s requirements. It is an ongoing process.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are confident that we have the right team and the appropriate measures to continue our discussions with the regulatory authorities in Germany.&rdquo;</p>

Regulatory Pressure Catches Up
<p>Binance has been met with regulatory challenges after the US SEC sued the exchange and its CEO, Changpeng &lsquo;CZ&rsquo; Zhao, alleging it violated US securities laws and operated a &ldquo;web of deception.&rdquo; The exchange and its CEO vehemently deny the SEC allegations.</p>
<p>The exchange is facing further difficulties as it exits the Netherlands after failing to meet the requirements to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license.</p>
<p>Binance is also under investigation by French financial regulators and has been since 2022. The investigation reported centres around &ldquo;acts of illegal exercise of the function of service provider on digital assets (PSAN), and acts of aggravated money laundering.&rdquo;</p>
