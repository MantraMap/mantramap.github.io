					<description><![CDATA[Shiba Inu has substantially recovered over the last week; it surged over 20% in the same timeframe. Over the last 24 hours, SHIB has appreciated by 2.9%, but despite the rise in value, the coin has remained stuck below the $0.000011 mark. The coin broke above its stern resistance mark of $0.000010, which had not been breached for the past two months. SHIB was trading within an ascending parallel chain, which showed bullishness; however, the coin was currently outside the ascending trendline. Related Reading: Myth Buster: Ethereum Shanghai Hard Fork Won’t Create Major Selling Pressure As it moved out of the ascending trendline, it could not break past its immediate resistance level. The technical outlook of the coin still depicts bullishness on the chart for SHIB. Shiba Inu was overvalued at the time of writing, and if a coin is overbought, there are chances of a price correction. This could be true if the coin does not break past the $0.000011 level. Currently, SHIB is trading 87% below its all-time high of 2021. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.0000106 at the time of writing. The altcoin moved outside the ascending parallel line and experienced resistance at $0.000011. Overhead resistance for Shiba Inu was at $0.0000108; a move above that level can push SHIB to breach the $0.000011 mark. The $0.0000112 mark has previously acted as a strong resistance for the coin. If the coin fails to move above the resistance line, it could fall to $0.0000100 and then to $0.0000097 before rising again. This could also present a shorting opportunity to the traders. The amount of SHIB traded in the last session was green depicting bullish momentum. Technical Analysis SHIB has managed to secure a multi-month high regarding demand. The Relative Strength Index was at 80, which meant that the asset was overvalued and buyers exceeded sellers. The last time the indicator touched the 80-mark was in August 2022, leading to a price correction. The asset price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line and was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line as buyers drove the price momentum. Shiba Inu, however, struggled to move above the 200-SMA line (green). The altcoin price may remain congested during the following trading sessions due to lateral trading. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed green bars tied to buy signals for the coin. The last signal declined in strength, indicating that buying the asset might not be the right decision. The Directional Movement Index was positive, as the +DI (blue) line was above the -DI (orange) line. Related Reading: Myth Buster: Ethereum Shanghai Hard Fork Won’t Create Major Selling Pressure The Average Directional Index shot up near 40, depicting strength in the current price action. This meant that the overall SHIB was positive, but as the coin was restricted under the 200-SMA, there could be continued consolidation, leading to a loss of value.

<p>The altcoin price may remain congested during the following trading sessions due to lateral trading. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed green bars tied to buy signals for the coin.</p>
<p>The last signal declined in strength, indicating that buying the asset might not be the right decision. The Directional Movement Index was positive, as the +DI (blue) line was above the -DI (orange) line.</p>

<p>The Average Directional Index shot up near 40, depicting strength in the current price action. This meant that the overall SHIB was positive, but as the coin was restricted under the 200-SMA, there could be continued consolidation, leading to a loss of value.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Solana is enjoying a positive start to 2023 after spending most of 2022 in decline due to the crypto winter. Also, SOL&#8217;s exposure to FTX caused its price to decline rapidly following the FTX saga in November 2022. SOL has also been a beneficiary of the crypto market upturn as it continues its climb back to the top. Although it is still off its all-time high  (ATH) value, it has shown positive signs in 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin aSOPR Again Retests Bull-Bear Junction Level, Will Resistance Break This Time? What Is Driving The Solana Price Increase?  Solana has launched a series of innovative projects that have increased interest among the crypto community. SolanaMobile announced on Twitter its plans to unveil the Solana Mobile stack and Saga phones. This mobile device intends to provide users with easy access to the blockchain. They assured their users of its availability for early 2023. Also, Solana offers its users a seamless payment protocol launched in February 2022. Brands such as @FastAF and @ASICSamerica, use this innovation. The payment channel allows merchants to interact on a secure blockchain and process payments efficiently. Moreover, the Solana network has become a developer&#8217;s hub as 2053 active developers worked on the blockchain in December 2022. These developers take advantage of the network’s unique proof-of-history mechanism to develop innovative apps on the network. The network prides itself on being carbon neutral since it does not rely on energy-intensive methods like proof-of-work. It means that the project aligns with environmental goals. The SOL network also progressed with Web3 advancement teaming up with Brave. Solana was integrated into the Brave browser, making it easier for more people to participate in the Web3 trend.  These factors, and other macroeconomic factors such as inflation decline, have aided the price improvement noted in SOL. Investors will hope that the rally continues without any setbacks from external factors. Solana Price Prediction Solana is currently trading at $23.18 in the crypto market. On the price charts, more green candlesticks are showing increased bullish momentum. SOL trades above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and below its 200-day (SMA). This pattern suggests the rally might be short live. However, SOL is close to its 200-day SMA and will likely surpass it in the coming days. The support levels are $20.53, $21.57, and $22.58. The resistance levels are $24.64, $25.68, and $26.69. Solana is currently testing the $24.63 level, with a slight pullback present in its uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the overbought zone at 79.29; the RSI might retrace and fall into the neutral zone. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is currently above its signal line and showing a bullish signal. Solana will likely continue its rise in the coming days.

					<description><![CDATA[Data shows the Bitcoin Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is retesting the historical bull-bear junction. Will a break be found this time? Bitcoin aSOPR Is Currently Doing Another Rest Of 1.0 Level As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, a successful retest here could suggest a meaningful regime shift in the BTC market. The &#8220;Spent Output Profit Ratio&#8221; (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder in the market is moving coins at some profit currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold imply the overall market is realizing some loss at the moment. The SOPR being exactly equal to 1 naturally suggests that investors are just breaking even on their selling right now. A modified version of this indicator is the &#8220;Adjusted SOPR&#8221; (aSOPR), which filters out all selling of coins that was done within only an hour of said coins being first acquired. The main advantage of this modification is that it removes noise from the data that wouldn&#8217;t have any noticeable impacts on the market anyways. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) Bitcoin aSOPR over the last couple of years: The 7-day EMA value of the metric seems to have gone up in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 3, 2023 As shown in the above graph, the 7-day EMA Bitcoin aSOPR has sharply risen recently and has reached the 1 level for the first time since the pre-FTX crash. This level has been historically significant for BTC, as the crypto has often encountered resistance at it during bear market periods. Related Reading: Why A Morning Star Reversal Could Awaken A Monster Bitcoin Rally The reason behind this is the fact that the aSOPR equal to 1 line represents the break-even mark. Whenever the metric increases to this mark, it means enough holders are back in a state of neutrality that they are able to recoup their investment. Psychologically, investors see this as getting their previously lost money &#8220;back&#8221; and hence large-scale dumping takes place here, thus providing impedance to the crypto&#8217;s price. Related Reading: Glassnode Points Out This Bizarre Consistency In Bitcoin Cycles A successful break above this level would suggest, however, that there is enough demand in the Bitcoin market right now that holders are able to realize their profits and buyers are present to absorb this selling. Because of this, such breaks have usually led to a transition from bear to bull markets. When bull markets take hold, the effect of the aSOPR 1 level flips, and the line instead starts providing support to the price of BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $21,200, up 23% in the last week. Looks like the rally has come to a halt since hitting the $21,000 level &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The broader cryptocurrency market has seen improvement in investor sentiment in the last weeks, and so has XRP. Even the global crypto market cap is up by 0.11%, reflecting the rate at which most tokens are rallying over the past few days. A recent WhaleAlert report reveals massive XRP whale transfers happening amid the token&#8217;s price surge. The report showed the movement of nearly 429 million tokens (about $167 million) on multiple whale addresses in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: ETH Whales Scoop Up SAND – Up Nearly 80% – For Its Highly Bought Crypto Menu According to the WhaleAlert, the largest single whale transaction was a transfer of 209 million XRP worth approximately $81 million. The crypto whales added $49 million (about 123 million XRP) in multiple transactions. One whale address accumulated 94.3 million tokens ($38 million) in a transaction from Binance. XRP Makes Top 1,000 BSC Whales List Following Price Surge Ripple&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, XRP, has recorded a price increase of nearly 12% in the past seven days. Its trading volume has also added by 55% and is now at $1.3 billion. Despite the long-running lawsuit from the SEC against Ripple, XRP&#8217;s market cap remained unfazed, being over $19.5 billion. However, WhaleAlert recorded outflows of Ripple&#8217;s native coin on several whale addresses. Several whales moved 97 million of Ripple&#8217;s native coin worth approximately $37 million to the Bitstamp crypto exchange. Aside from the massive whale addresses activity, WhaleStats also reported that XRP tokens ranked the second largest cryptocurrency by dollar value held by the top 1,000 BSC (Binance Smart Chain) whales. The biggest BSC whale now holds about $27.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. According to recent data, XRP secured its place on the top 10 purchased cryptocurrencies by the largest BSC whales. It also made the list of the most traded token by BSC whales. ChatGPT Gives Surprising XRP Price Prediction For March 2023 Meanwhile, Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, recently shared a ChatGPT conversation on Ripple&#8217;s native coin via a tweet. ChatGPT is an AI model chatbot developed by OpenAI. It launched on November 2022. Martin Hiesboeck shared a snapshot of his conversation with the ChatGPT, where he asked the robot about XRP&#8217;s moon date. After refusing to answer initially, ChatGPT told the Uphold executive that Ripple&#8217;s native coin would moon on March 23, 2023. It also added what looked like a price prediction saying, &#8220;XRP to $589,000, up yours XRPP.&#8221; This response cracked members of Ripple&#8217;s native coin community up with laughter. Some community members responded with laughter emojis, while few saw it as a forecast that the XRP price might moon. Hiesboeck even wrote that the all-knowing AI ChatGPT has revealed when the token will moon after much persuasion. John Deaton, blockchain enthusiast and founder of CryptoLaw, also reacted to Hiesboeck’s post, citing what people said about the $589,000 price for Ripple&#8217;s native coin. Many predictions have suggested that the crypto may hit the $100 but deemed the $589,000 price unrealistic. Related Reading: Polkadot: Why Recent On-Chain Feats Could Trigger Strong Investor Sentiment Some say Ripple&#8217;s native coin would need to rally almost 200 million percent from its current price before reaching $589,000. However, most analysts might be waiting for the verdict of the Ripple/SEC lawsuit before making predictions. According to data from CoinGecko, Ripple&#8217;s native coin has gained 11.4% in the past seven days and 13.5% in the past 14 days. However, the token trades at $0.3876.

<p>Martin Hiesboeck shared a snapshot of his conversation with the ChatGPT, where he asked the robot about XRP&#8217;s moon date. After refusing to answer initially, ChatGPT told the Uphold executive that Ripple&#8217;s native coin would moon on March 23, 2023. It also added what looked like a price prediction saying, &#8220;XRP to $589,000, up yours XRPP.&#8221;</p>
<p>This response cracked members of Ripple&#8217;s native coin community up with laughter. Some community members responded with laughter emojis, while few saw it as a forecast that the XRP price might moon. Hiesboeck even wrote that the all-knowing AI ChatGPT has revealed when the token will moon after much persuasion.</p>
<p>John Deaton, blockchain enthusiast and founder of CryptoLaw, also reacted to Hiesboeck’s post, citing what people said about the $589,000 price for Ripple&#8217;s native coin. Many predictions have suggested that the crypto may hit the $100 but deemed the $589,000 price unrealistic.</p>

<p>Some say Ripple&#8217;s native coin would need to rally almost 200 million percent from its current price before reaching $589,000. However, most analysts might be waiting for the verdict of the Ripple/SEC lawsuit before making predictions.</p>

<p>According to data from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CoinGecko</a>, Ripple&#8217;s native coin has gained 11.4% in the past seven days and 13.5% in the past 14 days. However, the token trades at $0.3876.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[With the &#8220;Merge&#8221;, the Ethereum blockchain successfully mastered the biggest upgrade in its history on September 15 last year. Even before the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS), investors were able to stake ETH to receive rewards. However, the prerequisite was that a minimum of 32 ETH had to be staked and could not be accessed until the next upgrade, meaning the ETH could be unstaked. This changes with the Shanghai hard fork, which is tentatively scheduled for March this year. As NewsBTC reported, the upgrade is not only causing excitement, but also concern that large investors may dump their ETH on the market when they can get their hands on their tokens for the first time in over two years, in some cases. However, the narrative of a dump is a myth as most people still don&#8217;t know how the exit queue works. Researcher Westie posted a thread via Twitter to explain the mechanism. According to him, the withdrawal period on Ethereum works dynamically and is not static like on other PoS networks (where there is a fixed withdrawal period for stakers, which on Cosmos, for example, is set at 21 days). This Is Why An Ethereum Dump Won&#8217;t Happen The period depends on how many validators drop out at a given time. In addition, Ethereum validators who exit the validator set must go through two stages: the exit queue and the withdrawal period. The initial queue is determined by the number of all validators and the quotient of the churn limit, set at 2^16 (65,536). Assuming there are 500,000 validators, the churn limit would be set at 7 according the analysis: 500,000 / 65,536 = 7.62, which rounds down to 7. This means that as the number of ETH validators increases, the churn limit also increases. It increases by 1 in each interval of 65536 (above the minimum threshold). Once a validator has successfully passed through the exit queue, the validator must also wait for a queue time based on when the validator is slashed. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gearing For Lift-Off to $1,800: Rally Isn’t Over Yet &#8220;If the Ethereum validator was not slashed, this withdrawal period would take 256 epochs (~27 hours) If they were slashed, it would take 8,192 epochs (~36 days). This large discrepancy is meant to disincentive bad actors,&#8221; according to the analyst. Based on these parameters, Westie concludes: If ⅓ of the entire validator set were to try and exit in one day, it would take at least 97 days to complete. To expect the same withdrawal time as most Cosmos chains, 21 days, it would take between 6.3% and 7.2% of the validator set to be in the exit queue at one time. Nevertheless, the calculation is only an estimate. As the analyst explains, forecasting is difficult. However, there is a high chance that the queue will be very long at first, 70 days or more, because there is recycling of validators, according to the researcher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Monthly High And Turns Deflationary Again The reason for this is that large players need to change their current Ethereum participation situation, as many of the practices from two years ago are now outdated &#8211; with better staking solutions available. &#8220;However, over time I expect it to converge to a small but sustainable amount. I don&#8217;t expect the withdrawal period to be as large as Cosmos&#8217; over a long enough time period, but we will certainly get a better gauge once the withdrawals are live,&#8221; the researcher says. For the Ethereum price, this means that the chance of a dump because all stakers sell their ETH at the same time is close to zero. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,568, approaching the crucial weekly resistance around $1,600. Featured image from Milad Fakurian / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As Bitcoin continues its strong rally, $22,400 could be the level to watch next, if this on-chain metric is anything to go by. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Realized Price Is Currently Around $22,400 According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC broke through all three realized prices of the market back in April 2019. To understand the concept of &#8220;realized price,&#8221; the realized cap needs to be looked at first. The realized cap is a capitalization model for BTC that values each coin in circulation at the price it was last transacted. This is different from the usual market cap, which puts the value of all tokens at the same current price of Bitcoin. When the market cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the BTC price is obtained, a fact that isn&#8217;t unexpected at all, as the market cap is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins to start with. However, if this same idea is applied to the realized cap (that is if it&#8217;s divided by the number of coins), a sort of &#8220;realized price&#8221; can be derived. The significance of this price is that it&#8217;s the cost basis of the average holder in the Bitcoin market. The implication of this is that if the (normal) price of BTC declines under this realized price, the average investor can be thought to have entered into a state of loss.

However, in the most recent rally, the crypto has so far managed to break above the STH cost basis ($18,000), as well as that of the entire market ($19,700).

					<description><![CDATA[Algorand is one of the fastest growing crypto in terms of gains. According to CoinGecko, the token has appreciated by 30% in the last two weeks. With the broader crypto market rallying as Bitcoin breaks its crucial $21,000 resistance, ALGO is set to gain more in the next few days.  The Total Value Locked department is where the ecosystem gained the most. According to DeFiLlama, Algorand’s TVL yesterday hit $177 million in value. This uptick in TVL is a bullish indicator that the ecosystem still has the momentum to reach new milestones.  However, the token might be on shaky ground as the bears test its current support at $0.2275.  Related Reading: Polkadot Shows No Sign Of Slowing, As DOT Gains 33% In Last 7 Days Image: Forkast Algorand Developments On-Chain Algorand’s G6 governance commitment period ended yesterday, January 16. According to Algorand blockchain explorer, AlgoExplorer, more than 4.1 billion ALGO is staked by over 31,763 governors.  Image: DeFiLlama The ecosystem would pay back the governors with an annual return rate of 6.52%. This way of governance makes the Algorand ecosystem stay true to the tenets of decentralized finance. To add to this bullishness, the ecosystem also processed its 1 billionth transaction.  With the ecosystem able to handle more than 2,881 swaps on-chain, Algorand is expected to continue growing in popularity.

The rejection at $0.2418 would delay ALGO’s recovery. With the token’s support at $0.2365 broken, ALGO investors should be able to buy the current dip in price as analysts are still bullish with the token’s price movement.  With improving macro trends, investors and traders are more likely to enter riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Not to mention that Bitcoin, the face of the crypto market, has broken through crucial resistance at $21k. With ALGO’s high correlation to BTC, ALGO can ride Bitcoin’s rally to reach higher highs.  Investors and traders should watch the current market situation of ALGO as the token’s current price position as the ecosystem has been having trouble maintaining a social presence.  ALGO total market cap at $1.6 billion on the daily chart &#124; Chart: TradingView.com Related Reading: TRON Snags No. 2 Spot In TVL As Revenue Spikes Despite Bear Market Pressure ALGO holders should also watch Bitcoin’s price rise in the next few days or weeks. The $21k resistance break wiped out the lost ground following the collapse of FTX. If BTC continues its bullish recovery in the next few weeks or days, ALGO can ride the upward wave.  But with the token facing a slight correction, this bullish break might be delayed as the bears retest the current support at $0.2275. If the bears win the struggle, the token’s recovery will inevitably be delayed. Featured image from ThoughtCo]]></description>

With the broader crypto market <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/new-year-new-rally-why-bitcoin-is-up-26-this-month-after-a-tumultuous-2022/ar-AA16pbIT" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">rallying</a> as Bitcoin breaks its crucial $21,000 resistance, ALGO is set to gain more in the next few days. </p>
<p>The Total Value Locked department is where the ecosystem gained the most. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Algorand" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeFiLlama</a>, Algorand’s TVL yesterday hit $177 million in value. This uptick in TVL is a bullish indicator that the ecosystem still has the momentum to reach new milestones. </p>
<p>However, the token might be on shaky ground as the bears test its current support at $0.2275. </p>

<h2><strong>Algorand Developments On-Chain</strong></h2>
<p>Algorand’s G6 governance commitment period ended yesterday, January 16. According to Algorand blockchain explorer, <a href="https://algoexplorer.io/governance" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AlgoExplorer</a>, more than 4.1 billion ALGO is staked by over 31,763 governors. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-516417 size-large" src="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48-860x238.png" alt="" width="860" height="238" srcset="https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48-860x238.png 860w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48-460x127.png 460w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48-768x213.png 768w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48-750x208.png 750w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48-1140x316.png 1140w, https://newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-48.png 1382w" sizes="(max-width: 860px) 100vw, 860px" /></p>

<p>The ecosystem would pay back the governors with an annual return rate of 6.52%. This way of governance makes the Algorand ecosystem stay true to the tenets of decentralized finance. To add to this bullishness, the ecosystem also processed its 1 billionth transaction. </p>
<p>With the ecosystem able to handle more than <a href="https://twitter.com/Axetrax22/status/1614363073292165129?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2,881 swaps</a> on-chain, Algorand is expected to continue growing in popularity.</p>

<h2><strong>Can ALGO Continue Its Climb? </strong></h2>
<p>The token is currently trading at $0.2329, a nearly 1% decrease from yesterday’s $0.2341 price. The rejection at $0.2418 would delay ALGO’s recovery. With the token’s support at $0.2365 broken, ALGO investors should be able to buy the current dip in price as <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarVibex/status/1614453091746684929?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">analysts</a> are still bullish with the token’s price movement. </p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64290162.amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">improving</a> macro trends, investors and traders are more likely to enter <a href="https://www.buyucoin.com/crypto-labs/is-investing-in-cryptocurrency-risky-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">riskier</a> assets like cryptocurrencies. Not to mention that Bitcoin, the face of the crypto market, has broken through crucial resistance at $21k. With ALGO’s high correlation to BTC, ALGO can ride Bitcoin’s rally to reach higher highs. </p>
<p>Investors and traders should watch the current market situation of ALGO as the token’s current price position as the ecosystem has been having trouble <a href="https://lunarcrush.com/coins/algo/algorand?metric=social_score%2Csocial_volume" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">maintaining</a> a social presence. </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ONdSDw4C/" width="2047" height="979" /></p>




<p>ALGO holders should also watch Bitcoin’s price rise in the next few days or weeks. The $21k resistance break wiped out the lost ground following the <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=e5065d691ab1f027JmltdHM9MTY3MzkxMzYwMCZpZ3VpZD0wMDcxNGJlNS0zYzkwLTYyNWUtMjNhNC01OTc3M2Q5MTYzOTImaW5zaWQ9NTE3OQ&amp;ptn=3&amp;hsh=3&amp;fclid=00714be5-3c90-625e-23a4-59773d916392&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW52ZXN0b3BlZGlhLmNvbS93aGF0LXdlbnQtd3Jvbmctd2l0aC1mdHgtNjgyODQ0Nw&amp;ntb=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">collapse</a> of FTX. If BTC continues its bullish recovery in the next few weeks or days, ALGO can ride the upward wave. </p>
<p>But with the token facing a slight correction, this bullish break might be delayed as the bears retest the current support at $0.2275. If the bears win the struggle, the token’s recovery will inevitably be delayed.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has always been the most evolving sector in the Web3 space. With new innovations and protocols popping up in the DeFi industry, the ecosystem total value locked (TVL) continued to increase until the bear market stepped in.  The bear cycle caused a lot of downturns in many sectors of the We3 industry including DeFi. However, following the ongoing so-called ‘mini bull run,’ we’ve seen DeFi TVL start to recover from the lower lows and surge by nearly 20% since the beginning of the year.  DeFi TVL Surges Nearly 20% According to data from DeFiLlama, DeFi TVL has exceeded $45 billion — its highest point in the past two months. Major DeFi protocols such as Lido Finance and MakerDAO played a significant role in the DeFi TVL rise. Lido has amassed double-digit gains over the past week, adding $8.4 billion to the DeFi ecosystem since its lower low late last year.  Though the TVL rise appears to be mirroring the crypto rally as most of the underlying DeFi tokens have also followed suit in the bullish trend, one thing worth noting is that DeFi TVL is still very far from its all-time high seen in 2021.  Notably, Liquid staking protocol like Lido Finance is the accelerator of the DeFi ecosystem surge, having the largest DeFi market share with 14.75% dominance and leaving the former king of DeFi, MakerDAO, behind with a share of 13.25%, according to DeFiLlama. As reported by NewsBTC, the reason behind the rapid increase in the momentum of Lido is the Ethereum Merge, which triggered the popularity of liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance. Following the merge, the total ETH stake in Lido increased 10% from 4.43 million ETH on September 15, 2022, the date of the merge, to over 4.8 million ETH today. Related Reading: Lido DAO (LDO) Token Outperforms Market With 62% Weekly Gains Other Accelerator Of The DeFi TVL Rise Aside from Lido&#8217;s aid in the DeFi TVL surge, the high-throughput layer-1 blockchain network, Algorand, has also been an assistant following its 123% spike over the past week. It currently has $176 million in TVL, with five of the top six leading DeFi protocols on the network having done significant percentages in gains over the past 7 days. AlgoFi is up 121% in the last 7 days. Folks Finance is up 490%, Pact 136%, and GARD 202%, driving massive momentum into the ecosystem.  Related Reading: Uniswap Tops Other Big Crypto In Social Dominance Despite Price Drop Aave and Uniswap have always contributed greatly to the DeFi ecosystem TVL, with Aave recording over 10% in gains in the last 7 days and Uniswap recording nearly 7% in gains over the same period. Regarding blockchain, Ethereum is still the top dog with the largest share in the DeFi TVL. Ethereum has a DeFi market share of over 50%, with a TVL of $27.16 billion. ETH has amassed significant gains in its value in the past few days amid the global market rally.  ETH finally broke the $1,300 zone and has climbed to a higher high above $1,500. Though ETH is still far from its peak, the second-largest crypto by market cap is striving to reach its ATH and beyond. Featured image from Freepiks, chart from TradingView]]></description>
