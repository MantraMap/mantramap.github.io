<p>With growing inflationary fears and worries about the fundamental health of the banking sector, digital assets have never been more appealing. On-chain data shows hundreds of thousands of fresh wallets being created by new users, and analysts believe that The Sandbox (SAND), Chiliz(CHZ), and Collateral Network (COLT) will be the biggest gainers in 2023. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) and easy pick with first mover advantageAnalysts stated that Collateral Network (COLT) was an easy pick given its first mover advantage in real-world asset narrative. The protocol leads a new standard in the DeFi lending space, being the first to integrate real-world assets. Asset owners can leverage institutional-level liquidity on Collateral Network (COLT) and unlock capital from their assets. Collateral Network (COLT) uses 100% asset-backed NFTs to achieve this and powers new liquidity options for owners worldwide. Collateral Network (COLT) delivers much-needed updates to the asset-backed lending industry famously held back by bureaucracy and allows permissionless access to its services. Functioning as a multi-sided platform, borrowers unlock liquidity, lenders earn passive income on stable assets, and it opens the path for millions, perhaps billions of dollars, to be onboarded into DeFi. Analysts have forecast a 3,500% surge in the coming weeks. With plans to launch on various major centralized exchanges featured in the protocol&rsquo;s roadmap, several analysts further predicted 100X for early presale participants. </p>

<p>Is The Sandbox (SAND) a good investment?The Sandbox (SAND) is a metaverse open economy allowing users to interact digitally and own their gaming experience through holding NFTs. The Sandbox (SAND) is one of the big three metaverse land brokers, and all land purchases require The Sandbox (SAND) native token, giving it a great source of buy pressure. Analysts expect The Sandbox (SAND) to trade between $1.07 and $1.27 in 2023, citing increased curiosity in the metaverse. The Sandbox (SAND) underwent a brutal period in 2022 as metaverse funding dried up, but with bolstered market sentiment, funding slowly returns to The Sandbox (SAND) and other metaverse projects. The Sandbox (SAND) has also recently worked on integrating new NFT projects into its metaverse, such as CyberKongz. The ability to use an NFT as an avatar naturally gives more people a reason to visit The Sandbox (SAND) and could drive significant growth in 2023. </p>
<p>How much could Chiliz (CHZ) be worth?Chiliz (CHZ) blends blockchain and sports. It gives fans a more direct role in club governance and allows sports teams to monetize their supporter base more effectively. Fans purchase Chiliz(CHZ) tokens and exchange them for club-specific tokens on the Socios platform. Chiliz (CHZ) remains the most significant sports and entertainment crypto project and recently launched its own layer one blockchain. Analysts expect Chiliz (CHZ) could trade between $0.22 and $0.28 by the end of the year, listing the massive partnerships Chiliz (CHZ) has secured to validate their bullish predictions. The most recent partnership Chiliz (CHZ) engaged in was with Sony Pictures for the launch of Spider-Man, and with this caliber of partnership, Chiliz (CHZ) could take off in 2023.</p>
