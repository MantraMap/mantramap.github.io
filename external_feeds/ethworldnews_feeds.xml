<ul><li>The Russian government has abandoned the plan to launch a national cryptocurrency exchange. </li><li>The country will instead establish a regulatory regime for crypto trading platforms. </li><li>Russian authorities intend to use the country’s crypto exchange to facilitate cross-border transactions. </li><li>The country&#8217;s Central Bank will likely be in charge of regulating the crypto exchanges. </li></ul>



<p>Russia’s ambitious plan to establish a national cryptocurrency exchange has come to an end just six months after it was initially unveiled. The government instead plans to set up a regulatory infrastructure to oversee the development and operations of the country’s crypto trading platforms. The authorities aim to reduce the risk of inviting further <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/us-ukraine-russian-crypto-sanction-evader/">sanctions</a> while promoting competition in the crypto market.</p>



<h2><strong>Russia Will Use Crypto Exchanges For Cross-Border Settlements</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://iz.ru/1519017/mariia-kolobova/novyi-bitok-v-rossii-poiaviatsia-pravila-sozdaniia-i-raboty-kriptobirzh" rel="nofollow noopener">Izvestia</a>, the Russian government has abandoned a plan to create a national crypto exchange in favor of healthy competition in the market. Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets, told Izvestia that the government is now planning to set up a regulatory regime to regulate the country’s crypto exchanges. This would allow local businesses to settle cross-border transactions. Chairman Aksakov added that the new plan would also help local businesses to avoid the sanctions placed against the country. </p>



<p>Russia’s Ministry of Finance is reportedly on board with the revised plan to regulate the country’s crypto trading platforms. Ivan Chebeskov, Director of the Finance Ministry’s Financial Policy Department, told Izvestia that the Ministry was never keen on the idea of setting up a national crypto exchange. The Ministry is reportedly in favor of legally regulating such platforms. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation will likely regulate the country’s crypto trading platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Russian authorities are hoping to foster the growth and development of new crypto exchanges through the revised regulatory policy for the crypto industry. It would also help minimize the risks of sanctions and infrastructure cyberattacks. The government’s decision to drop the national crypto exchange plan was welcomed by major crypto firms in the country. The plan received considerable opposition ever since it was unveiled in November last year. </p>

<ul><li>Binance is looking to invest in banks and become a minority investor in traditional financial institutions.&nbsp;</li><li>CEO Changpeng Zhao aims to encourage the banks towards crypto-friendly policies.&nbsp;</li><li>Binance stated last year that it may spend over $1 billion on deals in 2023, including a potential bank acquisition.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange is looking to pour funds into the traditional finance sector. Binance CEO <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-us-cut-cz-stake-in-the-exchange/">Changpeng Zhao</a> stated earlier today that his company may become a minority investor in banks through cash investments, in a bid to inspire the banks to take a friendlier stance towards crypto and adopt pro-crypto policies. </p>



<h2><strong>Binance Considered Acquiring A Bank</strong></h2>



<p>Changpeng Zhao, the founder of Binance, appeared in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1mKwAxwAJ0" rel="nofollow noopener">Bankless</a> podcast earlier today. The crypto billionaire reflected on several topics including the fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) surrounding his crypto exchange, the collapse of FTX, the regulatory landscape in the United States, and the future roadmap for his company. Speaking on the FUD around his crypto exchange, Zhao stated that the sheer size of the company made it an easy target for news agencies that aim to attract clicks and generate buzz by publishing negative stories. </p>



<p>When asked about plans to buy a bank in order to make it crypto-friendly, Changpeng Zhao revealed that his company looked into that option and did consider acquiring a TradFi bank. However, his company realized that the logistics and formalities would make it an unfeasible approach. Zhao revealed that buying a bank would still require it to comply with the regulatory policy of that jurisdiction. Additionally, the corresponding banks in the jurisdiction and abroad may choose to not interact with a crypto-friendly bank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Binance Chief stated that his company may make small investments in a few banks and become minority investors, in a bid to guide their management towards becoming more crypto-friendly and having pro-crypto policies. Zhao added that such a move wouldn’t guarantee a friendlier stance from the bank towards the crypto industry. Another concern that he pointed out was the business model that banks run on. According to Zhao, banks are risky businesses that don&#8217;t run on profitable and sound business models. Bloomberg reported last year that Binance is looking to pour in over $1 billion on deals in 2023, with a considerable portion potentially going toward the acquisition of a bank.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>Gemini and Genesis moved to throw out a lawsuit built on securities violation claims made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</li><li>In January, the U.S. watchdog filed a suit arguing that Gemini and Genesis offered unregistered securities and ignored investor protection procedures.</li><li>Crypto exchange Gemini filed that the regulator&#8217;s view of a tri-party MDALA contract between the digital asset entities and Earn Users &#8220;has no basis in law or fact.&#8221;</li></ul>



<p>Gemini and Genesis filed to throw out a <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343.30.0.pdf" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343/gov.uscourts.nysd.592343.30.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lawsuit</a> claiming securities law violations submitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in connection to an Earn Program offered by the Winklevoss-founded crypto exchange. </p>



<p>In January, the commission wrote that Gemini and bankrupt <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/digital-currency-group-refinance-debt/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/digital-currency-group-refinance-debt/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis</a> raised billions from investors who tapped into Gemini&#8217;s Earn product. Earn boasted hundreds of thousands of users who had access to crypto borrowing and lending facilities. </p>



<p>At the time, <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gemini</a> co-founder Tyler Winklevoss called the suit a &#8220;manufactured parking ticket&#8221; while lawyers from both the crypto exchange and Genesis filed that the suit &#8220;has no basis in law or fact.&#8221;</p>



<p>According to the U.S. watchdog, Gemini did not register Earn in line with securities laws before offering the product to investors. The suit further argued that Genesis, one of the sides in a tri-party agreement, deployed client funds toward revenue generation strategies. Genesis also directed part of this revenue to Earn subscribers in the form of interest, a business model that must be cleared by regulators per the commission&#8217;s stand.</p>



<p>The filing from the watchdog insisted that Gemini and Genesis failed to protect investors by not providing proper disclosure regarding Earn. </p>



<h2>SEC, U.S. Regulators Tighten Grip On Crypto Enforcement</h2>



<p>Gemini and Genesis are two entities in a growing list of companies under pressure from U.S. regulators. Kraken was forced to shut down its staking service for American customers supposedly for breaking local law. The exchange also paid a $30 million fine but did not admit to any violations. </p>



<p>Paxos and Binance were also subjects of lawsuits and enforcement actions as regulators across the U.S. crackdown on allegedly illegal players. The <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-continue-enforcement-action-coinbase/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/sec-continue-enforcement-action-coinbase/" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncertainty</a> surrounding regulations in America has now galvanized entities like <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-engage-uae-lawmakers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> to seek offshore options. </p>

<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has secured the necessary regulatory approvals to set up operations in Thailand. The Thai Ministry of Finance has granted digital asset operator licenses to <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-commingling-user-funds/">Binance</a> and its partner Gulf Energy, paving the way for the establishment of a new crypto exchange in Thailand by the fourth quarter of 2023. </p>



<h2><strong>Gulf Binance To Launch SEC Complaint Crypto Exchange</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://cryptotale.org/binance-launches-crypto-exchange-in-thailand-by-q42023-secures-licenses/" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from Binance, Gulf Binance, the joint venture between Gulf Energy’s innovation subsidiary Gulf Innova and the crypto giant, received the green flag from Thailand’s Finance Ministry to set up a digital asset exchange regulated by the country’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The exchange will reportedly go live between October and December 2023. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>By harnessing Binance&#8217;s expertise together with Gulf’s established local presence and network, Gulf Binance aims to showcase the full potential of blockchain technology to meet the needs of Thai users. Local users can expect access to a trusted and regulated service that prioritizes user security alongside compliance with local regulations.” </p><cite>Richard Teng, Binance’s Head of Asia, Europe, and MENA</cite></blockquote>



<p>The joint venture will see Binance contribute its extensive expertise in the digital asset space and Gulf contributing its local industry knowledge and established presence in Thailand. Gulf Binance is aiming to leverage the partnership to create a digital asset exchange and digital asset broker compliant with local regulatory guidelines in order to maximize value for its Thai users. The joint venture eventually plans to become the leading provider of infrastructure services for the digital asset ecosystem in Thailand. Nurturing local web3 talent and fostering the growth of the Thai blockchain ecosystem is part of Gulf Binance’s roadmap.</p>

<p>Summary: </p>



<ul><li>A Lawyer for Coinone’s former Listing Director Mr. Jeon and his broker Mr Ko responded to bribery charges during a hearing on Thursday.</li><li>South Korean prosecutors claim Mr. Jeon took $1.51 million in bribes for exclusively listing “Furiever Coin” on the crypto exchange Coinone.</li><li>The token is tied to a murder investigation in Gangnam, a district in the capital Seoul.</li><li>Mr. Jeon’s attorney said the defense will provide a final opinion after reviewing all available evidence.</li></ul>



<p>&#8220;Mr. Jeon&#8221;, the former director of listing at crypto exchange Coinone, formally recognized bribery charges against him and his broker &#8220;Mr. Ko&#8221; during a South Korean court hearing on May 25.</p>



<p>&#8220;I admit the facts of the prosecution.&#8221; an attorney for the former Coinone exec said at a hearing, reports from <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230525091000004?section=economy/cryptocurrency" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20230525091000004?section=economy/cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yonhap News</a> reported. </p>



<p>The admission does not necessarily mean a guilty plea. Rather it serves as an acknowledgment of the charges and claims made by South Korean prosecutors. Mr. Jeon&#8217;s attorney said a final opinion will be communicated to the court after all available evidence is reviewed. </p>



<h2>Coinone Crypto Listing Scandal</h2>



<p>The former head of Coinone&#8217;s listing machinery is accused of accepting around $1.51 million or 2 billion won for exclusively listing a cryptocurrency &#8211; Furiever Coin. Prosecutors named Furiever Coin as a point of interest in a murder investigation following a kidnapping in Gangnam, &nbsp;a district in the capital city of Seoul. </p>



<p>A broke identified as Mr.Ko is said to be involved in the deal and the cheat listing that followed. Mr. Ko is also facing charges in a South Korean court alongside Coinone&#8217;s former director of listing. </p>



<h2>South Korean Crypto Prosecutors On The Prowl</h2>



<p>The country is beefing up laws and policies following collapses like Terraform Labs from last year. Lawmakers are currently reviewing bills to standardize the crypto industry in South Korea while punishing non-compliers and protecting customers. </p>



<p>A bill was recently passed requiring policymakers and politicians to <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/cryptocurrency/south-koreas-ruling-party-asks-for-acceleration-of-bill-on-declaration-of-virtual-assets/85171/1" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/cryptocurrency/south-koreas-ruling-party-asks-for-acceleration-of-bill-on-declaration-of-virtual-assets/85171/1" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">disclose</a> their crypto holdings.

<p>Digital Currency Group (DCG) will close the curtain on its institutional trading platform TradeBlocks due to financial hurdles and tensions that characterize the U.S. crypto regulatory landscape. </p>

<p>TradeBlock was acquired by crypto news outlet CoinDesk &#8211; another Digital Curren Group-owned company &#8211; in January 2021 for an undisclosed fee. CoinDesk rebranded the startup&#8217;s institutional-grade market index infrastructure and rebranded the offering to CoinDesk Indices. TradeBlock&#8217;s other offerings were left to operate as a standalone business. </p>



<p>Barry Silber&#8217;s Digital Currency Group has experienced uncertain times since the acquisition. CoinDesk engaged investors in January over a potential takeover as its parent company fell into financial difficulties. The conglomerate closed its wealth management division HQ in the same month. </p>



<p>Last year, the group downsized its workforce by some 500 employees and posted $1 billion in losses thanks to crypto meltdowns following crashes like FTX and Three Arrows Capital. </p>



<p>Recently DCG missed a $630 million repayment to crypto exchange Gemini. The exchange said DCG owes the massive amount to its <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/gemini-genesis-winklevoss-dcg-lawsuit/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earn users</a>.

<p>United States-based Gemini Trust Co. has picked Ireland for its European headquarters. The Winklevoss-owned crypto exchange has announced that it will oversee its European operations out of Dublin. The news comes amid an industry-wide push among American crypto exchanges to increase their global footprint in light of intensifying regulatory crackdown in the United States.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Gemini Encouraged By Dublin’s Thriving Start-up Culture</strong></h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/business-and-practice/crypto-exchange-gemini-picks-ireland-for-europe-headquarters" rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Gemini cited Dublin’s thriving start-up culture as one of the reasons for picking it as its European base of operations. The Irish capital’s pool of talent was another factor that prompted the Winklevoss-owned exchange to establish its European headquarters there. The Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulations approved by the European Union last month are a big motivating factor behind several crypto entities in the U.S. considering a shift across the Atlantic. </p>



<p>Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar took to Twitter earlier today to congratulate <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/philippines-gemini-derivatives-exchange/">Gemini</a> on its latest decision and welcome the crypto exchange to Ireland. PM Varadkar added that the exchange’s decision to set up its headquarters in Dublin was a significant indicator of the government’s dedication to innovation. In July last year, the crypto exchange became the first company to be registered as a virtual asset service provider by the Central Bank of Ireland. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Gemini&#8217;s decision to locate in Ireland highlights our competitive offering for the international financial services sector. I wish Gemini every success as they build their team in Ireland.” </p><cite>Leo Varadkar, Prime Minister of Ireland</cite></blockquote>



<p>Gemini’s decision to set up its European headquarters in Dublin comes less than a month after it launched an offshore crypto derivatives trading platform as part of a global push. Paris has emerged as the more popular destination for crypto entities looking to establish their European headquarters. Crypto exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Crypto.com, have based their European operations in Paris, France.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>A consortium of investors called Fahrenheit, led by Arrington Capital, has won the bid to acquire Celsius’ assets.&nbsp;</li><li>The consortium, which includes Coinbase, beat NovaWulf LLC and another group of investors, that included Gemini.&nbsp;</li><li>Celsius’ restructuring will begin right away with over $400 million allocated for its development.&nbsp;</li><li>Fahrenheit’s winning bid means that NovaWulf is owed up to $20 million in break-up fees.</li></ul>



<p>Celsius Network’s months-long bankruptcy auction has finally come to an end, with Arrington Capital-led Fahrenheit emerging as the top bidder for the bankrupt crypto lender’s assets. The new owners of Celsius’ assets include <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/coinbase-sings-licensing-deal-bitpanda/">Coinbase</a>, US Bitcoin Corp, Algorand’s former CEO Steven Kokinos, and investment banker Ravi Kaza. This consortium of investors also had the support of senior executives at Wall Street giant Fortress Investment Group. </p>



<h2><strong>Celsius’ New Owners Plan To Scale Up Mining Operations</strong></h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230525005382/en/Celsius-Announces-Fahrenheit-LLC-as-Winning-Bidder-to-Manage-New-Entity-to-Be-Owned-by-Celsius-Creditors" rel="nofollow noopener">press release</a> from the Celsius Network, the bankrupt crypto lender’s new owners will provide the required capital and technical resources to successfully establish the new company, in line with the firm’s Chapter 11 plan. The plan also provides for Celsius’ liquid crypto assets to its account holders, along with settlements with the custody and withhold groups. A new company will be created to manage the crypto lender’s illiquid assets, including its institutional loan portfolio, mining business, and alternative investments. </p>



<p>The bankrupt crypto lender’s account holders will have 100% of the new equity in the new company. This firm will be overseen by a board of directors that will be appointed by the creditors. The new owners will allocate up to $500 million in liquid cryptocurrency for the new company. Fahrenheit LLC’s US Bitcoin Corp will build and energize crypto mining facilities with a 100-megawatt capacity in order to scale up Celsius’ bitcoin mining operations immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>“We are very pleased that our competitive auction process produced a positive result for customers, including, most prominently, hundreds of millions of dollars in lower management fee savings and increased liquid cryptocurrency distributions to Celsius’ customers.” </p><cite>David Barse and Alan Carr, members of the Special Committee of the Board.</cite></blockquote>



<p>Fahrenheit LLC beat other investor groups, including NovaWulf Digital Management, which was backed by Apollo Global Management, and the Blockchain Recovery Investment Committee, which was backed by the Winklevoss-owned Gemini Trust. NovaWulf’s defeat entitles it to up to $20 million in break-up fees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary:</p>



<ul><li>Binance suspended deposits for 10 bridged crypto coins pending an update from the Multichain team.</li><li>The Binance deposits for these coins are only affected on four blockchains &#8211; Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom networks.</li><li>The temporary deposit suspension on Binance follows growing concerns about the Multichain protocol and unverified rumors about the teams&#8217; arrest in China</li></ul>



<p>Major crypto exchange Binance <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1661649462387957760?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">suspended</a> deposits for 10 bridged crypto coins pending an update from the Multichain team.</p>



<p>The bridged tokens include pairs like AVA-ETH, ALPACA-FTM, FTM-ETH, and ACH-BSC to name a few. These 10 affected crypto coin deposits are spread across four different blockchain networks &#8211; Avalanche, BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Fantom. </p>



<p>The temporary halt on deposits will remain until <a href="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-commingling-user-funds/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.ethereumworldnews.com/binance-reuters-commingling-user-funds/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance</a> receives &#8220;clarity from the Multichain team&#8221;, an update from the crypto exchange said on Thursday. Binance clarified that users will be able to deposit these assets on other networks and the exchange.</p>



<h2>Multichain&#8217;s &#8220;force majeure&#8221;</h2>



<p>Today&#8217;s update is the latest development in an ongoing saga with Multichain. The protocol which allows users to move assets across multiple chains by acting as a bridge, suffered technical issues according to the team. </p>



<p>Several transactions are now jammed on the protocol on bridges linked to chains like Polygon zkEVM and zkSync. The team later claimed “force majeure&#8221; as the problem amid rising concerns about Multichain&#8217;s <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/multichain" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://defillama.com/protocol/multichain" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$1.5 billion TVL</a> protocol.</p>



<p>These concerns turned up a notch following radio silence from the protocol after its last vague update to the community. Also, there are rumors that the core Multichain team was arrested in China. The protocol has neither denied nor responded to the claims at press time. </p>



<p>Fears surrounding the protocol have seemingly led players like the Fantom Foundation, crypto investment company Haskkey, and Justin Sun to pull out almost $3 million combined from Multichain. </p>



<h2>Binance Enters NFT Lending Market With Ether Loans</h2>



<p>In other Binance news, the crypto exchange will allow users of its NFT marketplace to borrow crypto tokens against NFT collateral. </p>



<p>The new feature comes with no fees and a 7.91% p/a interest rate.  Users will be able to <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/loan" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.binance.com/en/nft/loan" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">offer</a> up their blue-chip NFTs from collections like Bored Apes and Azuki as collateral for ETH loans. </p>
