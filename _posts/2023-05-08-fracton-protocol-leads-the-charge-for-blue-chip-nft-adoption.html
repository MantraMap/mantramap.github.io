<p>Fracton Protocol, a new non-fungible tokens (NFTs) player, has become the top holder in seven renowned NFT collections, including Doodles, Mfers, Valhalla, Genuine Undead, Renga, Fluf, and ENS 10k club. This remarkable feat is especially noteworthy considering the current bearish NFT market that has impacted several NFT projects and protocols.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fracton Protocol has reportedly achieved significant milestones in under ten months, including a total value locked (TVL) of over 7,000 ETH. By securing its position as the top holder in multiple blue-chip NFT collections, Fracton Protocol reaffirms its status as a leading player in the quest for mass NFT adoption.</p>
<p>Fracton protocol`s success can be credited to its strategic partnership with KuCoin, one of the largest crypto exchanges globally. By integrating with KuCoin, the project has effectively expanded its NFT holder base and cemented the significance of this cutting-edge protocol.</p>

<p>&nbsp;We are incredibly honored to become the top holder in these prestigious NFT collections. It highlights Fracton Protocol's commitment to supporting valuable digital assets and our influential role in the NFT ecosystem&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fracton Protocol's approach to fractionalization and CEX integration has reportedly served as an effective strategy for expanding the NFT holder base and further establishing the importance of this innovative protocol. The project focuses on creating new opportunities for new users to invest in high-quality NFTs while minimizing the risks associated with rug pulls and other threats.</p>
<p>According to the team, Fracton Protocol is a cutting-edge NFT infrastructure that focuses on fractionalization and places user experience at the forefront to combat rug pulls and encourage broader access to NFT ownership and trading.
