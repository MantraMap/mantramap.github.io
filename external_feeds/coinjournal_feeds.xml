<li>Rob Ginsberg says Bitcoin could go further down in the near-term.</li>
<li>The Wolfe Research analyst explained why in a research note today.</li>
<li>Bitcoin (BTC) has already lost more than 11% in about a month.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has already lost more than 11% in about a month but a Wolfe Research analyst says a further price decline is still likely.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin could see more weakness ahead</h2>
<p>Rob Ginsberg is convinced that the world&rsquo;s largest cryptocurrency that has pulled back sharply from its year-to-date high in recent weeks will eventually break out to the upside.</p>
<p>In the near-term, though, he expects Bitcoin to see more weakness. According to the analyst&rsquo;s research note on Thursday:</p>
<blockquote><p>Could it finally breakout and expand higher? Certainly, but likely not before it goes lower, as has been the trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the BTC has aggressively rallied following a period of tight consolidation over the past two years. Christopher Jaszczynski &ndash; another crypto analyst also dubbed Bitcoin on knife&rsquo;s edge today (<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-on-knifes-edge-as-price-falls-below-28k/">read more</a>).</p>
<h2>Headwinds that could weigh on Bitcoin</h2>
<p>A day earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve released <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20230726.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minutes</a> of its July meeting that showed most members saw a possibility of further rate hikes ahead &ndash; a potential headwind for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Wolfe Research analyst Rob Ginsberg noted the U.S. dollar regaining strength as a mounting challenge for the cryptocurrency as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>These near-term headwinds are likely to force price lower and keep volume muted across the space. If history is any indication, however, when price does expand, expect it to be abrupt.</p></blockquote>
<p>He said the $31,000 level was one to watch as it coincides with a key resistance. Bitcoin has rejected from that level multiple times this year.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Judge Analisa Torres has allowed SEC to file an appeal against July 13 ruling on XRP.</li>
<li dir="ltr">SEC to file by August 18 and Ripple to respond by September 1.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/ripple/">Ripple news</a> is that Judge Analisa Torres, who ruled in July that public sales of XRP did not constitute an investment contract and thus not a security, has allowed a request by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to file an appeal against the ruling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On August 9, the SEC filed a letter seeking to file an interlocutory appeal against Ripple Labs over the XRP ruling &ndash; even as the regulator looks to battle Ripple&rsquo;s assertions regarding the rest of the case.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Judge sets timeline</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Per Judge Torres&rsquo; decision today, the SEC can now proceed to the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The regulator should have the appeal in place by August 18, while Ripple will have until September 1 to file its opposition. The timeline also includes September 8 as the deadline for SEC to file a reply.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The judge&rsquo;s decision to grant SEC&rsquo;s request came a day after Ripple opposed the regulator&rsquo;s intended interlocutory appeal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ripple Labs chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty <a href="https://twitter.com/s_alderoty/status/1691917112019960288" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">noted</a> that there is &ldquo;no extraordinary circumstance here that would justify departing from the rule requiring all issues as to all parties to be resolved before an appeal.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">John E. Deaton of Crypto Law. US says it could take 3-6 months for Judge Torres to deliver a ruling on the filing.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">As I said last week, she was going to grant the SEC the right to file a formal motion for an interlocutory appeal. Now she can deny it and explain why she&rsquo;s denying it along with explaining why Rakoff is completely off regarding his understanding of what she ruled.

<p dir="ltr">SEC sued Ripple and two of its executives &ndash; CEO Brad Garlinghouse and executive Chairman Chris Larsen &ndash; in December 2020. The securities regulator alleged that XRP was a security and that Ripple had violated securities laws by selling an unregistered security.</p>
<p dir="ltr">SEC Chair Gary Gensler has come under heavy criticism for his approach to crypto regulation, with both Binance and Coinbase also sued.</p>

<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin price fell to lows of $27,740 across major exchanges on Thursday, the lowest since June.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Stocks have also slipped after the latest Fed meeting.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Meanwhile, real yields have jumped to recent highs.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has traded to below $28,000 again, with Thursday&rsquo;s dip seeing the flagship cryptocurrency&rsquo;s value hit lows of $27,744 across major exchanges.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader crypto market was also shedding gains as top altcoins declined to pull the total crypto market cap down over 3% to $1.15 trillion.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Analyst says Bitcoin on &ldquo;knife&rsquo;s edge&rdquo;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, BTC was trading near $27,915, roughly 3.7% down in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has lost 5% of its value in the past week and the move to its lowest levels since June has bulls looking at a potential flip even lower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Christopher Jaszczynski, a crypto trader and analyst going by MMCrypto on X (formerly Twitter), shared the chart below showing Bitcoin price performance. It shows BTC back at a key trendline that has acted as support since early this year. He says the benchmark cryptocurrency is trending at a &ldquo;knife&rsquo;s edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BTC down as real yields rise</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin&rsquo;s slip to below $28k comes as the stock market also witnessed jittery reaction after Wednesday&rsquo;s <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/us-federal-reserve/">Federal Reserve</a> commentary. Market observers say the Fed is likely to see further interest rate hikes as necessary and that has investors on edge.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On Thursday, equities saw lackluster movement as Treasury yields climbed to recent highs.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The US 10-year Treasury yield was 6.6 points up to 4.324% while yield on the US 30-year Treasury lifted 6.1 basis points to 4.42%, tracking highs seen in 2009.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With higher interest rates a negative trigger for risk asset investments such as Bitcoin, fresh bearish moves are likely. Market analyst TXMC shared the below observation as real yields ripped.</p>
<p dir="ltr">
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

<p>Observe how the entire equity run from October to July occurred with real yields capped below their highs, and how each break higher incurred a selloff.</p>
<p>Then observe real yields today relative to said cap. <a href="https://t.co/E6cvdQjTkD">pic.twitter.com/E6cvdQjTkD</a></p>

<li dir="ltr">Republic Wallet is targeted to a global community of over 3 million Republic investors.</li>
<li dir="ltr">Users will access tokenized assets across multiple blockchains, including Ethereum and Avalanche.</li>
<li dir="ltr">The global tokenization market is expected to reach $24 trillion by 2027.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Digital finance firm <a href="http://www.republic.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Republic</u></a> has officially unveiled its self-custodial multi-chain digital wallet, opening crypto adoption to a global community of over three million customers.</p>
<p dir="ltr">More people looking to access digital assets can now tap into features of the Republic Wallet to buy, store and trade, the firm said in a press release shared with CoinJournal on Thursday.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Other than support for third-party <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/tag/wallets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wallets</a>, Republic Wallet&rsquo;s offers multi-chain capability with initial support for leading blockchains such as Ethereum, Avalanche, and Algorand. The wallet also plans to add Bitcoin and Polygon among others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The wallet&rsquo;s security has been tested and audited by Quantstamp. Meanwhile, integration of multi-party computation is aimed at providing an extra layer of protection for users.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bringing benefits of tokenization to the global community</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Also key to the launch is the wallet&rsquo;s potential to bring the benefits of tokenization to the global community, catering to retail investors interested in tokenized securities and real-world assets among other offerings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Andrew Durgee, the head of Republic Crypto, commented:</p>
<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;<em>For millions of global retail investors, investing in private assets like startups, real estate, and fine art is opaque, highly illiquid, and mostly inaccessible. Tokenization solves all of these problems. It&rsquo;s why we built Republic Wallet, a multisig, multi-chain digital wallet designed for a future where most private assets are tokenized</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Over 5,000 holders of Republic&rsquo;s digital security (<a href="http://www.republic.com/note" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Republic Note</u></a>), will be the first to use the new wallet to receive, transfer and manage crypto assets. Availability will expand to more users, who will also earn passive income by staking rewards. &nbsp;Investors will also be able to trade private assets directly from their wallet.</p>
<p>Republic believes the wallet will play a key role in democratizing private investing worldwide, bringing tokenization and Web3 to millions of people. The company wants to be part of the ecosystem that drives growth in a market forecast to reach <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/who-is-tokenizing-digital-assets-for-institutional-investors-to-buy-and-trade/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>$24 trillion</u></a> by 2027.</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Stablecoin issuer has discontinued support for Omni and Kusama.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Omni was the first transport layer that Tether used in 2014.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tether makes strategic changes to its operations</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Stablecoin issuer Tether&nbsp;<a href="https://tether.to/en/tether-makes-strategic-transition-to-meet-community-demands-and-foster-innovation/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>announced</u></a> on Thursday, August 17th, that it would discontinue support for Kusama, Bitcoin Cash SLP and Omni Layer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> comes despite Tether supporting Omni since 2014. According to the stablecoin issuer, the decision was made as the company is making strategic changes to its operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Omni is a software layer built atop the Bitcoin blockchain and it enhances the features of the network by providing smart contract features.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tether has been supporting Omni for nearly a decade but had to discontinue due to a lack of demand. The Tether team said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Over the years, the Omni Layer faced challenges due to the lack of popular tokens and the availability of USD&#8366; on other blockchains. This led many exchanges to favour alternative transport layers, leading to a decline in USD&#8366; usage on Bitcoin using the Omni Layer. &nbsp;As a principled organization, we must remain consistent and transparent, and adhere to open processes, even if it entails difficult choices.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tether records its first market cap decline in end-of-month since October</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Tether has maintained its position as the largest stablecoin in the world. However, the stablecoin has had minor troubles in recent weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to an August&nbsp;<a href="https://ccdata.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=09c4f41d23e5d6a61dacce331&amp;id=8c7dd3e50c&amp;e=5fb3fd2bdb" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>report by CCData</u></a>, the market cap of USDT fell 0.62% to $83.3bn, recording the first decline in end-of-month market cap for USDT since October 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the market cap dominance of USDT rose to 67.1% from 66.7% with all of the top stablecoins registering a decline in market cap in August.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Tether said it will stop issuing its USDT stablecoin on Omni, Kusama and Bitcoin Cash from August 17, while users can continue to redeem their tokens on the networks for the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Furthermore, users can also swap USDT on those networks for other chains on platforms that support these assets.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 dir="ltr">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Trading volume, liquidity and volatility are all falling in the crypto markets</li>
<li dir="ltr">Even Bitcoin&rsquo;s strong rise thus far this year has been steady and methodical rather than via sudden spikes, as in the past</li>
<li dir="ltr">Bitcoin dominance is rising, uncharacteristic during periods of price increases, highlighting a potential divergence&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Regulatory crackdown is suppressing market participation through lawsuits against exchanges and heightened legal uncertainty&nbsp;</li>
<li dir="ltr">Volatility should return eventually, but previous six months have been the most placid in recent memory </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;s all quiet on the blockchain front.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The crypto markets continue to plod along with volume, liquidity and volatility all extraordinarily low. All across the board, the numbers point to market participation lowering incessantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even Bitcoin&rsquo;s rise year-to-date, which is impressive thus far at 76%, has come through steady, methodical gains. This contrasts sharply with previous bull markets, which have seen the asset spike higher in very short time periods. Then again, the market seems unsure of whether this is a bull market, a bear market, or something in between. </p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14730820">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">The slow but steady incline this year has come amid a further fall in trading volume. Last year, volumes on centralised exchanges fell 46%. This came amid a vicious bear market, highlighted by several scandals, such as the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-insolvent-what-next-for-crypto/"><u>FTX collapse</u></a>, Terra&rsquo;s death spiral and numerous bankruptcies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The year 2023 has seen the trading slump continue lower, without even the dramatic episodes of volatility such as those aforementioned scandals. The Block&rsquo;s data for July has trading volumes now at levels last seen in 2020:&nbsp;<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/15/1692093105977-8e93aef5-6cb6-46ef-b0be-ff67c301db1c.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="314"></p>
<p dir="ltr">As we analysed here recently, this is partially a result of a typical <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-volume-falls-to-3-year-low-as-summer-activity-sags/"><u>summer trading lull</u></a>, something which affects asset classes beyond crypto, too. The next chart from Kaiko shows this, with Q3 frequently yielding the lowest volume in Bitcoin&rsquo;s short history. However, it is prudent to note that this is heavily skewed towards the last couple of years, with Bitcoin surging into mainstream consciousness and its liquidity therefore rocketing. Hence, blaming this lull on seasonality alone feels misguided. </p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/15/1692093287716-ae1b07a1-0a96-4e80-b9ac-2c3732d06ed9.jpg" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="319"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin dominance is rising&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Looking beyond Bitcoin, altcoins have also been quiet. There have been stories of the odd meme coin (Bald and Pepe, to name a couple) that have gained attention, but in comparison to previous years, the altcoin market has been devoid of the usual intrigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">One way of looking at this is the notable rise of <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/how-rising-bitcoin-dominance-invalidates-many-crypto-assumptions/"><u>Bitcoin dominance</u></a>, which measures the ratio of the Bitcoin market cap to the entire cryptocurrency market cap. It has risen above 50%, up from around 40% at the start of the year.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/10/1691667112490-9ac68aa5-4deb-47cb-a13c-c61ff2592cfc.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="286">This rise in Bitcoin dominance is unusual because it has occurred during a period of price expansion across the industry. Previously, Bitcoin has tended to underperform alts in bull markets, with dominance therefore falling. </p>
<p dir="ltr">One factor in both the rise in Bitcoin dominance and the low market participation across crypto is the impact of the regulatory crackdown in the US. The SEC outlined several coins as securities, including Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Cardano (ADA), and while Ripple secured an optimistic ruling in its own case against the SEC, the climate is undoubtedly more uncertain with regard to where all these tokens fit in.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, on the other hand, has largely been left out of the securities wars, and has even seen a slew of spot ETF applications lodged in recent months. Lawmakers very much seem to be dealing with Bitcoin as a separate genre of asset (as many in the sector have long done).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The regulatory crackdown on exchanges themselves has also been severe, and has certainly contributed to falling volumes across the space, Bitcoin or otherwise. Both Coinbase and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/opinion-binance-sued-by-sec-an-inevitable-but-ominous-day-for-crypto/"><u>Binance were sued</u></a> in June, with Binance also the subject of a Department of Justice investigation, with some reports claiming charges may be imminent.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Moreover, we need to be careful when assessing the apparent trading volumes. One of the (many) accusations in the SEC case is that Binance manipulated trade volumes, meaning the true figures could be even lower.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Then there is the issue of, even if real, how much volume is meaningful. Binance ceased zero-fee trading for all Bitcoin pairs in March, and before this, zero-fee trading accounted for approximately 75% of volumes on the exchange. After the promotion ended, however, it promptly fell to 36%, with the majority through the stablecoin which Binance continued to promote zero-fee trading on: TrueUSD. Prior to this development, TrueUSD was seldom used with minimal liquidity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Volatility</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With the fall in volume, it follows that there is also a fall in volatility. Traders live and die by volatility, and it is closely correlated with volume. In fact, volatility is currently around <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-volatility-at-three-year-low-as-crypto-markets-lull/"><u>three-year lows</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14728933">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">The effects of the drain in market participation are being seen on volatility beyond Bitcoin, too. The below chart shows that Ethereum volatility has recently dipped to the level of Bitcoin&rsquo;s, or even below it. That contrasts with what we have come to expect historically, with Ethereum typically trading with higher volatility than its big cousin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">        </p><div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/14728974">
            <script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script>
        </div>
    
<p dir="ltr">The volatility is more notable when considering that liquidity is also so thin. Order books are as shallow as they have been in a long time. Liquidity took a particular fall in November when prominent market maker Alameda collapsed amid the FTX scandal. Since then, not only has its capital not been replaced on order books, but more US market makers <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/crypto-liquidity-falling-as-market-makers-pull-back-from-hostile-us-market/"><u>have pulled out</u></a> or scaled back operations in the wake of the regulatory climate.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">All things considered, the crypto markets are showing remarkably low levels of liquidity, trading volume and volatility. This comes via a combination of factors, from investors retreating on the risk curve to other bear market-related factors. Regulation is also a key factor, however, and undoubtedly suppressing market activity while uncertainty is so high.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The turbulent price action will return. But for now, crypto charts are not throwing up their trademark chaos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Key takeaways</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has dropped below the $29k level, presenting a buying opportunity for some investors.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has now surpassed the $2 million mark.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been bearish this week, with the prices of most cryptocurrencies currently in the red zone.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and SHIB have all lost more than 2% of their values this week and could experience further downward movement in the short term.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin drops below $29k level</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin has dropped below the $29k level as the cryptocurrency market recorded huge losses over the last 24 hours. At press time, the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> stands at $28,479 per coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other leading cryptocurrencies including ETH, SOL, SHIB, and XRP all recorded massive losses over the past few days. The decline in prices could serve as an opportunity for investors to purchase more cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Despite the bearish sentiment in the market, Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale has hit a new milestone. The team has now raised more than $2 million in this presale round.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">What is Shiba Memu?</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> is a cryptocurrency project that seeks to make it easier for people and organisations to carry out marketing campaigns. Although it is a meme coin, Shiba Memu has real-world use cases and offers value to the users.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is still in its presale stage but Shiba Memu holds promise, with investors already pledging millions of dollars to the project&rsquo;s development.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">So far, the Shiba Memu stage two presale has raised more than $2 million, with over 65 million SHMU tokens sold so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In their whitepaper, the Shiba Memu team said the project combines AI and blockchain technology to develop an unstoppable, entirely self-sufficient marketing powerhouse.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu can execute the work of 100 marketing agencies thanks to how it leverages AI. As an AI-based platform, Shiba Memu will provide users with operational transparency thanks to its use of blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">If deployed, Shiba Memu will work 24/7 to identify ideal creative scenarios and work round the clock to develop excellent marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The project was launched as a meme coin as the team decided to take advantage of the recent popularity of meme tokens. Meme coins have become important in the crypto ecosystem, growing from a market cap of $0 in 2019 to $20 billion in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With Shiba Memu, the platform has self-sufficient marketing capabilities powered by AI technology. When deployed, Shiba Memu will develop its own marketing strategies, write its own PR, and promote itself in relevant forums and various social media platforms. &nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Currently, Shiba Memu operates on BNBChain and Ethereum, two of the leading DeFi blockchains in the world.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale hits $2 million</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has been bearish in recent weeks but that hasn&rsquo;t deterred investors from investing in projects.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Shiba Memu&rsquo;s stage two presale recently hit an important milestone. The team has raised more than $2 million in this current presale round and could reach its target very soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> has been attracting interest from investors despite the current market conditions. Funds generated from the various presale rounds would be diverted towards developing the Shiba Memu products. The team will use most of the funds to develop the Shiba Memu AI technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Click here</u></a> to find out more about Shiba Memu&rsquo;s presale event.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Should you invest in Shiba Memu today?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency market has underperformed this week, with the prices of most coins in the red zone. The recent bearish trend could serve as an opportunity for investors to buy more cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As investors continue to look for worthwhile projects,&nbsp;<a href="https://shibamemu.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Shiba Memu</u></a> could be one to consider. By combining the power of blockchain technology and AI, Shiba Memu could turn out to be a unique project. The platform will look to ease marketing strategies for companies and organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">With the right level of adoption, its native SHMU token could rally higher over the coming months and years.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Dogecoin price has joined other cryptocurrencies in a strong sell-off.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Technical analysis shows that the coin will continue falling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/"><u>Dogecoin</u></a> price was not left behind in the recent cryptocurrency sell-off. The coin dropped to a low of $0.067, the lowest level since July 18th. It has dropped by more than 20% from the highest level in July and over 58% from the highest level in 2022. Other coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Hedera Hashgraph have also dipped.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Dogecoin price forecast (daily chart)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart shows that the DOGE price has been in a strong bearish trend after peaking at $0.1587 in October last year. It has underperformed the crypto market, partly because of the strong growth of alternative meme coins like Bone Shibaswap, Pepe, and Bad Idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The coin has remained below the descending trendline, which connects the highest levels since December last year. At the same time, the coin has moved below the 25-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA).&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dogecoin price is hovering slightly above the important support level at $0.065, the lowest point in March and December last year. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has moved below the neutral point at 50 while the Stochastic Oscillator has moved below the oversold level.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, DOGE price will likely have a bearish breakout in the next few days. If this happens, the next level to watch will be at $0.055, the lowest level on June 10th 2023 and September last year. The stop-loss of this trade is at $0.080, the descending trendline.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">DOGE price analysis (4H chart)</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Turning to the four-hour chart, DOGE price has been in a downtrend in the past few weeks. It has managed to move below the ascending channel shown in black. It dropped below that level on August 2nd and then retested it on August 5th. In technical analysis, a break and retest pattern is usually a sign of a bearish continuation.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Dogecoin has also retreated below the 25-period and 50-period moving averages while the Relative Strength Index has moved below the oversold level. Therefore, the outlook of the token is bearish, with the next level to watch will be at $0.063.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/07/17/1692274251559-bc22d108-bc9f-46fc-b2a5-c86fc82052cc.png" style="width: 693px;height: 337.26px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="693" height="337.26"></p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer aims to take the mainstream betting market to the blockchain.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The P2P betting has been in demand, as the presale raises $1.4 million</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Chancer has huge potential after listing and could rise more after the platform launches</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Blockchain is fast infiltrating traditional sectors. Betting is one of them, with Chancer taking steps to take the predictive market to the blockchain. Chancer lets users bet on a fully decentralised ecosystem powered by a crypto token. Since launching a presale, investors have bought over $1.43 worth of tokens. But is Chancer worth&nbsp;<a href="https://chancer.com/?utm_source=media&amp;utm_medium=artc&amp;utm_campaign=coinjournal&amp;utm_term=internal&amp;utm_content=current_news" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buying</u></a> at presale ahead of the listing?</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>How Chancer works</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer is coined under the phrase &ldquo;Your Game, Your Rules, Your Odds.&rdquo; That partly explains how the platform works.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Chancer allows users to dictate the game of betting. Users can determine what they want to bet on, from mainstream events like football to social events. There is no limit on what users can bet on, making Chancer a game-changer in new betting experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">To bet, users create a peer-to-peer Chancer market via the decentralised ecosystem. Users can invite others (peers) to their markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Once created, users develop rules that will govern their P2P betting market. They also determine the odds of claiming winnings.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The P2P model of Chancer is unique from the mainstream betting platforms. Users are not constrained to what bookmakers provide. This aspect is expected to bring limitless betting opportunities and attract new users. The revolutionary features explain the fast presale of the token.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What is the value proposition of Chancer?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Betting is one of the fastest-growing and most popular sectors globally. By bringing it to the blockchain, Chancer has a huge potential to find unlimited uses. Users need not turn to their local or bookmaker currencies to bet and claim winnings. They will do so with the Chancer token. This means the potential for the token to skyrocket is high as demand increases, delivering returns.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Owning Chancer is also an opportunity to earn through market-making rewards. Users get rewarded for creating the P2P markets. The native token can also be staked for passive income-generating opportunities. Those who like to spread the word about Chancer are rewarded for their efforts through a Share2Earn feature.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Betting does not also need to be boring too. Chancer features real-time or live streaming powers via P2P markets. This is a good way to engage with wagers in one&rsquo;s betting cycles and have fun.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Chancer price potential and prediction in 2023 and 2024</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The magic of creating one&rsquo;s betting market through Chancer gives the token a lot of potential. Analysts have lauded the token as a 10x investment, which is realistic and attainable.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the project&rsquo;s roadmap, Chancer will be listed on Uniswap in Q3 2023. The company seeks a minimum of two CEX listings in the quarter. The listing will open up the token for more buys and unlock value. It means the value of Chancer could start to rise then.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But from a prudential perspective, Chancer&rsquo;s value could rise by 1,000% in 2024 or more in the future. This is after the main platform launches, and the value is unlocked from organic use rather than speculation. For 2023, investors should be comfortable with 100% or more increases. A 10x increase could be overambitious in the near term.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Is it the right time to buy the Chancer token?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">There is a clear expectation that Chancer will surprise the markets, looking at its successful presale. The price will be ready for takeoff when the token is listed in the third quarter. Investors that miss the presale may be forced to buy the token at a higher price on exchanges.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Buying the token at the presale is advantageous as the token&rsquo;s price is low. More so, the token is most attractively priced at the initial stages. For example, while Chancer started the presale at $0.01, it now goes for $0.011. That makes it worthwhile to buy it now rather than later.</p>
