<p>Suppose the Art Basel exhibition floor and the Venice Biennale had anything in common in 2022, apart from hosting mesmerizing works of inspiring art. In that case, it&rsquo;s the presence of a new form of expressive medium that is making an even bigger impact as a bridge between mind and matter. The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) phenomenon is coming back stronger than ever, despite the recession on the overall market of decentralized digital assets. It seems art lovers speak the same language, as appreciation for expression has taken over the mercantile aspect of digitization, allowing visionary projects to make their statements at both world-leading art events.</p>
<p>The Venice Biennale of 2022, which took place from May to November, hosted &ldquo;Seven of Swords&rdquo; by Justin Aversano, displayed at the Decentral Art Pavilion &mdash; dedicated entirely to digital artworks. The work, part of the &ldquo;Smoke and Mirrors&rdquo; collection, consists of 78 photographs of visionary individuals from the mystical, astrological, tarot, and other metaphysical planes of thought. Designed as unique tarot cards themselves in NFT format, the portrait artworks highlight an otherworldly presence, making the viewer believe in the existence of magic, hauntingly conveyed through the characters&rsquo; zealous adherence to their powers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; by Concept2048 is another project with NFT inclinations that made its loud statement at the Venice Biennale&rsquo;s contemporary art exhibition Personal Structures. Created by a duo of digital artists &ndash; Ekaterina Perekopskaya and Rostyslav Brenych &mdash; the works, set to be released as NFTs on January 24, 2023, represent various facets of art, stemming from concept and foresight. Indeed, considering that both artists involved in Concept2048 specialize in art fashion and conceptual production, their works leave more questions than answers in the mind of the viewer, tantalizing them with the quintessential one &mdash; is there such a thing as a final answer at all?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subtle games of light and shades of vibrant colors are the focal points in the collection, focusing the viewer&rsquo;s attention on the contrasts at play and the underlying concept of Universal light, one that dims in our world as it passes through challenges and development phases. The open-ended nature of their creative works sheds light on global issues, like sustainable development, urging and inspiring the viewer to act and take a stance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Metamorphoses&rdquo; collection made an equally resounding impact at the Venice Biennale, effectively blurring the line between concept and finality. Understandable, considering that it already wields the admiration of a 100,000 community, has experienced full sell-outs at presales, and a 350% price increase since launch. Those wishing to take advantage of early bird opportunities, may join the whitelist available on the project&rsquo;s website.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Social Sacrifice&rdquo; by Studio Drift at Ocean Space is an excellent example of NFT&rsquo;s merger with the physical. As a representative of the phygital medium, Drift set in motion remote-controlled drones, creating a staggering display of art through light and movement. Each of the 100+ live indoor performances was preserved in NFT format for further sale on the Aorist platform. The Artificial Intelligence involved in modeling the movements of a school of fish represented by the drones was accompanied in its graceful dynamic displays by the visceral orchestral audio design by artist and musician Don Diablo.</p>
<p>Such performances that imprint unforgettable live events as digital memorabilia continue to elevate the status of NFTs as true works of art and cement their perception as worthy additions to the many forms of human expression, and as feasts for the senses.</p>
<p>Another event blending the digital and the physical rocked the Art Basel venue as World of Women made its statement for a thriving community living the dream making inclusivity one of the founding pillars of Web3 space. The WoW collection by Yam Karkai is all about dissecting the stories of empowered and diverse women who were able to leave their mark on the world. The passion that Yam displayed with her vision gave WoW the necessary impetus to become one of the leading NFT brands in the world.</p>
<p>The 10,000 unique pieces of mesmerizing art in the collection, released on July 27th, 2021, sport randomly-generated digital collectibles hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. With their vivid colors, haunting gazes, and outright tribal art styles, the images inspire awe and admiration for the spirit of women who drive the world around them. The World of Women gala at the Art Basel event included a ceremony awarding attendees for digital fashion design, made all the more exciting by music from electronic duo Sofi Tukker. The importance of the collection resides in the fact that it recognizes women&rsquo;s digital identity through fashion and design, allowing them to leave a tangible footprint in Web3 space.</p>

<p>Clothing brands taking on the NFT medium is not a new phenomenon, but one taken on a new spin around the digital block by ITERATION-02 &ndash; a collaboration between 9dcc and Snowfro. Art Blocks founder and creator of the Chromie Squiggle injects a new spin on wearables. The ITERATION-02 collection takes the process of releasing on-chain generative art to the next level by seamlessly converting each creation into an article of generative clothing.</p>
<p>The lineup is ideal for admirers of luxury and digital artworks alike, as the iconic Chromie Squiggle is remixed with the visuals of 9dcc in NFT format, giving each holder a unique T-shirt proudly bearing the resulting digital image. The ability to actually wear unique art forms may not be a new concept in NFT space, but ITERATION-02 certainly shifts it from the inaccessible to the mass market segment, giving a vastly broader audience of NFT admirers to dive headlong into the process of creating digital artworks.</p>
From figment to art
<p>The days of badly-rendered, pixelated NFTs are long gone, as artists are becoming more sophisticated and bolder in how they approach the new medium of art and expression. While collections like Metamorphoses highlight the versatility of NFTs in conceptual medium, others like Drift push the envelope of art&rsquo;s perception as a static phenomenon and transcend the boundaries of visual and audio performance.</p>
<p>It is precisely the audacity of such artists who challenge the established frameworks of creative concepts that elevates digital art&rsquo;s standing and status at events like the Venice Biennale and Art Basel. It will take more time, of course, before NFTs become fully mainstream and the stigma surrounding them blurs, but the foundation has been laid. If the pace of adoption persists and the artists continue to unleash their creativity, another bull run for NFT art is well in the making.</p>
