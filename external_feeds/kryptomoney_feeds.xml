<p>Despite the recent <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/sec-hits-coinbase-with-lawsuit-a-day-after-binance/">SEC action against Coinbase,</a> crypto payments technology company Circle, along with others in the industry, remains determined to pursue its goal of going public. However, industry executives acknowledge that the current environment poses challenges for most companies considering a public listing.</p>
<p>In 2021, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/circle-breaks-boundaries-with-new-cross-chain-usdc-protocol/">Circle</a> announced its intention to become a public company through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC).</p>
<p>However, CEO Jeremy Allaire mentioned in a December 2022 tweet that his company had not completed SEC qualification in time.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Circle reiterated that going public is still a fundamental part of its strategy, which was confirmed by a company spokesperson and a recent job posting. While no specific deadline has been set, Circle is actively taking steps to progress toward becoming a public company as soon as feasible.</p>
<p>A recent job listing for corporate counsel at Circle also indicated the company&#8217;s intentions. The role would involve assisting with the potential SEC process related to going public and supporting the development of policies, practices, and processes for the public company.</p>
<p>Circle&#8217;s determination to go public remains intact, despite the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit against Coinbase. Coinbase has been a public company for over two years, having completed its initial public offering in April 2021 after the SEC approved its registration on Form S-1. However, the SEC has accused Coinbase of operating as an unregistered exchange, allegations that Coinbase has denied.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/google-cloud-users-can-now-pay-via-coinbase-with-bitcoin-ethereum-and-dogecoin/">Google Cloud</a> has introduced a new initiative to safeguard certain customers against the costs incurred during undetected crypto mining attacks, offering them up to $1 million in protection. This program is specifically available to subscribers of Google&#8217;s Security Command Center Premium, a cyber threat detection service.<br /><br />Philip Bues, a cloud security expert at market research firm IDC, praised Google Cloud&#8217;s proactive step in addressing the issue. Bues emphasized that crypto mining attacks pose significant security and financial risks for organizations lacking adequate preventative controls and threat detection capabilities in their cloud environments.<br /><br />The decision to provide coverage for these types of breaches stems from a<a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/gcat_threathorizons_full_sept2022.pdf"> report</a> published by Google&#8217;s Cybersecurity Action Team in September 2022. The report revealed that 65% of cases involving compromised cloud accounts were linked to hackers engaging in cryptocurrency mining.<br /><br />The report also highlighted that these attacks are often carried out through partially or fully automated means, making them swift and easily executed.<br /><br />If a hacker successfully evades Google&#8217;s detection mechanisms and proceeds to run crypto mining software on a user&#8217;s cloud account, Google Cloud will assume responsibility for the associated expenses. They will provide coverage of up to $1 million towards the customer&#8217;s bill.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this protection program is not related to Bitcoin mining. Instead, it exclusively applies to individuals using mining software, with one of the popular cryptocurrencies mined in this manner being Monero (XMR).</p>

<p>Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1666860069273710606">Vitalik Buterin</a> and Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal have announced their renewed commitment to supporting research on pandemic relief efforts. In a recent Twitter post, Buterin stated that last year, Crypto Relief, led by Sandeep Nailwal, allocated $100 million towards <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/vet-price-analysis-vet-usd-pauses-uptrend-at-0-0346-high-vechain-use-case-extends-to-covid-19-vaccination-records/">COVID</a> research projects. <br /><br />After discussing and evaluating the impact of these initiatives, they concluded that continued support is crucial. Consequently, they have decided to contribute an additional $100 million to these projects.<br /><br />Buterin emphasized that COVID and potential future pandemics are global challenges that demand a global solution involving cutting-edge scientific innovation and widespread implementation worldwide. <br /><br />He stressed the importance of finding public health solutions that uphold individuals&#8217; rights and freedoms while remaining accessible to all. The goal is not only to ensure survival and good health but also to promote enjoyable and fulfilling lives.<br /><br />Out of the newly pledged funds, Buterin personally committed $10 million. Nailwal, who established the emergency relief fund COVID Relief in April 2021, has already disbursed more than $58 million in pandemic relief grants. As per the organization&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptorelief.in/transparency">website</a>, COVID Relief currently holds over $20 million in its bank account.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a significant event, a <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/activity-finally-observed-in-bitcoin-whale-wallet-following-several-years-of-dormancy/">dormant wallet</a> holding a substantial sum of Bitcoin recently initiated a<a href="https://bitinfocharts.com/bitcoin/address/1E6nViR5Xv1wyNXg87SamvtLJ5TyXuksLC"> transfer</a> of 1,432.93 bitcoins, valued at approximately $37.8 million, to a new address. This move comes after more than a decade of inactivity, adding to a series of similar transfers witnessed in recent months.<br /><br />On April 9, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was a mere $195.40 per coin, the address received the Bitcoin in question, as highlighted by on-chain analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1666679589421338626?s=46&amp;t=yoL7WJcO9vZ3TjSE2j6FRQ">Lookonchain</a>. The fact that the wallet remained dormant for over ten years has drawn attention and sparked speculation regarding the motives and identity of the owner.<br /><br />This transfer is not an isolated incident. In April, there were several notable movements of dormant whale addresses. On April 24, an address that had been inactive for 12 years transferred nearly $11 million worth of Bitcoin to another address. Just days before that, a separate whale address, dormant for nine years, transferred approximately $61 million worth of Bitcoin. Another wallet that had remained dormant for a decade made a transfer of 279 bitcoins.<br /><br />Interestingly, the activity is not limited to Bitcoin alone. On the same day, April 24, an Ethereum address that had been inactive for 7.7 years, since the project&#8217;s initial coin offering, suddenly woke up and transferred a single ether. While the transfer amount may not be significant, it serves as another intriguing event in the realm of dormant addresses coming to life.<br /><br />These movements of long-dormant wallets have prompted speculation among cryptocurrency enthusiasts and analysts. Questions arise regarding the motives behind these transfers after such prolonged periods of inactivity. <br /><br />The identity of the wallet owners, their intentions, and the potential implications for the cryptocurrency market as a whole remain topics of discussion.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/robinhood-to-pay-10-2-million-in-outage-settlement/">Robinhood</a> Markets, the popular trading platform, is reassessing its cryptocurrency offerings in light of the intensified regulatory crackdown on the industry. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-06/robinhood-reviews-crypto-offerings-after-regulatory-crackdown">According t</a>o Dan Gallagher, the firm&#8217;s legal chief and a former SEC commissioner, Robinhood is actively reviewing the US Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) analysis to determine the necessary actions.<br /><br />The SEC recently filed lawsuits against two major players in the digital asset market, <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/sec-hits-coinbase-with-lawsuit-a-day-after-binance/">Binance and Coinbase</a>, which collectively account for half of global cryptocurrency trading. This regulatory action has prompted Robinhood to tread carefully and avoid drawing unwanted attention from the SEC.<br /><br />While Robinhood provides users with access to 18 different digital assets, including Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC), the SEC&#8217;s lawsuits this week have classified these tokens as unregistered securities. Although Robinhood&#8217;s crypto offerings are relatively limited compared to Binance and Coinbase, the company aims to ensure compliance and avoid regulatory issues.<br /><br />Robinhood has already faced regulatory challenges in the past. Earlier this year, the company was fined over $10 million by US-based regulators due to operational deficiencies that negatively impacted investors during the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) imposed a $30 million penalty on Robinhood last summer for violations related to anti-money laundering and cybersecurity laws. The NYDFS also discovered significant failures in the company&#8217;s compliance program, citing policies that did not align with virtual currency and cybersecurity regulations.<br /><br />As the regulatory landscape evolves, Robinhood finds itself carefully considering its crypto offerings and striving to navigate the complex regulatory environment to ensure compliance and address potential concerns raised by regulators.</p>

Rostin Behnam, Chair of the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-commodity-status-of-bitcoin-and-ether-says-xrp-is-uncertain/">Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)</a>, informed the House Agriculture Committee that the introduction of regulations for digital assets would require a significant amount of time, even if the agency receives additional funding for crypto-related resources.<br /><br />Behnam explained that with added funding, it would take at least one to two years to establish the rules, while without the extra resources, the process could extend to three to four years. Currently, the CFTC&#8217;s authority is limited to regulating derivatives of digital assets like bitcoin and ether, but Behnam stressed the necessity for expanded oversight, particularly in the spot markets of digital tokens that do not fall under the securities category.<br /><br />Representative David Scott, the top Democrat on the committee, emphasized the importance of providing sufficient funding to the CFTC for this crucial task. The Agriculture Committees in the House and Senate hold jurisdiction over the CFTC due to their oversight of commodities futures, primarily crop-related.<br /><br />To address the urgency surrounding digital asset regulations, House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn &#8216;GT&#8217; Thompson and House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry introduced new legislation that, if passed, would grant greater authority to the CFTC. It would also direct both the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish a more defined pathway for digital assets to be classified as commodities.<br /><br />Behnam underscored the need for proactive policing authority to address potential risks in digital asset markets, especially if they experience significant growth after a period of market correction. He emphasized that unchecked expansion could pose financial stability risks and other concerns for the broader financial markets. <br /><br />The collapses of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/ftx-set-to-make-a-comeback-after-recovering-7-3-billion/">FTX</a>, Celsius, Voyager, and Terra-Luna in the previous year have further fueled regulators&#8217; and policymakers&#8217; push to enhance safeguards around digital assets, should their market size begin to impact the US and global financial sectors.</p>

<p><a href="https://kryptomoney.com/coinbase-gains-regulatory-approval-to-operate-in-bermuda/">Coinbase</a>, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in America, finds itself in legal turmoil just a day after the SEC unleashed a wave of charges against Binance. The regulatory agency has filed a<a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdf"> comprehensive 101</a>-page lawsuit against Coinbase, mirroring the allegations made against <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/cardano-ada-solana-sol-and-polygon-matic-are-securities-sec-asserts/">Binance.</a><br /><br />The SEC claims that Coinbase has neglected to register as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, despite actively performing the functions associated with all three.<br /><br />Furthermore, the SEC accuses Coinbase of violating securities laws by enabling the trading of assets on its platform that meet the criteria set forth by the Howey Test. Despite outwardly expressing a desire to comply with regulations, Coinbase allegedly falls short by allowing these securities to be traded. Among the mentioned assets are prominent cryptocurrencies such as SOL, ADA, and MATIC.<br /><br />In a scathing statement, the commission asserts that Coinbase prioritizes its profit agenda over the interests of investors and compliance with the law that governs the securities markets. The SEC highlights Coinbase&#8217;s failure to register its staking-as-a-service product, alleging that this omission has deprived investors of crucial information about the program.<br /><br />Coinbase had foreseen the possibility of such a lawsuit months ago, but the company maintains its stance that staking products do not fall under the category of securities. Despite this claim, the SEC seeks relief by demanding that Coinbase surrender its wrongfully obtained gains and pay prejudgment interest.<br /><br />As the legal battle unfolds, Coinbase faces the challenge of addressing the SEC&#8217;s allegations and defending its position while the cryptocurrency industry continues to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>According to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-05/jpmorgan-to-use-blockchain-to-settle-usd-fx-trades-in-india-hub?utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=share&amp;utm_campaign=twitter"> Bloomberg News</a>, JP Morgan &amp; Chase Co., the renowned Wall Street giant, is set to launch a blockchain-based system in India for real-time settlement of interbank dollar transactions. The system will undergo a pilot phase to evaluate the experience of participating banks. <br /><br />The initiative is being carried out in collaboration with six of India&#8217;s largest banks, including HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Yes Bank, IndusInd Bank, and JP Morgan&#8217;s local unit.<br /><br />The primary purpose of <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/jp-morgan-formally-registers-crypto-trademark/">JP Morgan</a>&#8216;s blockchain settlement system will be to settle interbank dollar transactions in Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, also known as GIFT City. GIFT City is India&#8217;s ambitious endeavor to establish an international financial and trade hub that rivals Dubai and Singapore.<br /><br />Currently, the domestic non-deliverable forward market in GIFT City operates using a traditional banking system that takes several hours to settle transactions and is inactive on weekends and public holidays. JP Morgan aims to replace this legacy settlement system with its new blockchain project, leveraging its proprietary blockchain platform Onyx, if the pilot phase proves successful. This transition will enable real-time settlement of transactions at any time, significantly improving efficiency.<br /><br />Kaustubh Kulkarni, the senior country officer for India and vice chairman of Asia Pacific at JP Morgan, emphasized the benefits of blockchain technology, stating, &#8220;By leveraging blockchain technology to facilitate transactions on a 24&#215;7 basis, processing is instantaneous and enables GIFT City banks to support their own time zone and operating hours.&#8221;<br /><br />JP Morgan has been actively exploring blockchain technology since 2014, participating in various blockchain initiatives led by traditional banks. <br /><br />Although it left the R3 consortium in 2017, the company established its blockchain unit and launched Onyx in 2020. Onyx offers a range of blockchain-based services for financial institutions, including secure data sharing, multi-currency transfers and clearing, and tokenization of traditional assets into digital form.<br /><br />Furthermore, Onyx provides a platform for institutions seeking to develop their proprietary blockchains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In a significant development, the <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/u-s-congress-to-address-stablecoin-legislation-and-sec-oversight/">US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) </a>has filed a lawsuit against Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and its CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/I02zzqT/sec-v-binance-4-pdf#page=86">alleging</a> that several popular cryptocurrencies offered on the platform are unregistered securities.<br /><br />Notable cryptocurrencies mentioned in the lawsuit include Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), and Polygon (MATIC). The seriousness of the situation is further emphasized as the lawsuit identifies Binance&#8217;s native token BNB and the BUSD stablecoin as securities.<br /><br />The lawsuit goes on to list a range of other crypto assets that are allegedly considered securities, such as FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, and COTI. Additionally, the SEC points out that Binance has listed tokens that have previously faced enforcement actions by the regulatory body, including AMP, REP, UST, and TRX. This suggests a pattern of potential disregard for securities regulations on the part of Binance.<br /><br />It is worth noting that Ethereum (ETH) and Litecoin (LTC) are not included in the list of alleged unregistered securities. SEC Chair Gary Gensler has previously indicated that while Bitcoin (BTC) is viewed as a commodity, the majority of existing tokens are considered unregistered securities by the SEC.<br /><br />The lawsuit specifically accuses <a href="https://kryptomoney.com/binance-faces-doj-investigation-for-alleged-violation-of-russian-sanctions/">Binance </a>of offering unregistered securities trading platforms, engaging in the sale of unregistered crypto asset securities, and maintaining secret control over its US operations to enable high-value US customers to bypass restrictions. It further alleges improper commingling and diversion of billions of dollars in customer funds by Binance.<br /><br />This legal action by the SEC against Binance and CZ underscores the increasing regulatory scrutiny faced by cryptocurrency exchanges and the need for compliance with securities laws. The outcome of the lawsuit will have significant implications for the crypto industry as a whole and could potentially shape future regulations and practices in the market.</p>

<p>Reports have emerged of millions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency missing from users&#8217; self-custodial <a href="https://twitter.com/atomicwallet/status/1664946301815910400?s=46">Atomic Wallet</a>, raising concerns within the crypto community. The project has acknowledged the compromise and is actively investigating the apparent vulnerability. Many users took to Twitter to share their experiences with drained wallet contents, expressing fear and disappointment in Atomic Wallet&#8217;s security measures.<br /><br />Atomic Wallet, which boasts over 5 million downloads, has assured users that it is collaborating with leading security companies and reaching out to analytics firms and exchanges to trace the stolen funds. However, the exact method of the attack remains unclear at this time. Some users claim to have transferred their funds to other wallets in time, avoiding losses, while others have sadly lost their entire cryptocurrency holdings.<br /><br />Atomic Wallet prides itself on its security features, as it does not have access to users&#8217; private keys, which are encrypted and stored locally. However, an auditing firm called Least Authority previously raised concerns about the platform&#8217;s security measures in protecting user assets and private data.<br /><br />Investigative work by<a href="https://kryptomoney.com/bitcoin-blockchain-marks-14th-anniversary/"> blockchain</a> sleuth ZachXBT has identified over $35 million worth of stolen funds, with one victim losing nearly $8 million in Tether. The incident has had a significant impact on the price of Atomic Wallet&#8217;s ERC-20 token AWC, which has experienced a decline of over 96% since its all-time high in May 2021.<br /><br />The cryptocurrency industry as a whole has seen an increase in attacks, with hacks accounting for the majority of funds lost. In the first quarter of 2023 alone, an estimated $440 million was stolen across 73 incidents, surpassing losses from scams and other malicious activities.<br /><br />There is a glimmer of hope for the victims of the Atomic Wallet exploit, as some funds have been recovered through the collaboration of ZachXBT, Jito Labs&#8217; pseudonymous CEO Buffalo, and an employee at an MEV infrastructure company. However, the team is cautious about sharing their methodology, as it could potentially lead to further losses for other victims. Despite the challenges, Buffalo remains optimistic that their solution can provide assistance and support to those affected by the hack.<br /><br />The Atomic Wallet incident serves as a reminder of the importance of robust security measures within the crypto industry and the need for constant vigilance to protect user funds.</p>
