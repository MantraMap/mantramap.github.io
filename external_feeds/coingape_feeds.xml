In a recent development, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://coingape.com/us-supreme-court-agrees-to-abolish-us-sec-cftcs-powers//" target="_blank" rel="noopener">agreed</a> to consider abolishing the Chevron Doctrine, which allows federal regulatory agencies like the SEC to take decisions when there is no clear statute in law. If the top court goes on to get rid of the Doctrine, it could significantly dent powers enjoyed by the likes of SEC Chair Gary Gensler in regard to the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto market</a>. There are many disagreements between what the SEC perceives about crypto regulatory compliance and what the crypto firms face outside of the United States in terms of regulation.</p>

<h2>Chevron Doctrine Vs Crypto Market</h2>
<p>Deaton said the Chevron Doctrine case is not directly applicable to what the SEC and Gary Gensler are doing in the crypto market. However, there is a clear violation of the decision making liberty the SEC gains from the Doctrine. The Howey Test decides what type of transaction constitutes an investment contract.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What they are doing is not misinterpreting a statute but are grossly expanding (unconstitutionally) the Howey Test definition and its reach by applying it to the secondary market sales and the underlying assets. They (the SEC) can’t cite a case in the last many decades that supports this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, Deaton <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPJbMEodjKw" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a> Custodia Bank’s fight against the U.S. Federal Reserve is the most important in the crypto industry. The Federal Reserve Board had in January 2023 denied the bank’s application to become a member of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve System</a> owing to its focus on crypto assets presenting “significant safety and soundness risks.” The attorney argued that it is because of the Chevron Doctrine that Custodia Bank has been denied despite promising more than 100 percent reserves. He made the comments in the backdrop of a widespread banking service access to the crypto firms in the United States.</p>

As contained in a shareholder letter, DCG </span><a rel='nofollow'  href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dcgs-cfo-steps-down-crypto-133358735.html#:~:text=Also%20in%20the%20letter%2C%20DCG,down%20from%20a%20year%20earlier."><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> it raked in a total of $180 million in revenue for the quarter, a figure that is up by 63% from the fourth quarter of last year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The growth in the DCG revenue stemmed from the recovery that was experienced in the broader crypto ecosystem. For the quarter, the company said its losses for the quarter came in at $6 million, based on adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“DCG’s financial performance this year so far is reflective of the market,” the letter said, adding that its revenue for the year came in at $620 million and that it repaid a $350 million senior secured term loan for the quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Digital Currency Group entered this year with a great deal of uncertainty stemming from the financial distress experienced by some business entities in its lending arm Genesis. The losses incurred by Genesis that eventually led to its </span><a href="https://coingape.com/genesis-bankruptcy-crypto-brokerage-could-be-next-after-blockfi/"><span style="font-weight: 400">insolvency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was due to its exposure to FTX Derivatives Exchange which </span><a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-bankruptcy-lawyers-locate-2-2-billion-worth-of-crypto-assets-in-ftx-linked-wallets/"><span style="font-weight: 400">filed for bankruptcy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> earlier in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The current performance outlook did not just show that DCG’s finances had become partly stabilized, it shows the firm has started reaping good rewards from its numerous business ventures.</span></p>
<h2><b>Digital Currency Group: Charting the Future</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Digital Currency Group suffered quite a major blow to its finances in the 2022 Financial year with a total loss of $1.1 billion bordering on crypto prices plunge and Genesis restructuring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The loss is being parred off but the man behind the company’s financial department, the Chief Financial Officer Michael Kraines stepped down from his role in the firm. The company told its investors that Kraines’ role will be temporarily taken over by President Mark Murphy and Chief Strategy Officer Simon Koster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The company said it had enlisted the services of Heidrick &amp; Struggles to help in searching for a new CFO. The experts that will be taking over the role in the firm will have to do a lot to reposition the business and continue on a path of profitability.</span></p>

<h2>US SEC Fighting With Wrong Claims?</h2>
<p>In a recent Op-ed published on Bloomberg law, Attorney John Deaton slammed U.S SEC Chair, Gary Gensler over his approach toward crypto with the Howey Test. He mentioned that back in 1946, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a vital decision in SEC Vs Howey. The court laid out a specific definition of what constitutes a security.</p>
<p>The justices at that time wouldn’t have guessed how complex digital commerce be ahead, he added. Meanwhile, the SEC Chair holds his own idea of how cryptocurrency should be regulated today and it is taking it into a dangerous corner in the court. <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/xrp/?utm_source=menubar" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Read More XRP News Here&#8230;</strong></a></p>
<blockquote><p>As per the Howey Test, a transaction is a security if it is an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with a reasonable expectation of profit derived from the efforts of others.</p></blockquote>
<p>In order to prove an investment contract a security, all three prongs of Howey must be satisfied. Earlier, Coingape reported that <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-win-against-us-sec-might-upgrade-howey-test-for-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ripple&#8217;s win against US SEC</a> might upgrade Howey Test for Crypto.</p>
<p>XRP holders’ lawyer highlighted that the SEC for a long two years in the Ripple lawsuit is not arguing this. The commission is claiming that all sales of XRP have been and will be security ahead. The commission stretches to claim that the very nature of the digital asset is to be a security.</p>

<p>Deaton added that clear rules and regulations are to protect people. However, the SEC here is exploiting legal uncertainty about crypto. Gary Gensler is moving radically to redefine what constitutes an investment contract and a common enterprise.</p>

However, since last week, the price has retested the aforementioned support twice indicating the formation of a double bottom pattern in the daily time frame chart. Here’s how this pattern may influence the future price trend of Cardano coins.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the double bottom pattern reflects the increase in buying at a particular base support which encourages buyers for trend reversal</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple technical levels concentrated at $0.38 validate this level as a higher accumulation zone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the ADA coin is $214.5 Million, indicating a 26% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/2/2sUFrCXb.png" alt="Cardano Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The base support at which the Cardano price forms the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/double-bottom-pattern/">double bottom pattern</a> is $0.38 which is aligned with 50% Fibonacci retracement level. A correction phase to the 0.5% FIB is beneficial for buyers to recuperate the bullish momentum and prolong the prevailing bullish trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, the ADA price trades at $0.389 with an intraday gain of 0.75%. Moreover, the daily candle shows a hammer-type candle at $0.38 support indicating a higher possibility of price reversal.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/top-crypto-margin-trading-platforms-in-australia/">Top 10 Crypto Margin Trading Platforms In Australia</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This potential rally may drive the coin price to 8% to challenge the neckline resistance of this pattern at $0.42. A bullish breakout above this candle will strengthen the buying pressure and raise the coin’s market value by another 9-10% to hit the last swing high resistance of $0.46.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a breakdown below $0.38 will offset the bullish pattern and prolong the correction phase.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative strength index: </b>A<span style="font-weight: 400;"> slight bullish divergence in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">daily RSI</a> slope reflects the increasing buying pressure which may encourage the completion of a double-bottom pattern.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The 100-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> aligned with the $0.38 mark increases the support strength of this level.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cardano Coin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.388</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Medium</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.4 and $0.46</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.38 and $0.35</span></li>

Essentially, taxation on mining is a way to discourage <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/crypto-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto mining</a> in the United States and hence will only become a matter of an alternate jurisdictions for mining companies. Already, Coinbase on Tuesday <a href="https://coingape.com/coinbase-news-launches-derivatives-exchange/?utm_source=sidebartabnews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it was launching the Coinbase International Exchange.</p>

<p>Earlier, CoinGape reported that the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) pointed to effects of crypto mining related high energy consumption. The Council is <a href="https://coingape.com/biden-proposes-30-climate-change-tax-bitcoin-miners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to have mentioned in an upcoming report about the negative spillovers on environment, quality of life, and electricity grids.</p>
<h2>Nic Carter Says Taxing Would Increase Emissions</h2>
<p>Ventire capitalist and popular crypto figure Nic Carter argued that the Biden taxation move could actually be counter-productive to the environment. He <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/nic__carter/status/1653403842447302658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that jurisdictions like China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Iran, Venezuela and Malaysia have higher carbon intensity for Bitcoin mining related power generation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Banning mining in the U.S. won&#8217;t cause there to be less BTC mining. It will simply mean that mining occurs elsewhere. Other places with higher carbon intensity BTC mining.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>It may also be recalled that billionaire Elon Musk said Tesla was staying away from Bitcoin due to the emissions release from electricity generated for Bitcoin mining.</p>

The strong support has turned the falling prices sideways and revealed the formation of a famous bearish continue pattern called an inverted flag. In theory, the pattern prolongs the ongoing downtrend after the prices breach the flag support and offers a short-selling opportunity to interested traders.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>Key Points: </b></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bearish breakdown from the $0.00000981 support will accelerate selling pressure and tumble the coin price 12% down</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A long-coming support trendline may undermine the ongoing correction phase</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume of the Shiba Inu coin is $110.4 Million, showing a 13% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/yB002flL.png" alt="SHIB Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As shown in the above chart, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/#:~:text=The%20live%20Shiba%20Inu%20price,market%20cap%20of%20%244%2C986%2C438%2C590%20USD.">SHIB price</a> is resonating within the flag range spread from $0.0000118 and $0.00000977. As of now, the coin price trades at the $0.00000995 mark and retests the aforementioned support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the influence of this pattern, the coin price is likely to escape this temporary sideways trend once sellers pierce the $0.00000977 local support. This breakdown may intensify the selling pressure and tumble of 12% down to retest an ascending trendline.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Triangle Pattern Likely To Replenish Bullish Momentum In Shiba Inu Price</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/5/5QFLK6t3.png" alt="SHIB Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the weekly time frame chart, the aforementioned ascending trendline is part of a bigger chart pattern called a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle</a>. This chart pattern has maintained a sideways trend in Shiba Inu price for nearly a year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this long-coming chart pattern should have a stronger impact on Shiba Inu’s future trend, and therefore a retest to this support trendline is more likely to trigger a fresh recovery rally like it did in June 2022, and January 2023.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Moving Average Convergence Divergence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a>(blue) and signal(orange) lines give a strong sell signal with its bearish crossover below the midline.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> act as a dynamics resistance to assist selling to complete the bearish pattern</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.0000995</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: High</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance levels- $0.0000107 and $0.0000117</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels: $0.00001 and $0.00000875</span></li>

However, the bearish pullback halts above the 50% <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fibonacci-retracement/">Fibonacci retracement level</a> indicating the overall market sentiment remains bullish. Here’s how this level may further influence the XRP price to replenish bullish momentum</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key Points:</span></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The XRP price falling for four consecutive days with low volume reflects a potential downfall to $0.433 at 0.5 FIB level</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A correction phase to 0.5 FIB is considered healthy and encourages the resumption of a bullish trend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP is $940.5 Million, indicating a 13.6% gain.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/j/J4wqlorp.png" alt="XRP price" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On April 29th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp/">XRP price</a> turned down from the $0.48 resistance and tumbled the coin price 5.34% to reach the current price of $0.46. This reversal formed a new lower high at the aforementioned resistance indicating a high possibility of downtrend resumption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With sustained selling, the XRP price is likely to tumble another 6-7% and retest the 50% FIB level at $0.44. During the April fourth week, the daily candle showed multiple lower price rejection candles at this support, validating it as a high accumulation zone.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/low-cap-crypto-gems-gunning-to-explode/">Low Cap Crypto Gems Gunning To Explode In 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the altcoin is more likely to revert from this support and kickstart a fresh recovery rally. Furthermore, the daily chart shows a new resistance trendline currently carrying the ongoing correction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A potential breakout from this trendline will be a key signal for the end of the retracement phase and bullish recovery which may bring the coin back to $0.55 higher.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><b>Bollinger Band: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lower band of the <a href="https://coingape.com/education/bollinger-band/">Bollinger band indicator</a> situated near the $0.44 support increases the support strength of this level.</span></p>
<p><b>Exponential Moving Average: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 20-day <a href="https://coingape.com/education/exponential-moving-average-how-to-leverage-it-in-crypto-market/">EMA</a> slope flipped into a significant resistance that could assist sellers to undermine a bullish rally. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">XRP Intraday Price Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot price: $0.4614</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bearish</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $0.487 and $0.55</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $0.44 and $0.356</span></li>

PayPal will protect customers from all unauthorized crypto transfers from their accounts.</p>
<p>It will help PayPal increase in user base as well as protect its customers from events such as <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> and hacks. However, Reg E will only apply in case of unauthorized crypto transactions and errors.</p>
<h2>PayPal Protects Crypto Investors With Insurance</h2>
<p>PayPal Senior Vice President Jose Fernandez da Ponte recently announced <a href="https://coingape.com/paypal-crypto-push-venmo-users-transfer-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crypto transfer feature on Venmo</a> or PayPal. Customers could also transfer crypto to external wallets and crypto exchanges. Jose Fernandez da Ponte said they will also protect customers from unauthorized transactions.</p>
<p>As per updated <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.paypal.com/us/legalhub/cryptocurrencies-tnc" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">terms and conditions</a>, PayPal will protect customers from unauthorized activity involving the purchase or sale of crypto assets from their accounts.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;PayPal will cover you for the full amount of unauthorized purchase or sale activity, as long as you cooperate with us, and follow the procedures described below.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In case of unauthorized crypto transfers, customers will be reimbursed with up to a max amount of $50,000 over the life of the account holder. PayPal is the first company to promise to compensate users for any losses incurred by unauthorized cryptocurrency transfers.</p>
<p>Unauthorized transactions including password hacked used to send cryptocurrencies from a PayPal account or if crypto assets are sold from the account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Any reimbursement you receive from PayPal represents a warranty of our own services. PayPal does not provide insurance and does not insure you against loss of your crypto assets.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The insurance provided is Regulation E for electronic funds transfers. The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is yet to enforce Reg E for crypto payments. However, voluntary protection by PayPal is a crucial development in the regulatory framework for protecting cryptocurrency customers.</p>

This move comes at a time when <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/coinbase/">Coinbase</a> is facing a number of regulatory difficulties at home in the United States.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Launches International Exchange</h2>
<p>According to the latest <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/introducing-coinbase-international-exchange" rel="nofollow">announcement</a> by Coinbase, the platform will be known as the Coinbase International Exchange and will provide a robust trading experience with the help of a number of external market makers who are keen to provide liquidity. Additionally, it will have a liquidation framework that meets stringent compliance standards as well.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="U.S. Investors Abandoning Crypto Exchanges, But Where Are They Going?" href="https://coingape.com/crypto-news-usa-citizens-abandon-crypto-exchanges/" rel="bookmark">U.S. Investors Abandoning Crypto Exchanges, But Where Are They Going?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The move marks Coinbase&#8217;s latest step into derivative trading, which is one of the most popular sectors of the global <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">cryptocurrency market</a>, although being essentially barred from operating in the United States &#8212; as it requires substantial regulatory and compliance monitoring.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Implements 5X Leverage</h2>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> and Ethereum (ETH) perpetual futures contracts went live on the Coinbase International Exchange where every transaction is settled in <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/usd-coin-usdc/">USDC</a>, and as per the company&#8217;s statement, there will be no introduction of fiat on-ramps. Meanwhile, Circle CEO also chimed in to congratulate Coinbase&#8217;s new endeavor and highlighted USDC&#8217;s presence as the sole stablecoin pair used in the exchange.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very excited to see <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@coinbase</a> International Exchange launch.  Highly competitive, excellent execution and product quality, and USDC as the sole native digital dollar used for funding, collateral and trading.  Congrats <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@brian_armstrong</a>!</p>
<p>&mdash; Jeremy Allaire (@jerallaire) <a href="https://twitter.com/jerallaire/status/1653398782774575105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>In the beginning, the contracts provide leverage of up to five times and can be increased going forward, according to Coinbase. Furthermore, institutional clients located in qualified jurisdictions outside of the United States are also able to access the trading platform through APIs.</p>
<p>While speaking about the firm&#8217;s association with US citizens and operations, the Coinbase team was quoted as saying:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rest assured that Coinbase is committed to the US, but countries around the world are increasingly moving forward with responsible crypto-forward regulatory frameworks to strategically position themselves as crypto hubs.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the wake of this Coinbase news, the share price of COIN dropped by 1% and is currently exchanging hands at $49.46 at the time of writing.</p>

Although the current Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s term ends in June 2026, the change could be enforced due to the incumbent&#8217;s ambitions in a different capacity. It is widely known that Gensler has been facing heavy criticism for his style of functioning and the SEC&#8217;s tough regulatory stance on the crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Also Read: <a href="https://coingape.com/singapore-state-owned-temasek-denies-10m-investment-in-array" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Singapore State-Owned Temasek Denies $10M Investment in Array</strong></a></p>
<p>The speculation around Gensler&#8217;s Senate run stem from the retirement news of Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland. Senator Cardin announced that he will not be running for Senate in 2024 election, as per a New York Times <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/us/politics/ben-cardin-maryland-senate-seat.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>. Hence, speculation is rife that Gary Gensler, who hails from Baltimore, Maryland in the United States, is speculated to be running for Cardin’s seat in Maryland.</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler Running For Maryland Senate Seat</h2>
<p>According to Ryan Selkis, Cofounder and CEO, Messari, Gensler is likely to run for the Senate seat citing his grim chances of becoming the Treasury Secretary. Calling Gensler a dishonest public figure, Selkis <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/twobitidiot/status/1653065795809714177?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the state deserves better representation.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Chair Gensler is likely to run for Ben Cardin’s Senate seat in Maryland since he has zero shot of ever becoming Treasury Secretary. I will be actively campaigning against him because he’s a dishonest public figure and Maryland deserves better.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, Gensler faced heavy grilling from Congressmen during the House Financial Services Committee on the SEC&#8217;s oversight. The Committee&#8217;s Chair Patrick McHenry sided with the crypto community that there was clearly no clarity on regulatory framework while the SEC has been initiating enforcement actions.</p>

As part of its offerings, Brazilians will be given access to foreign exchange with remittance capabilities in multiple currencies including the Brazilian Real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nik Storonsky, Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the digital bank said &#8220;Brazil is an exciting market for Revolut and holds enormous potential for our global expansion.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our mission is to unlock a borderless economy with financial products that are accessible and easy to use and that allow our customers to use their money efficiently. We will start with the global account and crypto investments, but this is just the beginning,” he added</span></p>
<h2><b>Revolut Eyes Brazil&#8217;s Large Financial Market</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Revolut had been mulling over this expansion into Brazil for more than a year now. In March 2022, Glauber Mota was hired as its new Brazil CEO and at the same time, a waiting list was opened in preparation for the full launch of the company. Now that the digital bank has completed the launch in the Latin American nation, the waitlist will be expanded while existing names will be rolled out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Brazil is recognized as the largest market in the region for financial services. When he was appointed the Brazil CEO, Mota confirmed that citizens of the country are some of the most active digital population globally. Also, he asserted that a huge number of Brazilians use digital banks as their primary accounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The total that Brazilians spent abroad more than doubled in 2022, totalling $12 billion, and there is growing demand for access to crypto assets with more than ten million individual investors in Brazil. Revolut offers Brazilians an app that meets all these needs in one place, with a high-quality UX that has not yet been seen in the Brazilian market,&#8221; Mota explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it progresses, Revolut would have to compete with the likes of Nubank which already </span><a href="https://coingape.com/just-in-brazils-nubank-to-allow-crypto-trading/"><span style="font-weight: 400">offers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> crypto trading services in Brazil and also </span><a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-news-live-updates-19-october/"><span style="font-weight: 400">introduced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> its cryptocurrency dubbed Nucoin.</span></p>

The decision shocked investors as the central bank claimed further tightening is needed to control inflation as it has passed the peak, but 7% is still too high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the European Central Bank (ECB) also expects to raise interest rates as inflation reaches 7% in the Euro Area. While the ECB was set to deliver a 25 bps rate increase in May, the bank may increase the rate by another 50 bps to control inflation and bring it to the 2% target.</p>
<h2>Australia Looks for More Rate Hike to Control Inflation</h2>
<p>The Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia on May 2 meeting <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2023/mr-23-10.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=media-release&amp;utm_campaign=monetary-policy-decision-2023-may" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">decided</a> to raise interest rates by 25 bps to 3.85%. The central bank also raised the rate paid on Exchange Settlement balances by 25 bps to 3.75%.</p>
<p>The hawkish stance caused the Australian dollar to rise while bond futures tumbled traders expect more pressure after Governor Philip Lowe revealed further tightening to being back inflation under the target range.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Inflation in Australia has passed its peak, but at 7% is still too high and it will be some time yet before it is back in the target range. Given the importance of returning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe, the Board judged that a further increase in interest rates was warranted today.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The Australian labor market remained tight, with employment blowing past expectations in March and the unemployment rate at its lowest point in nearly half a century.</p>
<p id="description">Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Inflation rate in the Euro Area slightly increased to 7% in April from a 13-month low of 6.9% in March. The ECB will likely increase interest rates by 25 bps this week to control inflation near the 2% target.</p>
<p>The global crypto and stock markets remain under pressure as the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Fed</a> also decides its key rate hike on May 3 amid the banking crisis and the debt ceiling crisis. Traders await Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s stance for guidance on the rates in the coming months.</p>

<h2>Crypto Market Remains Subdued</h2>
<p>The crypto market remains subdued with low trading volumes across all major cryptocurrencies. <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin price</a> currently trades at $28,087, down 2% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Whereas, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/ethereum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum price</a> trades near the $1,800 level. The crypto market continues to be under pressure amid major events this week.</p>

This development comes on the heels of the U.S. government&#8217;s repeated claims of potential damage to the environment caused by a subset of the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<h2>US Claims Crypto Mining Poses Threat To Society</h2>
<p>According to a recent report that is set to be published in the White House today, the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) argues that Crypto miners&#8217; high-energy consumption has negative spillovers on the environment, quality of life, and electricity grids where such businesses are located.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: <a title="LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?" href="https://coingape.com/lunc-news-dev-teases-ai-app-chain-block-entropy/" rel="bookmark">LUNC Developer Teases AI App Chain “Block Entropy”, LUNC Price Eyeing $0.1?</a></strong></em></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency mining business is being unfairly targeted, according to those who oppose the planned tax. The rampant crypto crackdowns by the regulators and now a proposed bill to impose hefty tax stand out as a sore eye for the larger <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/">crypto market</a> and being part of a larger anti-crypto crusade. According to Tom Mapes, head of energy policy at the Chamber of Digital Commerce, who <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-proposes-30-climate-change-tax-on-cryptocurrency-mining-120033242.html" rel="nofollow">spoke</a> with Yahoo News, stated that &#8220;this is just a way to go after the industry which they do not support.”</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s PoW In Controversy</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/proof-of-work-pow/">Proof-of-Work mechanism</a> has long been appreciated and debated since its inception. Massive supercomputers compete with one another in order to be the first to solve a mathematical riddle in the process of PoW cryptocurrency mining. According to a report published by the White House in September of last year, the mining of cryptocurrencies consumes more electricity than the entire country of Australia. It is estimated that cryptocurrency mining accounts for 0.9% to 1.7% of total electricity use in the United States, which is home to approximately one-third of all mining operations.</p>
<p>Recently, the Cryptocurrency Environmental Alliance (CEA) states in a post that &#8220;currently, cryptocurrency mining firms do not have to pay for the full cost they inflict on others, which includes local environmental pollution, higher energy prices, and the massive impacts of increased greenhouse gas emissions on the climate.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://coingape.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin’s price</a> is currently exchanging hands at $28,046 with a market cap of $544 billion.</p>

Thus, if you have missed the Pepecoin rally, here are some of the top meme coins showing a bullish setup to encourage a sustained bull run.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin(DOGE)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/f/FZ2axmMC.png" alt="Memecoins- Doge" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/dogecoin/">Dogecoin price</a> currently trades at the $0.0783 mark and is down 89.39% from its All-Time High of $0.737. However, the weekly chart shows the prevailing downtrend has turned sideways and reflects the exhausted bullish momentum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, this sideways trend shows the formation of a <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/symmetrical-triangle-pattern/">symmetrical triangle pattern</a>, offering an excellent chart pattern to kickstart a bullish recovery. A potential bullish breakout from the pattern’s resistance trendline will offer buyers a significant launchpad and signal an early sign of trend reversal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A predetermined target for this pattern could be around $0.025, but with sustained buying, the Dogecoin price may continue to chase the ATH mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiba Inu(SHIB)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/l/LFl1nOcO.png" alt="Memecoins- Shib" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Dogecoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/price/shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu coin price</a> reveals the formation of a symmetrical triangle pattern. The coin price rebounded twice from both the converging trendline of this pattern indicating the traders respect this pattern and may follow its potential target.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of now Shib price trades at the $0.0000099 mark and 88.85% down from its ATH of $0.00008845. A weekly candle closing above the trendline will be the key signal for trend reversal and may drive this memecoin above the $0.000025 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the bullish trend remains intact, the Shiba price could revisit the ATH peak.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Floki(FLOKI)</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/8/8N6pliy7.png" alt="Memecoins- Floki" width="1946" height="1105" /></strong>Source- Tradingview </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Floki coin price is the weekly time that shows a texted book example of a famous bullish reversal pattern called <a href="https://coingape.com/education/cup-and-handle-pattern-how-to-identify-and-take-leverage-of-it/">cup and handle</a>. This memecoin is 90.85% down from the $0.0003437 All time high and is currently trading at $0.0000315 and forms the handle portion of the pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern is usually spotted at market bottoms and is used to find multi-bagger assets. In theory, a bullish breakout from the pattern’s neckline gives 5 to 6 times the distance between the neckline and the cup bottom as the target. Thus, if Floki price coins breach the pattern neckline resistance, the buyers are more likely to drive a sustained recovery to rechallenge the ATH ceiling.</span></p>
