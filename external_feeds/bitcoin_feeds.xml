Russian Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov added that many countries, including those that do not face sanctions, are gravitating towards using national currencies in trade settlements.</strong></p>
<h2>BRICS Currency and De-Dollarization</h2>
<p>With the BRICS leaders’ summit on the horizon, there is a growing discussion about de-dollarization and the feasibility of a common BRICS currency. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The summit will take place from Aug. 22-24 in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation, told reporters on Thursday that experts are discussing the possibility and feasibility of introducing a common currency, Russian state-owned news agency Ria Novosti reported (translated by Google’s AI program). “This is still a discussion process, it is clear that it will be stretched over time,” he was quoted as saying. The Kremlin spokesperson described:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the near future, it is unlikely that this will be feasible, but the use of national currencies is already a reality that is growing on a global scale, and this practice is not only used by countries that face sanctions, but also by those that do not face them.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The process of de-dollarization of the global economy is inexorably underway. Many countries are gravitating towards the trajectory of using national currencies,” he emphasized.</p>
<p>Last week, Russia&#8217;s deputy prime minister stated that the topic of a common BRICS currency <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-official-says-brics-currency-could-be-discussed-at-upcoming-summit/">could be discussed</a> at the economic bloc&#8217;s upcoming summit. However, South Africa’s diplomat in charge of BRICS relations, Anil Sooklal, has insisted: “There’s never been talk of a BRICS currency, <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-currency-not-on-agenda-for-leaders-summit-nations-to-focus-on-de-dollarization/">it’s not on the agenda</a>.” Moreover, Leslie Maasdorp, vice president and chief financial officer of the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS Bank, recently clarified that the economic bloc has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">no immediate plan</a> to launch a currency to compete with the U.S. dollar.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been rumors circulating regarding the BRICS economic bloc planning to launch a <a class="sc-hWhWUk dZhDeq" href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-bank-official-discusses-common-currency-as-reports-of-gold-backed-brics-currency-gain-attention/">gold-backed currency</a>. Numerous individuals believe that a common BRICS currency could erode the U.S. dollar’s status as the world’s dominant currency. However, there are hurdles to overcome. The governor of Russia&#8217;s central bank, for instance, has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russias-central-bank-brics-currency-requires-consent-of-many-parties-faces-implementation-challenges/">warned</a> that establishing a BRICS currency would require the consent of numerous parties.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-interest-soars-40-countries-seek-membership-as-de-dollarization-efforts-grow/">More than 40 nations</a> have expressed their desire to become part of the BRICS alliance, with 22 countries already submitting formal applications. Additionally, Sooklal disclosed that South Africa has extended invitations to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/brics-invites-69-leaders-to-august-summit-western-countries-omitted/">69 leaders</a> for the summit, encompassing all African heads of state and key leaders from prominent Global South organizations. However, he affirmed that no Western countries have been invited.</p>

<h2>Social Media Bots Boosted FTX-Listed Coins, Says Report</h2>
<p>Analyzing over three million posts from 2019 to 2023 mentioning 18 FTX-listed coins, <a href="https://networkcontagion.us/reports/7-31-23-bot-driven-gold-rush-unmasking-the-role-of-inauthentic-social-media-activity-on-the-crypto-market-and-beyond/">NCRI’s report</a> found bot-like X accounts made up around 20% of online chatter about these cryptocurrencies. The study suggests this inauthentic social media activity effectively forecasted price changes for half of the FTX-associated coins examined.</p>
<p>NCRI&#8217;s analysis shows <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">FTX</a> promotions on X immediately preceded surges in the coins&#8217; values, with the proportion of inauthentic posts steadily growing over time to around 50% of total chatter. The findings indicate manipulative tactics were used to artificially boost market sentiment after the coins&#8217; FTX listings.</p>

<p>The report also analyzed activity around recently launched crypto tokens like <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/meme-coin-pepes-market-cap-surpasses-1b-with-896-surge-over-the-past-week/">the meme coin PEPE</a>, detecting abnormal account creation patterns and predictive links between bot posts and price changes. This points to ongoing potential market manipulation via coordinated inauthentic social media activity. The study found that the FTX-listed coins SPELL, IMX, GALA, RNDR, and BOBA were involved in this type of behavior.</p>
<p>“It is notable that bot activity appears to rise beginning with official promotion by FTX,” NCRI researchers detail. “This suggests that FTX promotion may have proven catalytic for attracting inauthentic amplification. While listing on FTX attracted substantial increases in overall chatter for each coin, it is notable that the proportion of inauthenticity in this chatter significantly increased over time.”</p>

<p>As cryptocurrencies become increasingly mainstream, the prospect of manipulation through bots and fake social media accounts poses major risks to investors and financial stability, the NCRI report concludes. The NCRI researchers further underscore the need for greater transparency and oversight of cryptocurrency markets prone to volatility from orchestrated hype and deception on platforms like X.</p>
<p>NCRI&#8217;s study demonstrates social media&#8217;s critical role in the meteoric rise and spectacular collapse of FTX amid allegations of fraud. The NCRI findings suggest the FTX empire leaned heavily on inauthentic online engagement to prop up worthless assets — a &#8220;bot-driven gold rush&#8221; with echoes of pump-and-dump schemes.</p>

Lichtenstein made the admission while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in a Washington, D.C. federal court, with his wife, Heather Morgan, also pleading guilty to related charges. </strong></p>
<h2>Groundbreaking Admission: Ilya Lichtenstein Confesses to 2016 Bitfinex Hack</h2>
<p>Until the court&#x2019;s admission on Thursday, the person responsible for the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bitfinex-hack-bitcoin/">hack from Bitfinex</a> was unknown to the public. Though not charged with the hack itself, Lichtenstein faces a maximum of 20 years in prison for one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. His wife, Morgan, an aspiring rapper known as &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/accused-bitfinex-bitcoin-money-launderer-heather-razzlekhan-morgan-speaks-for-the-first-time-since-her-arrest/">Razzlekahn</a>&#x201D; could face up to five years. This is the first time the identity of the hacker has been disclosed, with the couple facing significant prison time, as CNBC first <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/03/new-york-man-admits-being-original-bitfinex-hacker-during-guilty-plea-in-dc-to-bitcoin-money-laundering.html">reported</a> on the matter.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-seizes-94636-bitcoin-2016-bitfinex-hack-largest-crypto-seizure-to-date-2-people-arrested/">seized</a> over 94,000 bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) out of the more than 119,000 hacked, worth billions at the time of arrest in February 2022. Since then, the government has confiscated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ny-couple-to-forfeit-billions-in-crypto-and-cash-in-plea-deal-over-bitfinex-hack-laundering-case/">$475 million</a> more related to the hack. Lichtenstein&#x2019;s attack was quite similar to James Zhong&#x2019;s attack against the Silk Road. &#x201C;Lichtenstein used a number of advanced hacking tools and techniques to gain access to Bitfinex&#x2019;s network,&#x201D; the DOJ said, according to CNBC&#x2019;s report. The government&#x2019;s complaint further added:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once inside their systems, Lichtenstein fraudulently authorized more than 2,000 transactions in which 119,754 bitcoin was transferred from Bitfinex to a cryptocurrency wallet in Lichtenstein&#x2019;s control.</p></blockquote>
<p>CNBC reporters Eamon Javers, and Dan Mangan further detailed that Morgan played an active role, assisting her husband in laundering the stolen funds. Around 25,000 stolen bitcoin were transferred out of Lichtenstein&#x2019;s wallet through a complex money laundering process, ending up in accounts controlled by the couple, the report highlights. Further investigation revealed that the couple converted some assets into gold coins, with Morgan even burying them at a location known to law enforcement.</p>

<p>Lichtenstein&#x2019;s travels to Ukraine and Kazakhstan were discovered to involve converting digital assets to cash through Russian and Ukrainian middlemen, then shipping it to addresses where he could retrieve it. The crypto couple&#x2019;s high-profile court case occurred on the same day as the former president, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/former-us-president-donald-trump-warns-of-economic-depression-if-hes-not-elected/">Donald Trump</a>, was charged, leading to a rescheduling of the proceedings.</p>

<h2>CNN Poll Reveals Majority See Worsening Economy</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/cnn-poll-economic-pessimism-joe-biden/index.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_content=2023-08-03T10%3A45%3A06">survey</a> of 1,279 adults found that 51% think the U.S. economy remains in a downturn that is getting worse, even as indicators like job growth, GDP, and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-inflation-hits-two-year-low-boosting-stocks-and-precious-metals/">inflation</a> suggest stabilization or improvement. The persistent pessimism comes as U.S. president Joe Biden nears the launch of his 2024 reelection campaign against Republican contenders.</p>
<p>CNN conducted the poll from July 1 to July 31 using a combination of online surveys and live telephone interviews. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.</p>
<p>Economic concerns dominated when respondents were asked to name the most important issue facing America today. Nearly half pointed to issues like inflation, poverty, and the overall economy. Dissatisfaction with personal finances also remains high, with 55% saying they are dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The partisan divide on economic perceptions remains significant. While 39% of Democrats now say the economy is recovering, just 26% of independents and 23% of Republicans share that view. Feelings that the economy is worsening remain widespread among independents (51%) and Republicans (74%).</p>
<p>Still, Biden&#8217;s approval rating has inched up since last summer&#8217;s lows. The new poll puts his overall approval at 41%, largely unchanged since spring. Approval of his handling of the economy (37%) and inflation (30%) remains low.</p>
<p>Most Americans report making changes to afford necessities, like altering grocery purchases (71%), cutting entertainment spending (70%), and reducing driving (48%). Half say they changed summer travel plans due to costs. But some impacts bifurcate along partisan lines, with Republicans more likely to report reductions in driving.</p>
<p>Congress fares poorly in the survey, with 68% saying lawmakers have not effectively addressed major issues. Most now express more trust in Republicans in Congress (54%) than Biden (45%) on these problems. Biden’s “Bidenomics” has <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bidenomics-agenda-struggles-to-gain-support-as-joe-bidens-approval-ratings-plummet/">struggled</a> to gain support and lift the president’s rankings.</p>

<p>The CNN poll suggests economic messages may challenge both parties as the 2024 presidential race takes shape. Persistent pessimism among key voter blocs could complicate Democrats&#8217; arguments about recovery.</p>
<p>While the U.S. has seen encouraging economic indicators, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_bank_failures_in_the_United_States">three of the largest bank failures in U.S. history</a> culminated this past spring. U.S. regulators just <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/another-us-bank-collapses-heartland-tri-state-bank-closed-by-regulator/">shut down</a> Heartland Tri-State Bank and Fitch Ratings <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/white-house-yellen-slam-fitchs-us-rating-downgrade-biden-officials-call-it-bizarre-and-baseless/">downgraded</a> the United States&#8217; debt rating this week.</p>

<h2>Dubai&#8217;s FTX Exchange Faces Voluntary Liquidation After Motion to Dismiss From Parent Company</h2>
<p>In the <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/Home-DocketInfo">motion</a> filed in Delaware bankruptcy court, FTX stated that FTX Dubai has never engaged in operational activities or had any customers. The crypto exchange received a license to operate in Dubai in July 2022 but did not offer any services prior to FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy filing in November. <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-obtains-dubai-license-to-provide-crypto-exchange-services/">Dubai</a> regulators suspended FTX Dubai&#8217;s license shortly after the bankruptcy filing, and the license expired in July 2023.</p>
<p>Without having commenced any revenue-generating activities, FTX’s court filing said its Dubai subsidiary has no reasonable likelihood of rehabilitating operations. Additionally, the company stated that FTX Dubai has a positive cash balance and is solvent, making it suitable for a voluntary liquidation procedure under United Arab Emirates (UAE) law.</p>
<p>FTX believes dismissing the Dubai unit would allow for an orderly wind-down and liquidation of assets. The cash balance could then be used for timely distribution after paying outstanding liabilities. FTX Dubai currently holds around $4.5 million spread across bank accounts.</p>
<p>The motion argues that bankruptcy proceedings are not necessary for the subsidiary and would only lead to further administrative expenses. FTX stated that dismissal is in the best interest of the company and its creditors. If approved, the dismissal would allow FTX Dubai to undergo liquidation in Dubai. Creditors could still pursue claims directly against the subsidiary in those separate proceedings.</p>

<p>FTX Trading and over 100 affiliated companies filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2022. The company cited a severe liquidity crisis following revelations of financial mismanagement. FTX founder <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/from-a-32-billion-valuation-to-financial-troubles-an-in-depth-look-at-the-rise-and-fall-of-ftx/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> was arrested in December and charged with defrauding investors out of billions of dollars. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges against him.</p>
<p>Tuesday&#8217;s motion indicates winding down FTX&#8217;s global network of entities will be a complex process spread across jurisdictions. The court will decide whether to grant dismissal of the Dubai subsidiary in a hearing later this month. Just recently, FTX and the firm’s CEO and chief restructuring officer, John J. Ray III, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-unveils-reorganization-strategy-proposing-offshore-crypto-exchange-and-new-trust/">unveiled</a> the debtors&#8217; reorganization strategy which included a proposal of rebooting FTX as an “offshore crypto exchange.”</p>

<h2>Riyadh Holds Firm on Oil Output Limits</h2>
<p>Saudi Arabia said Thursday it will keep oil production nearly one million barrels per day below its quota for another month, according to a <a href="https://www.spa.gov.sa/en/3e9cd3f912m">statement</a> from the Saudi Ministry of Energy reported by the state-run Saudi Press Agency.</p>
<p>The voluntary supply restraint, which began in July alongside Russia’s 300,000 barrel per day cut, aims to prop up oil prices amid concerns over slowing economic growth. But prior decisions like this one have <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/dem/release/chairman-menendez-statement-on-future-of-united-states-saudi-relationship">frustrated</a> U.S. officials who have urged producers to raise output to lower fuel costs.</p>

<p>Further OPEC+ curbs will likely frustrate Biden officials focused on taming inflation. Speaking with CNN Business, the vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, Robert Yawger, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/energy/oil-production-cut-saudi-arabia/index.html#:~:text=OPEC%20leader%20Saudi%20Arabia%20is,other%20energy%20prices%20even%20higher.">told </a>CNN’s news desk that Russia and Saudi Arabia are dependent on high oil prices.</p>
<p>&#8220;It flies in the face of the U.S. effort to tame inflation,&#8221; Yawger remarked to CNN.</p>
<p>U.S. gas prices are at an average of <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price#:~:text=US%20Retail%20Gas%20Price%20is,12.86%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago.">$3.869 per gallon</a> of gasoline and last week the average was around $3.711 per gallon. Last summer in June 2022, the price at the pumps in the U.S. tapped an all-time high average of <a href="https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/economy/history-gas-prices-remember-little-paid/#">$5.02 per gallon</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;$4 is the line in the sand,&#8221; Yawger told the news publication. &#8220;Once you get to $4 you get demand destruction. It kills the golden goose,” the Mizuho Securities executive added. Some analysts are <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/lifestyle/us-news/personal-finance/2023/07/28/64c393f246163f66548b456e.html#">attributing</a> the high gas prices in the U.S. to &#8220;the extreme heat and the heatwaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>In June 2023, Saudi Energy minister prince Abdulaziz bin Salman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-meets-debate-production-quotas-new-cut-sources-2023-06-04/">defended</a> the voluntary cuts in oil production.</p>
<p>Speaking with CNBC&#8217;s Dan Murphy, Abdulaziz <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/04/saudi-energy-minister-defends-voluntary-oil-cuts-as-precautionary.html">said</a>, “It was just our sensibility, if you will call it, that the environment was not sufficiently allowing confidence to be there. So taking a precautionary measure tends to put you on the safe side. And it is part of the typical rhythm that we have installed in OPEC, which is being proactive, being preemptive. That tool is with us. It doesn’t mean we have certainty that things will go sour or left or right.”</p>

The decline comes as the global market cap fell by as much as 2% over the course of the day. Dogecoin also declined, falling for a third consecutive session.</strong></p>
<h2><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a></h2>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>, formerly ripple, remained in the red during today&#x2019;s session, as the price fell to a multi-week low.</p>
<p>Following a high of $0.6971 the day prior, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $0.6589 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This is the weakest point that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> has hit since July 13, when the token was trading below $0.4700.</p>

<p>That day also saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> hit its highest point since December 2021, after it was ruled by a U.S. judge not necessarily to be a security.</p>
<p>Since then, sentiment has been largely bearish, with the latest sell-off coming as the relative strength index (RSI) broke out of a floor at 49.00.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is tracking at 48.60, with the next visible point of support at 45.00.</p>

<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) extended its own stay in bearish territory on Thursday, as the meme coin fell by as much as 5% today.</p>
<p>The decline saw DOGE/USD drop to an intraday low at $0.07305, less than 24 hours after peaking at $0.07703.</p>
<p>As a result of this sell-off, dogecoin has fallen to its lowest level since July 24, which is the last time price was trading at a support of $0.07000.</p>

<p>Similar to <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> above, Thursday&#x2019;s decline comes as a result of price strength falling below a floor at 51.00.</p>
<p>The RSI is currently at a reading of 50.23, with DOGE trading at $0.07339, which is marginally above today&#x2019;s bottom.</p>

These dollar-tied tokens have rapidly gained momentum, witnessing substantial growth in market capitalization soon after their debut.</strong></p>
<h2>A Look at Aave&#x2019;s GHO and First Digital&#x2019;s FDUSD Growth</h2>
<p>In mid-July, the decentralized finance (defi) lending protocol Aave <a href="https://app.aave.com/governance/proposal/?proposalId=268">approved</a> a governance proposal and unveiled the platform&#x2019;s gho (GHO) stablecoin. On July 17, 2023, there were <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/aave-launches-gho-stablecoin-on-ethereum-network/">2,510,269 GHO tokens</a> in circulation, and now there are more than <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f">11.25 million GHO</a>. This implies that GHO&#x2019;s supply expanded by over 348% within the last 16 days. Currently, the most popular trading platforms for exchanging GHO are Uniswap v3 and Balancer v2. GHO has roughly 357 holders and has recorded a total of 3,479 transactions since its inception.</p>
<p>The 24-hour trading volume of GHO has hovered around $1.52 million, and Balancer&#x2019;s Vault accommodates 59.2255% of the entire GHO supply. The present supply and market capitalization of GHO position it as the 31st largest stablecoin in August 2023. GHO exceeded $1 when it jumped to $1.01 per unit or more than 3% higher just 18 days ago. On July 24, 2023, GHO reached its all-time low at $0.971 per unit.</p>
<p>While a 348% supply surge is impressive, FDUSD has exhibited an even more remarkable ascent since its <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-introduces-fdusd-listing-amid-stablecoin-market-decline-faces-initial-technical-setback/">introduction</a>. On July 26, 2023, etherscan stats revealed that FDUSD&#x2019;s supply was approximately 1,114,126 just a week ago. Today, over <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xc5f0f7b66764F6ec8C8Dff7BA683102295E16409">232 million FDUSD</a> are in circulation, indicating a staggering 20,000% increase in supply within a week. FDUSD&#x2019;s statistics also show that there are only 14 holders and a mere 98 transfers have been recorded since its launch.</p>

<p>An estimated 96.0563% of <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xc5f0f7b66764F6ec8C8Dff7BA683102295E16409#balances">FDUSD&#x2019;s supply</a> is held in a wallet named &#x201C;Binance 14,&#x201D; while 1.4325% resides in another wallet called &#x201C;Binance 15.&#x201D; Binance seemingly controls the third largest wallet containing 1.3670% of the FDUSD supply. The fourth largest wallet holds slightly more than 2 million FDUSD, accounting for 0.8604% of the circulating supply. Coinmarketcap.com (CMC) <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/first-digital-usd/">data</a> reveals that FDUSD&#x2019;s leading market is tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>), with $65,964,418 traded globally on Binance in the past 24 hours as of August 2, 2023.</p>

<p>Approximately $2,773,961 worth of transactions have been registered against the stablecoin BUSD, and FDUSD&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BNB" 312009  target="_blank">BNB</a> volume has been a meager $2,773,961. Even lower is the volume on Pancakeswap which has seen an even smaller $46.65 in 24-hour trade volume on August 2. So far, FDUSD has recorded an all-time high at $1.06 per unit on July 29, 2023, and an all-time low on July 31, when it hit $0.912 per coin, CMC statistics show.</p>

The drop appeared to come as traders secured profits, following a failed breakout of a key price point. Ethereum also edged lower today. </strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) dropped below the $29,000 zone in today&#x2019;s session, as bulls appeared to have abandoned their positions following Wednesday&#x2019;s gains.</p>
<p>After peaking at $29,988.00 yesterday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD slipped to an intraday low of $28,946.51 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This comes as the bullish sentiment surrounding Microstrategy&#x2019;s latest <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> investment seems to have already faded.</p>

<p>In addition to this, the relative strength index (RSI) failed to move past a key ceiling at 50.00, and has bounded off a floor at 42.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 42.79, with <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> climbing back above the $29,000 mark as a result.</p>
<p>Price may now consolidate, as traders&#x2019; attention turns to Friday&#x2019;s nonfarm payrolls report.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Additionally, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also moved lower earlier in the day, dropping below a support point of $1,850 in the process.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD bottomed out at $1,822.35 during today&#x2019;s session, following Wednesday&#x2019;s high at $1,860.19.</p>
<p>As a result of today&#x2019;s decline, ethereum moved back towards a four-week low at $1,812.</p>

<p>The slippage took place after the RSI fell below a floor at the 45.00 level, and it is now at a reading of 41.93.</p>
<p>Should momentum continue to drop, the next price target will likely be the $1,795 level.</p>
