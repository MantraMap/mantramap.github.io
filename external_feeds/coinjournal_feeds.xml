<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">OKCoin&rsquo;s CEO believes that the rising need for sound currency systems could result in the next bull run.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">More countries will follow El Salvador&rsquo;s footsteps and adopt digital currencies, the CEO added.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The next Bitcoin halving in 2024 could also trigger a surge in crypto prices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Three catalysts could ignite the next bull run</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Okcoin CEO Hong Fang, revealed in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRJDlDOUopY" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>recent interview</u></a>, that he believes three catalysts could trigger the next Bitcoin bull run. He mentioned this while talking to Kitco News earlier this week.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to Fang, the rising need for sound currency systems, caused by the failures of current centralised monetary systems, could serve as a catalyst for the next crypto bull market.</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that he envisions a scenario where more countries will follow El Salvador&rsquo;s footsteps and make Bitcoin a legal tender. Fang said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;I think from a macro perspective, we continue to see challenges out there&hellip; I think the World Bank recently came out saying that a dozen countries may default on their own country&rsquo;s debt next year, which is a failure of a centralized monetary system. I would suspect that the fundamental need for a more sound money will continue to build in the background, something like El Salvador, but maybe of a larger size.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bitcoin halving could trigger the next bull cycle</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">According to Fang, the next&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/halvening-explained-infographic/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Bitcoin halving</u></a> event in 2024 could also trigger a bull cycle. He stated that;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Bitcoin has its own [halving] cycle. I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s coincidental that the past crypto cycles have somewhat coincided with the Bitcoin [halving] cycle, but that may also be another catalyst&hellip;I think the third potential catalyst is real projects. Every time we have a bull market with Bitcoin, with DeFi [decentralized finance] and NFTs [non-fungible tokens], that was because a lot of builders, they built projects in the last bear market. So I think that all of the projects that are being built right now, when there is a little more substance that can be felt by the customers that they tend to serve, [it] will trigger another bull market.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>The leading cryptocurrency has been underperforming in recent months, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> now close to the $17k mark.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Poor record keeping is making the unwinding of the collapse FTX exchange difficult.</li>
<li>The new FTX management is trying to trace millions of dollars from several bank accounts.</li>
<li>So far, the new management has identified over $1 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>FTX&rsquo;s new management, which took over from the founder Sam Bankman-Fried, on Tuesday told a procedural hearing that it has identified assets worth more than $1 billion since it <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-begins-strategic-review-of-all-company-assets/">started a strategic review of its assets</a>. It also said that it had located about $720 million held by US financial institutions, which it is yet to consolidate.</p>
<p>The US financial institutions were authorized to hold funds by the US Department of Justice and about $500 million are already confirmed held in US institutions.</p>
<p>The new FTX chief financial officer (CFO), Mary Cilia speaking under oath during the bankruptcy hearings said:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are reaching out to all of those banks and changing the signatories on the accounts so that we can get access to the accounts and move the cash as much as we can to authorized depository institutions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2>$423 million held at a single broker</h2>
<p>The CFO also mentioned that about $423 million held by US authorities are from a single broker though she never mentioned the broker by name. Cilia said, &ldquo;$485 million are already in an authorized deposit institution&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the funds held in the US, there is about $130 million in cash that is locked up in Japan where local authorities have ring-fenced the funds for local customers.</p>
<p>Steve Coverick, a senior director at FTX&rsquo;s financial advisors Alvarez &amp; Marsal told the hearing that the new management is working to identify FTX&rsquo;s international crypto assets and transfer them to cold wallets using custodial providers like <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ftx-to-hire-bitgo-to-safeguard-its-assets-during-bankruptcy/">Bitgo, which FTX hired in November</a>.</p>
<h2>Difficulties in winding up FTX</h2>
<p>While the Chapter 11 bankruptcy hearings are supposed to wind up the FTX exchange, there have been complications due to poor record keeping and weak governance under the former CEO, SBF. The new management is being forced to look for details by reviewing customer terms and conditions stored in a variety of places including Slack and Google Drive.</p>
<p>As a result, the exchange is yet to file a statement of its financial position or of its assets as required under the US bankruptcy law. It however estimates it could do so in April next year.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;The broader cryptocurrency market has retreated after a positive start to the week. The total crypto market cap is down by less than 1% and currently stands below $810 billion.</p>

<p dir="ltr">This <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>latest cryptocurrency news</u></a> has seen ACH outperform the broader cryptocurrency market. ACH has added more than 3% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at around $0.00784 per coin.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The broader cryptocurrency market is underperforming after a positive start to the week. The total crypto market cap is down by less than 1% and currently stands below $810 billion.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin, the world&rsquo;s leading cryptocurrency by market cap, is still trading in the positive zone. It is up by less than 1%, and the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>price of Bitcoin</u></a> currently stands above $16,800.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Key levels to watch</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The ACH/USD 4-hour chart is still bearish despite Alchemy Pay outperforming the broader market today. However, the technical indicators show that ACH&rsquo;s sentiment is improving.</p>

</div>
<p dir="ltr">The MACD line remains below the neutral zone, indicating that the bears are yet to relinquish control of the ACH market. The 14-day relative strength index of 49 shows that ACH is no longer in the oversold region, and its sentiment has been improving.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If the positive momentum is maintained, ACH could rally past the $0.0080 resistance level before the end of the day.</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, it would need the support of the broader crypto market before it can attempt to reach the $0.0102 psychological level in the near term.</p>

<li>The Lima upgrade is the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade on the Tezos protocol.</li>
<li>Tezos is referred to as the &ldquo;self-amending blockchain&rdquo; for its ability to seamlessly upgrade using its on-chain governance.</li>
<li>Lima upgrade reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts among other benefits.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://coinjournal.net/tezos/what-is-tezos/">Tezos</a>, one of the original <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos/">Proof-of-Stake (PoS)</a> blockchains, has activated its 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade, the Lima upgrade, which was voted upon and approved by the Tezos community. The new upgrade which introduces several new features also reduces the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>Lima marks the fourth protocol upgrade in 2022 and the 12<sup>th</sup> upgrade since the Tezos protocol was unveiled. Tezos is known for its ability to seamlessly upgrade through its on-chain governances which allows the protocol participants to propose and vote on upgrades and changes that they believe are important for the protocol.</p>
<h2>Key improvements introduced by Lima upgrade</h2>
<p>The Lima upgrade introduces several key improvements to Tezos functionality including faster processing speeds, the introduction of consensus keys, and improvements to tickets.</p>
<p>The Lima upgrade continues with the &lsquo;Pipelining validation project&rsquo; that speeds up the processing of blocks and operations on Tezos by separating validation processes from application processes. A new block on Tezos is first validated before being forwarded to other peers; a feature that speeds up block propagation on the network and reduces the block time to 15 seconds and increases the overall throughput for the blockchain.</p>
<p>The consensus keys will allow validators (known as bakers in Tezos) to designate a special key for signing blocks and consensus operations. This feature prevents backers from losing delegators due to a change in setup or the need to coordinate with delegators <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/off-chain/">off-chain</a> to move them to a new address.</p>
<p>Tickets are a type of data unique to Tezos smart contracts and a great foundation for the scalable solutions that have allowed for many use cases including tokenization, authentication, and voting among others. Lima upgrade in particular deprecates the creation, storage and transfer of zero-amount tickets thus reducing the risk of bugs in smart contracts.</p>
<p>In addition to the improvements to the current Layer 1 Tezos solutions, the Lima upgrade also finalizes the development work towards Smart Rollups, which is an innovative Layer 2 scaling solution that is expected to debut in the subsequent Tezos upgrade proposal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin price has moved sideways in the past few weeks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The Federal Reserve sounded more hawkish than expects.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It has formed a rising wedge pattern.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price continued recoiling on Monday as investors remained concerned about monetary policy and the crypto industry. The BTC coin was trading at $16,750, where it has been in the past few days. This price is a few points below last week&rsquo;s high of $16,867.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price prediction: no Santa rally?</h2>
<p dir="ltr">The BTC/USD price has continued consolidating in the past few weeks. After staging a comeback last week, the pair suffered a pullback as investors reflected on the latest Federal Reserve interest rate decision.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In its decision last week, the Fed decided to hike interest rates by 0.50% in its final decision of the year. It had previously increased rates by 75 basis points in the previous four monetary policy meeting. Also, the bank decided to continue with it quantitative tightening policy, as we wrote <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bitcoin-retreats-below-18k-as-fed-raises-interest-rate-to-a-15-year-high/"><u>here</u></a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important change was that the Fed would continue hiking rates in the coming months. That statement helped the market to change its view about monetary policy. Before the meeting, analysts were expecting that the central bank to sound a bit dovish since inflation has started cooling.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After the decision, American and global stocks collapsed while bond yields rose to their highest level in a few week. The US dollar index, which was recently falling, has made a strong recovery in the past few days.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other main reason why Bitcoin price has been recoiling is the rising outflows from most exchanges. Binance, the biggest exchange in the world, has seen its outflows rise to more than $7.5 billion in the past 7 days. In the same period, Bitfinex has seen over $335 million in outflows while Crypto.com lost over $76 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, all these actions mean that the Santa rally has not happened.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitcoin price forecast</h2>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/19/1671450377573-ab2cf34d-9533-46a2-8688-dbeced009a33.png" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="286" height="318"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=COINBASE"><u>BTC/USD chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">So, is it safe to <a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/buy/"><u>buy Bitcoin</u></a>? The BTC price has been in a tight range in the past few days. In this period, it has remained below the important resistance level at $16,867. It is also consolidating at the 25-day and 50-day moving averages.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the same time, the Reltive Strength Index (RSI) has formed a bullish divergence pattern, which is a bullish sign. It has also formed a rising wedge, which is usually a bearish sign. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the coin will have a bearish breakout. If this happens, it could drop to $15,000.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin has lost the battle at the resistance of $4.2</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has been hit by the general weak crypto sentiment</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">APE could drop to $3 if the bear pressure mounts</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">ApeCoin (APE/USD) traded at $3.5 as the cryptocurrency came under bear pressure from the $4.2 resistance. Buyers have been defending the $4.2 resistance for some time, giving hopes of a potential breakout and the start of a bull market. Apes seem to have now been defeated as the cryptocurrency looks at a possible decline to $3.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recent strengths in ApeCoin coincided with the launch of the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/staking/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>staking</u></a> feature earlier this month. Despite witnessing a lot of success, the users of the staking service have been warned of numerous phishing attacks. Horizen Lab, the developer of the staking feature, has told users to only use the official link,<em>&nbsp;ApeStake.io,</em> for the service.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, from the price outlook, APE seems to be getting hit by the overall crypto sentiment. The decline comes despite Ape-coin-linked NFTs continuing to record leading sales volumes. A technical outlook shows APE still trapped in a descending channel.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>APE slides from $4.2 resistance as weakness develop</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671570146723-d0f47cbd-cfbd-48b5-afc2-3246bee8baf4.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="286"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/APEUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>APE/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">APE initiated a bearish MACD crossover on the daily chart. The indicator has shifted to the negative territory after the latest price decline.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency now trades below $4.2 resistance after bears took control. APE price has now crashed back to the descending channel. The price is gaining stability at $3.5, but the established support lies at $3.0.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Concluding thoughts&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">If bulls do not take control of APE at $3.5, the next decline could take the cryptocurrency to $3.0.&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/apecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>APE price</u></a> must overcome resistance at $4.2 and the descending channel to become bullish.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SOL trades at $12 with weak momentum</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency is weighed by weak market fundamentals</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">SOL could consolidate further before pushing higher or lower</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Solana (SOL/USD) trades with dwindling volumes at $12. For another time, the cryptocurrency faces bear pressure at the now-developed support zone. Bulls have successfully defended the level in the past, and it remains to be seen whether they will for another time. The latest&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrency news</u></a> has been unforgiving for SOL.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">A myriad of factors has been against Solana price this year. Aside from the macro factors and weak crypto sentiment, Solana has suffered at the hands of hackers. Less than a week ago, Solana-based DEX Raydium lost $2.2 million. The exploit on December 16 has been responsible for much of the weakness of SOL currently. The hacks have been many this year, hitting the native token.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But there is some good news you could want to hear about Solana. According to crypto analytics firm Nansen, Solana competed successfully with Ethereum before the FTX saga. Nansen says in the three months to October, the daily transactions on Solana rarely fell below 200 million. The analytics firm pointed out that the active addresses on the network were between 600,000 to 1.1 million during the period.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The activity underlined that Solana was catching up with its proclaimed Ethereum killer status. The collapse of FTX brought a new twist, taking the price significantly lower. SOL investors are still reeling from the aftermath.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>SOL trades with weak momentum at the $12 support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671569661495-334bebee-76de-4f53-8906-b29ba602d976.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="287"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">From the daily chart, the MACD indicator shows a weak and bearish momentum for SOL. Trading volumes on both the buy and sell sides are weak for the cryptocurrency. SOL is currently held at the $12 support.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for SOL?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/solana/#:~:text=One%20Solana%20is%20currently%20worth,02%3A00%20GMT%2D8." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>SOL price</u></a> could continue consolidating at the $12 support until it gathers more liquidity. Based on the fundamental developments, a break higher or lower could occur. Should bears increase, SOL could fall to or below $10.</p>

<p dir="ltr">DOGE has lost by double digits in the past week.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency has been weighed by limited fundamentals around its use on Twitter.</p>

<p dir="ltr">DOGE faces further lows if it crashes below the 200-day MA.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/what-is-dogecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Dogecoin</u></a> (DOGE/USD) is again fighting off the onslaught of bears. With a weekly loss of 17%, the meme cryptocurrency is the biggest loser among its peers. Perhaps to underline DOGE&rsquo;s status as a meme coin, the cryptocurrency has been labelled a &ldquo;giant con&rdquo; by CNBC&rsquo;s Jim Cramer. It is easy to see why the decline has been immense for DOGE. Positive fundamentals have been hard to come by, and investors&rsquo; enthusiasm around DOGE&rsquo;s use on Twitter has subsided.</p>
<p dir="ltr">DOGE fans could be a little disappointed as Elon Musk sends mixed signals around Twitter. The billionaire investor asked his followers if to step down as Twitter CEO. An overwhelming majority of 58% voted &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; supporting the proposal.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As you already know, DOGE has been earning support from Musk&rsquo;s comments and views. His latest tweet does not augur well with DOGE since he relinquishes an important position in the social media giant. Will Musk be able to influence the use of DOGE in Twitter payment from a different role other than the CEO? That would be the question that DOGE fans would ponder. The negative sentiment around it could influence the price of Dogecoin. But investors will, at least, hope that DOGE does not crash below 200-day MA.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>DOGE faces pressure as the selling continues below $0.09 support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2022/11/20/1671568276674-18864e69-368a-4fce-b8d1-d56cc946927d.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="285"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOGE/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Investors have been selling DOGE aggressively since tapping $0.11. That is indicated by the RSI reading shifting from above the midpoint to a near-oversold reading.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the daily chart outlook, the price has lost crucial support at $0.09, welcoming a bear market. DOGE has also crashed below the 50-day MA. The cryptocurrency now trades at the 200-day MA, an important level that could spell doom for bulls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will DOGE trade lower or higher?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">The next direction for&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/dogecoin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>DOGE price</u></a> will depend on whether the 200-day MA will hold. If bulls resist bears, DOGE could roar back to $0.09. On the flip side, DOGE will head to $0.058 support.</p>
