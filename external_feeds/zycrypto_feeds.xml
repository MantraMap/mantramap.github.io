<p>While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers LUNA, the native token of the Terra ecosystem, a security, a court in South Korea has declared that it does not have attributes of a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-security-violation-charges-against-terra-co-founder-dismissed"><strong>Security Violation Charges Against Terra Co-Founder Dismissed</strong></h2>



<p>According to local reports, the southern district court in Seoul has dismissed charges of securities violations against the co-founder of collapsed crypto issuer Terraform Labs Daniel Shin.</p>



<p>The court indicated in the judgment that LUNA (now LUNC) was a non-security under the Korean Capital Markets Act. South Korean prosecutors charged Shin, who left Terraform Labs in March of 2020 to focus on payments app Chai, with allegedly extracting illegal profits as he dumped $105 million of the LUNA token at a market top without notifying investors. The authorities were also seeking an arrest warrant for Shin, arguing that LUNA constitutes a financial investment security.</p>



<p>However, the judge has reportedly said, “It is difficult to see Luna Coin as a financial investment product regulated by the Capital Markets Act.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the latest ruling, the court also rejected the prosecutor&#8217;s request to seize the accused’s assets and arrest based on securities law infringements. The Seoul Southern District Court explained that it was hard to see that the property subject to the allegation had been “acquired by crime or an asset derived from it.&#8221; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Fall Of Do Kwon</strong></h2>



<p>Some crypto pundits thought Do Hyeong Kwon — popularly known as Do Kwon — his algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and its sister token LUNA would take them to the promised land. But then the stablecoin veered away from its dollar peg. Everything unravelled. Over $50 billion evaporated. Life savings were erased.</p>



<p>An arrest warrant had been issued for Do Kwon, who co-founded Terraform Labs with Shin in 2018. Kwon, who had been on the run from authorities since the stunning implosion of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, was finally <a href="https://zycrypto.com/terras-luna-sees-selloff-following-founder-do-kwons-arrest-in-montenegro/">apprehended </a>by Montenegrin police last month for trying to travel with a fake passport. The SEC <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">charged </a>the South Korean native with violating securities law following his apprehension. Notably, Kwon’s lawyers are pushing to have these SEC charges dismissed.</p>



<p>Kwon recently<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-04-17/do-kwon-loses-bid-to-block-sec-from-seeking-singapore-records?leadSource=uverify%20wall"> suffered a legal blow</a> as a United States judge denied his plea to bar the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from obtaining certain records related to Terraform Lab’s operations in Singapore.</p>



<p>The former Terraform Labs CEO currently faces criminal fraud charges brought against him by U.S. prosecutors and charges relating to violating the Capital Markets Act back home in South Korea. Both the U.S. and South Korea have requested the extradition of the fallen crypto star, but he will likely first face trial in Montenegro.</p>

<p>Cardano whales did not take a single break during the weekend. According to key metrics, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-impressive-fundamentals-fuel-speculation-for-ada-reaching-1-price-milestone/">Cardano</a> is on fire as transactions carried out on the network continue to skyrocket.</p>



<p>Active <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">ADA whales</a> can be credited for this development, mainly because they make up the “big hands” in the market and have mostly contributed to the spike in large transactions. Taking to Twitter, an analyst in the crypto market spotlighted whale movements on the network. His tweet revealed how whale transactions have surged in recent times.</p>



<p>Per the data shared by the analyst, the number of large transactions on the network surged past 3,000 last week. Around this time, ADA transactions exceeding $100,000 on the Cardano network rose.</p>



<p>Although a slight dip was recorded later, an upward correction followed, and transactions skyrocketed to new levels in April. On April 1st, large transactions hit 4,000. Whales managed to push through the bumpy ride, and transactions neared 5,000 on the 11th of April and are now on their way to crossing those levels.</p>



<p><em>“Large ADA transactions are on the rise, suggesting that Cardano network activity is heating up as institutional players and whales make their moves.This is a bullish sign supporting the ADA uptrend!” The analyst wrote.</em></p>



<p>As the analyst asserted, the ongoing development might be linked to the rising interest rate in Cardano from institutional players in the market. Notably, Grayscale Investments, the world&#8217;s largest digital currency asset manager, rebalanced its funds in the first quarter of 2023. </p>



<p>In the most recent fund component weightings, Cardano is now at 28.31%. This marks an upsurge in component weightings for Cardano from the previous year.</p>



<p>With Grayscale holding significant space for Cardano in its Smart Contract Platform Ex-Ethereum Fund (GSCPxE Fund), exposure to institutional players could undoubtedly increase.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) has had a commendable run for the past month. The asset is among a few others securing monthly gains past 10%. Cardano (ADA) has managed to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum ( ETH), with monthly gains going up to 17%; the second highest, behind Solana (SOL). </p>



<p>Although Cardano ( ADA) was pushed to the red zone in the last hours, gains from the last 72 hours still sit at 3.44% at the time of this report. Cardano (ADA) now trades at a press time price of $0.38.</p>

<p>On April 23, 2011, the enigmatic creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, sent his final emails to fellow developers in which he made it clear he had “moved on to other projects,” at the time handing over a cryptographic key he had used to send network-wide alerts.</p>



<p>Fast forward to April 2023, and the Bitcoin story is, in many ways, still just starting. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-message-from-satoshi-nakamoto"><strong>The Message From Satoshi Nakamoto</strong></h2>



<p>12 years ago, the pseudonymous Bitcoin founder penned one of the final correspondences with a friend. The mysterious creator conveyed in his final email that they had “moved on to other things” and confidently proclaimed that the Bitcoin project was entrusted in “good hands” with software developer Gavin Andreesen and “everyone”. Notably, nobody has been able to track down the projects that Nakamoto moved to ever since.</p>



<p>After handing over control of the Bitcoin source code repository to Gavin, Satoshi Nakamoto completely disappeared from the public eye.</p>



<p>As projected, Bitcoin has evolved from an obscure, esoteric project to a trillion-dollar decentralized financial behemoth in the years since its creator’s departure.</p>



<p>Now heralded by governments, politicians, financial institutions, and corporations, the flagship cryptocurrency is in the midst of a mainstream moment. Yet, Satoshi’s identity remains a mystery, and their BTC stockpile of over 1 million remains unmoved. </p>



<p>Australian entrepreneur Craig Steve Wright is mired in a protracted legal fight that hinges on his being able to access crypto wallets allegedly belonging to Satoshi. Multiple pieces of evidence claiming to strengthen Wright&#8217;s claim, including PGP keys, have been disputed, and many in the community are unconvinced that he is the pseudonymous creator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pressure To Change Bitcoin Code</strong></h2>



<p>Though Bitcoin has yet to live up to all the tenets of Satoshi’s original 2008 white paper, its established monetary policy has made it an appealing store of value for investors.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, a section of industry pundits has made calls to change Bitcoin’s code. Chris Larsen, the billionaire founder of Ripple, for instance, backed a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-creator-chris-larsen-launches-crusade-aimed-at-changing-bitcoins-code/">controversial campaign</a> to persuade the Bitcoin community to alter the network’s existing code and remove its proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, which requires miners to solve complex puzzles to validate transactions and secure the network, in favour of the less energy-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">executed </a>this change, which resulted in a 99.9% reduction in total energy use.</p>



<p>Although Bitcoin’s environmental impact has been a subject of debate for years, Larsen’s proposal to follow Ether’s footsteps and change the system designed by Satoshi Nakamoto was strongly rejected by Bitcoiners.</p>

<li>The SEC and CFTC hounding down on the staking arm of digital asset companies will lead to decentralization in the wake of the Shanghai upgrade.</li>



<li>Analysts and users on most centralized trading platforms express mixed feelings concerning the new developments in staking.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Shanghai upgrade has been lauded in several quarters around the cryptocurrency space and is billed to spark new regulatory concerns as users begin to withdraw their staked assets.</p>



<p>After the much anticipated Merge which hit the Ethereum (ETH) network last year, the blockchain transitioned to a proof-of-stake (PoS) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/the-merge-goes-live-and-a-new-era-for-ethereum-begins-heres-the-whole-bushel/">consensus</a> mechanism replacing miners with validators. With a minimum staking threshold of 32 ETH, average ETH holders were not able to become validators until the emergence of centralized staking through exchanges.</p>



<p>Over 30% of staked ETH is facilitated by exchanges, with Kraken, Coinbase, and Binance leading the pack. Despite being the game-change in attracting over 18 million ETH in months, it raised centralization concerns coupled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) going after exchanges regarding their staking activities.</p>



<p>In February, Kraken reached an agreement with the SEC to halt its staking service in the US as part of its $30 million settlement with the Commission. Marco Santori, Kraken’s legal officer, stated that the settlement would be completed after locked assets became available. </p>



<p>Users outside the United States can keep their assets with Kraken and continue staking on Ethereum, as the settlement only applies within the US. The SEC has also expressed that its staked assets could be categorized as securities because they are locked up in anticipation of a profit-making.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-there-a-silver-lining-to-this-decentralization-approach"><strong>Is there a silver lining to this decentralization approach?</strong></h2>



<p>Most users would prefer validation on the blockchain to be completely decentralized without entities dictating the pace with their centralized staking pools. However, this is not attainable at least for now, because the minimum requirement to become a validator is 32 ETH, a sum too high for the average user.</p>



<p>Kraken is not the only platform to be affected by regulatory bodies, as Coinbase and Binance face their own with the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), respectively. Coinbase <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">received</a> a Wells Notice in March raising concerns over some products, including its staking program, Coinbase Earn.</p>



<p>Although a lawsuit has not been filed, the company says it is ready for anything while informing customers that there is a need for patience while expecting their assets after the Shanghai upgrade.</p>



<p>“<em>Customers may need to remain patient. We anticipate the Ethereum protocol will take weeks to months to process unstaking requests immediately following the upgrade,”</em> the company wrote.</p>



<p>In a nutshell, some commentators argue that the SEC is trying to make staking completely decentralized, where users deal directly with the protocols without staking pools.</p>

<p>After a steady decline since Wednesday, Bitcoin traded flatly throughout the weekend despite recovering slightly on Saturday. In the past week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has lost over 8% of its value. At press time, BTC was trading at $27,644, up 1.27% in the past 24 hours, as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80078" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-9-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-bitcoin-falling"><strong>Why is Bitcoin Falling?</strong></h2>



<p>Apart from crypto-industry-focused uncertainties that have afflicted the wider digital asset market, Bitcoin’s gradual descent can be attributed to the selling activities of miners.</p>



<p>On Sunday, “Tarek”, an analyst for Cryptoquant, noted that Bitcoin’s drop has brought its price closer to the cost of mining, which is currently around $27,200. This has prompted miners to offload their coins, resulting in downward pressure on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value.</p>



<p><em>“We notice an increase in the miner outflow index and the selling index of miners, along with a decrease in miners&#8217; reserve. All of this indicates selling pressure from miners during the past few days,”</em> he wrote, sharing a Bitcoin Miners Position Index (MPI) chart, which has been increasing.</p>



<p>He, however, advised investors against panicking, noting that he expects the selling pressure to subside around $27,200-$26,600.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Local Top” is in for Bitcoin</strong></h2>



<p>JA Maartum, another Cryptoquant analyst, notes the recent uptick in the activity of movement of “ancient” Bitcoin or dormant addresses could signal a “local top” for Bitcoin.</p>



<p>In trading, a local top refers to a point in an asset&#8217;s price chart where the price peaks before starting to decline. This peak represents a level of resistance where the price has trouble breaking through and continuing to rise. After reaching the local top, the price typically retraces, creating a short-term bearish trend.</p>



<p>According to Maartum, while it’s rare for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/an-ancient-bitcoin-stash-worth-7-8-million-just-moved-after-a-decade-of-slumber/">dormant addresses</a> to be moving around, considering they are still significantly profitable in dollar terms at current market prices, they occasionally re-enter circulation to take profits.</p>



<p><em>“This is a rare occurrence, and it typically happens around market tops (when the market crashes) or bottoms (when old Bitcoin capitulates, such as during the FTX crash). And it happened yesterday as well. 6,000 BTC with an age between 7 and 10 years moved. This could be a sign of a local top,” </em>he wrote<em>.</em></p>



<p>That said, while Bitcoin has been experiencing a minor correction, various experts expect the cryptocurrency to bounce back soon, considering that most fundamentals remain strong. According to Caleb Franzen, a senior market analyst at Cubic Analytics, Bitcoin needs to reclaim $27,820 to establish a bullish move.</p>



<p>In a recent post, the pundit highlighted the cryptocurrency’s 12 and 24-month Williams %R oscillators, which he noted are no longer &#8220;oversold&#8221;. According to him, this has “<em>historically meant that the lows of the BTC bear market are in &amp; that a new bull market is starting.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Republican lawmakers blasted Gary Gensler over his ‘hostile’ approach to regulating digital assets in the country.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Rep Tom Emmer and others accused the SEC of driving cryptocurrency investments into the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Gary Gensler wants more resources and manpower to effectively regulate digital assets amid criticism.</li>
</ul>



<p>The once-loved crypto figure turned villain is now at the center of the head following a heated debate with the United States Congress on regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At a hearing in the House Financial Service Committee, lawmakers probed the regulatory approach of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) led by Gary Gensler. In the course of the hearing, Gensler noted that the digital asset industry is fast-paced, making it more difficult for the Commission to track.</p>



<p>Republican lawmakers were not having any of that defence as they lashed out at the Commission for not being decisive on rule-making and spurring confusion in the market which has hurt companies along with investors. Rep Tom Emmer took a direct swipe at Gensler with these words. </p>



<p><em>“You’ve been an incompetent cop on the beat.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Taking the criticism a step further, Emmer noted that the current approach of the SEC is pushing start-ups and other American firms to the “<em>hands of the Chinese Communist Party.” </em>He went on the accuse Gensler of creating no rules in place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“<em>During your tenure at the SEC, how many rules has the SEC finalized that actually accommodate the existing regulatory framework and are specifically for the digital asset industry so that the crypto market can come into compliance?……… the answer is zero,” </em>he added.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler has been under fire from digital asset executives and their communities for many controversial regulatory decisions including looking to classify assets as securities.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gensler-remains-undeterred">Gensler remains undeterred&nbsp;</h2>



<p>A group of Republican lawmakers criticized Gensler before the hearing through a letter highlighting that digital asset firms&#8217; lack of compliance is the SEC&#8217;s fault. The letter noted that the lack of clear rules had created non-existent registration processes, and the only entity to blame was the SEC.</p>



<p>Responding to the harsh criticisms received from lawmakers, the SEC chairman restated his commitment to improving the current regulatory framework around digital assets. Gensler stated the need for more resources and manpower to keep up with the fast-changing industry effectively.</p>



<p>“<em>In terms of digital assets, we could certainly use more resources,” </em>said Gensler.<em> “Definitely there are more things to look at and investigate than we have people on the staff to do.”</em></p>

<p>For the past few years, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been on a rollercoaster ride, and so have the emotions of its holders. After dropping by more than 50% from its all-time high of nearly $69k in November 2021, Bitcoin bounced back to $45k briefly but then went through another downward spiral to hit a three-month low of $18.9k on June 18, 2022. Since then, the price has been struggling to break out of the $20k-$30k range, and the sentiment in the market has been mixed.</p>



<p>However, one group of Bitcoin holders seems more optimistic than others, as they have resumed accumulating the crypto asset en masse despite the recent market turbulence. These whale addresses hold 100-1k BTC, often regarded as influential players in the Bitcoin ecosystem due to their large holdings and potential impact on the price.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-whale-agiotage-could-hint-at-bitcoin-s-positive-prospect"><strong>Whale Agiotage Could Hint at Bitcoin’s Positive Prospect</strong></h2>



<p>According to the latest data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment, whale addresses with 100-1k BTC have added 20,007 BTC to their holdings in the past two days after a month-long selling period. This suggests that these whales are confident about Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects and see the current dip as a buying opportunity.</p>



<p>Not all whale addresses are created equal, and some may have different transaction strategies or motives. For instance, there are also whale addresses with more than 1k BTC, which have been selling more than buying lately, possibly to take profits or rebalance their portfolios. Moreover, some of the whales may be <a href="https://zycrypto.com/1-2-billion-worth-of-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-in-a-week-proving-institutional-investments-are-heavily-pouring-in/">institutional investors</a> or high-net-worth individuals with access to over-the-counter markets or derivatives not reflected in the on-chain data.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, the trend of whale accumulation in the lower range of BTC holdings could indicate that some retail investors or small-scale traders are also following their lead and buying the dip. This could provide some support to the price and prevent it from falling further, as it did in the previous bear market of 2018-2019 when whale selling exacerbated the sell-off.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bitcoin Price: What’s Been Going On?</strong></h2>



<p>Speaking of the price, Bitcoin has been oscillating between the $30.5k resistance and the $28.7k support level for the past few days, with neither side gaining a decisive advantage yet.</p>



<p>The short-term&#8217;s lack of a clear direction could reflect the uncertainty and indecision among traders and investors, who are waiting for more clarity on the regulatory and macroeconomic fronts. The recent crackdown on crypto mining and trading in China and the potential tapering of the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s rates could significantly impact Bitcoin&#8217;s price and perception as a safe-haven asset or a speculative bubble.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="647" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-1024x647.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80047" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-1024x647.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-300x190.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-768x485.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-1536x971.png 1536w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/image-6-2048x1294.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTCUSD Chart by <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The whale accumulation of Bitcoin and the price consolidation around the $20k-$30k range are contrasting but related signals reflecting the ongoing tug-of-war in the cryptocurrency market. Whether the whales are right in their <a href="https://zycrypto.com/global-crypto-market-cap-surges-above-1-trillion-as-bitcoin-makes-bullish-comeback/">bullish outlook</a> and whether the price can break out of its current range remains to be seen. What is certain is that the crypto world is never short of drama and surprises.</p>

<p>The week has been chaotic for the entire cryptocurrency market. With regulatory-centred discourse making rounds again, sentiments are likely to change occasionally. However, the altcoin season seems to be right around the corner, despite the continuous unrest in the market.</p>



<p>Confirming the new development was Author Hayes, the former CEO of cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BitMEX. Taking to Twitter, the former exec posted a screenshot showing the bullish performance of the Ethereum (ETH) altcoin against the USD. With Ethereum’s rise above $2,000, Hayes is certain that altcoin season has, in fact, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/arthur-hayes-sees-a-glorious-altseason-coming-soon-as-ether-price-jumps-above-2-1k/">arrived</a>.</p>



<p>Altcoin season, as the name suggests, is a time when alternative cryptocurrencies in the market enter the bullish zone. During altcoin season, Bitcoin often underperforms as alternative coins lead the market with gains. Investors and traders look forward to the altcoin season, which appears to be extremely promising. </p>



<p>As with previous times, a few altcoins lead the pack during the altcoin season. This time, three altcoins have set the stage for what will come. Leading with gains this month, Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano ADA are dominating.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-eth"><strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong></h2>



<p>Ethereum (ETH) is the second most valued cryptocurrency by market cap. The altcoin, which has maintained its position as the second most valued crypto asset by market cap, is making rounds for its outstanding performance this week. Ethereum (ETH) bulls worked overtime, sending the asset price to $2,000 on the 13th of April. Ethereum last hit these levels in August of 2022. ETH hit a high of $2,121 before plunging to a press time price of $1,883.</p>



<p>Ethereum’s price upsurge has been credited to the recent Shapella upgrade. As stakers now have access to their staked ETH, the network has recorded an upsurge in staking activity. Ethereum’s price seems to be surging in tandem, creating room for a potential upward reversal.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dogecoin (Doge)</strong></h2>



<p>Up by more than 6% in the last 7 days, Dogecoin (DOGE), currently the most valuable meme coin, is another promising altcoin poised to outperform in the coming weeks. Trading at $0.08 at press time, with over 6% in losses within the last 24 hours, sentiments are mixed for Doge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cardano (ADA)</strong></h2>



<p>Prior to the current bloodbath, which has caused ADA to shed over 6% of its gains within the last 24 hours, ADA bulls dominated the market, sending weekly gains up to 11%. </p>



<p>Clearing hourly losses, ADA is up 0.33% in the last hour. ADA is one of the few assets poised to rake in gains, as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-primed-for-massive-boom-as-ada-whales-network-activity-heats-up/">fundamental factors</a> sit in its favour.</p>

<p>An ancient Bitcoin address that laid practically dominant for over a decade came back to life on Friday — transferring 279 Bitcoins worth $7.8 million to new wallets.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-another-dormant-bitcoin-whale-awakens"><strong>Another Dormant Bitcoin Whale Awakens</strong></h2>



<p>A Bitcoin whale that had not transacted in over 10 years suddenly came online today.</p>



<p>In October 2012 and May 2013, the wallet received some 1,128 Bitcoin ($31.6 million), <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1649387289745977344">according </a>to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain. Back then, Bitcoin was worth $12 and $195, respectively. No coins went in or out of that wallet until today when the owner transferred $279 BTC worth approximately $7.8 million to three different addresses.</p>



<p>A decade ago when the wallet received its 1,128 bitcoin, investors may have had limited expectations about the price of the OG cryptocurrency and traded it as if it was chump change. At current prices, people who held onto the crypto basically became Bitcoin whales.</p>



<p>This latest transfer came just a day after another ancient wallet <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1648912229264416768">moved </a>2,071.5 BTC — worth $60.7 million — after lying dormant for over nine years. This particular whale acquired 6,071.5 BTC on Dec. 19, 2013, when Bitcoin’s price was around $663.</p>



<p>While sizable Bitcoin trades occur on a daily basis, it&#8217;s not often that coins that old see the light of day again. Some suggest that when old coins are being spent more often, it may indicate a shift in confidence to hold the crypto asset — often spurred by periods of market volatility.</p>



<p>Bitcoin continued its slump Friday for the third consecutive day, dropping 2.33% over the last 24 hours to just above $28,000 as traders seem to move away from risky assets. The top crypto has lost around 8.06% since last Friday. Bitcoin’s slide dragged the rest of the crypto market with it, with the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies dropping by 2.4% to $1.23 trillion, per CoinGecko data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, one positive development for the crypto world on Thursday: the European Parliament <a href="https://zycrypto.com/industry-leaders-upbeat-as-eu-parliament-passes-much-anticipated-mica-regulation/">passed </a>the long-awaited MiCA crypto law, becoming the first major jurisdiction to do so.</p>

<p>In a landmark decision on Thursday, the European Union (EU) Parliament passed the EU Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, bringing the first-ever EU legislation for policing crypto assets one step closer to becoming law. The draft law was approved by a majority vote, with 529 votes in favour and 29 against.</p>



<p>The latest vote aimed to ensure that crypto transfers, like other financial operations, can always be traced and suspicious transactions blocked by introducing the so-called &#8220;travel rule.” The travel rule is a regulation by the Financial Action Task Force FATF that requires financial institutions to collect and share customer information during transactions to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. </p>



<p>As per the draft law, the travel rule will cover transactions above €1000 from self-hosted wallets when interacting with crypto-assets service providers. However, the rules will not apply to transactions conducted between individuals without the involvement of a service provider.</p>



<p>The draft law also supports market integrity and financial stability by supporting measures against market manipulation, money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>



<p>The legislators also approved the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to establish a public register for unauthorized crypto service providers in the EU to tackle money laundering. Also, crypto service providers, including miners, will have to disclose their energy use to reduce the carbon footprint of crypto-currencies when the draft is enforced.</p>



<p>Following the latest vote, industry leaders have been outpouring their support, even as the US continues to employ brute force tactics against the crypto industry.</p>



<p>“<em>While US regulators have been busy infighting and refusing to provide the most basic of clarity for the crypto industry, the European Union just approved the MiCA regulation, which provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto in Europe. It&#8217;s sad to see the US being left behind on such an important technology and its promise,”</em> Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of crypto exchange Gemini, tweeted on Friday.</p>



<p>Susan Friedman, head of Ripple&#8217;s public policy, also commented that the US risks falling back due to its obsession with ‘Enforcement instead of clarity’.</p>



<p><em>“The EU has taken a big leap forward with a sensible, progressive approach to crypto regulation. We look forward to building and growing in the European marketplace,”</em> she said.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Coinbase CEO Ben Armstrong hinted at his exchange <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-ceo-is-considering-relocating-company-outside-of-the-u-s-due-to-unfavorable-regulation/">moving offshore</a>, lauding the UK for “moving fast on sensible crypto regulation.” In an April 19 blog, Nana Murugesan, VP of International and Business Development noted that while they would like to see the US take an approach similar to that of the UK, “<em>a regulation by enforcement approach in the US is instead leading to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US.”</em></p>



<p>That said, the MiCA texts will now be forwarded to the council for formal endorsement before being published in the EU Official Journal, becoming effective after 20 days.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, recouping over half of the losses incurred during the 2021-2022 bear cycle.</p>



<p>Last week, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency rose as high as $30,900, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/another-bitcoin-indicator-hints-at-explosive-btc-price-growth/">tapping levels</a> seen in over 10 months and bringing a welcome relief for investors who had previously suffered significant losses. That strength was also reflected in other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, which has now reclaimed the $2,000 mark, partially fueled by the recently concluded Shanghai Harfork.</p>



<p>Notably, the global crypto market capitalization also recouped the $1 trillion market cap total of $1.18T at press time, as investors pumped money into various crypto assets hoping to make some profits. According to experts, this had been a further indication of an overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market despite concerns around regulatory uncertainty that have roiled the crypto market in the past few months.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-careful-warns-santiment"><strong>Careful, Warns Santiment</strong></h2>



<p>Nevertheless, even as investors continue to pile investments into cryptocurrencies for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/galaxy-digitals-novogratz-on-why-bitcoin-could-hit-30k-before-the-end-of-march-amid-rising-fomo/">fear of missing out</a> (FOMO), on-chain analytics firm Santiment has warned that this could portend danger.</p>



<p>On April 4, the firm issued a warning about the current state of the market, noting that its had noticed several divergences that have led to a temporary pause in the growth of ETH.</p>



<p><em>“These divergences suggest that the market&#8217;s appetite for risk has been relatively low, with some participants anticipating a drop, while others were waiting for the break of 32k in BTC and 2k in ETH,”</em> the firm warned.</p>



<p>The firm further highlighted a similar pattern in the wealthy holder’s behaviour map, where whales have been seen reducing their BTC positions. It, however noted that the situation had begun to change following the Shanghai fork and Ether’s move above $2,000.</p>

<p>Santiment then noted that the market may be heading towards a top as signs of FOMO, or fear of missing out, become more apparent. According to the firm, traders should be on the lookout for indicators such as a significant increase in retail accumulations, a decrease in stablecoin holdings, and a spike in general network activities- to discern a market top.</p>



<p>“<em>If these indicators are present, along with increased funding rates and a consensus among video (YouTube) &#8220;influencers&#8221; that this break represents a confirmed path towards new all-time highs (ATH), it may signal that we are approaching a market top,”</em> wrote the firm.</p>



<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $28,065 after a 2.81% decline in the past 24 hours. According to Gareth Soloway, president and chief market strategist at inthemoneystocks, the price needs to get above the $30,500 level “to really establish that a low is in on Bitcoin”.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Ether was trading at $1,920 after a 1.8% drop in the past day, as per CoinMarketCap.</p>

<ul>
<li>Crypto wireless network Helium has concluded its long-anticipated exodus to Solana, creating a mutually beneficial partnership. </li>



<li>As part of the move, 991,000 NFTs are being minted to represent each node running on the Helium network.</li>



<li>Each NFT will also serve as an authentication tool for all nodes, making them decentralized network credentials.</li>
</ul>



<p>Solana (SOL) is having a good year, with its price skyrocketing over 131% this year and is set to improve on its technical and network infrastructure.</p>



<p>Helium has successfully migrated to the Solana ecosystem from its own layer 1 blockchain in a move that will create new prosperous paths for both networks. The Helium community hailed the move as a catalyst to unlocking cheaper non-fungible tokens (NFT) mints while Solana could unlock additional use cases on the blockchain.</p>



<p>The move will see 991,000 new NFTs minted on Solana representing each physical hotspot node on Helium. Currently, over 150,000 NFTs have been minted, according to data from Flipside Crypto. Node operators will claim their NFTs when they login to their hotspot’s wallet.</p>



<p>This month, Solana <a href="https://solana.com/news/state-compression-compressed-nfts-solana">announced</a> a new State Compression feature which makes it easier to mint NFTs with little cost. According to the developers, the cost of minting a million NFTs stands at $113 worth of Solana, which is far less compared to Solana’s default NFT mining price.</p>



<p>Without the compressor, it cost about $253,000 worth of SOL to mint NFTs, $33.2 million worth of ETH on Ethereum, and $32,000 worth of MATIC on Polygon. The Helium Foundation has justified minting nearly 1 million NFTs representing each node, asserting that the tokens will serve as an added network credential to authenticate hotspots.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-perfect-start-to-q2">A perfect start to Q2</h2>



<p>This move mutually benefits both networks with increasing use cases, cheaper fees, and improved community participation. The move was initially approved in Sept 2022 after the community voted in favour of the migration. Deploying the ‘network of network’, which incentivizes users to share their wireless connection for rewards is key to Solana&#8217;s development.</p>



<p>Helium launched a 5G network to be used on smartphones, laptops, and other devices, which are already being marketed with Solana’s newly <a href="https://zycrypto.com/solana-smartphone-set-for-early-may-sales-here-are-its-exciting-features/">released</a> Saga phone. Plans are also in motion by Nova Labs, the developers of Helium, to release Helium Mobile Wireless Service in the United States in partnership with T-Mobile’s nationwide coverage. </p>



<p>This move will be huge for Solana as it looks to recover losses after struggling with network downtimes from technical issues last year. </p>

<p>Former Marine-turned-class-action lawyer John E. Deaton threw shade at SEC chairman Gary Gensler on Thursday, condemning his performance as a regulator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gensler has previously been accused of forcing the digital assets industry into a regulatory framework that’s neither applicable nor compatible. Rather than providing the necessary clarity, the official has opted to send Wells Notices to several crypto-focused firms this year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-i-look-forward-to-the-day-he-is-investigated"><strong>“I Look Forward To The Day He Is Investigated”</strong></h2>



<p>Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has taken aim at Gary Gensler.</p>



<p>In a recent tweet, Deaton noted that the SEC chair should be investigated in the near future. His logic stems from the fact that Gensler has stepped up scrutiny of digital asset firms this year and declared all cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin fall under securities rules, all while deliberately failing to pursue “Chinese executives&#8217; crimes in US capital markets”, per a tweet that Deaton commented on.</p>



<p>The XRP amicus curiae posited that Gensler acts in the interest of a “select few”, suggesting he is an agent of Wall Street’s financial elite. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@garygensler</a> you believe focused SEC enforcement on crypto and concealing (not pursuing) Chinese executives&#39; crimes in US capital markets is the best way to maintain US dollar position? 1/3  <a href="https://t.co/3q3cL6hn1k">https://t.co/3q3cL6hn1k</a>…<a href="https://twitter.com/mirandadevine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@mirandadevine</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/LeeSmithDC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@LeeSmithDC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Jkylebass?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Jkylebass</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/RepTimmons?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RepTimmons</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JohnEDeaton1</a></p>&mdash; Brian Costello (@bpcostello) <a href="https://twitter.com/bpcostello/status/1648764092801499136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>The original tweet authored by Brian Costello states that Gensler and his agency covered up “a multibillion-dollar Chinese criminal enterprise defrauding US investors”. During Costello’s interview with the FBI, one federal agent allegedly “believed there were significant offenses and inquired about SEC&#8217;s lack of response.”</p>



<p>According to Costello, these actions, coupled with the SEC’s furious attack on the fast-growing crypto ecosystem, are “accelerating the collapse of the dollar.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SEC’s Tough Stance On Crypto</strong></h2>



<p>Following the quick and unexpected bankruptcy of mega crypto asset exchange FTX late last year, the SEC — under Gary Gensler — has quickly targeted prominent U.S. crypto brands.</p>



<p>Back in January, it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7">slapped </a>Genesis and Gemini with charges for offering unregistered securities. A month later, it <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">fined </a>cryptocurrency exchange Kraken $30 million for breaking securities laws.</p>



<p>Then, last month, the Commission <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">issued </a>a Wells Notice to Coinbase, the largest exchange in the U.S., claiming that its staking products constituted unregistered securities.</p>



<p>And in its latest enforcement action earlier this week, it <a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2023/comp-pr2023-78.pdf">alleged </a>that Seattle-based exchange Bittrex simultaneously operated a national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency in violation of federal securities law. The agency further claimed that major cryptocurrencies Dash, Algorand, OMG Network (OMG), and others bear characteristics of securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These actions have some politicians — Republicans in particular — fuming, with some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-congressman-mulls-pushing-legislation-to-remove-secs-gary-gensler/">proposing </a>legislation to boot Gensler from office.</p>

<p>Recently, the team behind “SHIB: The Metaverse” shared a range of developments made over the last few weeks on the project, thrilling the Shib-Army and signalling a bright future for the ecosystem’s future.</p>



<p>In an April 10<sup>th</sup> blog post, the team announced the launch of a new official Twitter account, noting that all official updates and communications on the metaverse will subsequently be made there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also highlighted the details of several new tools being developed to make the user experience on the metaverse “truly fantastic”. These tools include the Plot Builder, which will enable the creation and customization of plots, while the Avatar Builder will enable users to create a unique digital identity with a wide set of personalization options. The team also noted that they were working on a Game Maker tool, which will be discussed in a future blog.</p>



<p>As per the blog, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-devs-set-out-to-deliver-an-exceptional-product-as-shib-metaverse-is-finally-unveiled/">Shib The Metaverse</a> has also been revised to ensure users enjoy a more photorealistic experience. To achieve this, the team noted that it was building new Hubs from a new starting point using Unreal Engine 5.1, which shortens the workflow process and results in an impressive level of quality.</p>



<p>The latest update also revealed that Rocket Pond would be the next Hub to be unveiled, which the team promised will take users to new heights, literally and figuratively.</p>



<p>Last month, Shib The Metaverse was showcased at the SXSW Experience, an annual conference for creators in Texas, USA, where the project’s team gathered consumer feedback. The team&#8217;s presence at the event was centred around community building, increasing awareness of the SHIB -The Metaverse concept and establishing a feedback loop on the project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the team, by the end of 2023, users will be able to dabble with some areas of the Metaverse.</p>



<p><em>“While all development takes time, the MV team is confident that by the end of 2023, users will have the opportunity to explore some of the areas in this fantastic world, build, design, play, and develop within it.” </em>The blog read, adding, <em>“However, it should be noted that not all areas of the Metaverse will be fully completed as it is an ongoing project. The world will continuously evolve and develop, but there will be several optimized Hubs and all necessary tools for users to start building and creating.”</em></p>



<p>That said, the latest update on Shib’s metaverse is full of exciting developments that promise to provide users with endless possibilities and a possible run up to $0.001 SHIB price. It will thus be interesting to see how the project develops in the coming months, alongside other ecosystem updates such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">Shibarium</a>.</p>
