<p>The transaction occurred approximately 11 hours ago, catching the attention of the crypto community.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>The whales not only withdrew $PEPE but also executed several trades involving other cryptocurrencies. The whale sold 97,735 $LINK tokens, valued at around $592,000, and 9,883 $BNB tokens, amounting to approximately $3.01 million. These sales resulted in a loss of approximately $342,000 for the whale.</p>

<p>Following the sale of $LINK and $BNB, the whale made a strategic move by swapping all their positions for 1.93 trillion $PEPE tokens and 227 $ETH tokens, valued at around $424,000. This swap represents a significant shift in the whale&#8217;s portfolio and suggests their interest in diversifying holdings and exploring alternative investments.</p>



<p>Such large-scale transactions by whales often attract attention due to their potential impact on the market. However, it is important to note that individual transactions can be influenced by various factors, including personal investment strategies, market conditions, and the whale&#8217;s risk tolerance.</p>

<p>The move to acquire a significant amount of $PEPE tokens suggests that the whale sees potential in this particular cryptocurrency. The decision to swap other positions for $PEPE and $ETH indicates a calculated investment strategy, although it comes with certain risks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Themis Protocol was hacked, and its lending function was disabled.</em></li>



<li><em>The attacker drained around $368,000 by exploiting a faulty oracle and using Stargate Finance for fund conversion.</em></li>



<li><em>Recovery efforts and a compensation scheme are underway.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Themis Protocol reported that it had been hacked and that its lending function had been disabled.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png" alt="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack" class="wp-image-198371" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2044-750x395.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>Themis Protocol is a lending platform that has had an agonizing deployment, with consumers having to wait even longer for the platform to become operational after enduring multiphased airdrops but no useable product. On June 16, the project officially went into beta on Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 platform.</p>



<p>On June 27, just eleven days later, the team announced that the project had expanded to over $1 million TVL in two working days. They <a href="https://twitter.com/ThemisProtocol/status/1673806486299099137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declared</a> an hour later that they would pause the procedure and launch an emergency investigation into a suspected flashloan attack. In its literature, Themis states that &#8220;security is the highest priority&#8221; of the project and references many PeckShield audits.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1024x542.png" alt="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack" class="wp-image-198372" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1024x542.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-300x159.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-768x406.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-750x397.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045-1140x603.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2045.png 1334w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Themis Protocol $370,000 Damage Due To Flashloan Attack 5"></a></figure></div>


<p>The protocol will initially attempt to work with the hacker to recover the monies. If the hacker refuses to comply, it will work with authorities to fix the situation. A compensation scheme is being prepared at the moment.</p>



<p>According to PeckShield monitoring, an attacker seems to have been able to compromise the project, draining around 220 Themis-wrapped ETH (approximately $417,000). Due to liquidity concerns, they were only able to exchange these for around 94 ETH ($178,000) and over $190,000 in stablecoins, for a total haul of approximately $368,000. According to PeckShield, the flashloan attack was caused by a faulty oracle, and the stolen monies were channeled via Stargate Finance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>US presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) reaffirmed that if elected President of the United States would guarantee the inviolability of using and owning Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>He said he would ensure &#8220;we have policies that support Bitcoin and free transactions.&#8221;</em></li>



<li><em>Another candidate is Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, who has also vowed to &#8220;defend&#8221; Bitcoin during his presidential campaign.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bright US presidential candidate <a href="https://coincu.com/197325-presidential-candidate-rfk-jr-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (RFK Jr.) </a>tweeted will ensure that your right to use and hold Bitcoin is not violated if elected president this year.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039-1024x576.png" alt="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected " class="wp-image-198360" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2039.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected 7"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Bitcoin is not only a bulwark against totalitarianism and manipulating the money supply but also points the way to a more transparent and democratic future of government institutions.&#8221;</p>



<p>An article by RFK Jr. was shared by Michael Saylor, co-founder and executive chairman of MicroStrategy &#8220;The next President will be a pro-Bitcoin President.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since running for this candidate, there have always been pro-Bitcoin statements. Before this news on June 23, Robert Kennedy Jr. said in an interview that he would ensure that policies support Bitcoin and freedom of transactions.</p>



<p>Up to now, the list of US Presidential candidates has seen four people with views in favor of Bitcoin and crypto in general.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="880" height="400" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040.png" alt="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected " class="wp-image-198361" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040.png 880w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-300x136.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-768x349.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2040-750x341.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px" title="RFK Jr. Guaranteed Right To Hold And Use Bitcoin If Elected 8"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The first is <a href="https://coincu.com/179391-florida-governor-says-fed-made-digital-u-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ron DeSantis</a>, the governor of Florida. He has vowed to &#8220;defend&#8221; Bitcoin during his presidential campaign. He also proposed allowing businesses to pay state fees in cryptocurrency. In addition, he is an anti-Central Bank CBDC and has enacted legislation banning the use of CBDCs by federal and foreign governments.</p>



<p>The second is Mr. RFK Jr., as mentioned above. Third is Vivek Ramaswamy, the founder of the pharmaceutical company, who has also announced his support for cryptocurrency and said he would accept campaign donations in Bitcoin. And recently, a fourth name has also appeared, Francis X. Suarez, mayor of Miami. He is best known as the &#8220;Bitcoin Mayor&#8221;.</p>



<p>This new industry requires leaders to pay closer attention as needs such as identifying the potential and driving the development of crypto become increasingly apparent. Candidates like Mr. DeSantis could spark innovation and boost the economy, cementing America&#8217;s lead in the market.</p>



<p>Candidates DeSantis and RFK Jr. have a favorable view of crypto regardless of political views. As the presidential race draws closer, crypto&#8217;s role will certainly increasingly influence candidates&#8217; backgrounds. At that time, American citizens must consider the truth before voting for any candidate to develop the crypto market to its potential.</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>European Union regulators have expressed concerns that Binance may be engaging in illicit activities such as money laundering and tax evasion. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="575" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1024x575.jpeg" alt="Binance Faces Accusations of False Reporting in Ireland and Malta" class="wp-image-198357" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1024x575.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-768x431.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-750x421.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta-1140x640.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Binance-Faces-Accusations-of-False-Reporting-in-Ireland-and-Malta.jpeg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Binance Faces Accusations of False Reporting In Ireland and Malta 9"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>These concerns have been raised due to its operations within Ireland and Malta being particularly difficult to track, despite claiming to employ dozens of employees. Revenue streams are unexplained or explained by “consultancy services” according to official records, and the companies don’t have an active and operational space other than their registered address — which are shared with other companies. In some cases, officials believe BNB is inflating registered employee headcounts by conflating the figure with contractual services to freelancers, whose job is mainly of a promotional nature.</p>



<p>Binance has been accused of commingling funds from revenue streams of different countries to avoid raising the eyebrows of regulators and tax authorities. European investigators have stated that BNB may be faking its accounts and operations in several EU jurisdictions. There are concerns that Binance is obfuscating illicit activity, which is why financial regulators in several EU jurisdictions received requests for information on BNB by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) even before the agency charged the crypto exchange earlier this month.</p>

<p>Despite BNB&#8217;s claims to be operating in various countries in Europe, including in France, Ireland, Malta, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, and Lithuania, several European countries are conducting their own investigations into BNB on suspicions of local wrongdoing. In 2018, Binance announced that it was to set up its European headquarters in Malta and set up two companies. Then it changed track and set up three other companies in Ireland, announcing its European headquarters would be there. Eventually, it settled on Paris, France for its EU HQ and received a license to act as a digital asset provider in the country.</p>



<p>Binance&#8217;s headquarters in Paris was recently raided by police in a European-wide investigation over aggravated money laundering. In addition, Belgium’s financial regulator ordered Binance to stop its services in the country. As a result, Binance is expected to face more legal challenges with other EU countries in the coming months.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[FTX has filed a lawsuit against a former regulatory and compliance officer at the exchange, Dan Friedberg.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>FTX sues former officer Friedberg over bribery allegations.</em></li>



<li><em>Friedberg, known for past poker scandals, was implicated in FTX deception.</em></li>



<li><em>FTX CEO investigates and seeks to recover funds; report points to his role.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>FTX has <a href="https://restructuring.ra.kroll.com/FTX/ExternalCall-DownloadPDF?id1=MTU0MDA0Mw==&amp;id2=0&amp;cid=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against a former regulatory and compliance officer at the exchange, Dan Friedberg, saying he conducted a series of bribes to keep employees from reporting difficulties at the exchange.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="980" height="551" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png" alt="Former FTX Compliance Officer Dan Friedberg Accused Of Bribes: Report" class="wp-image-198348" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036.png 980w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2036-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" title="Former FTX Compliance Officer Dan Friedberg Accused Of Bribes: Report 11"></a></figure></div>


<p>Lawyer Friedberg, whose image was tainted by the greatest online poker scam a decade ago, may also be involved in deceptions perpetrated by collapsed cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Friedberg worked at UltimateBet during the company&#8217;s super-user cheating scandal and subsequent downfall, and he was captured on film supporting Russ Hamilton in his efforts to rescue the situation. Until recently, he was the Compliance Officer for FTX US and the general counsel for Alameda Research, a link that only became widely known in the poker community when the firm filed for bankruptcy in November 2021.</p>



<p>FTX filed a lawsuit against Daniel Friedberg on June 27. According to the lawsuit, Friedberg worked as a fixer for the exchange&#8217;s co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, making hush money payments to two possible whistleblowers to prevent them from releasing information regarding regulatory difficulties, and FTX&#8217;s claimed strong relationships with Alameda Research.</p>

<p>As Bankman-Fried awaits trial on allegations of fraud and other offenses, the company&#8217;s new CEO, John J. Ray III, is heading an inquiry and seeking to retrieve as much investor money as possible. Ray&#8217;s most recent interim report, released on June 26, exposes the role of &#8220;a top FTX Group attorney&#8221; in alleged deceptions by the company&#8217;s leadership.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The FTX Senior Executives did not commingle and misuse customer deposits by accident. Commingling and misuse occurred at their direction, and by their design. Bankman- Fried, with the assistance of a senior FTX Group attorney (“Attorney-1”) and others, lied to banks and auditors, executed false documents, and moved the FTX Group from jurisdiction to jurisdiction… to enable and avoid detection of their wrongdoing,&#8221; the report wrote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senior-attorney-helped-ftx-founder-misuse-customer-funds-report-says-7180ae25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> that &#8220;Attorney-1&#8221; is Friedberg, citing people familiar with the situation. The report, for example, mentions Attorney-1 sending a $1 million incentive to a lawyer and former government official in the Bahamas. According to the <em>WSJ</em>&#8216;s source, Friedberg paid this payment.</p>



<p>FTX issued 11 civil allegations in the 40-page petition, alleging, among other things, that Friedberg disregarded his legal obligations and facilitated a series of fraudulent transfers and loans to other former FTX executives.</p>



<p>Friedberg allegedly received a $300,000 salary, a $1.4 million signing bonus, and 8% stock in FTX US during his 22-month tenure at the exchange, all of which FTX is attempting to recoup, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>According to the <em>Financial Times</em>, the creators of cryptocasino Stake <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2490279b-9c94-49a8-beff-cbd7c3307586" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked</a> with Friedberg about their concept. Stake, on the other hand, has denied any link to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really crazy that Apple will unilaterally block you from running the software you want on your own device. One of the most disrespectful parts of their culture, and it&#8217;s damaging to their brand.&#8221; CEO Brian Armstrong commented on Twitter.</p>



<p>Yesterday, William Casarin, founder of Damus, an open social app based on the Nostr protocol, tweeted that Damus will be removed from the App Store on Tuesday for violating Apple&#8217;s in-app purchase rules.</p>



<p>He said that while we&#8217;ve updated the app and clarified that users won&#8217;t unlock any digital content after paying, it will still be removed from the App Store.</p>



<p>The app said it would appeal because the rule had been abused and misapplied. Damus was launched on the App Store earlier this year but was ordered by Apple to be removed from the shelves on June 13 because of its &#8220;zaps&#8221; function (a unique function of Damus that allows users to send small amounts of bitcoin to content creators through the Lightning Network, similar to tweets).</p>

<p>Apple says it doesn&#8217;t allow zaps on its platform because they &#8220;may&#8221; be used by content creators to sell digital content. Apple then said it spoke with Damus and agreed on how Damus&#8217; hits will survive on the platform.</p>



<p>Damus is a decentralized social media platform running on the Nostr protocol, which is quite popular with bitcoins. One of the reasons for its popularity is that most Nostr implementations support payments over the blockchain&#8217;s Lightning Network. Lightning is Bitcoin&#8217;s second-layer payment network allowing faster transactions and lower transaction fees.</p>

<p>This morning, the Manta Network project announced an ongoing airdrop in cooperation with Binance Labs on its official Twitter account and asked users that the $MANTA token is launching today and is currently FREE to claim.</p>

<p>However, right below the comment section of the article, many warnings were being given that Manta&#8217;s account was compromised, there was no airdrop going on, and asked users not to click on any link.</p>



<p>Only in the first 2 months of 2023, the Crypto market has become extremely exciting when continuously receiving strong growth from tokens according to AI, LSD, and the upcoming ZK narrative. Manta Network is also one of the Layer 1 blockchains using ZK technology.</p>



<p>Manta is a Layer 1 blockchain built on top of Polkadot&#8217;s Substrate frameworks. Manta uses zkSNARK to provide complete end-to-end anonymity, high throughput, and cross-chain interoperability.</p>

<p>The project received a lot of attention after Binance Labs announced its strategic investment in Manta Network for Web3 Privacy on February 17.</p>



<p>Binance Labs will support Manta&#8217;s efforts as they continue to build innovative products, services, and technologies that enable security on a decentralized chain. Manta&#8217;s Dolphin pilot network features will be rolled out on the Calamari Network first in a service called MariPay. At launch, MariPay will be able to privatize various parachain assets on Kusama, including KSM and Calamari&#8217;s native asset, KMA.</p>



<p>Manta is currently working with various parachains to achieve interoperability to privatize the assets of their projects.</p>

<p>The entire Azuki brand NFT series witnessed a sharp decline, with the floor price dropping to 10 ETH, marking a staggering 24-hour decrease of 31%. This disappointing turn of events has raised concerns within the digital collectibles community.</p>



<p>One of Azuki&#8217;s co-founders acknowledged the failure of the minting experience, stating that it did not meet the expected standard. This admission highlights the challenges faced by the team in delivering a satisfactory user experience and meeting the high expectations of collectors and investors.</p>

<p>Despite the decline in prices and the admission of failure, the Azuki official team (0x3A…6305) managed to generate substantial revenue through the sale of Azuki Elementals. They received 20,000 ETH, which amounts to approximately $37 million. Shortly after, the funds were transferred to the Azuki team&#8217;s multi-signature address (0x2a…60AA). This transfer of funds signals the team&#8217;s continued commitment to navigating the challenges and striving for future success.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>The Nevada regulator that applied to take over the Prime Trust is facing default.</em></li>



<li><em>The filing says Prime Trust is also running with an equity shortfall of $12 million due partly to an inability to access old wallets.</em></li>



<li><em>The regulator said the crypto asset manager has failed and owes millions to its customers.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to Coindesk, the Nevada Department of Financial Institutions (FDI) announced on Tuesday that it has applied to take over cryptocurrency custodian <a href="https://coincu.com/198262-prime-trust-faces-receivership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prime Trust</a> and freeze its activities.</strong></h5>

<p>FDI has petitioned the Nevada District Court to appoint a person to take over the day-to-day operations of the Prime Trust and &#8220;thoroughly examine all of the company&#8217;s financial affairs to determine what is in the best interest of the company.&#8221; Prime customers, or to remedy and return the company to private management, or liquidate it&#8221;.</p>



<p>An attachment to the application document shows that Prime&#8217;s management has agreed to take over. According to previous news, FDI stated that Prime Trust lost access to old wallets in early 2021 and used customer assets to buy back cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Prime Trust entered into an agreement with Fireblocks for a second company to manage its crypto assets. The deal was completed in 2020. In 2021, after Prime Trust had new management, it had already signed up. Set up &#8220;old wallet forwarding&#8221; for wallets on Fireblocks&#8217; platform, or set up to forward to wallets on Fireblocks&#8217; platform, the filing said.</p>

<p>However, in December 2021, Prime Trust &#8220;discovered that it could not access&#8221; the old wallets or the cryptocurrencies held in those wallets. Fireblocks head of communications Gaby Hui told CoinDesk that Prime and Fireblocks control all legacy wallets and hold no funds.</p>

<p>In a recent statement, Matt Huang, the founder of Paradigm, expressed unwavering dedication to the world of cryptocurrency. Five years ago, when Paradigm was established, there was no grand blueprint but rather a shared passion for the future and a deep belief in the potential of crypto. Today, that conviction remains stronger than ever.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paradigm has never been more dedicated to crypto.<br><br>When Fred and I started Paradigm five years ago, there was no master plan. What we had was a shared curiosity for the future, deep conviction in crypto, and a desire to advance the frontier of what’s possible.<br><br>Our best decision…</p>&mdash; Matt Huang (@matthuang) <a href="https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1673786399252955137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June 27, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>One of its most significant early decisions was to create the position of &#8220;research partner,&#8221; an innovative role aimed at attracting exceptional talent like Dan Robinson, a coder and lawyer with a keen interest in research. This move, along with the contributions of Charlie Noyes, laid the groundwork for Paradigm&#8217;s research-driven approach, which continues to define the company today.</p>



<p>Over the years, Paradigm has evolved, integrating investing and research into a cohesive and symbiotic relationship. By embracing a research-driven philosophy, the team has honed their investment acumen, while their investments have provided valuable insights and perspectives for their research endeavors.</p>



<p>At Paradigm, the emphasis is on nurturing a team of inquisitive individuals who are encouraged to follow their instincts. This experimental approach has solidified their identity as a research-driven organization, a concept now prominently reflected on their website.</p>



<p>While Paradigm&#8217;s primary focus remains on the crypto landscape, the team also recognizes the captivating advancements in the field of artificial intelligence. Rather than viewing crypto and AI as competing forces, the firm sees significant potential for collaboration and overlap between the two. As such, they are committed to exploring both realms with equal enthusiasm.</p>
