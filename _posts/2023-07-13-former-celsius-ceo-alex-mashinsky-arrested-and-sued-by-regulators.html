<p>Celsius co-founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky was arrested on Thursday after an investigation into the bankrupt lender&rsquo;s collapse. </p>
<p>Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of the insolvent cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network was arrested on Thursday according to a US Department of Justice (DOJ) indictment.</p>
<p>Mashinsky and others have been charged with seven counts, including securities, commodities, and wire fraud, and a conspiracy charge to manipulate $CEL, Celsius&rsquo; native token, Bloomberg reports.</p>
SEC, CFTC, and FTC File Lawsuits Against Mashinsky
<p>The DOJ&rsquo;s indictment is accompanied by separate lawsuits by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) against the company and Mashinsky.</p>
<p>Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 2022, and the Fahrenheit consortium recently won a bid to acquire the lender&rsquo;s assets.</p>
DOJ: Mashinsky Misled Investors for Years
<p>The Department of Justice accused Mashinsky and Celsius&rsquo; Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon of running &ldquo;a years-long scheme to mislead customers&rdquo; on Celsius&rsquo; market value and its interest in CEL.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports the DOJ indictment further accused Mashinsky of making false and misleading public statements regarding his own sales of CEL.</p>
<p>The DOJ indictment reads:</p>

<p>Mashinsky portrayed Celsius as a modern-day bank, where customers could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest. In truth, however, Mashinsky operated Celsius as a risky investment fund, taking in customer money under false and misleading pretences.</p>

CFTC Alleges a Fraud Scheme
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) accused Mashinsky and Celsius of participating in a &ldquo;scheme to defraud hundreds of thousands of customers by misrepresenting the safety and profitability of its digital asset-based finance platform.&rdquo; The complaint adds despite worsening market conditions, Celsius continued to &ldquo;promote the safety and viability of Celsius, and failed to disclose these losses to customers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The regulator further alleges Celsius violated several federal commodities regulations, failed to register as a Commodity Pool Operator, engaged in fraud, and did not provide sufficient disclosure documents.</p>
<p>Investigators from the CFTC previously concluded that Mashinsky and Celsius violated several US laws.</p>
SEC Accuses Celsius and Mashinsky of Securities Fraud
<p>In a separate lawsuit, the Securities and Exchange Commission accused Mashinsky and the firm of securities fraud. According to the SEC, CEL and Celsius&rsquo; Earn product are securities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint alleges:</p>

<p>In this case, Celsius offered and sold CEL and the Earn Interest Program as securities. Celsius and Mashinsky never filed a registration statement or had one in effect with the SEC for their offers and sales of securities through the Earn Interest Program.</p>

FTC Announces $4.7 Billion Settlement With Celsius
<p>The barrage of claims against Celsius and its former CEO further included a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) complaint.</p>
<p>The FTC said Celsius violated the Federal Trade Commission Act &ldquo;in connection with the marketing and sale of cryptocurrency lending and custody services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The commission said:</p>

<p>Defendants assured customers that Celsius maintained sufficient reserves to meet customer obligations.</p>

<p>However, the FTC reached a settlement agreement with Celsius &ldquo;that will permanently ban it from handling customers&rsquo; assets&rdquo; and prohibits it from &ldquo;offering, marketing, or promoting any product or services that could be used to deposit, exchange, invest or withdraw any assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Celsius has agreed to a $4.7 billion judgement which will only be paid after creditors and investors have been repaid in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC&rsquo;s Bureau of Customer Protection, commented on Celsius's alleged conduct, saying:</p>

<p>Celsius touted a new business model but engaged in an old-fashioned swindle.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s action banning Celsius from handling people&rsquo;s money and holding its executives accountable should make clear that emerging technologies are not above the law.</p>
