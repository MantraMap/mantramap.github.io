However, this selling remains contained as the rate hike was quite on the expected lines.</p>
<p>On-chain data shows that whales are back in action and have been accumulating across stablecoins including USDT, USDC, BUSD, and DAI. These addresses accumulating stablecoins are typically those with $100,000 to $10,000,000.</p>
<figure id="attachment_131551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131551" style="width: 2428px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-131551" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15104816/Stablecoins-Whales.jpg" alt="" width="2428" height="1339" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-131551" class="wp-caption-text">Courtesy: Santiment</figcaption></figure>
<p>As we can see in the above image, the lines for stablecoins holdings are all going up. This shows that big players are coming back into the crypto market and the buying power is overall increasing.</p>
<p>As we can see from the above images, there have been massive jumps in the $100k to $10m wallets for USDT and BUSD. In the last three days alone, key USDT wallets have accumulated $817.5 million more in buying power. Similarly, the key BUSD addresses have accumulated $104.9 million more in buying power.</p>
<p>On-chain data provider Santiment states that these are typically great signs after the recent FTX episode. These accumulation patterns hint that the trust in the broader crypto space still remains intact.</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Whales Change Course</h3>
<p>Over the last 14 months, we have been seeing that Bitcoin whales have been <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-under-pressure-as-another-whale-dumps-almost-10k-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reducing the supply</a> and the price drop has followed in tandem. However, there&#8217;s a fresh change in the Bitcoin whale behavior witnessed this week. The Santiment <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/are-whales-setting-sail-or-predicting-a-crypto-fail-7139" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We have seen 159 new addresses holding between 100 to 10,000 BTC in just the past three weeks. This is the fastest growth of these addresses in 10 months. 40,747 more Bitcoin (worth $726 million) have collectively entered these key whale wallets in just the past 9 days&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently, there are 15,848 such addresses that hold anywhere between 100 to 10,000 BTC. This is typically a smaller number in comparison to the 43,460,000 total Bitcoin addresses. However, the whale addresses are the ones that cause major movements in the BTC price.</p>

<p>This PayPal integration into MetaMask will provide a simple and convenient way for users to purchase crypto. For now, this facility is available only to select MetaMask users in the U.S. and shall roll out to all customers in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>This also makes MetaMask the first Web3 wallet to leverage PayPal and drive successful on-ramp transactions. Note that with the PayPal integration, MetaMask is currently allowing the purchase of only Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>MetaMask is a leading self-custody wallet quite popular among crypto users. It also allows millions of crypto enthusiasts to interact with other applications such as play and earn, NFT marketplaces, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).</p>
<p>The crypto wallet service provider is now looking to expand and diversify the payment options via the MetaMask mobile app. Speaking on the development, Lorenzo Santos, Product Manager for MetaMask, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/consensys-teams-with-paypal-for-a-new-way-to-buy-crypto-in-metamask/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">added</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“This integration with PayPal will allow our U.S. users to not just buy crypto seamlessly through MetaMask, but also to easily explore the Web3 ecosystem.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Recently, MestaMask users <a href="https://coingape.com/web-stories/metamask-users-outraged-after-consensys-privacy-policy-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> their displeasure over ConsenSys&#8217; privacy policy. This happened after ConsenSys confirmed that they collect user data on their on-chain wallet service.</p>
<h3>ConsenSys Launches zkEVM</h3>
<p>A day before, ConsenSys unveiled its zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) network for private beta testing. This would allow developers to deploy and manage their decentralized applications directly using tools like MetaMask, Truffle and Infura.</p>
<p>This development will also help in bridging assets between zkEVM and the Goerli testnet for developers to test their smart contracts and DApps. Speaking on the development, ConsenSys <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-launches-private-beta-zkevm-testnet-to-scale-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Testnet participants can also bridge tokens, transfer tokens, and interact with deployed dApps listed on our upcoming ecosystem portal page. We intend to learn whether the developer experience of the zkEVM has the potential to accelerate innovation in Web3 and will be evaluating feedback from the community to inform our next step.”</p></blockquote>

On December 14th, the memecoin breaks below a $0.09 support with sufficient volume, indicating likeless of further downfall. How far may this potential fall carry Dogecoin in the coming weeks?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A resistance trendline of a 4-hour time frame chart assists sellers in prolonging Dogecoin losses</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Dogecoin price plunged below the 200-day EMA support</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Dogecoin coin is $467.5 Billion, indicating a 30% loss.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are whales Accumulating Amid Dogecoin Fall?</span></h2>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131544" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15094417/Screenshot_20221215_094314-e1671077674494.png" alt="whale activity" width="1200" height="433" srcset="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15094417/Screenshot_20221215_094314-e1671077674494.png 1200w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15094417/Screenshot_20221215_094314-e1671077674494-300x108.png 300w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15094417/Screenshot_20221215_094314-e1671077674494-768x277.png 768w, https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15094417/Screenshot_20221215_094314-e1671077674494-150x54.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />Source- <span style="font-weight: 400;">Intotheblock</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intotheblock, the on-chain data provider, showcased their <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/dogecoin-price-prediction-bullish-pattern-sets-doge-to-reach-0-15/">Dogecoin</a> has been witnessing huge whale transactions since December 10th. The Large transaction metric records transaction value greater than $100000 to figure out how institutional investors and whales react to the current market scenario. These players have a better understanding of the market, so their activity could highlight an important turnaround mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, despite a steady downfall in Dogecoin price, a rising slope in this onchain indicator hints at whale accumulation. On December 13th, the indicator shows a two-week high value of 1.48k transactions.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin Price Analysis</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/g/G7FfYyUm.png" alt="Dogecoin Price" width="1946" height="1109" />Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two weeks, the Dogecoin price showcased weakness compared to market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. On December 5th, the coin price turned down from the $0.1 resistance and triggered a v-top reversal. This downfall registered a 20% loss and plunged the Doge price to its current level of $0.87.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the falling prices breached local support of $0.09, indicating the seller are confident in reaching lower levels. Yesterday, this <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a> witnessed a 3.6% loss and offered a daily candle closing below the $0.09 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the price shows sustainability below the breached support, the sellers may drive Dogecoin 15% down to $0.0735.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical  indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>RSI indicator:</strong> A recent downfall in the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the strength of the coin’s recent price action, displays a bearish outlook as its slope nosedive below the neutral line</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> with the recent downfall, the Doge price dipped below the 20, 50, and 200 daily EMAs offering additional confirmation of potential downfall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dogecoin Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $0.087</span></li>

The Fed stated that it is likely fair to raise rates again at the current rate of increase. After increasing rates by 75 bps for several months due to inflation worries, today&#8217;s announcement came as a slowdown to rate hikes.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price Slumps</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> along with the stock market crashed significantly after the Federal Reserve announcement. At the time of writing, the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> fell by over 2.7% in the past thirty minutes and currently trade at $17,790 and $1305 respectively.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131541" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15012626/Capture8.png" alt="" width="1017" height="419" /></p>
<p>Additionally, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinstats.app/fear-and-greed/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index</a> has fallen to levels of &#8220;fear&#8221; and is expected to increase further to &#8220;extreme fear&#8221; in the coming days.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-131540" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/15011920/Capture7.png" alt="" width="604" height="324" /></p>
<h2>Fear Engulfs Crypto</h2>
<p>There is also a growing fear among the crypto community on the back of the market dip, as the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-enters-pre-halving-accumulation-phase-time-to-buy/">BTC price rally</a> seems to have lost steam.</p>
<p>Many expected a relief rally to commence after the Fed announcement today, but it seems like all hopes have been squashed.</p>

<p>However, many prominent analysts do believe that this crash is more of a &#8220;buy the news, sell the rumor&#8221;, and the market has already bottomed out. They anticipate a relief rally for Bitcoin is very much due.</p>

<p>The Fed&#8217;s continuous rate hikes are part of a larger effort to curb inflation and calm the economy, which has been pushing prices to their highest levels in decades.</p>
<p>As investors react to an uncertain economic climate, the effects of every fresh Fed rate increase are still being felt in the stock and <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> markets.

This pattern consists of a bull rally market by a long pole and a minor correction face between two downsloping trendlines. Thus, the technical step-up offers a directional rally target the same distance as the length of the pole.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low volume retest to the breach trendline indicates the traders are betting on long position trade.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crucial EMAs(20, 50, 100, and 200) trading above the coin price creates multiple resistance against a price rally.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the XRP price is $807 Million, indicating a 27% loss.</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent uncertainty in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-is-more-important-than-ever-for-sec/">XRP coin</a> showed a minor correction from the $0.41 resistance. However, the daily technical chart revealed this minor pullback was a part of a flag pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, this bullish continuation showcase a minor retracement between the two downsloping trendlines. This correction phase absorbs the excessive buying pressure and prepares buyers for the next bull run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the recent less-than-expected CPI data, the crypto market witnessed a sudden buying pressure on December 13th. As a result, XRP price jumped 3% and gave an upside breakout from the patterns resistance trendline. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By press time, the XRP trades at the $0.39 mark and shows a retest to the breached trendline. Furthermore, a long-tail rejection attached to the daily candle with decreased volume indicates price sustainability above the new flipped support.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, a post-retest rally may drive the price 30% higher to the $0.5 mark.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, a daily-candle closing below the breached trendline will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMAs:</strong> along with the pattern breakout, the XRP price pierced the 20-day EMA slope this reclaimed Ema will act as suitable support bolstering the potential price recovery rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>MACD:</strong> the rising <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">MACD</a> and signal line shows gradual growth in bullish momentum. Moreover, the buyers will gain additional confirmation for price recovery if these slope jump above the neutral line.</span></p>

Moreover, this price jump triggered a bullish double-bottom pattern increasing further growth potential in Solana.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Completing the double bottom pattern, the Solana price is poised for an 11% rise.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The daily- candle closing below the $14.4 mark will invalidate the bullish thesis.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 24-hour trading volume in the Solana coin is $836 Billion, indicating a 19% gain.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/2/2NlGgEWC.png" alt="Solana Price" width="1946" height="1109" /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Source-</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the recent uncertainty in the crypto market, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/solana-price-prediction-is-solana-dead-or-is-it-just-panic-selling/">Solana coin price</a> resonated in a defined range stretched from $15 to giving it a closer look; this consolidation shows the formation of a double bottom pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In technical analysis, this bullish reversal pattern is quite famous at the market bottom, encouraging a directional rally upon the break out of its neckline resistance. Thus, with a 5.7% intraday price jump, the Solana price gave a massive breakout from the $14.4 neckline resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a daily candle closing above the $14.4 resistance, the prices are expected to revert lower and retest the breached level as possible support. The new flip support will act as a launchpad to bolster further price growth. In theory, the potential target for this pattern is the same distance covered between the neckline and base support shot from the breakout point.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, a post-retest rally shall drive the Solana Price 11% higher to hit $8.57</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a contrary note, the in-between resistance of $15 has registered bullish growth since last month. Therefore, a daily candle closing below the $14.4 mark will weaken the bullish thesis and continue the following consultation for longer periods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, traders look for a safer entry for buying above the $15 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Relative strength index:</strong> the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the strengths of recent price action, suggests a bullish outlook. Despite the sideways trend, the indicator slope constantly rises, suggesting increasing bullish momentum, which supports the $15 breakout.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>EMA&#8217;s:</strong> the recent price pierced the 20 DMA slope, which offers an extra edge for buyers</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $14.3 and $15</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support levels- $2.75 and $11.3</span></p>

The Fed chair said the labor market remains extremely tight with median projection for the unemployment rate rises to 4.6% by the end of next year. Also, the activity in the housing sector has weakened significantly.</p>
<p>He said the US economy slowed significantly from last year&#8217;s pace. A restrictive policy stance will likely be needed for some time, he added. Overall, Powell said a sufficiently restrictive policy stance is yet to arrive.</p>
<h2>More Evidence Needed To Show Inflation Drop Is Sustained</h2>
<p>Powell said the last two <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">CPI</a> reports showed a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases. &#8220;It will take substantially more evidence to have confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.&#8221; Maintaining the previous stance of not loosening policy prematurely, Powell said the status quo on inflation will continue. Speaking about how the economy could places an year from now, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Fed</a> chair said no one knows with any certainty where the economy will be.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The historic record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course until the job is done.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 0.50% interest rate rise. Stock markets and crypto prices reacted negatively despite the hike being on the expected lines. Meanwhile, Bitcoin (BTC) price stands at $17,946, up 1.27% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. The Fed hike announcement essentially nullified the gains BTC made earlier. At one point on Wednesday, the top cryptocurrency was trading at $18,300 range.</p>

<p>Explaining the decision, the committee said the repeat of ongoing rate increases are likely appropriate to return inflation to 2 percent, going forward. The FOMC said it is looking at achieving maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run.</p>

<h2>Rate Hikes Thus Far</h2>
<p>The Fed raised interest rates by 0.25% in March 2022, the first hike since 2018. In its March policy meeting, it predicted six further hikes, which have since proved true.</p>

<p>In May, the central bank continued its policy of economic tightening, by announcing the first 0.5% increase since 2000. The remaining five hikes June, July, September, and November were all 0.75%, until the downgrade of 0.5% which happened today.</p>
<p>Investors are nonetheless worried about the central bank&#8217;s approach to controlling price inflation as well as the possibility of a severe <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/recession/">recession</a>.</p>

The Fed said the repeat rate hikes at ongoing rate increases are likely appropriate. This marks a slowdown in rate hike after several months of rising rates by 75 bps amid inflation concerns. Following the encouraging 24 hours of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto trading</a> after the release of November Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, the stock markets have been on an upward curve on Wednesday. However, the Fed announcement led to a crash in crypto and stock prices.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">CPI</a> rose at an annual 7.1%, which led to a rise in stocks on Tuesday. The latest FOMC interest rate decision came in the wake of recent comments from Fed chair Jerome Powell about potential slowing down of interest rate hike. Accordingly, the markets were in anticipation of a 50 bps interest rate rise. Fed chair Jerome Powell is expected to reveal economic projections on interest rates, unemployment, inflation and economic growth in the United States.</p>

<p>In line with its long term plans, the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20221214a1.pdf" rel="nofollow">FOMC</a> said it sought to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The committee said there was modest growth in spending and production while job gains have been robust in recent times.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Crypto Prices Go Down</h2>
<p>In the last one hour prior to the rate hike announcement, Bitcoin (BTC) price rose by around 1.05%. This indicates a positive momentum with expectation of 50 bps rate rise. As of writing, BTC price stands at $17,953, up 1.27% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. However, BTC took a drop by 0.55% after the rate rise announcement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 Index also registered a 0.68% drop in the day. This is compared to around 0.50% rise it saw before the announcement was made.</p>

While it does not involve any of the FTX employees, four different witnesses are going to testify in front of the panel.</p>
<h2>Kevin O&#8217;Leary Testifies</h2>
<p>Among these witnesses is <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/kevin-oleary/">Kevin O’Leary</a>, from Shark Tank fame and also an investor in FTX. He has also previously been a paid spokesperson for the now-bankrupt crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Although the FTX debacle has left him at a loss, O&#8217;Leary still remains a staunch supporter of the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency in general.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-news-kevin-oleary-claims-he-cant-call-sbf-guilty-unless-hes-tried/">Kevin O’Leary Claims He Can’t Call SBF Guilty Unless He’s Tried</a></em></p>
<p>According to O&#8217;Leary, he spoke with the FTX founder <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> after the business declared bankruptcy. He quoted Bankman-Fried as saying that a large portion of the missing money was used to buy back FTX shares from Binance founder Changpeng &#8220;CZ&#8221; Zhou.</p>
<h2>O&#8217;Leary Slams Binance</h2>
<p>O&#8217;Leary said that $2 billion to $3 billion in funds were used to buy shares, emptying the balance sheet of all assets in the process.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-wanted-to-keep-sec-out-of-crypto-regulation-ftx-hearing/">SBF Wanted To Keep SEC Out Of Crypto Regulation</a></em></p>
<p>He testified to the senate that,</p>
<blockquote><p>Binance is a massive unregulated monopoly now. This is my personal opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, as per O&#8217;Leary &#8212; Bankman-Fried had stated that he needed to purchase these shares because <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cz/">CZ</a> was effectively blocking compliance requirements in a number of different locations where the exchange was attempting to gain regulatory approval.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a title="FTX Hearing: CEO John J. Ray iii Claims “Embezzlement” Root Cause Of FTX Collapse" href="https://coingape.com/ftx-hearing-ceo-john-ray-claims-embezzlement-root-cause-of-ftx-collapse/" rel="bookmark">CEO John J. Ray iii Claims “Embezzlement” Root Cause Of FTX Collapse</a></em></p>
<p>According to his testimony, CZ would not comply with the data requirements imposed by a number of different jurisdictions. He was also quoted saying that <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/binance/">Binance</a> had intentionally tried to put rival FTX &#8220;out of business&#8221;.</p>
<p>The troubles at FTX extended much further than just obtaining shares from CZ, as demonstrated by various claims made by prosecutors and by the newly appointed CEO of FTX, <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-ceo-john-j-ray-blasts-sbf-ahead-ftx-tomorrows-congressional-hearing/">John J. Ray III</a>.</p>
<p>However, it seems like Kevin places most or at least some of the responsibility on Binance, which was rivaled by FTX during its heydays.</p>

In this scheme, the defendants manipulated exchange-traded stocks by using the social media platforms like <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> and Discord.</p>
<h2>Pro Traders Or Manipulators?</h2>
<p>In its lawsuit, which was submitted to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, the SEC seeks permanent injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against each defendant.</p>
<p>The SEC specially mentions Stefan Hrvatin, who goes by the Twitter username &#8220;@LadeBackk&#8221; as apart from facing the above charges, he will also be barred from trading penny stocks in the market.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-is-more-important-than-ever-for-sec/">Why XRP Lawsuit Is More Important Than Ever For SEC?</a></em></p>
<p>According to the SEC&#8217;s official <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-221" rel="nofollow">announcement</a>, seven of the eight defendants advertised themselves as accomplished traders and amassed hundreds and thousands of followers on Twitter and in stock trading chatrooms like Discord, starting around early January 2020.</p>
<h2>The Grand Scheme</h2>
<p>These seven defendants are accused of buying specific stocks and encouraging their sizable social media following to purchase those stocks by publishing price objectives or making it known that they were buying, holding onto, or growing their stock positions in them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More: </strong><a href="https://coingape.com/sbf-built-a-house-of-cards-says-sec-chair/">SBF Built A House Of Cards, Says SEC Chair</a></em></p>
<p>However, the complaint claims that as the share prices and/or trading volumes increased in the securities they were promoting, the individuals regularly sold their shares without even disclosing their intentions to do so.</p>
<h2>SEC&#8217;s Official Stance</h2>
<p>Joseph Sansone, the Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Market Abuse Unit, officially states that,</p>
<blockquote><p>As our complaint states, the defendants used social media to amass a large following of novice investors and then took advantage of their followers by repeatedly feeding them a steady diet of misinformation, which resulted in fraudulent profits of approximately $100 million</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Today’s action exposes the true motivation of these alleged fraudsters and serves as another warning that investors should be wary of unsolicited advice they encounter online.&#8221;, Sansone said.</p>
<p>The SEC’s ongoing investigation is being handled by Andrew Palid, David Scheffler, and Michele T. Perillo of the Market Abuse Unit (MAU).</p>

For the first time in several months, there are high chances of the Fed announcing a rate hike in line with the market expectation of 0.50%. The anticipation comes at the back of Fed chair <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/jerome-powell/">Jerome Powell</a>&#8216;s recent remarks on slowing down rate hikes. After the November FOMC meeting, Powell hinted at the possibility of lesser rate hike in the December meet.</p>

<p>Following fall of U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) in November to 7.1%, the Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices rose significantly. As of writing, BTC price stands at $18,004, up 0.80% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>. The current price range is the highest so far in over a month since the FTX liquidity crisis led to a crypto crash around mid-November.</p>
<h2>BTC To Recover More If Fed Rate Hike At 50 BPS?</h2>
<p>During his recent <a href="https://coingape.com/powell-speech-at-brookings-economic-outlook-inflation-crypto/">speech at the Brookings Institute</a>, Powell reiterated his statement that smaller interest rate hikes could start in December 2022. Stating that the inflation still remained high, he said moderating hike pace might come as soon as December. Meanwhile, crypto analysts are predicting a jump to the $18,400 level if Fed hikes interest rate by 0.50%. <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1603024109331513347?s=20&amp;t=IceyM4w8qOOuVS1vLPXWkw" rel="nofollow">Captain Faibik</a>, who does technical analysis, said BTC will break that price level if the news comes out to be positive.</p>

<p>Following the reveal of interest rate decision, Powell speech could spill beans on the country&#8217;s economic outlook, inflation, and the labor market.</p>

The declining CPI data accentuates the cooling inflation and a higher chance that the US Fed will ease the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-ethereum-price-gains-in-anticipation-of-50-bps-rate-hike-by-us-fed/">interest rate hike</a> program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Bitcoin and numerous <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoins</a> surged higher on December 14th and escaped their consolidation phase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By 8:47 am EST Wednesday, the global crypto market was valued at $873.27 billion, falling 0.21% </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">since yesterday</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Moreover, the total crypto market volume fell 12.7% and reached the $40 Billion mark. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Top Gainers and Losers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131509" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/14194919/Screenshot_20221214_194343.png" alt="heatmap of cryptocurrency prices" width="1200" height="675" />Source- Coin360 </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recovery sentiment in the crypto market, Toncoin and Lido Dao show the highest gains today among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. In the 24-hour period, the TON price surged 17.02% to reach $2.70; the LDO price gained 8.65%% to $1.15. On the other hand, the GMX and Stacks Tokens are top losers, with GMX price down 6.99% to $54.5, while STX price at $0.2862 shows a 2.68% fall.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin Price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131510" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/14195018/Screenshot_20221214_194541.png" alt="BTC" width="1200" height="349" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin price witnessed a significant inflow just after the release of CPI data. A positive sentiment spread in the crypto market bolstered this price to give a massive bullish breakout of $17300 weekly resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the daily chart shows the coin follows a parallel channel pattern, in which the prices show a steady growth between two ascending trendlines. Thus, untill the pattern support trendline is intact, the Bitcoin price may prolong its recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UEQtxyN1.png" alt="Bitcoin Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the press time, the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-btc-enters-pre-halving-accumulation-phase-time-to-buy/">Bitcoin price</a> is trading at $17900 and retesting the pattern resistance trendline. This retest indicates a higher possibility for the price to revert lower and revisit the bottom trendline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the new traders looking for entry opportunities can enter at the support trendline for the new bull cycle that may reach to $18500 mark.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ethereum price </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-131511" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/14195040/Screenshot_20221214_194619.png" alt="ETH" width="1200" height="365" />Source- Coinmarketcap</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to Bitcoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/ethereum-price-prediction-market-recovery-sets-eth-prices-for-8-8-jump/">Ethereum price </a>experienced strong buying pressure on December 13th and gave a massive breakout from the $1300 monthly resistance. Today, this altcoin shows a 0.76% rise, but with low volume, the prices are likely to plunge lower and retest the $1300 mark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the possible retest phase shows sustaining above the $1300 mark, the buyers could drive the price $1422 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/n/NFRJZyxH.png" alt="Ethereum Price Prediction" width="1946" height="1109" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">RSI indicator</a>, which reflects the strength of ongoing price action, indicates a bullish outlook as it reaches a four-week high of 57.8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a breakdown below $1300 will undermine the bullish thesis.</span></p>

<p>Bitcoin currently trades above $18,200, nearly 3% up in the last 24 hours. The trading volume has also jumped higher and the 24-hour low and high are $18,312 and $17,930, respectively.

<p>Ethereum (ETH) price is trading at $1,341, up over 2% in the last 24 hours. Similar to Bitcoin, ETH price soared nearly 1% in the last few hours. The 24-hour low and high are $1,289 and $1,341, respectively. The ETH price is moving strongly as compared to BTC. However, a resultant rally will help drive altcoins to move higher.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Expectations On Fed Rate Hike and Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve is expected to raise the fed funds rate by 50 bps to 4.25%-4.5% during its last monetary policy meeting, following four consecutive 75 bps rate hikes. Investors will also keep a close eye on projections for growth and inflation as the U.S. CPI continues to fall.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wall Street expects a slowdown in rate hikes from December as hinted by Fed Chair Jerome Powell after a <a href="https://coingape.com/us-fed-raises-interest-rates-by-75-bps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">75 bps rate hike in November</a>. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citi, Nomura, Barclays, and Bloomberg expect a 50 bps rate hike in December.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="headlines-description">Today, the UK announced that the annual inflation has eased to 10.7% in November from a 41-year high of 11.1% in October, beating forecasts of 10.9%. Thus, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices remained higher.</span></p>
<p>Futures tied to Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq 100 remain flat on Wednesday as investors are uncertain over the Fed&#8217;s hawkish or dovish stance. Investors anticipate a smaller interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve after softer inflation data.</p>
<p>As per the <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">CME FedWatch Tool</a>, the probability of a 50 bps rate hike is 80%. The value increased from 73.5% after the CPI data release. Moreover, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has dropped below 104. The stock markets have already reacted to it, but crypto investors are awaiting the Fed rate hike decision to confirm the market bottom.</p>

In this context, the U.S. Federal Reserve is set announce its interest rate hike decision later on Wednesday. While the Fed rate hike is more likely to come in line with the market expectation of a 0.50% rise, it remains to be seen if the crypto market will react positively to the news. The rate hike decision assumes huge prominence as the central bank could for the first time reduce the rate hike.</p>

<p>In the last few months, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has consecutively raised interest rates to contain the rising inflation in US. More importantly, the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/cryptocurrency-market/">crypto market</a> is showing first signs of positive momentum after the FTX collapse that led to a crypto crash in November 2022.</p>
<h2>Share Of Withdrawals In Binance Reserves</h2>
<p>Amid concerns of recent Binance withdrawals, CZ responded to fears of the exchange being at the risk of collapsing. Speaking on a <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1BdGYykXBDyGX?s=20" rel="nofollow">Twitter space</a> on Wednesday, the Binance CEO spoke about the exchange getting consolidated and become even stronger and more powerful in the industry after the FTX collapse. Ran Neuner, a crypto influencer, pointed out that Binance reserves and trading suggests that the platform is multiple times bigger than its nearest competitor. Binance is perhaps bigger than the volume of most other competitors put together, he said.</p>
<p>Reacting to this, CZ said traders are choosing Binance over other platforms due to its high security and reputation, among other things like the big reserves. The crypto exchange stood the test of time many times with attacks all the time by frauds. This is how we earned our trust, he said.</p>

<p>CZ also suggested that &#8216;stress tests&#8217; like the recent withdrawals are a good thing for the industry. In fact, the share of withdrawals in the last two days amounts to less than 2% of the total assets on Binance, he said.</p>

This price move has helped XRP to reclaim the 6th spot in the tally.</p>
<h2>Whales moving huge amounts of XRP</h2>
<p>According to the data provided by WhaleAlert, more than 411 million XRP have been moved in the last 24 hours. <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-news-whales-move-442-million-xrp-court-grants-deadline-motion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whales bought</a> over 76.9 million XRP tokens (approx worth $30 million) in multiple transactions.</p>
<p>However, the biggest transaction recorded by the whale tracker has been of adding $16.6 million worth of XRP from the Binance crypto exchange.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the whale tracker recorded an unusual transaction of moving <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1602622243372138499" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">300 million XRP tokens</a> (approx worth $115.97 million) were moved from Binance to an unknown wallet. However, this transaction comes amid the heavy withdrawals registered from the Binance, crypto exchange.</p>
<p>CZ, CEO of Binance mentioned that this is just a FUD. it has been following the crypto exchange since its ICO back in 2017. Coingape reported that deposits are coming back to the Binance. He added that the <a href="https://coingape.com/binance-news-things-have-stabilized-deposits-are-coming-back-in-ceo-cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FUD surrounding Binance</a> facing FTX contagion and a probe by DOJ is the reason behind the massive withdrawals.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s native token regains 6th spot</h2>
<p>On the other hand, a whale also moved around $13.8 million worth of XRP tokens to the Bitstamp crypto exchange amid the recent price surge.</p>
<p>XRP price is up by around 12% over the past 30 days. Ripple’s native crypto is trading at an average price of $0.39, at the press time. Its 24 hour trading volume has jumped to stand $972 million.</p>
<p>This price surge has helped the XRP to reclaim the 6th spot in the tally of top digital assets. XRP is holding a massive market cap of over $19.66 billion despite <a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-is-more-important-than-ever-for-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">facing a lawsuit from the SEC.</a></p>

In the wake of the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx">FTX</a> scandal, analysts are of the opinion that the market has already reached its lowest point and is due for a trend reversal.</p>
<h2>Can Ethereum (ETH) Break Resistance?</h2>
<p>While the price of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> is continuing to be under pressure due to worries of miner capitulation and bankruptcy filings, Ethereum is showing strength by gaining close to 9% in the past week with a possibility of rallying towards  the $1,550 price zone.</p>
<p>With the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics today released November’s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/consumer-price-index-cpi/">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) data of 7.1%, down from 7.7% in October, Ethereum broke past $1300 to hit $1325 where it currently trades and faces stiff resistance.</p>

<p>While the Ethereum (ETH) price shows strength at these levels and can hold on to it, traders and potential buyers can drive the price of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> to revisit the $1420 mark, a 7.5% high from its current market price.</p>
<p>Furthermore, popular crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe, predicts that Ethereum can even surpass the $1420 mark and potentially hit $1550, if it&#8217;s able to break past the resistance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> faces crucial resistance here, which is the area at $1,325 to break.</p>
<p>If that breaks, we can see $1,550, possibly.</p>
<p>Support to hold; $1,280-1,300. <a href="https://t.co/eEdG3VJP86">pic.twitter.com/eEdG3VJP86</a></p>

<h2>Data Shows Price Rally Due</h2>
<p>According to historical data, Ethereum has recorded consistent year-on-year (YoY) growth throughout the earlier three Christmases, with the last one being $4093 on December 25, 2021.</p>
<p><em><strong>Read More:</strong> <a title="Bitcoin Price Prediction: Analyst Predicts A Pull Back Before Bitcoin Bull Run" href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-analyst-predicts-a-pull-back-before-bitcoin-bull-run/" rel="bookmark">Analyst Predicts A Pull Back Before Bitcoin Bull Run</a></em></p>
<p>Also, if technical parameters are considered, the Ethereum chart clearly shows that the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets/heres-ethereum-eth-price-analysis-for-the-coming-week-buy-now/">ETH price</a> is due for a rally. Its relative strength index (shown in purple) dropped below 30 in early November and has now gradually been going up again.</p>

<p>In addition, ETH&#8217;s 30-day <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/macd-moving-average-convergence-divergnece/">moving average</a> (shown in red) has lagged behind its 200-day average (shown in blue) for the entirety of the year, indicating that a change towards more favourable price movement is long overdue.</p>
