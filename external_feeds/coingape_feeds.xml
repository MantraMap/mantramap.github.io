However, the BTC price has seen some short-term improvements since the beginning of the new year, although, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s market value continues to wallow below crucial support levels.</p>
<h2>Breaking BTC&#8217;s Key Resistance</h2>
<p>In spite of the gains, investors in Bitcoin are searching for a probable bottom that may bring in a new rise for the first blockchain-powered <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>. In the past few weeks, the price of Bitcoin has been unable to overcome the critical resistance located near $17,000. And, since December 17, 2022, the flagship cryptocurrency has been largely fluctuating around the $16,900 level.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-134527" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/07012727/chrome_GMm9ktnqgh.png" alt="" width="922" height="437" /></p>
<p>In a tweet published on January 6, crypto trading specialist and analyst Michael van de Poppe indicated that Bitcoin is at support based on the recent price action. He also identified significant long positions to look out for, which is especially important given the announcement of upcoming major macroeconomic data like the Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index (PMI) &amp; Consumer Spending Index (CSI). De Poppe had earlier forecasted that the peak price of Bitcoin would range between $275,000 and $350,000 during the bull cycle of 2023.</p>

<p>While speaking on macroeconomic factors, the <a href="https://coingape.com/crypto-market-bullish-us-job-report/">decrease in the unemployment rate</a> in the United States from 3.7% in November 2022 to 3.5% in December may help support Bitcoin&#8217;s likely rally toward $18,000. In addition, the U.S. economy added 223,000 jobs in December, surpassing the predicted 200,000.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Bitcoin</a> is again at support, but not fancying longs too much at this point.</p>
<p>It needs to hold above $16.6K to avoid a puke to low $16K and to sustain upwards momentum.</p>
<p>In that regard, with the data today, I&#39;d be looking at bit lower for longs towards $17K. <a href="https://t.co/6VQvjR9IeX">pic.twitter.com/6VQvjR9IeX</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1611295154517966849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2023</a></p></blockquote>

<h2>Bitcoin (BTC) Price To Rally?</h2>
<p>Against this backdrop, a number of sizable whale transactions have also surfaced in recent days. This is unexpected given the state of the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> at the moment. Data shows that within the first week of January alone, there were four of these significant asset transactions. This supports the possibility of other large transfers in the upcoming weeks prior to a brief <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bull-market/#:~:text=The%20bull%20market%2C%20also%20known,markets%20when%20prices%20rise%20up.">bull run</a>.</p>
<p>With almost a week into the new year, participants in the cryptocurrency industry predict a mixed 2023 for Bitcoin&#8217;s (BTC) price; with some predicting further effects from events like the FTX collapse while others see <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin-halving-2/">2024&#8217;s halving event</a> as a massive driving factor for the leading crypto king.</p>
<p>As things stand, the Bitcoin (BTC) price is currently being traded at $16,954. This represents an increase of 0.58% on the day, in contrast to a gain of 2.5% during the week as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

Under the influence of the cup and handle pattern, the coin price breached this monthly barrier which may offer a strong launchpad to buyers and continue the bullish recovery. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/c/cSGBb4Pf.png" alt="litecoin" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tradingview</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Litecoin Price Forms A Bullish Reversal Pattern</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Litecoin price shows the formation of a cup and handle pattern in the weekly time frame chart. This pattern resembles itself as shaped a normal teacup, but it is one of the most common bullish reversal patterns observed at market bottoms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In theory, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rounding-bottom-pattern/">U-shaped recovery</a> during the formation indicates the buyer gradually taking trend control and carrying a sustained recovery. Moreover, this pattern has a key resistance level whose breakout would intensify the buying and provide an entry opportunity for investors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Litecoin chart shows this resistance at $80, and in the ideal condition, it should drive a bullish rally to the $110 mark.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>Also read: <a href="https://coingape.com/heres-how-much-your-1000-investment-in-litecoin-will-be-worth-if-ltc-reaches-100/">Here’s How Much Your $1000 Investment In Litecoin Will Be Worth If LTC Reaches $100</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The $0.478 Stand As Crucial Support</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the recent uncertainty in the crypto market, the litecoin price has been walking a sideway strength for the past two months. However, during this consolidation, the prices rebounded from the $47.8 mark several times, indicating the buyers were obtaining sufficient support from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This support zone has also bolstered the cup and handle pattern mentioned above.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullish Divergence In RSI Indicator</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</a> indicator reflects the underlying strength of the price trend by calculating the speed and magnitude of recent price action. Thus, despite the sideways trend in litecoin, the weekly RSI showing evident growth indicates the rising buying pressure in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This bullish divergence increases the probability of an upcoming recovery rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Current Price Action</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last two weeks, the Litecoin price rebounded from local support of $63.75 and surged 18.5% high. The recent new year recovery assisted buyers with this growth and pushed it to its current price of $75.6.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained buying, the LTC price may continue to rise and challenge the $80 neckline resistance of the cup and handle pattern.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance Levels: $80 and $101</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support Levels: $63.7 and $47.8</span></li>

The Solana-based <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/meme-cryptocurrency/">memecoin</a>, which suddenly sprang out of nowhere and soon made its way into the top 200 cryptocurrencies by total <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/market-capitalization/#:~:text=The%20term%20market%20capitalization%20or,coin%20at%20any%20given%20time.">market capitalization</a>, was hit hard by a powerful bearish trend late on Thursday evening.</p>
<h2>BONK&#8217;s Price Crashes By 40%</h2>
<p>As speculation spread that BONK&#8217;s creators would be selling off their assets, a number of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/solana-sol/">Solana</a> whales liquidated their BONK positions. Because of this, BONK&#8217;s market value dropped by a whopping 54% over the course of 24 hours. Despite the significant drop in price, the memecoin is still in positive after a 1509.7% increase during the previous week.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-134521 size-full" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06225321/chrome_dWcJBHLSRW.png" alt="BONK" width="904" height="443" /></p>
<p>Following the current bearish outburst, the 24-hour trading volume of the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/">altcoin</a> has declined by 43.40% to $63 million while the market cap has dropped by 0.3% to $93 million. This is a direct response to the falling market price after a large number of SOL whales began withdrawing their BONK holdings and reaping enormous profits. A <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a> investor, in particular, admitted on Twitter that he sold $700,000 worth of BONK shortly after purchasing it for just $330.</p>

<h2>BONK&#8217;s Price To Dump More?</h2>
<p>However, as per the token&#8217;s richlist data, the top twenty wallet addresses have ownership of almost 50% of the token&#8217;s <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/circulating-supply/">circulating supply</a>. This has led many to believe that the token can be manipulated and dumped by large wallet holders. Moreover, if conspiracy theories are to be believed, some also suspect the disgraced crypto tycoon, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sam-bankman-fried/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, to be behind all this &#8212; as the creator of the now-defunct <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx">FTX exchange</a> was very much involved in Solana&#8217;s (SOL) development &amp; ecosystem.</p>

<p>The price of memecoin had recently increased due to the <a href="https://coingape.com/bonk-burns-five-billion-coins-as-price-continues-to-surge/">announcement of its coin burn</a>, in which the developers stated that all the five trillion BONK tokens which were allotted to them had been destroyed. Given the current volatility in the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">cryptocurrency market</a>, it&#8217;s hard to say what the future holds for BONK&#8217;s price. Since BONK has recently shown evidence of being in decline, many onlookers have projected that it would eventually fall to ground.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Bonk (BONK) is currently being traded at $0.000001610. This represents a decrease of 2% in the past 1 hour, in contrast to its 40.11% slump during the last 24 hours, as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="675" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/05185746/bnbchain.jpeg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="bnb" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike many major cryptocurrencies, which witnessed more than a 75% loss in market value, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/markets/3-reasons-to-buy-binance-coinbnb-before-entering-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance coin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has projected relatively fewer losses during the ongoing downtrend. By press time, the BNB price trades at $256.5, which is 62.89%, down from the all-time high of $690.93. Moreover, the coin price is currently wobbling near a high accumulation zone of $210, offering an entry opportunity to interested traders. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key points: </span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bullish breakout from $255 resistance sets BNB price for 16%</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An evident bullish divergence in weekly RSI hints upcoming price rally</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The intraday trading volume in the BNB coin is $389.5 Million, indicating an 11.2% loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/i/iuBM9rdG.png" alt="Binance Coin Price Prediction 2023" width="1946" height="1104" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The weekly technical chart indicates Binance coin has been stuck in a range-bound rally for the past eight months. This range is stretched from $340 to $220 and has limited the BNB growth for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the $210-$200 support managed to undermine two major downfalls, that of May 2021 and May-June 2022. In addition, the weekly chart showed some long lower price rejection candled at his support, indicating the buyers are aggressively defending this level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with the new year recovery in the crypto market, the BNB price has recently rebounded from the aforementioned support zone. On January 4th, this price recovery gave a massive breakout from the local resistance of $255, offering further growth potential for holders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/altcoins/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">altcoin </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">sustains above the breached resistance, the buyers will obtain suitable support to carry forward the price recovery. The post-breakout rally may push the price 16% higher to hit the $300 psychological resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, a daily candle closing below $255 will offset the bullish thesis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having said that, the Binance coin will need a weekly candle closing above the $340 resistance to bolster a sustained bullish recovery in 2023. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical Indicators</span></h2>
<p><b>Relative Strength Index:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Despite the sideways price action, the </span><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">weekly-RSI slope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows apparent growth, which undermines the underlying strength of a price trend. This bullish divergence shows a higher possibility for price recovery from $210 support.</span></p>
<p><b>EMAs:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The 200-weekly EMA is moving near the $210 mark, strengthening the support power of this level. However, the other EMAs(20, 50, 100) will pose significant resistance to a potential rally.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Coin</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Price Intraday Levels</span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spot rate: $258.2</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trend: Bullish </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volatility: Low</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Resistance level- $300 and $340</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Support level- $255 and $210-$20</span></li>

What seems to be a component of a broader potential exploit or a technical flaw, Balancer has been prescribing ways to eliminate it.</p>
<h2>Balancer Under Damage Control</h2>
<p>On January 6, at 2:03 a.m. UTC, Balancer took to Twitter in order to make an announcement regarding an &#8220;issue&#8221; with the platform&#8217;s liquidity pools. In order to alleviate the problem, the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/defi-decentralized-finance/#:~:text=Decentralized%20finance%20(DeFi)%20is%20a,exchanges%2C%20and%20other%20centralized%20entities.">DeFi application</a> stated that the protocol fees had been set to zero, and that additional information would be publicly provided in the near future. However, the team also emphasized the fact that this particular strategy would not be effective in mitigating all of the implications of the mystery problem.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">IMPORTANT: Because of a related issue, LPs of the following pools should remove their liquidity ASAP as the issue cannot be mitigated by the emergency DAO. <a href="https://t.co/WcBeBvjdY2">https://t.co/WcBeBvjdY2</a></p>

<h2>Balancer&#8217;s Affected Pools</h2>
<p>Balancer provided a list of the pools that need to have funds withdrawn from them. These pools include DOLA / bb-a-USD on Ethereum, It&#8217;s MAI life and Smells Like Spartan Spirit on Optimism, and Tenacious Dollar on <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/fantom/">Fantom</a>. Out of which, the DOLA / bb-a-USD pool currently manages $3.6 million worth of assets, making it the largest of the three pools.</p>
<p>The Balancer token is an <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a>-based asset that serves as the driving force behind the Balancer protocol, an automated market maker that gives anybody the ability to build or add <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/liquidity/">liquidity</a> to trading pools while earning customizable trading fees.</p>
<p>As things stand, the price of Balancer (BAL) is currently being traded at $5.35. This represents an increase of 1.17% in the past 1 hour, in contrast to its 1.19% drop during the last 24 hours, as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>

This was a decrease from the previously reported 263,000 jobs in November and was above the 200,000 jobs that were predicted by economists. In contrast to predictions that it would remain unchanged at 3.7%, the unemployment rate came in at 3.5%.</p>
<h2>Signs Of No Recession Yet?</h2>
<p>Even while economists, CEOs, and others have been discussing a possible recession, the new data confirm that there isn&#8217;t one just yet. Besides employment numbers, other economic indicators, such as consumer spending, also indicate that the United States economy is not in a recession. Despite the fact that the <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/federal-reserve-system/">Federal Reserve</a> began raising <a href="https://coingape.com/us-fed-raises-interest-rates-by-75-bps/">interest rates</a> in March of last year at a pace not seen since the 1980s, the labor market has continued to be resilient and robust.</p>

<p>In addition, data regarding job openings were also provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as part of the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS). According to the most recent data, the number of job opportunities in the United States in November was 10.5 million, which is comparable to the revised number of job openings in October. And the preliminary numbers for the layoff rate in November showed that it remained at 0.9% for the third month in a row, which is close to the record low.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Reaction</h2>
<p>In minutes that followed the release of the unemployment news, the price of Bitcoin (BTC) remained unchanged at $16,750. With the headline number of 223,000 new jobs gained, the <a href="https://coingape.com/markets">crypto market</a> rebounded into the green zone in the past one hour, as per crypto market tracker <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">CoinMarketCap</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, both <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ethereum/">Ethereum</a> have seen a considerable increase in price over the past 30 minutes, with Bitcoin showing a rise of 0.30% and Ethereum showing an increase of 0.60%. The price of XRP, DOGE, and BNB, along with a few of the other prominent <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrencies</a>, all rose in response to the news.</p>

The price volatility in BTC died down since the second half of December 2022, after so many unexpected events surrounding the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx-collapse/">FTX collapse</a>. While the Terra collapse played a major role in defining the 2022 bear market, FTX bankruptcy had only worsened the weakening market sentiment. To add to this, the macroeconomic scene failed to improve at year end thanks to the Fed&#8217;s decision to continue rising rates in 2023.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Whales Preparing For A Short Rally?</h2>
<p>In this context, a series of huge whale transactions came up in the last few days. This comes as a surprise considering the current market scenario. According to <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://cryptoquant.com/quicktake/63b7e1d0c694b7554b16393c-Four-remarkable-transactions-from-last-week" rel="nofollow">Crypto Quant</a> data, there were four of these big asset transfers in the space of just the first week of January. This makes a case for potentially more of these big transfers in the coming weeks before a short bull run.</p>
<p>More importantly, all of these transactions were associated with assets that stayed dormant for quite some time now. The biggest of these transfers occurred on January 5, 2023, when 15,480 BTC was transferred. These assets were held in the wallet with no activity between three to five years. In three other transactions around the same date, transactions of 3,001 BTC, 4,614 BTC and 5,208 BTC were made.</p>

<h2>BTC Price Breakout</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin price failed to break the key resistance at $17,000 in the last few weeks. Since December 17, 2022, the BTC price has been hovering at around $16,900 level. As of writing, BTC price stands at $16,756, down 0.25% in the last 24 hours, according to price tracking platform CoinMarketCap.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On December 30th, the <a href="https://coingape.com/bitcoin-price-today-6-jan-2023-btc-drops-0-20-silvergate-shares-plunge/">Bitcoin price</a> rebounded from the local support of $16300. Amid the recent new year recovery in the crypto market, the Bitcoin price has witnessed a steady recovery since last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bullish recovery registered a 3.7% jump and challenged the overhead barrier of $17000-$16980. Thus, the aforementioned level has created a narrow range, and Bitcoin price has been trapped within it for the past three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/y/Yh583vak.png" alt="Bitcoin price prediction" width="1946" height="1105" />Source- Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, today the BTC price is down 0.63% and shows the formation of an evening star candle pattern at $17000. This bearish reversal candle pattern appearing at a know resistance indicates a higher possibility for upcoming downfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, with sustained selling, the Bitcoin market value may drop 2.35% down from its current price of $16735 and entrap it within the narrow range for a few more trading sessions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Bitcoin, the <a href="https://coingape.com/ethereum-eth-price-2000-whale-activity-grows/">Ethereum price</a> shows higher bullish strength as it breached a significant resistance zone of $1220-$1230 on January 4th. However, the altcoin has been going through a minor pullback in the last two days and retested the breached resistance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Ethereum price currently trades at $1244 with an intraday loss of 0.56%. Thus, if the coin sustains above the $1230 mark, the buyers should drive the prices 8.5% higher to hit the $1350 barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img decoding="async" class="alignnone" src="https://s3.tradingview.com/snapshots/u/UNrqWwu5.png" alt="Ethereum price prediction" width="1946" height="1105" />Source-Tradingview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conversely, if the crypto market remains uncertain, a daily candle closing below $1220 will undermine the bullish thesis and plunge the ETH price back to $1160.</span></p>

This gives Binance an opportunity to re-enter the South Korean crypto market. However, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FTX</a> and Genesis contagion has affected the Binance-Gopax deal.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Gopax</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> needs to repay about $47 million to customers of its wealth management product </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">GoFi and failing to reach the deal will make investors suffer massive losses.</span></p>
<h2>Binance and Gopax Deal Suffers Obstacle</h2>
<p>On Monday, <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-binance-to-re-enter-south-korea-market-with-latest-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binance completed due diligence</a> on the acquisition of Gopax as it plans to enter <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/south-korea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Korea</a>. Moreover, the acquisition deal has reached the final stage as Binance looks to buy a majority stake from CEO Lee Jun-haeng, who has a 41.2% stake in Gopax.</p>
<p>Binance is discussing the acquisition of Gopax on the premise of GoFi repayment support. An employee of Binance said that the acquisition of Gopax has not been decided, <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://it.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2023/01/06/2023010601630.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> local media Chosun on January 6. In fact, industry experts believe the deal may not happen until issues related to Genesis resolve.</p>
<h2>How Genesis Contagion Reached Gopax</h2>
<p>Following the collapse of FTX, crypto lender <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis</a> halts repayments, withdrawals, and new loan originations. Crypto exchange Gopax&#8217;s GoFi earn product, which is linked to Genesis, has also suffered withdrawal issues.</p>
<p>Genesis&#8217; parent DCG is the second-largest shareholder of Gopax. Therefore, Gopax said it is communicating closely with Genesis and its parent DCG to resolve the repayment issues. The situation continued to deteriorate as Genesis links to FTX and Alameda Research surfaced.</p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">The possibility of Genesis returning the GoFi funds is low. In fact, Gopax</span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> needs to repay about $47 million to customers of its wealth management product </span><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-b88u0q r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">GOFi. It was earlier expected to be around $23 million, but recent reports have revealed that amount is almost double.</span></p>
<p>Considering all crypto market changes since the repayment suspension on November 16, the industry expects the lowest estimate to be around $40 million. The size of the acquisition is expected to be equal to or exceed the total repayment amount of GoFi.</p>
<p>If the deal with Binance fails, investors could lose millions and confidence in the crypto market. The Terra-LUNA crisis has severely impacted South Korean investors.</p>

Since this announcement, Huobi’s native crypto price has dropped by around 12% in the last 24 hours. However, data depicts that Justin Sun is moving huge amounts of funds amid this drop.</p>
<h2>Justin Sun moving  stablecoins amid FUD</h2>
<p>As per whaleAlert, a wallet <a rel='nofollow'  rel="nofollow noopener" href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1611278338651209728" target="_blank">address linked to Justin Sun</a> has moved $100 million worth of USDC and USDT tokens to some unknown wallet. He moved $50.027 worth of USDT to another wallet. While the same amount of USDT tokens was sent to Justin earlier.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that around $100 million worth of USDT and USDC were transferred from the Binance, crypto exchange to Huobi Global&#8217;s shadow owner in multiple transactions. Earlier, Justin Sun moved around $50 million worth of $50 million worth of USDT to Binance.</p>
<p>The tracker further noted that $100 million worth of USDC and USDT tokens were moved from an unknown wallet to Huobi, crypto exchange.</p>
<p>These huge transactions have been recorded when Huobi&#8217;s token and TRON (TRX) token is on a drop. Earlier, Coingape reported that TRON’s stablecoin <a href="https://coingape.com/justin-sun-usdd-depegs-trx-drops-by-8-heres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USDD is de-pegging heavily</a> and might collapse ahead due to uncertainty.</p>
<p>Reports suggest that he will shut down 1,100 staff Huobi China HQ in order to re contracting all China employees.</p>

The Blockchain Association of Singapore, a main crypto lobby group has opposed this proposal claiming it to be “overly restrictive.” They also disagreed about the proposal of a complete ban on crypto firms extending incentives to the retailer and called it “too draconian.”</p>
<p>About lending tokens, they argued that such decision will force the retailers to get funds from the crypto firms that are unregulated, as stated in the 11-page long feedback submitted by the group to the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/monetary-authority-of-singapore/">Monetary Authority of Singapore,</a> in the later stages of December.</p>
<h2>The Blockchain Association of Singapore’s disagreement</h2>
<p>Singapore came up with many more proposals to protect retailers from the unpredictable crypto market. They also called for the restriction of crypto firms in lending or putting their coins to increase yield. Individuals won’t be able to take loans for purchasing tokens if the law passes. However, the association, stated that lending tokens can get money for customers. The interesting part about digital payment tokens is the interest rates on them.</p>

<p>The association, however, agreed that there should be certain restrictions on individuals lending money from firms to purchase <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/cryptocurrency-5/">cryptocurrency</a>. It also suggested that instead of banning incentives by retail firms it should be regulated. It can be shaped to giving “gifts that are not linked to financial purchases.”</p>
<p>Chia Hock Lai, the chairman of the association said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“We are proposing a more measured and targeted approach, including doubling on educating consumers on the risks of dealing with unregulated entities and increasing enforcement activities on those engaging in regulated activities without the requisite regulatory approvals,”</p></blockquote>
<p>while speaking with Bloomberg.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The proposed measures, while well-intended, might have unintended consequences if implemented in its entirety, including leading consumers to move towards unregulated service providers,”</p></blockquote>
<p>added Lai.</p>
<h2>What led to proposing such regulations?</h2>
<p>Last year Singapore saw its city-state company <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/three-arrows-capital/">The Three Arrows Hedge fund</a> collapse. It was one of the largest hedge funds to go under. The proposal came following this. Later FTX collapsed and there have been serious questions raised about the regulations of cryptocurrencies.</p>

Today, Justin Sun <a href="https://coingape.com/breaking-justin-sun-confirms-20-of-staff-layoff-at-huobi/">confirmed</a> that Huobi will be laying off 20% of its staff.</p>
<p>Top withdrawals from Huobi are mainly in USDT, USDC, ETH from wallets with high balances.</p>
<h2>Reports of internal conflict at Huobi surface</h2>
<p>Earlier today <a href="https://coingape.com/huobi-token-falls-after-reports-of-internal-conflicts-surface/">reports</a> of internal strife at the Chinese crypto exchange surfaced on Twitter. Huobi reportedly blocked internal communication groups to curb rebellion. Later, Justin Sun confirmed to Reuters that Huobi will lay off 20% of its staff.</p>
<p>Blockchain analytics firm Nansen reported that $60.9 million of the $94.2 million net outflow in the past week occurred in the past day alone. The news of massive withdrawals also coincided with <a href="https://coingape.com/silvergate-stock-crashes-reports-decline-crypto-deposits/">Silvergate Capital’s shares</a> tanking last night. Silvergate Capital had massive exposure to FTX and had to sell $5.2 billion of debt securities at a $718 million loss to enable withdrawals.</p>

<h2>Justin Sun tries to reassure customers</h2>
<p>After news of Huobi laying off 20% of its staff broke, Justin Sun took to twitter to reassure the customers about the exchange’s future. Sun <a rel='nofollow'  href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1611297498588663810">tweeted</a> that as a leading cryptocurrency exchange, their strategy is to stay focused on the long-term and not get swayed by short-term distractions. In an attempt to reassure investors, Justin said they are heavily investing in technology to provide a trusted and reliable platform to their customers.</p>
<p>Justin Sun’s Tron’s stablecoin USDD also started to <a href="https://coingape.com/justin-sun-usdd-depegs-trx-drops-by-8-heres-why/">depeg</a> today as it reached as low as $0.9754. Huobi Token also fell as much as 12% today.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">In conclusion, at Huobi, our strategy is to &quot;Ignore FUD and Keep Building.&quot; By staying true to our mission, investing in technology and security, listening to our users, we&#39;re able to provide a trusted and reliable platform for our users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrency.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img width="1200" height="800" src="https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/06165004/AIRDROP.jpg" class="attachment-full size-full wp-post-image" alt="Flare Token" decoding="async" style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;" loading="lazy" /><p>Bitget will now support the <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/xrp-holders-to-get-flare-token-airdrop/">Flare (FLR) token</a></strong> airdrop. However, it is now among the cryptocurrency exchanges that will do so. Users who held the XRP token at the time of the snapshot, which occurred approximately two years ago, will be able to obtain their tokens.</p>
<p>FLR is a flexible token that adds value to both the network and the currency. The FLR token, for instance, can be utilized for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate within Governance</li>
<li> Collateral</li>
<li>Transaction Fees</li>
</ul>
<p>The initial FLR distribution process would remain the same: The first 15% of FLR tokens will be given out to existing airdrop recipients. However, the remaining 85% of tokens will be distributed in 36 monthly installments. This is equivalent to 4,278,738,205 FLR. The Flare tokens will be distributed to each <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XRP</a></strong> holder in a 1:1 ratio. However, users will only receive 15% of the total number of FLR tokens available to them in this airdrop.</p>
<h2>Flare token is supported by Coinbase</h2>
<p>The largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, Coinbase, also added FLR support earlier this month. In addition to Bitfinex and Kraken, other well-known cryptocurrency trading platforms include Bitstamp, Bitrue, Okcoin, and <strong><a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin</a></strong>.</p>
<p>A recent announcement states that the Flare Token Distribution Event (TDE) will now occur on January 9. According to the project, the support from the major trading stages that agreed to give their users access to the FLR token has been &#8220;excellent.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Flare Network is a brand-new, extremely sophisticated blockchain technology. However, that aims to increase the functionality and usefulness of the <a href="https://coingape.com/blog/what-is-ethereum-virtual-machine-and-how-does-it-work/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a> (EVM). Bringing secure, <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps/">decentralized</a> smart contracts to other protocols like Ripple and Litecoin is the fundamental objective of Flare Network. These public blockchain projects now have a lot of room to grow.</p>

<p>The implosion of <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/ftx/">FTX</a> and the arrest of its former CEO, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sbf/">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the dust of it hasn’t settled yet. Major firms have been hit by the event in the first few days of 2023. The companies that showed the results of this hit are <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/genesis-global/">Genesis Global</a> and Silvergate Bank.</p>
<h2>Silvergate shares fall</h2>
<p>On Thursday, Silvergate, a bank focused on crypto, recorded a massive fall of over 40%  in its shares in just few hours. The bank published its preliminary report of the last quarter of 2022, which showed that 8 billion USD worth of crypto had been withdrawn as customers suffered the spook of FTX collapse. It has also decided to lay off its 200 employees which accounts for 40% of the workforce.</p>
<p>A U.S Attorney said to the court on Wednesday, that the accounts of Silvergate and Framington State Bank which does business as a moonstone bank, have been seized. They held about 143 million USD and are affiliated with FTX Digital Markets.</p>

<h2>Genesis plans on cutting off more employees</h2>
<p>Genesis Global which offers loans to financial institutions has also decided to layoff its 30% of its employees. Earlier in November, the firm stopped giving loans and withdrawals by customers citing the extreme market condition caused by the implosion of FTX.</p>
<p>Crypto exchange Gemini has a partnership with Genesis for a crypto lending product. They have been saying Genesis to find a solution before the firm is forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy similar to FTX.</p>
<h2>Huobi Confirms 20% Layoff</h2>
<p>Since the collapse of FTX, <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/huobi/">Huobi</a> is seeing a massive downfall in its trading volume. The news forced more investors to take out their money, which has now ultimately led to layoffs at Huobi. Earlier there had been reports about Huobi forcing its employees to accept salary in USDC/UDTC rather than <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/fiat-money/">fiat currency</a>, a denial to this which could get the employees fired.</p>

<h2>Alex Mahinsky faces lawsuit</h2>
<p>The crypto billionaire, Alex Mahinsky, founder and former CEO of <a href="https://coingape.com/glossary/celsius-2/">Celsius Network</a> was slapped with a new lawsuit on Wednesday by New York Attorney Generals. When Mahinsky was the CEO in 2021-2022, his company offered loans of billions of dollars to Alameda research, as per the lawsuit. It asks to stop him from running any business in New York. He is accused of fooling customers about the status of its now bankrupt company.</p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried pleaded non-guilty, last Tuesday in court. He is facing 8 financial crime charges against him by the <a href="https://coingape.com/tag/sec/">U.S. SEC</a>. He is accused of transferring funds from FTX to his other company Alameda Research and of looting customers.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Founder of defunct crypto exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried has filed a motion seeking to block FTX debtors from taking control of his 56 million Robinhood shares.

Earlier, US prosecutors announced to seize those Robinhood shares worth $450 million.</p>
<p>FTX co-founder SBF, who is currently under<a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-founder-sbf-released-on-250-mn-bond-placed-under-house-arrest/"> house arrest</a>, has argued in a court filing that Robinhood shares do not belong to any of the FTX-related entities.</p>
<h2>SBF needs money to fund his legal expenses, lawyers argue</h2>
<p>SBF’s lawyers have argued in the court filing on Thursday that their client needs the money to fund his legal expenses. FTX and its trading arm Alameda Research are currently under court-appointed liquidators that are seeking any assets they can find to repay FTX customers and investors.</p>
<p>Earlier, a US Department of Justice prosecutor said in a <a href="https://coingape.com/us-prosecutors-to-seize-460m-robinhood-shares-linked-to-bankrupt-ftx/">court hearing</a> that they are moving ahead to seize SBF’s stake worth $450 million. What DoJ plans to do with Robinhood shares will be decided in a future hearing.</p>
<h2>FTX investors and customers seek claim on Robinhood shares</h2>
<p>BlockFi, a crypto lending firm that FTX promised to bail out with a $250 million agreement, filed for bankruptcy. BlockFi had massive exposure to the failed crypto exchange. The crypto leading firm sought claims on SBF’s Robinhood shares in its bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>Earlier, FTX customers also filed a <a href="https://coingape.com/ftx-sbf-faces-class-action-lawsuit-last-chance-for-user/">class action lawsuit</a> against the exchange and SBF, alleging they deserve all the assets that are left with FTX. In its bankruptcy filing, FTX had revealed that it has over 1 million creditors.</p>
