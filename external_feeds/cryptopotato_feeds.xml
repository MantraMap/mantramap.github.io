			            <description><![CDATA[Grogan's good deed received a wave of positive comments, with some calling him a "hero."]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conor Grogan &#8211; the head of product at Coinbase &#8211; said he found $322,000 worth of digital assets that belonged to a person who was unaware of that since the funds were transferred after Ethereum&#8217;s hard fork in 2016.</p>
<p>The executive discovered that the owner of the crypto stash had previously become a victim of hackers who drained their entire life savings.</p>
<h2>Lucky Day for Numerous Investors Thanks to Grogan</h2>
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s director <a href="https://twitter.com/jconorgrogan/status/1676689354071199744" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">announced</a> on Twitter that he had tracked down &#8220;6+ figures&#8221; for people who have forgotten they have funds onchain or have not realized they were awarded some tokens via airdrops.</p>
<p>One reason individuals might have been sitting on substantial sums without knowing is Ethereum&#8217;s hard forking event in 2016 when the protocol split into Ethereum Classic (with a native token ETC) and Ethereum ((ETH).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;ETH forked in 2016; if you held a balance, you would get credited 1:1 the ETC. My thesis is that many people are not aware that they were in the snapshot,&#8221; Grogan explained.</p></blockquote>
<p>Twitter user Griff Green is one such person who had 23 ETH but never knew of their existence. Due to ether&#8217;s price appreciation over the years, the stash is currently worth almost $45,000 (7,400% more than the $600 at the time).</p>
<p>Grogan&#8217;s biggest discovery was an account that held over $320,000 worth of ETC. While finding the owner was no easy task, he stumbled upon &#8220;one unique coin&#8221; called EOSDAC. The token was airdropped on Ethereum to EOS holders in 2018, helping Grogan to connect the dots and discover the lucky person.</p>
<p>It seems fate has finally smiled on the latter, considering they have fallen prey to a hacker in 2019, resulting in all life savings lost. Apart from that, the individual was involved in a legal battle with the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.</p>
<p>Grogan posted a screenshot of the conversation between him and the person in question, revealing that the latter had no idea about the existence of those assets.</p>
<p>Numerous Twitter users commented below the post, highlighting Grogan&#8217;s act. Binance&#8217;s Chief Strategy Officer &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/PRHillmann/status/1676811707132289025" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Patrick Hillmann</a> &#8211; was among them.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Classic: the Original Form of Ethereum</h2>
<p>Ethereum Classic is an open-source, decentralized cryptocurrency platform that runs smart contracts. Despite being less popular than Ethereum, it is considered by some the original version of the blockchain protocol.</p>
<p>It was formed in 2016 as a result of a massive attack known as &#8220;The DAO hack.&#8221; The DAO, which was a decentralized venture fund used by Ethereum investors, amassed at one point over 11 million ETH. However, hackers found cracks and siphoned approximately a third of those assets.</p>
<p>Most DAO members wanted to restore the stolen funds to investors, but not all agreed. This led to the split of Ethereum Classic (according to which &#8220;Code is Law&#8221;) and Ethereum.</p>
<p>The former has a native token called ETC, which is a no-match to ETH but has been on a roll lately. It currently hovers around $20, whereas its market capitalization is less than $3 billion (per CoinGecko data).</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price and the successful breakout above the significant $30K resistance level, the market is now undergoing a period of consolidation. However, noteworthy signals are emerging during this phase.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>The Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>On the daily chart, the price has repeatedly tested the $30K level since breaking above it recently. While this level has provided support so far, there are concerning indications in the form of a bearish divergence seen in the RSI indicator.</p>
<p>This suggests the possibility of a correction or reversal in the near term. Should a decline occur, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages at approximately $28K and $26K marks, respectively, could act as significant support levels.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the price continues its upward momentum, a move toward the $38K resistance zone becomes a plausible scenario.</p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Chart:</h3>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the price has displayed erratic and unpredictable movements in recent weeks, making it difficult to determine its future direction. The $30K level is being tested once again, and a potential breakdown could result in a decline toward the $27,500 level.</p>
<p>The RSI indicator has been relatively flat, hovering around the 50% mark, suggesting a lack of clear dominance from buyers or sellers. The ongoing battle near the critical $30K area further reinforces the short-term uncertainty in the market.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p>By: Edris</p>
<h3>Bitcoin Exchange Reserve</h3>
<p>The recent upward movement in Bitcoin&#8217;s price has sparked discussions regarding whether market participants are selling their coins for minimal profit or opting to hold onto them longer.</p>
<p>By analyzing the Bitcoin exchange reserve metric, which tracks the amount of BTC held in exchange wallets, we can gain insights into investor behavior. An increase in this metric indicates that investors are depositing their coins onto exchanges, likely intending to sell them. Conversely, a decrease suggests that investors are withdrawing their BTC from exchanges, indicating a preference to hold onto their coins for an extended period.</p>
<p>Recent data shows a significant decline in the Bitcoin exchange reserve metric over the past month. This decline suggests a bullish sentiment among market participants, as they anticipate further price increases and are inclined to hold onto their coins.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[BTC peaked less than two years following the previous two halvings, will history repeat again after the fourth one?]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With less than a year remaining until Bitcoin&#8217;s fourth ever halving, speculation has already begun on whether this one will be followed by the same or similar bull runs as the previous ones.</p>
<p>In-depth data shows that the asset&#8217;s price performance has been rather identical before and after the last two such events.</p>
<h2>The Halving Effect</h2>
<p>Upon creating the network, the anonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto incorporated an event called the halving, which occurs every 210,000 blocks (appr. every four years) and slashes the rewards miners receive in half to slow down the speed at which new BTC is being created.</p>
<p>Due to basic economic factors, these events have had positive effects on the asset&#8217;s price performance, as the valuation rises, at least in theory, when the supply slows down while the demand remains the same or increases.</p>
<p>As such, each of the past three halvings has been followed by price runs. The last one was in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/the-2020-bitcoin-halving-is-finally-here-as-block-number-630000-mined/" data-wpel-link="internal">mid-May 2020</a>, and BTC started a notable bull cycle in the next year and a half, which resulted in an ATH marked in November 2021 at $69,000. The situation was similar after the 2016 halving, as the then-ATH came in December 2017 (almost $20,000.)</p>

<p>As the graph above demonstrates, the asset&#8217;s performance has been rather identical before and after the last two halvings. It all starts with a 1.5-2 year bull cycle, followed by massive corrections and sideways trading. According to these stats, BTC has already bottomed after the near-400-day bear market, which culminated last year when it dumped below $16,000.</p>
<h2>Will History Repeat?</h2>
<p>All financial gurus will rush to tell you that past performances should not be indicative of future ones. A recent Coinbase <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-halving-effect-on-assets-behavior-still-unclear-coinbase/" data-wpel-link="internal">report</a> claimed the same, stating that the effects of the upcoming halving are still unclear, mainly due to macroeconomic factors and regulatory uncertainty.</p>
<p>However, there were similar <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/why-the-2020-bitcoin-halving-is-different-and-might-disappoint-price-spike-expectations-like-in-2012-2016/" data-wpel-link="internal">reports</a> before the 2020 halving, claiming that the asset&#8217;s valuation was already priced in and that investors shouldn&#8217;t expect any fireworks, which wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&#8217;s still hard to predict BTC&#8217;s future performance, after all, even the highly-popular AI chatbot ChatGPT <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-predicts-what-will-happen-with-btcs-price-during-and-after-the-2024-bitcoin-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">refrained</a> from doing so recently.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The US regulator believes Coinbase is trying to ignore the Howey test, used to determine which assets are classified as securities.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a response to Coinbase&#8217;s recent filing, in which it claims that the exchange made a &#8220;calculated decision&#8221; to act as an unregistered securities intermediary.</p>
<p>The company filed to dismiss the SEC&#8217;s charges back in June.</p>
<ul>
<li>The agency launched a full-on legal operation against two of the behemoths of the crypto industry in early June when it filed consecutive lawsuits against Binance (and its US affiliate) as well as <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/us-sec-files-a-lawsuit-against-coinbase-day-after-suing-binance/" data-wpel-link="internal">Coinbase</a>.</li>
<li>The latter responded swiftly by <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-files-request-for-dismissal-of-charges/" data-wpel-link="internal">filing a request</a> to dismiss all charges just a few weeks after the lawsuit.</li>
<li>In it, the exchange argued that the SEC had already greenlighted its business model back in 2021 when it allowed Coinbase to become a publicly-traded company.</li>
<li>The company has reiterated multiple times its attempts to open positive regulatory dialogues with the US watchdogs, but to no avail so far. It even asked the SEC to provide more clarity on its regulatory policies toward cryptocurrencies, but the agency is <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/sec-responds-to-coinbase-request-for-crypto-clarity-wants-more-time/" data-wpel-link="internal">yet to respond</a>.</li>
<li>However, the SEC responded to Coinbase&#8217;s request to dismiss the charges on Friday, July 7. The <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.26.0.pdf" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">filing </a>reads that &#8220;Coinbase&#8217;s own actions belie&#8221; its argument &#8220;it was unaware that its conduct risked violating the federal securities laws.&#8221;</li>
<li>The Commission further claims that the exchange has warned its shareholders &#8220;repeatedly&#8221; since getting listed on NASDAQ of the risk that &#8220;the crypto assets traded on its platform could be deemed securities and therefore that its conduct could violate the federal securities laws &#8211; including in the very registration statement it now points to as proof that the SEC supposedly blessed its conduct.&#8221;</li>
<li>The filing also reads that Coinbase has decided to ignore &#8220;more than 75 years of controlling law under Howey,&#8221; and hade made two &#8220;flawed arguments&#8221; in its request for dismissal:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;(1) An investment contract must be or include a formal, common law contract, or (2) even if a crypto asset is considered an investment contract when it is first offered and sold by an issuer, that same asset cannot be an investment contract when traded between non-issuers on a platform like Coinbase&#8217;s because secondary market transactions not involving its issuer are merely &#8220;asset sales.&#8221; Both arguments are wrong,&#8221; said the SEC.</p></blockquote>

			            <description><![CDATA[US investors are leaping into Bitcoin as more of its supply gets sucked away by long-term holders.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin (BTC)’s performance this year is modeling that of previous 4-year market cycles, signaling the early innings of another potential bull market, according to market analysis firm Reflexivity Research.</p>
<p>The firm published a report this week exploring drivers behind the asset’s strong performance in Q2, examining both market structure and on-chain data.</p>
<h2>Who Is Buying Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>As the <a href="https://docsend.com/view/zrnp62r2r2qjiyzy" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a> states, Bitcoin’s present tailwind to two critical events this year: the banking crisis surrounding Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in March and BlackRock’s filing for a Bitcoin Spot ETF in June.</p>
<p>Each event has “unequally benefitted digital gold relative to other digital assets in the market,” the report stated. Bitcoin now comprises over 50% of crypto’s total market cap, with bulls like Michael Saylor <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/michael-saylor-thinks-the-sec-crackdown-could-boost-bitcoins-dominance-to-80/" data-wpel-link="internal">predicting</a> greater highs as regulatory crackdowns drive capital away from altcoins.</p>
<p>Outsized interest in Bitcoin is visible in the futures market, where Bitcoin perpetual futures are “clearly diverging away” from Ether perpetual futures.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259390" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259390" style="width: 978px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-259390 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-161948.png" alt="" width="978" height="535" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-161948.png 978w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-161948-300x164.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-161948-768x420.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Screenshot-2023-07-07-161948-50x27.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 978px) 100vw, 978px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259390" class="wp-caption-text">Bitcoin Perpetual Futures VS Ether Perpetual Futures. Source: Glassnode</figcaption></figure>
<p>Rising interest in Bitcoin seems to be coming out of the United States in particular, where BlackRock’s latest filing could make for the nation’s first official Bitcoin spot ETF. The report notes that most of Bitcoin’s performance has taken place during US trading hours since the asset manager’s submission.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Bitcoin CME futures open interest has risen by $1 billion since the filing, further indicating higher activity among US firms.</p>
<h2>A Look on Chain</h2>
<p>Regarding network data, the researchers highlighted Ordinals as a “space to keep an eye on over the coming quarters.” The number of total Ordinals inscriptions now nears 15 million, having raised an additional $56 million in fees for miners to date.</p>
<p>The number of Bitcoin addresses holding over 1 BTC crossed 1 million for the first time ever this quarter, and the network settled roughly $2 trillion in transactions during that time.</p>
<p>Reflecting the finding of other firms, including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-shrimps-are-stacking-their-hardest-since-2017-glassnode/" data-wpel-link="internal">Glassnode</a> and Santiment, Reflexivity said Bitcoin’s supply held by long-term holders is now relatively high, meaning market participants aren’t planning to sell their coins anytime soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Should some of these ETFs get approved, the effects of newfound demand with a near record low available supply could be quite powerful,” the firm wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, a black swan event is still in the cards, “[It] appears to be early innings for this current bull cycle, with the possibility of retesting cycle lows similar to March of 2020 still there,” the report concluded.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; London, United Kingdom, July 8th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>Aptius Ltd, a British financial enterprise, has developed a new cryptocurrency called <a href="https://britanniacoin.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">BritanniaCoin</a> which will be available for pre-sale from June 18th onwards, ahead of its launch later this year. BritanniaCoin is a British-built blockchain that introduces real-world applications while honoring British cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The pre-release contains 316,000 coins for sale, fixed at 6 USD per coin, in honor of the official unification of England and Scotland in 1707, 316 years ago. The pre-release presents an opportunity to purchase BritanniaCoin before its launch on exchanges at 8 USD per coin. BritanniaCoin is also launching a software wallet for the public, downloadable on the Apple App Store and Google Play. As part of BritanniaCoin&#8217;s commitment to charitable causes, 10% of the proceeds from the pre-sale will be donated to charity, as listed on the BritanniaCoin website.</p>
<p>During its pre-sale this summer, BritanniaCoin intends to give away 125,000 coins. BritanniaCoin is 100% self-funded and developed with no silent partners, as detailed in the <a href="https://britanniacoin.org/static/media/whitepaper.b21ed6c65d64a6125d2f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">white paper</a>. These initiatives aim to foster an ecosystem that represents British values, integrates historic cultural legacy with technological innovation, and supports charitable organizations such as Hearts of Gold to improve the lives of vulnerable people.</p>
<p>BritanniaCoin introduces a proprietary blockchain with zero fees and a 20% faster block confirmation time than Bitcoin.</p>
<p>After the 1st round pre-release for commercial customers started in September 2022, BritanniaCoin launched its own bespoke hardware infrastructure. This hardware wallet platform intends to facilitate customer security, anonymity, and technological innovation. This exclusive hardware wallet is currently available to private investors and commercial clients who get in touch via their website. Moreover, the prospect of providing customers of the planned NFT project with access to hardware wallets in the future is something that is currently being considered. Following the completion of its 2nd stage ICO, BritanniaCoin intends to center its blockchain ecosystem, brand identity, and community on this hardware technology basis.</p>
<p>BritanniaCoin pursues multiple long-term goals, including expanding its community and improving the user experience. In addition, BritanniaCoin has its own British-themed NFT project that provides holders unique advantages, offering access to airdrops, special discounts, voting rights, an active role in selecting which charity institutions to support and signature events, such as their recent pre-release party held at the East India Club.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify"><img src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-05-09_23-45-30_16836723471Rfvtay6eK-1024x768.jpg" /></p>
<p>In the aftermath of the ICO, BritanniaCoin intends to launch BritanniaPay, consisting of their software wallet compatible with iOS and Android and connected with the company&#8217;s current hardware wallet network. BritanniaPay is an innovative new initiative that prioritizes British brands and businesses by integrating blockchain technology into its own payment system. Users can pay for their purchases at various UK and international retailers with BritanniaCoin alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum and other established cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>BritanniaCoin unites a diverse <a href="https://britanniacoin.org/About#Team" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">team</a>, as the Co-founder and CEO Daniel M. Ashworth brings over five years of experience in the cryptocurrency sector and co-founded Aptius in 2018, a Crypto and Forex trading company.

			            <description><![CDATA[A few tokens of the Shiba Inu ecosystem have jumped impressively in the past 24 hours.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Similar to previous weekends, bitcoin has calmed and failed to produce any substantial volatility in either direction during the weekend as the trading volumes have declined.</p>
<p>Most altcoins are with insignificant daily increases and decreases, aside from BONE, INJ, and SHIB.</p>
<h2>BTC Stalls at $30K</h2>
<p>After the previous calm weekend, bitcoin finally went on the offensive on Tuesday but was stopped in its tracks at just over $31,000. The subsequent rejection drove it south down to $30,200, but the bulls stepped up on the gas once more on Thursday.</p>
<p>This time, they managed to propel a more impressive price surge that drove BTC to $31,500, which became its highest price tag in over a year. Yet, the cryptocurrency failed there and fell even harder, this time to under $30,000.</p>
<p>It managed to bounce off ahead of the weekend and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-defends-30k-after-blackrock-refiled-its-spot-bitcoin-etf-application-this-weeks-crypto-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">reclaimed</a> the coveted round-numbered milestone of $30,000. With the declining trading volumes on Saturday and Sunday, the asset has <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/solana-sol-shoots-up-12-daily-bitcoin-btc-maintains-30k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">remained</a> just inches above that level as of now.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization is just shy of $590 billion, and its dominance over the altcoins has remained the same over the past 48 hours at 49.9% on CMC.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259493" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259493" style="width: 1835px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD-9.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-259493" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTCUSD-9.png" alt="BTCUSD.

<h2>BONE Enters Top 100</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s flagship cryptocurrency has jumped the most from the top 50 altcoins, having gained 4% on a daily scale. However, it&#8217;s not just SHIB. Another token from the project&#8217;s ecosystem &#8211; Bone ShibaSwap &#8211; has soared by 6% in a day and 50% weekly. As a result, BONE has entered the top 100 largest alts by market cap.</p>
<p>AVAX, TRX, ETH, DOGE, ADA, and XRP are also slightly in the green from the larger-cap altcoins, while BNB, SOL, DOT, BCH, and LTC have posted minor price drops.</p>
<p>Aave has declined the most (-6%), while INJ has added 5% and trades well above $8.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meme coin season is well underway and shows no sign of slowing down. With coins like Pepe showing huge price growth over the last few months, new coins continue to surge each week. The likes of Pepe 2.0 and Shib 2.0 are two of the most recent examples, with both having exploded over the last week.</p>
<p>Another newcomer that’s gained considerable investor attention is <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=wall-street-memes-raises-13-million-in-presale-traders-think-it-could-be-the-next-pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a> is a new community-focused meme coin that’s currently on presale. Despite intense competition among meme coins, it has raised over $13 million in just a couple of months, highlighting its strong community backing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wallstmemes.com/assets/documents/Whitepaper.pdf" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes whitepaper</a> highlights the potential of memes to bind people and challenge established norms.</p>
<p>It also expands on how Wall Street Memes can offer financial empowerment amid a world preaching &#8216;greed is good.&#8217;</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259487" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-9.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="669" height="387" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-9.jpg 669w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-9-300x174.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-9-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px" /></a></p>
<p>$WSM&#8217;s creators, the brains behind the hot-selling Wall St Bulls NFT collection that <a href="https://thedalesreport.com/crypto-nfts/wall-street-bulls-nft-collection-sells-out-in-half-an-hour/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">sold out within 30 minutes of launch</a>, have launched this meme coin in response to market demand.</p>
<p>Wall St Bulls also expanded into Bitcoin Ordinals NFTs, showing their ability to align with the latest market trends.</p>
<p>The start of Wall Street Memes is tied to the GameStop saga. Its purpose isn&#8217;t just wealth accumulation but creating a community set on challenging financial structures via meme power.</p>
<p>By merging the engaging nature of memes with decentralized blockchain technology, $WSM aims to give its users the control &#8211; a core crypto principle.</p>
<h2><strong>Community-Focused Meme Coin With Over A Million Followers</strong></h2>
<p>Wall Street Memes&#8217; <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=wall-street-memes-raises-13-million-in-presale-traders-think-it-could-be-the-next-pepe" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$WSM token</a> secured over $300,000 on its first day on presale. Impressively, this amount shot up to surpass $13.1 million over the next month, indicating strong investor trust.</p>
<p>This rapid growth has set $WSM as a promising prospect for major crypto exchanges, including big players like Binance.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-9.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259486" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-9.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="694" height="344" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-9.jpg 694w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-9-300x149.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-9-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px" /></a></p>
<p>Currently, $WSM is available at $0.031 USDT during its presale, which is in the 21st stage of a 30-stage launch.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to note that presales, while full of upside potential, also come with certain risks. However, platforms with strong community support tend to show resilience and success over time.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes has over one million followers across five social media platforms. The following signifies a well-established, supportive community that points to the bright potential of the $WSM token.</p>
<h2><strong>Why are Some Traders Backing Wall Street Memes? Even Elon Musk Interacted</strong></h2>
<p>Wall Street Memes is gaining increasing investor traction. High-profile personalities like Elon Musk have shown interest, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1636924379086077954" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">interacting with Wall Street Memes on Twitter</a> &#8211; a move that has previously seen meme coins like Dogecoin skyrocket.</p>
<p>The distribution strategy of $WSM tokens is unique, emphasizing its community-first approach. With 2 billion tokens, half are set aside for presale, 30% are intended for community rewards, and 20% are reserved for exchange liquidity.</p>
<p>Importantly, the project team holds no token shares, maintaining transparency and reducing &#8216;rug pull&#8217; risks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Wall Street Memes is rolling out an airdrop for presale supporters. They can win $50,000 in $WSM tokens by following the project&#8217;s social media channels and completing simple tasks.</p>
<h2><strong>$WSM’s Roadmap to Success</strong></h2>
<p>In its roadmap, Wall Street Memes has outlined a three-part strategy: Foundation, Launch, and Community Empowerment, showing its dedication to long-term growth.</p>
<p>The roadmap&#8217;s initial stage is community-building and establishing a powerful brand presence. The second phase includes launching the $WSM token, creating key partnerships, and securing listings on multiple top-tier exchanges.</p>
<p>The final stage focuses on amplifying community power, targeting a $1 billion market cap after its exchange listings.</p>
<p>Many analysts anticipate $WSM as the next meme coin to surge in value, with some even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ATJyNo9AvE&amp;pp=ygUYd2FsbCBzdHJlZXQgbWVtZXMgY3J5cHRv" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">backing it to 100x</a> given its strong community and a well-timed entry into the market.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Euro Tether (EUR₮) and Tether Gold (XAU₮) have scored new listing. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stablecoin issuer announced the listing of Euro Tether (EUR₮) and Tether Gold (XAU₮) on XT.COM, which is being touted as the &#8220;world&#8217;s first social-infused exchange.&#8221; The latest move will enable users on the platform to access XAU₮ &#8211; which represents ownership of physical gold &#8211; as well as the ability to transact with EUR₮ &#8211; a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the euro.</p>
<p>The expansion news comes amidst increasing scrutiny in the stablecoin sector.</p>
<ul>
<li>The addition of EUR₮ and XAU₮ will also allow users on XT.COM to gain access to two stablecoins developed by Tether, the company said in a <a href="https://tether.to/en/euro-tether-eurt-and-tether-gold-xaut-to-be-listed-on-xtcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">statement</a>.</li>
<li>Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino weighed on the upcoming listings and stated,</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;As the company behind the leading stablecoin in the market today, recognized for its exceptional liquidity, expanding market share, and widespread acceptance, this further emphasizes our steadfast commitment to unlocking financial liberation and fostering economic inclusivity for communities worldwide.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Launched by Tether in 2020, XAU₮ represents ownership of one troy ounce of gold held in a Swiss vault controlled by the company.</li>
<li>EUR₮, on the other hand, is a euro-pegged stablecoin also supported by Tether that mirrors the euro via a decentralized network.</li>
<li>Currently, XAU₮ and EUR₮ have market caps of $474 million and $44 million, respectively. Despite the figures being massively dwarfed by the US dollar-backed USDT, the two stablecoins have managed to score several listings.</li>
<li>In yet another significant milestone for the firm, Tether <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-collaborates-with-georgia-to-place-the-country-as-a-global-blockchain-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">signed</a> a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Georgia’s government in June to position the country as a global hub.</li>
<li>USDT&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-circulation-hits-new-peak-as-confidence-in-circle-continues-to-shrink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">dominance</a> grew significantly in the past year or so owing to the banking crisis and the subsequent stablecoin market turbulence that caused its circulation <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tether-circulation-hits-new-peak-as-confidence-in-circle-continues-to-shrink/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">t</a>o peak above $83 billion.</li>
