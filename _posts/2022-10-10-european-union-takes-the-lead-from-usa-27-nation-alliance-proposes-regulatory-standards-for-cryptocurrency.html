In online crypto communities some European traders are now suggesting that "the US should just follow our lead".&nbsp;</p><p>This new determination to be the standard-setters seems to have ignited when the Biden administration shared their "first comprehensive framework for the responsible development of digital assets" - which basically asked government agencies to submit answers to their&nbsp; completely open ended question of what they believe they need to properly regulate the industry, this warned the rest of the world that current US leadership appears to be unqualified to regulate crypto (and probably all tech) as senior citizens fill many of the vital roles.&nbsp;</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">White House seems "only focused on the risks and not the opportunities" that the cryptocurrency sector has to offer....</h3><p>Both Biden and officials appointed by him seem to have taken media clickbait articles as fact, and often remarks focus on addressing only the negative aspects in the crypto world.</p><p>But law isn't just about stopping the bad guys, it's also about protecting the good ones. Which is why lawmakers shouldn't be looking at anything but hard data and reality to form their opinions.</p><p>In reality, about 2.1% of crypto is being used for illegal purposes like money laundering or purchases of items found on the darkweb, according to the firm that works with the FBI analyzing blockchain data for illegal activity, Chainalysis.</p><p>According to the UN, as much as 5% of ALL global currency is being used to facilitate something illegal, meaning Fiat currency, specifically paper cash, remains the preferred format of currency in the criminal underworld.</p><h3 style="text-align: left;">The European Union recently just slipped in harsh new rules regarding Dollar-pegged stablecoins...<br /><br /></h3>The current draft version of the bill aims to reduce the market cap, and limit the number of transactions using dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc.<br /><br />The current version of Europe's proposed regulations would limit USD pegged stablecoin transactions to no more than $200 million in total value each day, or a total of 1 million transactions of any amount.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />These limits are ALREADY exceeded on most days, so what are traders expected to do at this point? Well, to be clear, these limits are only on stablecoins pegged to the dollar - stablecoins\pegged to the Euro will be free from any limits on their usage.<br /><br /><div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Currently 75% of all transactions in crypto involve a US dollar pegged stablecoin...</h3><br />With this, the US loses an opportunity they could have sized that potentially could help maintain the strength of the Dollar for decades to come, at least according to&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/us-government-must-embrace-stablecoins-to-maintain-dollar-dominanc">some opinions</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>If Europe implements what is currently proposed the US loses an opportunity they could have sized that potentially could help maintain the strength of the Dollar for decades to come, at least according to some opinions. A government made up of more tech-savy leaders would know to pass regulations requiring companies issuing stablecoins to actually hold a US dollar for each coin issued.<br /><br />The US may learn the hard way - either take the lead and "set the standard" yourself, or expect when other nations do it they will make sure their own interests are served first...</div><h3 style="text-align: left;">How the US could still be first to implement comprehensive crypto regulations...</h3><div>It may look like the US is too far behind now to catch up, but it would be even more unrealistic to believe the EU has nothing but smooth sailing ahead.</div><div><br /></div><div>Even slower than US officials, is the European Union trying to agree on new laws. Hardly surprising when you consider how long it can take for differences to be resolved between parties within the same nation - imagine trying to get consensus from 27 governments.<br /><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">There are some major flaws in the he most current version of the EU's 'Markets in Crypto Assets' regulatory proposal...<br /><br /></h3><div>The best example of a 'major flaw' contained within the EU's propose regulations is how it would start requiring wallet providers to KYC (Know Your Customer) and obtain the legal ID of anyone using their software, even though wallet providers are never in possession of, or can even access your crypto.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>The best analogy is expecting manufactures of real wallets used for paper money and credit cards to ID buyers because 'you never know - they could use it to hold a credit card they just stole one day'. In both cases even if the allegations were 100% confirmed - the wallet-makers have no way of accessing what is inside of it.</div><div><br /></div><br /><span style="color: black;">-----------</span><br /><i><b>Author:&nbsp;</b>Ross Davis<br /></i><i><span><span style="color: #cc0000;">Silicon Valley Newsroom</span><br /></span></i><i><span><b><span style="color: #3d85c6;">GCP </span>//<span style="color: #3d85c6;">&nbsp;</span></b><a href="https://www.globalcryptopress.com/" style="color: #3d85c6; font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #3d85c6;">Breaking Crypto News</span></a></span></i><p></p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml"><img src="//feedburner.google.com/fb/images/pub/feed-icon32x32.png" alt="" style="border:0"/></a><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/GlobalCryptoPress" title="Subscribe to our feed" rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml">Subscribe to GCP in a reader</a></div>
