<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Celsius is attempting to withdraw more than $6 million from a Fabric Ventures investment commitment.</em></li>



<li><em>During a Series B round that took place in 2021, Fabric Ventures promised to invest $8 million in Celsius. On December 3, 2021, they signed a Series B deal with Celsius&#8217;s current shareholders and top investors.</em></li>



<li><em>The plan did not work out as expected. In July, about a month after preventing client withdrawals and locking billions of dollars across more than a million accounts, the troubled lender filed for bankruptcy.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Venture capitalists are growing less eager to make new bets. Some of them apparently violate previous agreements reached with different organizations.</p>



<p>According to a court filing <a href="https://cases.stretto.com/public/x191/11749/PLEADINGS/1174901172380000000108.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">submitted</a> on Tuesday, <strong>Fabric</strong> had agreed to make three payments totaling more than <strong>$8 million</strong> in the <strong>Series B</strong> round of <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160537-celsius-mining-sell-mining-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celsius</a>. By increasing a <strong>$400 million </strong>round to<strong> $750 million</strong> at a <strong>$3.25 billion valuation</strong>, Celsius claimed to have finished its extended Series B in <strong>November 2021</strong>.</p>



<p>A plan established in April of last year saw <strong>Fabric&#8217;s first $2 million payment made in</strong> <strong>May</strong>. It was planned to make the following installments of <strong>$2 million in June</strong> and <strong>$4 million in July</strong>.</p>



<p>The plan did not work out as expected. In July, about a month after preventing client withdrawals and locking billions of dollars across more than a million accounts, the troubled lender filed for bankruptcy. Recent court records revealed that Celsius has a <strong>$2.8 billion</strong> balance sheet hole as a result of its liabilities exceeding its assets by more than<strong> $6.7 billion</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Fabric</strong> <strong>Ventures</strong> is being sued by the now-bankrupt cryptocurrency lender <strong>Celsius</strong> for breaking its promise to invest <strong>$8 million</strong>.</p>



<p>According to a newly filed court document, the case sought <strong>$6,003,379</strong> in damages for the two unpaid payments, including interest, court costs, and any other remedies mentioned in the filing.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“Fabric agreed to pay $8,003,379 in three installments: $2,000,000 in May 2022, $2,000,000 in June 2022, and $4,003,379 in July 2022,” the document states.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, it made the first installment on time but declined to pay the following two.</p>



<p>Scalable decentralized networks are the focus of venture capital firm Fabric Ventures&#8217; investments. <strong>Fabric</strong> has made investments in creators, businesses, and digital assets at every step of growth since <strong>2012</strong>.</p>

<p>Prior to its current financial issues, Celsius suffered a number of operational difficulties. The former CEO of Celsius, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/130409-alex-mashinsky-keeps-moving-20000-cel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alex Mashinsky</a>, might potentially be charged with misleading investors.</p>



<p>The court document&#8217;s correspondence suggests that <strong>Fabric</strong> <strong>attempted to recover its initial $2 million advance payment pending project completion </strong>as news of Celsius&#8217; financial troubles spread.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Staking is a long-standing feature of the blockchain ecosystem that allows crypto holders to earn rewards in exchange for locking up their assets. Our research has shown that investors are interested in diversified, crypto-native return streams – especially amid crypto winter. In particular, we&#8217;ve heard demand for a reliable and safe way to access staking, one of the most attractive potential return streams available in the crypto ecosystem. The 21Shares Staking Basket Index ETP does just that, and will be an attractive addition to many portfolios.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>21 EVM-compatible chains</strong>, including<strong> Ethereum, BNB Chain, Arbitrum</strong>, and <strong>Optimism</strong>, are supported by Swing&#8217;s new widget and SDK. Four <strong>non-EVM networks</strong>, including <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160962-solana-sol-now-surges-65-in-the-second-week/">Solana</a> and <a href="https://news.coincu.com/145305-cosmos-stride-airdrop-4-strd-token/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos</a>, will also be covered by the protocol, according to <a href="https://www.accesswire.com/735534/Swing-Launches-Web3-Developer-Tools-to-Access-Cross-chain-Liquidity-and-Accelerate-Crypto-Adoption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcements</a>.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrency assets can be transferred between multiple networks via cross-chain solutions like bridges. According to Swing, creating these solutions typically takes several weeks, which is why its software package is necessary. The <strong>SDK</strong> now allows developers to finish bridge interfaces for their decentralized applications in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>Swing&#8217;s new Web3 software tools support the unification of bridge aggregation and cross-chain liquidity, greatly streamlining cross-chain development and enhancing liquidity with less friction. The notification said that the procedure might just take a few minutes if the widget is used.</p>

<p><strong>Swing</strong> claims that eliminating so-called liquidity fragmentation, in which liquidity is segregated across many blockchains and cannot easily flow between chains, calls for streamlining the cross-chain deployment process. <strong>Viveik Vivekananthan</strong>, the founder of Swing, stated:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Accessing cross-chain liquidity is crucial for the ongoing expansion of the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector. Liquidity in the crypto space will move across different networks like a superhighway, reaching the protocols that are best equipped to cater to the influx of new users entering the web3 ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Swing supports numerous bridges in addition to the 21 EVM chains. The project is listed as supporting nine bridge protocols on the website, including <strong>Celer</strong>, <strong>Wormhole</strong>, and <strong>Hop</strong>.</p>

<p>The move, according to Lubin, would affect<strong> 96 people and is a part of attempts to concentrate resources on the company&#8217;s core industries.</strong></p>

<p>Even though they had already been widely publicized, Lex Sokolin, the chief crypto economics officer of ConsenSys, told a few days before the layoffs&#8217; official announcement that the industry was still far from widespread acceptance globally.</p>



<p>We are still in the early stages of this technology. The general population doesn&#8217;t understand it, he claimed.</p>



<p>Over <strong>30 million users per month were utilizing MetaMask to access DeFi protocols</strong>, mint and trade NFTs, and take part in DAOs during the previous bull run, said Consensys. That is a drop in the ocean internationally, although being encouraging.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-small-font-size">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“MetaMask has 30 million monthly users and in Web3, there are maybe 500 million addresses,” Sokolin said. “But that’s not five billion people.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Asked when crypto will see mainstream adoption, Sokolin said it was all about having enough compelling use cases for crypto, as well as a thriving ecosystem to support it.</p>

<p>He also rejected the idea that it would come as a result of better user experience and more transparent regulations.</p>



<p>“They&#8217;re not the things that people say [such as] ‘when is UI going to be better,’ or ‘when is regulation going to make it better.’ Those are important, but [&#8230;] they&#8217;re not the catalyst,” said Sokolin adding:</p>

<p><strong>Anatoly Legkodymov</strong>, the creator and primary stakeholder of <strong>Bitzlato</strong>, was detained last night in Miami on accusations of conducting<strong> a money laundering enterprise in breach of US regulatory protections,</strong> including anti-<a href="https://news.coincu.com/160543-4-people-charged-nexos-money-laundering/">money laundering</a> regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The United States Department of Justice</strong> and the <strong>Treasury Department </strong><a href="https://www.justice.gov/live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today a joint enforcement action against an international cryptocurrency firm. This inquiry focuses on the Hong Kong-registered cryptocurrency trading site Bitzlato.</p>



<p>According to<strong> Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco</strong>, US officials have disrupted the Hong Kong-based website Bitzlato, and the platform&#8217;s founder, Anatoly Legkodymov, has been detained. This effectively ends the platform&#8217;s continued support for <strong>recognized illegal behavior related to Russia.</strong> Monaco was describing coordinated enforcement measures including<strong> the Federal Bureau of Investigation</strong> and the <strong>US Treasury Department</strong>. Monaco described the operation as the most important yet against a crypto criminal network.</p>

<p>The authorities stated that BitZlato <strong>gave electricity to darknet markets</strong> and aided in the process of ransomware attacks, <strong>totaling over $700 million in illegal activities</strong>, both directly and indirectly,<strong> between 2018 and 2022</strong>. The fact that the network took relatively little in the way of personally identifiable information from its users, as is the case with the bulk of bigger exchanges, made it enticing to criminals.</p>



<p><strong>Anatoly Legkodymov</strong>, the Russian kingpin, <strong>was arrested in Miami on Tuesday</strong> evening on suspicion of<strong> running a money transfer corporation</strong> that violated anti-money laundering regulations and transmitted unlawful monies. The 40-year-old crypto billionaire, who presently resides in China, will be taken before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Wednesday afternoon to face the criminal allegations.</p>



<p>The announcement was made <strong>at noon on Wednesday by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco</strong>, who presided over a press conference with FBI Associate Deputy Director Brian Turner, US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York Breon Peace, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth Polite of the Department of Justice&#8217;s criminal division, and Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo.</p>

<p>In a statement, <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160539-coinbase-crypto-related-stocks-are-soaring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coinbase</a> said that it had been forced to take the tough step of ceasing operations in the nation and conducting a thorough review of its Japanese business. The exchange attributed the move to the state of the market at the time. Following the ruling, it declared that <strong>it would conduct a thorough post-mortem of its operations in the nation.</strong></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Due to market conditions, our company has made the difficult decision to halt operations in Japan and to conduct a complete review of our business in the country. However, we are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for our valued customers,&#8221; the company said in a blog post.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This Friday, <strong>January 20</strong>, fiat deposits to the exchange will end, and users can withdraw their cash and cryptocurrency holdings until <strong>February 16</strong>.</p>



<p>Any fund that is still available after this date will be converted to <strong>Japanese Yen</strong> and sent to a <strong>Guaranty Account</strong> at the <strong>Legal Affairs Bureau</strong>, where clients will be responsible for retrieving their own cash.</p>

<p>The choice was made just a few days after the business declared it would start to wind down its activities there. <strong>Nana Murugesan</strong>, vice president of business development at Coinbase, stated on <strong>January 11 </strong>that the company was <strong>not interested in M&amp;A</strong> and would not be selling its <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159629-japan-unit-of-coinbase-cuts-workforce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japanese division</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Murugesan</strong> stated at the time that the shutdown would wait until Coinbase had resolved all outstanding issues with the<strong> Japanese Financial Services Agency</strong> <strong>(FSA)</strong>. In order for the business to guarantee the security of customer assets, a select few employees are scheduled to continue in their roles in the upcoming weeks.</p>



<p>After securing its registration with the nation&#8217;s<strong> FSA</strong> in <strong>June 2021</strong>, Coinbase entered the Japanese market. The exchange is following the lead of its rival Kraken, which stopped operating in Japan at the end of the previous year.</p>

<p>Most recently, as part of its restructuring, <strong>Coinbase</strong> <a href="https://news.coincu.com/159274-coinbase-to-cut-950-jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off roughly 950 employees </a>or about<strong> 20% of its staff.</strong></p>



<p>Crypto enterprises have been adjusting their business strategies to the new reality as the crypto winter bites more in late 2022 after the failure of <strong>FTX</strong>. It looks like this event still has implications for the industry at the moment.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, this activity peaked in the fourth quarter of 2022, right before <a href="https://news.coincu.com/160499-skybridge-capital-wants-buy-back-30-shares/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTX</a> collapsed and caused significant money outflows on the biggest exchanges in the sector.</p>



<p>In addition, Alchemy&#8217;s poll of <strong>985 developers </strong>in <strong>December</strong> revealed that <strong>94% of them were dedicated to creating in Web3</strong>, highlighting an optimistic outlook despite the current crypto winter.</p>



<p><strong>Web3</strong> development activity has increased dramatically over the past year, despite the significant challenges the crypto industry has encountered.</p>



<p>The company reported that more than <strong>100,000 applications</strong> flooded in after the opening of its <strong>Alchemy University</strong> in October, demonstrating a strong interest in developing Web3 development abilities.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>According to Fineqia International&#8217;s research, there were 53 more encrypted ETPs in December 2022 than there were in January 2022 (from 109 to 162). But its managed assets decreased from $58.5 billion to $20 billion.</em></li>



<li><em>The number of ETPs decreased from 163 to 162 as a result of the removal of one ETP that used the FTX token as its underlying asset.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5><strong>According to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/number-of-crypto-etps-grew-50-in-2022-even-as-aum-mirrored-drop-in-cryptocurrency-prices-301722697.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fineqia International&#8217;s analysis of Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)</a> with cryptocurrencies as their underlying assets, there are now 162 ETPs, up from 109 in 2022, despite a 66% decline in their Assets Under Management (AUMs).</strong></h5>

<p>The overall AUM decreased by a third to <strong>$20 billion</strong> from <strong>$58.5 billion</strong> in <strong>2022</strong>, according to the analysis.</p>



<p>The internal research team at Fineqia gathered all <strong>ETFs</strong> and <strong>ETPs AUM</strong> from publically accessible sources such<strong> 21Shares AG, Grayscale Investment LLC, VanEck Associates Corp., MorningStars, Inc., and TrackInSight SAS.</strong></p>



<p>ETPs launched in bear markets grew significantly in succeeding bull markets. For instance, <strong>Grayscale&#8217;s Litecoin Trust (LTCN)</strong>, which was introduced in <strong>2018</strong>, increased its AUM by almost <strong>220 times</strong>.</p>



<p>In contrast, ETPs that were introduced around the time that<a href="https://news.coincu.com/161121-bitcoin-btc-soars-600-mil-hit-short-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Bitcoin<strong> </strong>(BTC) </a>reached its record high of over <strong>$69,000</strong> in <strong>November 2021</strong>, such as the <strong>ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF</strong>, which debuted on <strong>October 18, 2021</strong>, had a <strong>54% decline</strong> in market capitalization from <strong>$1.2 billion</strong> to roughly <strong>$549 million.</strong></p>

<p>Between<strong> January and December 2022</strong>, the price of <strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong> fell by<strong> 68% </strong>and that of<strong> Bitcoin </strong>by<strong> 65%</strong>. Fineqia&#8217;s CEO <strong>Bundeep Singh Rangar</strong>, said:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;The fact that an average of one new ETP was issued each week, despite the bear market in 2022, can be seen as an indication of continued investor appetite for this asset class. Specific events, such as the bankruptcy of FTX, contributed to a fall in crypto prices and resultant AUMs.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <strong>AUM ETPs holding BTC</strong> decreased by<strong> 3%</strong> in <strong>December</strong>, from <strong>$14 billion</strong> to <strong>$13.5 billion</strong>. The<strong> AUM of ETPs trading in ETH </strong>dropped from <strong>$5.3 billion </strong>to <strong>$5 billion</strong>, a <strong>7.5% decline</strong>. <strong>ETPs</strong> that represent alternative coins fell by <strong>18%</strong>, while those that include a variety of cryptocurrencies fell by <strong>8%</strong>.</p>



<p>The number of <strong>ETPs</strong> decreased by one, from<strong> 163</strong> to <strong>162</strong>, because one ETP that used the <strong>FTT</strong> as its underlying asset was taken off of trading. <a href="https://news.coincu.com/154508-ftx-uses-ftt-to-pay-blockfolio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTT</a> is the native token of the exchange that no longer exists <strong>FTX</strong>. Its demise has had ramifications for the crypto market and the companies in the industry.</p>

<p><strong>Ivanov</strong> issued a <a href="https://t.me/sashawaves/61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> in the Telegram group:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;There&#8217;s some misunderstanding regarding the future of USDN, which I&#8217;d like to clear up. First off, did it fail as a stablecoin? Yes, it did. Is it dead? Hell no. Its architecture has proven to be a failure for a hard-pegged stablecoin. But it will be adequate for another interesting financial product, namely the ecosystem index. It does not require a hard peg, it just has to track a portfolio of select ecosystem tokens. We phase it out as a stablecoin, but we resurrect it as a new asset with new meaning and utility. I agree that it is quite unconventional, but drastic times require drastic measures.</p>



<p class="has-small-font-size">We are doing it in such a way that we&#8217;ll be able to keep NSBT and SURF tokens with their incentives, and also we will incentivize token holders to add their tokens to the Index. The updated protocol will be simple but, despite (or thanks to) that, very efficient. Bear in mind that since it is not stable any more, its price can be not only under $1 but also above it. We are preparing new treasury assets to be added, first, it will be a donation, after that, the incentives to add new tokens to the treasury will kick in, and the project will live in a fully decentralized way. If you believe in Waves, believe in USDN. The core team is working really hard to execute the plan and breathe new air into USDN. Nothing is forgotten, and we never give up.&#8221;</p>
