			  <description><![CDATA[<p>While Solana (SOL) and Tron (TRX) may be more well-known names in the cryptocurrency space, they have received negative reviews from analysts and have struggled to gain traction in the market. In contrast, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) has been gaining popularity with its impressive 655% growth during phase 2 of its presale, positioning it for a potential 60x return by the end of the presale. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is quickly catching up and making a name for itself as a standout performer. ORBN is currently in phase 3 of the presale.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Solana (SOL) is down over 93% in the past year</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) is considered a competitor to Ethereum (ETH). Solana (SOL) has gained popularity due to its capacity to process transactions quickly. Solana (SOL) can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) also can generate smart contracts. These smart contracts can aid in decentralized application development. Increasing numbers of decentralized apps are currently hosted on Solana (SOL). As more projects are launched on Solana (SOL), the interest in DeFi increases. Solana (SOL) is also capable of creating NFTs.</p>
<p>Solana (SOL) is one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies of the year, having lost approximately 93% in a single year.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">TRON (TRX) fails to stay relevant</p>
<p>TRON (TRX) has gained much attention since its inception, owing to its desire to establish a fully decentralized network. It demonstrates that TRON (TRX) has turned a substantial portion of its interest into market value over time. </p>
<p>The creators of TRON (TRX) are ambitious and determined. TRON (TRX) are attempting to create a decentralized internet. TRON's cutting-edge technology might substantially alter the economics of content creation. Aside from that, it has recently attracted so much investment that its market value surpasses that of several popular cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>But all of that hasn't been enough to keep the investors of TRON (TRX) happy, as TRON is currently trading over 76% lower than its all-time high. TRON (TRX) fails to stay relevant in bearish market conditions and, for this reason, is off the analyst's radar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE&lt;&lt;</p>
<p class="s3">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) shines with 655% returns</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a decentralized investment platform aiming to revolutionize the crowdfunding and venture finance market. Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) intends to accomplish this by using fractionalized non-fungible tokens, or F-NFTs, which businesses can issue as a form of equity or rewards and which can be traded for as little as $1.</p>
<p>This enables ordinary investors to gain the benefits of early-stage investing and helps startups to raise capital at a lower cost. In addition, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) uses a "Fill-or-Kill" mechanism that guarantees all investors are refunded if a startup fails to fulfill its funding objective.</p>
<p>ORBN is the project's utility token, and the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale is currently in its third stage. Following a 655% rally, ORBN is currently selling for $0.0302. Analysts expect ORBN to gain 6000% in the following months.</p>
<p>In the presale, only 40% of the total supply of ORBN is up for grabs. ORBN holders receive various platform-wide perks, including staking bonuses, governance rights, transaction cost savings, and access to exclusive investor groups.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>A temporary outage of LBank&rsquo;s trade platform in December sparked discussion among users about how exchanges should approach cloud hosting. LBank CEO Allen Wei addressed the issue during a Twitter Space AMA on December 26th.</p>
<p>Why this matters: Veteran crypto exchanges like LBank are trying to uphold a long-standing reputation of seeing little service downtime and thwarting hackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driving the discussion: Alibaba Cloud, LBank&rsquo;s Cloud Service Provider, experienced technical issues on December 18th, rendering the trading platform temporarily inaccessible for over 7 million users.</p>
<ul>
  <li>&ldquo;Our engineers got word from Alibaba Cloud that there was a server crash ongoing and immediately started collaboration. It took quite some time to recover our services, but luckily we recovered access to our websites through other cloud services quite early on. The incident not only affected us, but a lot of other exchanges and internet companies,&rdquo; Wei said.</li>
  <li>LBank stresses that these kinds of outages have no impact on user assets whatsoever. &ldquo;We take regular back-ups of platform data. The wallet side is especially secure because we utilize cold storage controlled by our own servers,&rdquo; Wei added.</li>
  <li>Addressing the FUD that popped up on social media during the incident, Wei stated this phenomenon isn&rsquo;t an abnormality in the financial industry. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been through this before ever since kicking off in 2015 and are nonetheless still supporting crypto and blockchain tech. The community continues to trust us and trade on our platform, which underlines the potential of crypto,&rdquo; the LBank CEO said.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Big Picture: Wei points out that exchanges should approach cloud hosting with a multipronged strategy.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The exchange will take even more frequent back-ups of platform data in the future and will look towards other Cloud Service Providers to mitigate downtime. &ldquo;We are slowly moving some of our services to other Cloud Providers, like Amazon&rdquo;, Wei stated.</li>
  <li>Continuing to provide excellent stability of the trading platform is an integral part of LBank&rsquo;s global goals, Wei said. &ldquo;In 2023, we would also like to expand on the local community relations we established this year&rdquo;, he concluded.
</li>
</ul>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Indian crypto exchanges suffered extremely badly during the crypto bear market of 2022. Trading volume on WazirX fell a massive 97% over the year.</p>
Severe drop in trading volumes
<p>According to an article in the business section of the Outlook India</p>
<p>news platform, exchanges based in the country experienced a severe drop in trading volumes.</p>
<p>Data quoted from CREBACO stated that WazirX&rsquo;s trading volume plummeted 97.99%, CoinDCX&rsquo;s decreased 88%, Bitbns fell 67%, and ZebPay went down 94%. All over the course of 2022 taken from January to December.</p>
Indian authority&rsquo;s negative view on crypto
<p>Other exchanges across the world are likely to have suffered large dips in trading volume as well, but the Indian market probably suffered more due to the very negative crypto view of the government and the Royal Bank of India.</p>
<p>In line with this, a 30% capital gains tax was introduced for all those citizens trading in crypto. Furthermore, a 1% tax was also levied on every single single transaction.</p>
Crypto sector dwindles in India
<p>The result of this was to dampen the Indian crypto market to a very high degree, and in addition, some crypto infrastructure such as exchanges, moved overseas and a brain drain was also experienced.</p>
<p>With far more regulatory laws about to descend on crypto in India, and also in various jurisdictions across the world, it remains to be seen how this will affect the sector.</p>
Regulation - good or bad?
<p>Some say that the clarity and certainty produced by more regulatory oversight can lend the aura of respectability to the industry that is required by institutions wishing to invest in the sector.</p>
<p>However, others might say that the type of regulation that is incoming in places like Europe (MiCA), could have the effect of squashing the life out of crypto and of drastically curtailing the innovation that has been freely flowing out of the sector.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 16922 Technical Level:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 28 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) failed to sustain recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair fell back to the 16795.53 area after trading as high as the 16920.10 level, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pair continues to orbit the &nbsp;16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16792.55 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16816.39.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) failed to sustain recent upside progress early in the Asian session as the pair fell back to the 16795.53 area after trading as high as the 16920.10 level, representing a test of the 50% retracement of the appreciating range from 15460 to 18385.36.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pair continues to orbit the &nbsp;16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460. &nbsp;Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16792.55 and the&nbsp;100-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16816.39.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>New York, United States, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>With sales of non-fungible tokens falling for the 6th straight month, and falling by 60% in just Q3 to Q4 this year, it&rsquo;s understandable to say the market is feeling pessimistic. A number of factors contribute to this such as interest rate increases cooling the economy and the novelty of purely aesthetic NFTs failing to attract investor attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pessimistic Donkey College, hopes to rally the bear market by introducing the NFT project that provides a new investment opportunity with a focus on long-term growth of an investor community. This new project will be launching on January 15, 2023.</p>
<p>In order to help support investors, the project is also going to be run on a royalty-free model to encourage trading and participation in the project post-launch. This is in line with the innovative stake system being developed to run alongside it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an addition to launching the NFT, Pessimistic Donkey College will be producing a weekly mental health podcast to raise awareness and educate their audience on the increasingly important topic. This approach of pairing an NFT with a socially conscious project is a new step for the industry and demonstrates that NFT projects can be used for the public good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The evolutionary goals of the project and their commitment to bringing pessimistic investors together in the bear market show an understanding that NFT projects need to change and develop past tools of investment and move into community-driven environments and can enact a positive social impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>About Pessimistic Donkey College
Pessimistic Donkey College is a new NFT project by co-founders: JAY, Draco, DEL, TT, and their teams. One of the project's major goals is to reinvigorate interest in the face of the bear market by offering a new collection of images as well as utilities and a royalty-return system.</p>
<p>The plans for this project are to take another step in the NFT space beyond previous competitors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the minting of NFTs, the project will also produce a weekly mental health podcast.&nbsp;</p>ContactDracoPessimistic Donkey Collegeinfo@pessimisticdonkeycollege.com]]></description>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Crypto.com promotes its very experienced and successful COO to president. Eric Anziani will now carry out both roles.</p>
<p>Eric Anziani, who is currently the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Crypto.com, has been promoted to President of the company. In this expanded role, Anziani will continue to oversee operations and lead strategy, product, sales, international expansion, data, research, and blockchain integration.&nbsp;</p>
A key roll
<p>Anziani has been with Crypto.com since 2018 and has helped the company secure licences in various locations, grow its user base to over 70 million people, build its product and NFT offerings, advance Web3 innovation, and establish partnerships with prominent brands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anziani has extensive experience in the tech industry, having worked for Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, PayPal, and Global Fashion Group in various locations around the world.</p>
<p>Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, said of the promotion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eric is a leader and strategic thinker who has helped guide the Company&rsquo;s vision and solidified Crypto.com as a world-class platform built on security, compliance, and trust. Eric&rsquo;s expanded role will allow him full visibility of growth opportunities for the company and the ability to continue building and innovating to position Crypto.com for continued success.&rdquo;</p>

Advertising issues
<p>The UK's advertising regulator recently ruled against Crypto.com and Turtle United for promoting NFTs (non-fungible tokens) without clearly outlining the risks of investing in them or adequately disclosing transaction fees.&nbsp;</p>
Exchanges seek to prove financial stability
<p>This decision comes as crypto exchanges are trying to demonstrate their financial stability following the failure of FTX. On December 9th, FTX released a proof-of-reserves study conducted by Mazars, but the auditing firm later announced that it would no longer offer its services to the crypto industry.</p>

Several vending machines installed worldwide also support YES WORLD Token as payment method.</p>
<p>Launched in the spring of 2022, YES WORLD Token is getting good traction in crypto utility space and&nbsp; is already trading on several leading centralized exchanges including XT.com and Coinsbit.io, as well as on decentralized exchange - PancakeSwap.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The global monetary system is at a crossroads. Can Bitcoin play a part in the finances of tomorrow?</p>
<p>The famed economist Fredrick A. Hayek was of the view that the State was not a good enough actor to hold the reins of monetary power. He said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we shall ever have a good money again before we take the thing out of the hands of government, that is, we can&rsquo;t take them violently out of the hands of government, all we can do is by some sly roundabout way introduce something that they can&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sly roundabout way&rdquo; was used by Satoshi Nakamoto to introduce the &ldquo;Peer-to-peer electronic cash system&rdquo; that was called Bitcoin. The system was implemented as a way to allow people to leave a corrupt banking system that was insidiously robbing them of their wealth over many decades.</p>
<p>That same banking and monetary system persists to this day, and there probably aren&rsquo;t many who are aware that this fiat-backed, debt-based system is on the brink of collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governments have been incredibly profligate and have printed their currencies towards oblivion. The US Federal Reserve alone printed 40% of all the currency that has ever been printed in the history of the dollar just in the 2 years following covid.</p>
<p>We have the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, announcing rate rise after rate rise in a so-called effort to reduce spending and to bring the inflation rate down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As inflation started to rise higher following the massive $6 trillion of printing, Powell of the Fed, and Yellen of the Treasury, told the world that it was only &ldquo;transitory&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How many times have our financial leaders come in front of the cameras to tell us that everything is absolutely fine, for the situation to then erupt and worsen into something dreadful.</p>
<p>Throughout history it has been proven that humans cannot control monetary policy without sending us into worsening cycles of boom and bust. There is just too much political pressure to make things &lsquo;easier&rsquo; for businesses and individuals today, at the expense of robbing the future from our children and grandchildren who will have to pay the debt.</p>
<p>One of the only remaining escape routes out of the system is Bitcoin. No government control and no financial intermediaries; a decentralised system that enables the user to in effect be their own bank. It&rsquo;s incumbent on everyone to decide which system they would prefer to be in.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>TRON DAO, a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps, today announced that it has joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA). As an EEA member, TRON DAO will collaborate with EEA and its members, the leading business adopters, innovators and leaders within the Ethereum ecosystem, to accelerate the pace of Ethereum business advancements and adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TRON DAO is accelerating the progression of Web3 adoption across a global scale by creating novel and useful solutions for builders and consumers. &ldquo;TRON and Ethereum have grown and matured together over the years,&rdquo; says TRON blockchain Founder, H.E. Justin Sun. &ldquo;We want this affiliation to be a step forward for the industry to showcase that progress comes in many forms. Blockchain has the potential to change the world in manners we cannot fathom and we need to coordinate together to make it happen. I am optimistic that partnerships like this are one of the healthiest moves we can collectively do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The EEA&rsquo;s membership base represents companies from every region of the world. The EEA&rsquo;s Interest Groups, Working Groups, and events bring together the top Ethereum and global business leaders, technologists, and industry experts to learn about the latest business reference implementations, real-world use cases, and technical innovations. The EEA&rsquo;s educational primers, designed specifically for non-technical entrants to the Ethereum ecosystem, offer introductions to many of the different concepts and facets of Ethereum, and blockchain as a whole, to help more professionals get started on the platform. </p>
<p>About the EEA</p>

<p>About TRON DAO</p>
<p>TRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.</p>
<p>Founded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of December 2022, it has over 130 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.4 billion total transactions, and over $9.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government&rsquo;s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (&ldquo;DMC&rdquo;), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica&rsquo;s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>On the third of January 2023 Bitcoin will celebrate its 14th birthday. What is in store for the freedom currency?</p>
<p>The man, woman, or group of people that went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto minted the Bitcoin genesis block on January 3, 2009. In that first block, Nakamoto wrote the following headline from the Times newspaper: &ldquo;Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Such a headline being written into the genesis block of the fastest growing asset in history really puts into perspective as to &lsquo;why&rsquo; Satoshi Nakamoto spent the time on engineering something that might provide a liferaft out of the poverty-inducing monetary system that persists to this day.</p>
<p>The monetary system makes the world go round, and yet nobody really questions how currency comes into existence. It&rsquo;s not taught at schools, and even probably the vast majority of individuals who work in banks or financial agencies don&rsquo;t have a clue as to how our debt-based monetary system actually works.</p>
<p>The renowned industrialist Henry Ford said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noble venture that is Bitcoin was probably allowed to flourish because those in the banking system initially ignored it, and then they laughed at it. However, the laughing went on long enough for Bitcoin to gain the network strength through decentralised nodes, that allowed it to become the securest computing network on earth.</p>
<p>Some attribute the saying to Gandhi in his struggle for Indian independence from the British &ldquo;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bitcoin is in the fighting phase right now. The bankers and those that lead the world&rsquo;s financial agencies have realised to their horror that Bitcoin has become a force to be reckoned with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the full force of the &lsquo;system&rsquo; can be brought to bear on the Bitcoin network. A fight to the death of either of the systems has now been initiated, and only the future will tell us if the decentralised Bitcoin network will be able to withstand the tsunami of misdirection from the mainstream media, and the crushing weight of regulation that will seek to grind the cryptocurrency sector into the dust.</p>
<p>The fear is that control over the minds of the populace will give the central banks the time they need in which to roll out their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). And of course, once these are embedded across the world, liberty and freedom can be crushed once and for all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quote former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair: &ldquo;Education, education, education.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We live in a world where mainstream news generally always carries a particular slant, and where television and social media is full of inanities that lull us all into mind-numbing indifference. Retaining freedom is worth the time spent on educating oneself. Who will do so?</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>An Analyst from global investment giant JPMorgan has revealed that large institutional investors are actively avoiding crypto, with the asset class not even on their radar when it comes to investments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the analyst, thanks to high volatility, institutional investors feel relieved about staying away from crypto.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Not On The Radar&nbsp;
<p>In a free-wheeling conversation, the head of institutional portfolio strategy at JPMorgan&rsquo;s Asset Management, Jared Gross, discussed institutional investors and their outlook toward crypto. The strategist revealed that as an asset class, crypto was non-existent for most institutional investors. He attributed their lack of interest to several factors, including significant volatility and the dearth of an intrinsic return on crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As an asset class, crypto is effectively non-existent for most large institutional investors &hellip; The volatility is too high, the lack of an intrinsic return that you can point to makes it very challenging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He further added that it was fairly clear that Bitcoin had not lived up to its billing as a form of digital gold or a haven asset, as many had hoped it would. He stated that, on the contrary, institutional investors were relieved they did not jump into the market and aren&rsquo;t going to anytime soon either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most institutional investors probably are breathing a sigh of relief that they didn&rsquo;t jump into that market and are probably not going to be doing so anytime soon.&rdquo;</p>
Not The Only One With A Gloomy Outlook&nbsp;
<p>Jared Gross&rsquo;s sentiments were echoed by CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a harsh critic of cryptocurrencies. Dimon had recently called cryptocurrencies a sideshow, comparing tokens to pet rocks. Dimon has been skeptical of cryptocurrencies since Bitcoin&rsquo;s early days. The criticism of the asset class was particularly harsh after JPMorgan developed the JPM Coin, which the bank calls a permissioned system that can serve as a payment rail and deposit account ledger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is essential to remember that JPMorgan has always had an uneasy relationship with the cryptocurrency industry.&nbsp;</p>
Banks And Financial Institutions Still Offering Crypto&nbsp;
<p>Despite the pessimistic outlook, a number of banks and financial institutions are still offering crypto products and services to their institutional clients. Investment giant State Street had stated back in September that it sees the demand for crypto assets to continue from institutional investors. Nasdaq has also recently established a crypto unit called Nasdaq Digital Assets on the back of increasing demand from institutional investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, in a November survey, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase revealed that institutional investors have been increasing their allocations during the ongoing bear cycle. It further emphasized that the increase in allocation is a strong indicator of crypto&rsquo;s acceptance as an asset class. A study conducted by Fidelity back in October stated that 74% of institutional investors were planning on investing in digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
Crypto Winter Continues&nbsp;
<p>Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market is still reeling thanks to the ongoing crypto winter, with the Federal Reserve and other major banks around the globe raising interest rates to fight rising inflation. As a result, the industry has seen the collapse and bankruptcy of several prominent players in the sector, with the most recent and prominent ones being that of FTX and Alameda Research.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is unlikely that prices will recover during the year, with some coins having lost 80% of their value over the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is unlikely that prices will recover during the year, with some coins having lost 80% of their value over the course of the year.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>1inch Network has just revealed their new Fusion update for the 1inch Swap Engine, solidifying its position as one of the top decentralized finance aggregators. The network's Fusion upgrade seeks to provide crypto investors with dependable, safe and profitable exchanges at a lowered cost.</p>
<p>The update to 1inch is designed to maximize revenue potential, safeguard users' funds, and provide a seamless user experience in the decentralized finance sector. 1inch's Swap Engine connects DeFi users and provides liquidity for crypto trades with the use of professional market makers, operating as a decentralized trading and matching backend system.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fusion makes swaps on 1inch dramatically more cost-efficient, as users won&rsquo;t have to pay network fees, plus, an extra layer of security is added, protecting users from sandwich attacks," shares Sergej Kunz, 1inch Network co-founder.</p>

<p>Taking a revolutionary step away from the standard centralized system, 1inch's latest upgrade affords investors to securely make noncustodial swaps without needing permission or trusting any third-party. These transactions occur in an entirely trustless and autonomous manner.</p>
<p>As announced, 1inch is providing seemingly endless liquidity and utilizing a cutting-edge decentralized order-matching approach modeled on the Dutch auction model. The Dutch auction model proceeds by determining a ceiling price for an asset, starting at its higher level, and then gradually lowering until bidders are willing or able to accept the current price. This approach allows DeFi users to find the best rates when making transactions on 1inch.</p>
<p>1inch's new Fusion mode enables users to trade tokens across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) without incurring any network fees. The improved version also grants users the autonomy to decide when their order should be executed based on their individual requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, the Fusion mode ensures protection against MEV (Maximum Extractable Value), which is indicated as the maximum amount which can be harvested from block production outside and in excess of regular gas fee and reward.</p>
<p>1inch's Fusion upgrade also comes with the introduction of its Resolver Incentive Program, a new system that provides resolvers with a refund on the gas spent for filling orders in Fusion mode. However, 1inch has noted that this will only be applicable until the 31st of December this year.</p>

<p>"As resolvers will fill orders without trying to minimize their gas costs, they will offer better swap rates to users. As a result, regular users will be the main beneficiaries of the program." 1inch clarified in a blog post.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>After falling nearly 40% to 170.60 EH/s, Bitcoin&rsquo;s network hash rate has recovered, rising to 241.29 EH/s. The hash rate had fallen from a weekly peak of 276.40 EH/s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drop was attributed to bone-chilling temperatures across the United States of America that stretched the country&rsquo;s electricity grid.&nbsp;</p>
Christmas Chill Cripples Mining Operations&nbsp;
<p>The week leading up to Christmas saw a monster storm wreak havoc as the cold arctic chill swept across the United States, crippling the energy grid and leaving millions without power. The freezing temperatures also claimed 28 lives. Bitcoin mining operations were also severely impacted, with the energy grid stretched thin. According to reports, Bitcoin miners in Texas, which account for a significant chunk of the country&rsquo;s hash rate, voluntarily ceased operations, giving power back to the grid and allowing residents to keep their homes heated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The disruption caused due to the mining operations had a significant impact on Bitcoin&rsquo;s hashrate. Typically, the hash rate stays between 225 and 300 Exhashes per second (EH/s). On the 25th of December, this number dropped to 170.60 EH/s. However, the hashrate rose to 241.29 EH/s, according to data sourced by hash rate mining calculator CoinWarz.&nbsp;</p>
Community Debates Cause Of Drop&nbsp;
<p>Bitcoin&rsquo;s hash rate is calculated by measuring the hashes produced by Bitcoin miners when they are solving the subsequent block. The hash rate is considered a key metric for assessing the Bitcoin network&rsquo;s security. The drop in hash rate prompted John Stefanop, FutureBit founder, to issue a controversial statement blaming highly centralized mining operations in Texas for switching off at the same time for the drop. Stefanop stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, does not change the fact that a few large mines in Texas affect the entire network to the tune of 33%... everyone&rsquo;s transactions are now being confirmed 30% slower because the hash rate is not decentralized enough. If hash rate was distributed evenly around the world by 10&rsquo;s of millions of small miners instead of a few dozen massive mines, this event would not have even registered on the network.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, Bitcoin bull Dan Held countered the argument, stating that weather patterns and their impact on operations does not equal centralized operations or ownership.&nbsp;</p>
Bitcoin Continues To &ldquo;Work Perfectly&rdquo;&nbsp;
<p>Despite the weather and the numerous issues it caused, the Bitcoin network continued to function normally. This was pointed out by the CEO of the Bitcoin mining advocacy group, Satoshi Action Fund, Dennis Porter, in a Twitter post. Porter stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over 30% of the #Bitcoin hash rate has gone offline due to extreme weather in Texas, and yet the global #Bitcoin network continues to work perfectly. Now imagine if Amazon or Google tried turning off 1/3rd of their data centers.&rdquo;</p>

Burgeoning Hash Rate&nbsp;
<p>Currently, the United States is the biggest contributor to the Bitcoin hash rate. According to the Cambridge Electricity consumption Index, the United States currently accounts for over 37% of the monthly hash rate share. All of the top states for Bitcoin mining, Georgia, Kentucky, New York, and Texas, experienced significant power outages due to the massive snowstorm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Texas, in particular, has seen a significant Bitcoin mining boom in recent months thanks to favorable regulations. This has seen some of the biggest mining companies set up operations in the state. These include Argo, Rion blockchain, Bitdeer, Compute North, core Scientific, and Genesis Digital Assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the recent events have contributed to a growing list of headaches for mining companies. The ongoing bear market has resulted in mining companies accruing debt to the tune of $4 billion. Additionally, several prominent US-based mining companies have recently filed for bankruptcy. However, the recent events don&rsquo;t seem to have had an impact on Bitcoin&rsquo;s price so far.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance's French subsidiary, Binance France, has been sued by fifteen investors who claim that the cryptocurrency giant violated local regulations by misleading customers.</p>
<p>The French subsidiary of Binance has been accused of violating France's laws by promoting and distributing its cryptocurrency services before obtaining proper authorization. The plaintiffs recorded and documented their dealings on the crypto exchange, showing Binance's marketing materials for its French users. According to the plaintiffs, these were done right before Binance gained authorized registry with local regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed on December 14, formalizing complaints against Binance France which included allegations of securities law violations for the sale of TerraUSD and its sister cryptocurrency Terra (LUNC). The lawsuit claims that Binance was selling these digital assets in violation of law, and buyers were not warned or sufficiently informed, through advertising materials, about the risks involved in their purchases.</p>
<p>The lawsuit outlines Binance's unlawful sale of the highly debated algorithmic stablecoin and other tokens without informing buyers regarding potential risks. In their complaint, the plaintiffs assert that Binance and its senior management were aware of the downfall of a project prior to marketing it globally. Consequently, they have allegedly lost over 2.4 million euros due to believing in false claims that this token was backed by US dollars.</p>
<p>Investors who relied on Binance to purchase UST were sorely disappointed, as they quickly found out that the exchange was far from 'safe,' 'stable,' and/or 'fiat-backed.' Furthermore, French investors have expressed their grievances in claiming that Binance acted more like an "actual seller" when it came to any transactions taking place on its platform; rather than simply facilitating a direct exchange between those parties involved, it went so far as to actually credit or debit each individual's respective accounts.</p>
<p>Upon inquiry, Binance France declared that they had not been notified of any civil or criminal proceedings. Additionally, the entity confirmed that no promotional activities were undertaken in France prior to receiving registration from French authorities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Binance did not promote in France before being allowed to do so. Telegram groups are global community forums, which any Telegram user can create or join voluntarily,&rdquo; Binance stated.</p>

<p>It was only earlier in May this year that Binance France was able to secure a digital asset service provider with the country's regulators. The license provides the exchange as a Paris-based business to provide traders with a premier cryptocurrency platform while also serving as a custodian for businesses linked to crypto. This, despite the fact that Binance has faced immense regulatory pressure from UK and other European authorities this year, it is still determined to expand into Europe.</p>

Encryptus CEO Shantnoo Saxsena used the platform to encourage crypto users to educate themselves before investing in digital assets.</p>
<p>The summit in Mumbai, India, brought together over 10,000 industry leaders, experts, and enthusiasts to exchange ideas about the crypto and blockchain ecosystem. Speakers included Shiv Kumar Bhasin, COO and CTO of the National Stock Exchange; Shantnoo Saxsena, Founder and CEO of Encryptus; and Mru Patel from My Tokenized Capital. These experts shared their thoughts on crypto, the metaverse, and NFTs.</p>
<p>During the summit, Encryptus and other attendees discussed pain points in the industry and collaboratively explored solutions to improve the digital asset space and promote crypto adoption.</p>
<p>The International Blockchain Summit also focused on emerging trends in different industries such as Defence, Technology, and Machine Learning. Mr. Shiv Kumar spoke about the implementation of a CBDC in India. He highlighted the challenges, government plans, and the future of the E-Rupee. Mr. Patel discussed NFTs and the metaverse and how they can play an active role in driving web3 adoption.</p>
<p>Shantnoo Saxsena had a house full of students as he spoke about the basics of cryptocurrency: its adoption, scams, and how to stay safe at all times. He commented: "Users must educate themselves before investing their hard-earned money. There are over 20,000 projects out there and not all the projects are legit. Buying cryptos is not tricky, but buying the right cryptos, clean cryptos, with proper storage is more critical.&rdquo;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Decentralized leverage trading protocol Defrost Finance, which recently disclosed that its protocol has been exploited for roughly $12 million through its V1 and V2 products, has issued an update stating that the V1 attacker has returned the exploited funds.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We will soon start scanning the data on-chain to find out who owned what prior to the hack in order to return them to the rightful owners. As different users had variable proportions of assets and debt, this process might take a little [time]," Defrost Finance devs stated through an official blog post.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the team, the first attack involved the use of a flash loan sequence to drain funds from its V2 product. Another exploit was launched using the owner key, gaining access to Defrost Finance's V1 product.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In decentralized finance protocols, liquidations occur when the value of a user's collateral falls below a protocol's minimum loan-to-value ratio. Defrost allows users to deposit collateral for a loan, which the protocol uses to calculate the interest rate on that loan. Fake collateral introduced into V2 likely compromised users' loan-to-value ratios, leading to their liquidations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The protocol is built on top of the Avalanche blockchain. What's curious is that blockchain security firms such as Peckshield have claimed that the attack was more of an inside job, and has been considered a rug pull.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Decentralized leverage trading protocol Defrost Finance, which recently disclosed that its protocol has been exploited for roughly $12 million through its V1 and V2 products, has issued an update stating that the V1 attacker has returned the exploited funds.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"We will soon start scanning the data on-chain to find out who owned what prior to the hack in order to return them to the rightful owners. As different users had variable proportions of assets and debt, this process might take a little [time]," Defrost Finance devs stated through an official blog post.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">According to the team, the first attack involved the use of a flash loan sequence to drain funds from its V2 product. Another exploit was launched using the owner key, gaining access to Defrost Finance's V1 product.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In decentralized finance protocols, liquidations occur when the value of a user's collateral falls below a protocol's minimum loan-to-value ratio. Defrost allows users to deposit collateral for a loan, which the protocol uses to calculate the interest rate on that loan. Fake collateral introduced into V2 likely compromised users' loan-to-value ratios, leading to their liquidations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The protocol is built on top of the Avalanche blockchain. What's curious is that blockchain security firms such as Peckshield have claimed that the attack was more of an inside job, and has been considered a rug pull.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">CertiK, another blockchain security and auditing firm, confirmed that they have been unable to establish contact with the Defrost Finance team, leading to the firm posting a warning on its Twitter account which indicated that the Defrost Finance hack was instead an exit scam.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Road Town, BVI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire</p><p>Santa Browser has announced the Version 1 launch of its web3 browser today. Built for an emerging crypto world, the browser claims to bring in the next generation of web3 users by developing tools that allow anyone to leverage the power of blockchain technologies. Due to the extreme volatility of the market, Santa is dedicated to building a &ldquo;Trustable Technology Stack&rdquo; that users can firmly rely upon while browsing the web. With the Christmas release of Santa Browser, users can now earn crypto rewards simply by browsing.</p>
"We believe that browsers need to evolve a lot more to keep up with the pace at which the internet is evolving." said Alekh B, CEO of Santa Browser. "Our approach to Santa Browser is deeply influenced by the principles of web3 &mdash; Anti Monopoly, Transparency, Democracy, Data Privacy, Security &amp; Fair Distribution Of Wealth."
Why Santa Browser?
<p>Browse-2-Earn 
On a mission to reimagine the web, the browser starts with the relationship between users &amp; advertising. With Santa&rsquo;s Browse2Earn, users can earn crypto rewards for their regular activities online (rewards include but are not limited to ad monetization, search monetization, discounted shopping, etc.) while maintaining control over their privacy.</p>
<p>Geared For Privacy

<ul>
  <li>Integrated ad blocker &mdash; to stop all invasive ads.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Tracker blocker &mdash; &nbsp;to stop all online trackers &amp; browser fingerprinting practices.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Ungoogling &mdash; while forked from chromium, the browser has been cleansed of all Google trackers, host detectors (tools that identify your IP address) &amp; other privacy-harming features.</li>
  <li>Santa also disables other features inherent in the base Chromium build that inhibit control and transparency, while adding/modifying features that promote them. This is an ongoing process.</li>
  <li>Santa&rsquo;s partnership with Eyeo ensures that only Acceptable Ads that abide by the criteria specially developed for and by ad-filtering users, and are non-intrusive are allowed to interact with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>Military Grade Security
Santa Browser's code has been reviewed and tested for vulnerabilities by Veracode, a programme that validates a company's secure software development processes. Veracode Secure code review certification echoes Santa Browser's mature practices for creating secure software.</p>
<p>Planned Features
Updates in the next few weeks will see the phased release of interesting features such as free single-tab VPN, an immersive dApp store and the browser&rsquo;s very own decentralized &ldquo;Santa Wallet&rdquo; where users can easily collect their rewards.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Japanese regulators are reconsidering lifting the ban on cryptocurrency restrictions related to foreign stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) in 2023 according to reports by local news agencies. </p>
<p>According to reports by local news agency Nikkei, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan is to reconsider major cryptocurrency strictions related to the distribution of foreign issued stablecoins in 2023. The report indicates that the new stablecoin regulations in the country will allow local exchanges to handle stablecoin trading under the condition of asset preservation by deposits and an upper limit of remittance. The report notes:</p>

<p>If payment using stablecoins spreads, international remittances may become faster and cheaper.</p>

<p>In June 2022, Japan&rsquo;s parliament passed a bill to ban stablecoin issuance by non-banking institutions. The FSA said that by now allowing stablecoin distribution in Japan will also necessitate additional regulations related to Anti-Money Laundering controls. The FSA&rsquo;s most recent announcement will have a major impact on crypto trading services offered in the country as currently no local exchanges are permitted to provide trading in stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. None of the 31 Japanese exchanges registered with the FSA were handling stablecoin trading as of November 30, 2022, according to official data.</p>
Japan Eases Corporate Tax Rates for Token Issuers
<p>Japan&rsquo;s news on the lift of the ban on stablecoin issuance comes not long after it passed other very bullish news on cryptocurrencies. Earlier in the month, Japan&rsquo;s ruling Liberal Democratic Party approved a proposal that would exempt companies issuing cryptocurrencies from taxes on unrealised capital gains for tokens they retain on their books. The proposal aims to improve business conditions for companies issuing crypto as they are currently required to a pay a set 30% corporate tax rate on their holdings, regardless if they have realised a profit through a sale or not.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Gains Minor Traction:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 27 December 2022</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) found a minor bid early in the Asian session as the pair climbed as high as the 16887.96 area after being lifted from the 16720 area in a continuation of the recent tight trading range around the 16880.44 area, a level that represents the 23.6% retracement of the depreciating range from 21478.80 to 15460.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent rebound saw BTC/USD test the 18469.40 area, a level it could not sustain as elevated risk aversion resulted in more downward pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp; Selling pressure recently intensified around the 18385.36 and 17525 levels and BTC/USD tested downside price objectives related to these levels, including the 16375.18 area.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional related downside price objectives related to these areas of selling pressure include the 15900, 15313, and 14364 levels.&nbsp; If BTC/USD reclaims some upside momentum, additional technically significant upside retracement levels include the 18495, 19199, 20070, and 20201 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTC/USD has depreciated approximately 63% year-to-date, and is off more than 1% month-to-date.&nbsp; Below current price activity, BTC/USD bears are eyeing a possible test of recent two-year lows around the 15460 area, established after Stops were elected below the 15512 area.&nbsp; Notably, the 15512 level represented an exact bearish price objective based on selling pressure that strengthened around the 21478.80 and 18495.50 areas.&nbsp; Below these areas, technically significant levels include the 14613, 14500.15, 13369, 10432.73, 10727, 9682, 8837, and 7538 levels.&nbsp; Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;below the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (hourly) and above the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 16846.69 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 16826.77.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;14500.15/ 13369.11/ 10727.75 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;18495.40/ 19199.48/ 20070.64 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On&nbsp;4-Hourly&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bullishly above SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is Bullishly above MACDAverage.</p>
<p>On&nbsp;60-minute&nbsp;chart,&nbsp;SlowK&nbsp;is Bearishly below SlowD&nbsp;while&nbsp;MACD&nbsp;is&nbsp;Bearishly below MACDAverage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
