            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Prague, Czech Republic, May 25th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Conference and Hackathon set for June 3-5 to start Prague Blockchain Week </strong></em></p>
<p><a href="https://gateway.events/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Gateway to Cosmos</a> 2023 announced today the speakers and sponsors for the three-day in-person conference and hackathon in Prague June 3-5 that will bring together top Web3 minds to shape the future of Cosmos, the Internet of blockchains.</p>
<p>The event, which will kick off <a href="https://explore.prgblockweek.com/23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Prague Blockchain Week</a>, where Vitalik Buterin is a confirmed attendee, and will be the largest Cosmos community gathering in Europe, with 40+ exceptional speakers, 30+ presentations, 10 panel discussions, and 15 workshops.</p>
<p>In addition to attending scheduled addresses, an anticipated 600 attendees will have a chance to browse the booths in the Cosmos Gateway Expo, talk to project and vendor teams, network with fellow Cosmonauts – as community members refer to one another – or visit the oasis of the Neutron Hackers Lounge for a chance to code, chat and chill.</p>
<p>Cosmos and its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol solves what was previously a key challenge for builders in Web3 &#8211; the need to select a blockchain, like Ethereum, Avalanche, Solana, or Aptos, to build their applications upon. Projects benefit if that chain’s adoption grows, because a vibrant application ecosystem means more users, and better user journeys. With Cosmos / IBC technology, builders now launch applications that are operational across chains from Day 1, and can focus only on developing great products and businesses.</p>
<p>The conference will showcase the ecosystem’s leading projects and startups, technical roadmap developments, investment trends, and offer a window on adjacent technologies, like privacy and scaling solutions, with the potential to advance today’s most exciting blockchain use cases.</p>
<p>“While other blockchain technologies that were once the darlings of builders, users, and investors have struggled in this more bearish environment, Cosmos is uniquely on the rise. It has attracted more developers than almost any other blockchain ecosystem &#8211; a testament to the now-clear benefits of “app-chains,” and the limitations of public blockchains. Cosmos has emerged as a main rival to Ethereum to house the future of decentralized finance (DeFi),” said Samantha Bohbot of RockawayX, the global venture capital firm and an organizer of the conference.</p>
<p>Speakers will include leaders of prominent projects that use Cosmos and Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) technology, including Osmosis Co-Founder Sunny Aggarwal, Sommelier Co-Founder Zaki Manian, Agoric Co-Founder Dean Tribble, and Juno Co-Founder Jake Hartwell, just to name a few. Others, like Node Capital’s Amos Meiri, The Block’s Frank Chapparro, and Binance’s Kiril Khomiakov will offer fresh perspectives from outside Cosmos’ borders.</p>
<p>Gateway to Cosmos 2023 builds on the success of last year’s Rockaway-hosted<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiyfbQ91bm8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> inaugural conference</a>, a buzzy, packed event that drew 300+ attendees and was rated a success by guests and speakers alike.</p>
<p>Day One, Launching The Rocket into Cosmos, will feature the best use cases already in production as well as those hitting the launchpad in the near future. Keynote addresses will come from key representatives of Cosmos, Interchain, Informal, Agoric, Celestia, Sommelier, and NYM, among others.</p>
<p>Day Two will focus on steering the Cosmos rocket in the right direction. Speakers will lift the hood and offer deep insight into topics such as governance, interoperability, and decentralization at large.</p>
<p>Day Three will be all about welcoming new Cosmonauts on board–milestones ahead for leading projects and what’s required to develop and scale the next generation of “killer decentralized applications.”</p>
<p>The event’s partners span the top companies using Cosmos and IBC technology today and leaders across the digital asset space, including Halborn, Flow Traders, Fraction, SubQuery, and more.</p>
<h2>About Cosmos</h2>
<p>Cosmos Hub is the gateway to a rapidly expanding ecosystem of independent interconnected blockchains built using developer-friendly application components and connected with ground-breaking IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) protocol.</p>
<h2>About RockawayX</h2>
<p>RockawayX has been investing in early-stage crypto companies and token projects since 2017. In addition to running VC strategies and a credit fund, the firm operates businesses that provide critical services to the digital asset space. Its infrastructure arm runs nodes on leading decentralized networks, and it operates a crypto security business that offers smart contract audits and code diligence services to crypto protocols. Rockaway&#8217;s web3 venture studio incubates and spins out products that address gaps in web3 infrastructure and its commercial ecosystem.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Renton, United States, May 25th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://stably.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Stably</a>, a leading Stablecoin-as-a-Service (SCaaS) and fiat on/off-ramp infrastructure provider for Web3 projects, is aiming to revolutionize the nascent Bitcoin ordinals market by launching its US Dollar (USD)-backed stablecoin, <a href="https://stably.io/brc20-usd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Stably USD</a>, as a natively-issued BRC20 token under the symbol <strong>#USD</strong>. This groundbreaking development marks a critical milestone in the exponentially growing Bitcoin ordinals ecosystem that is now reaching half a billion dollars in total market capitalization in less than six months.</p>
<p>#USD is a BRC20 standard stablecoin created via the Bitcoin <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ordinals protocol</a> which was introduced in January 2023 after the recent <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/releases/0.21.1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Taproot</a> upgrade. BRC20 tokens use a technique called ordinal inscriptions to attach data to individual &#8220;satoshis,&#8221; the smallest unit of a Bitcoin. These satoshis can then represent anything from digital art ownership to “meme coins” and even stablecoins.</p>
<p>According to Stably, every #USD token is backed 1-to-1 with USD in a collateral account managed by a US-regulated custodian for the benefit of KYC/AML-verified token holders. Monthly reports for the account are also conducted by a third-party stablecoin attestor to ensure #USD tokens are always fully collateralized with USD.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<strong>When I met Domo, the creator of the BRC20 standard, at the Bitcoin 2023 conference in Miami, I told him about our upcoming plans for #USD</strong>,&#8221; said Kory Hoang, Stably’s CEO and Co-Founder. “<strong>He thought it was great and funny how we are creating a stablecoin on Bitcoin to enable Bitcoin trading on-chain… With a stablecoin built on Bitcoin. I’m still chuckling about it to this day, actually</strong>. <strong>In just one week after that, however, we made it happen!</strong>”</p></blockquote>
<p>The integration of BRC20 #USD into the Bitcoin network is part of Stably’s mission to power the next billion Web3 users with a seamless fiat-to-crypto and stablecoin onramp to all popular and emerging blockchain networks. The company’s upcoming collaborations with prominent ordinals and BRC20 projects, including UniSat–the world’s largest decentralized wallet/marketplace for ordinals–and Ordzaar–Asia’s first decentralized ordinals marketplace project, reflect Stably&#8217;s aspiration to drive global innovation and adoption toward decentralized finance on the Bitcoin network, or “BitFi.” Additionally, Stably’s engineers are now exploring the new ORC20 standard for Bitcoin ordinals, which could significantly enhance the token properties of #USD once implemented.</p>
<p>#USD can be issued/redeemed with Fedwire, SWIFT, USDC, and USDT by KYC-verified users across 200+ countries/regions currently, including up to 44 US states. Stably states that it is employing a <a href="https://support.stably.io/en/articles/7933928-how-to-buy-and-sell-brc20-usd" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">manual process</a> of issuance/redemption for #USD’s initial launch but plans to release support for automatic issuance/redemption through Stably Ramp, the company&#8217;s plug-and-play fiat gateway widget, during Q3 2023. By then, users of #USD will be able to on/off-ramp via more traditional payment methods like ACH, instant ACH, and credit/debit cards, in addition to bank wires.</p>
<p>Founded in 2018, the 20+ team member Seattle FinTech is backed by leading institutional and angel investors in the crypto space, such as Morgan Creek Capital, BEENEXT, 500 Startups, Hard Yaka, CREAM Labs, Sunny Lu of VeChain, and Paul Stahura of Donuts, Inc. The company has raised over $7.5-million in total funding to-date, $5-million of which was collected during its last Pre-Series A round in December 2021. Stably has also expanded its fiat on/off-ramp and stablecoin natively to more than ten emerging networks, including Arbitrum, XRP Ledger, Stellar, Tezos, VeChainThor, Harmony, Polymesh, Coreum, ICON, and Chia Network.</p>
<h2 class="ql-align-justify">About Stably</h2>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Stably is a Web3 payment infrastructure provider and FinCEN-registered MSB from Seattle. The company specializes in providing stablecoins and fiat &lt;&gt; crypto on and off-ramps to users of Web3 applications. Stably’s mission is to power this decade’s next billion Web3 users with regulatory-compliant payment infrastructure across both developed and emerging blockchain ecosystems.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[South Korean politicians now must report their crypto holdings as they do cash, stocks, bonds, or gold. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">South Korea’s National Assembly has officially passed a bill into law requiring lawmakers and high-ranking government officials to disclose their crypto asset holdings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The new law is a response to a recent scandal involving a politician allegedly violating campaign finance laws using cryptocurrency. </span></p>
<h2>The “Kim Nam-guk Prevention Law”</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a </span><a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/5058538" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> from local news agency News1, the relevant amendments to the National Assembly Act and Public Service Ethics Act passed unanimously on May 22 among all lawmakers present for each, with 269 votes and 268 votes respectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The National Assembly Act amendment puts cryptocurrency on the list of lawmakers’ registered properties and “private interests.” Meanwhile, the amendment to the Public Officials Ethics Act passed the Public Administration and Security Committee on the same day, making both high-ranking officials and National Assembly members need to register their holdings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bill was originally scheduled for implementation in December but was </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/south-koreas-ppp-seeks-to-speed-up-bill-requiring-lawmakers-crypto-holdings-disclosure/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">fast-tracked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to this month after the conservative People Power Party’s newly elected leader, Rep. Yun Jae-ok, said the previous date was “too late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Given the current high level of public interest, especially regarding lawmakers, it’s not appropriate to enforce the law six months later after the promulgation,” said the party leader last week, while proposing a fast-tracked version of the bill last week. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The “public interest” refers to a high-profile scandal surrounding Kim Nam-guk – who was alleged to have cashed out $4.5 million in cryptocurrency at Wemix exchange early last year. The same lawmaker backed legislation in 2022 to defer a law implementing a 20% capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies from 2023 to 2025, though he’s denied there being any conflicts of interest. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, the revelations invited investigations into the former Democratic Party lawmaker for suspected campaign finance violations, tax portals, and criminal possession of crypto. </span></p>
<h2>Which Politicians Hold Crypto in America?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lawmakers in the United States are already required to disclose their crypto and Bitcoin holdings, among whom only a small number hold any digital assets. Senator Cynthia Lummis </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/i-only-have-5-bitcoin-senator-lummis-encourages-people-to-buy-and-hold-btc/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">revealed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in 2021 that she owns 5 BTC – three of which she bought for just $300. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Senator Ted Cruz has also confessed to owning a little more than 2 BTC, respecting the asset as a long-term inflation hedge and decentralized governance. Last month, he </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/heres-why-senator-ted-cruz-likes-and-owns-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">said</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that he has a standing order to buy more Bitcoin every Monday morning. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like bitcoin for the same reason that the Chinese communist government doesn’t like bitcoin,” he said. “They don’t like bitcoin, and they banned it because they can’t control it.” </span></p></blockquote>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin is around 60% since the turn of the year, and while that doesn’t necessarily signal the end of the crypto winter, it’s a sign that investors who have been holding off on the world’s largest cryptocurrency may have missed their chance to buy in while it was undervalued.</p>
<p>However, there are still plenty of explosive opportunities in the crypto market for investors who are willing to look beyond Bitcoin. We’ll take a closer look at Bitcoin’s price and highlight 5 emerging altcoins that could generate massive returns in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Momentum Stalls, Some Analysts See Bearish Move Ahead</h2>
<p>After a year of crypto winter, Bitcoin had an impressive start to 2023. The token gained more than 80% in the first four months of the year and briefly broke through the key $30,000 price level in mid-April.</p>
<p>However, bullish momentum in BTC has stalled in the past month. Bitcoin has been unable to remain above $30,000. Instead, the token has remained in a range between $27,000 and $30,000, with the price <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumped-to-2-week-low-apecoin-nosedives-8-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">recently sliding</a> to $26,250.</p>
<figure id="attachment_252408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252408" style="width: 1379px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-252408" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="1379" height="886" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2.jpg 1379w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2-300x193.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2-768x493.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-2-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-252408" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<p>Some crypto analysts see this as a worrying trend for Bitcoin. If the token can’t firmly break through resistance at $30,000, it is likely to fall to its next support level around $23,000 &#8211; that would represent a 12% loss from today’s price.</p>
<p>The macroeconomic picture for Bitcoin is equally uncertain. Although a pause in interest rate hikes by the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to be positive for BTC, continued high rates and fears of a recession have turned investors away from cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>At the same time, BTC faces increasing scrutiny in the US and abroad for the energy required to mine it. New restrictions on mining could make BTC less accessible and decrease demand for the token, thus holding down the price for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>All of these trends suggest that while Bitcoin may still be well below its all-time high, it’s more likely to go through another round of bearish price action before it surges, with a true crypto bull run not expected until 2024 with the next halving approaching.</p>
<p>So, investors in search of speedy profits in the crypto market may be better served by exploring altcoins that are gaining traction right now.</p>
<h2>AiDoge Raises $13.5 Million for AI-powered Meme Generation</h2>
<p>AiDoge is a meme coin that’s leveraging generative AI to make meme creation easier than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252409" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="1379" height="745" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3.jpg 1379w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3-300x162.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3-1024x553.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3-768x415.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-3-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px" /></a></p>
<p>AiDoge users just need to describe the meme they want to create, and the AI will take care of the rest. Within seconds, it will provide a custom image and text that users can customize.</p>
<p>AiDoge enables users to mint their creations as NFTs before sharing them. That way, if a meme goes viral, users can verifiably claim ownership over the latest trend.</p>
<p>In order to create memes with AiDoge, users will need the project’s native AI token. Users who stake AI earn daily credits to use the meme generation algorithm. This incentivizes long-term investing while encouraging users to create new memes.</p>
<p>The AiDoge presale is going on now and has already raised more than $13.5 million in just four weeks. Investors need to hurry if they want to join the presale—less than 10% of AI tokens allocated to the presale remain available and the project could hold an ICO in the next few weeks.</p>

<h2>Launchpad XYZ to Drive Mainstream Web3 Adoption with Gateway Portal</h2>
<p>Launchpad XYZ is another crypto presale project that is quickly grabbing the attention of investors.</p>
<p>The new protocol will act as a gateway platform for new Web3 users and crypto natives by providing a broad range of tools and access to help drive mass adoption.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252410" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-3.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="312" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-3-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-3-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The project, which has its own Web3 wallet, will simplify Web3 navigation by providing an easy portal to various different marketplaces, experiences, and protocols.</p>
<p>That includes a decentralized exchange, NFT marketplace, play-to-earn gaming hub and metaverse library, a trading terminal, fractionalized assets, and whitelist spots to the best new crypto presales.</p>
<p>Launchpad XYZ, which has been developed by a doxxed and experienced group, is powered by LPX, a utility token that is needed to earn access to all the different features on offer.</p>
<p>The Launchpad XYZ presale has already raised more than $600k, with LPX tokens currently on sale for $0.0445 during stage 2 of 10, with the price to increase to $0.0565 in the final stage.</p>

<h2>yPredict Builds AI-powered Crypto Trading Platform with 20,000+ Backers</h2>
<p>yPredict is a new crypto project that’s using AI to help traders achieve greater profits in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252411" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="1379" height="833" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2.jpg 1379w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2-300x181.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2-1024x619.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2-768x464.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-2-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px" /></a></p>
<p>The project is building a suite of AI-powered predictive modeling tools. Analysts, quants, and developers can use these tools to create custom models that predict where the price of a crypto asset will be in hours, days, or weeks.</p>
<p>Model builders can share their models with traders on a subscription basis through yPredict’s marketplace. yPredict gets a cut of each subscription, and it shares 10% of that revenue back to traders who stake its native YPRED token.</p>
<p>In addition to the predictive models, yPredict is building a custom trading terminal that’s loaded with other AI features. The platform will support automated chart pattern recognition, social sentiment analysis, trading from charts, and more.</p>
<p>YPRED, which is built on the Polygon Matic network, is available to buy now through the yPredict presale. It’s currently priced at $0.07, a more than 40% discount from the planned list price of $0.12.</p>
<p>The yPredict presale has raised almost $1.7 million and the project has more than 20,000 users on its wait list. The next price increase is just days away.</p>

<h2>Ecoterra Pioneers Recycle-to-earn Ecosystem, Raises Over $4 Million</h2>
<p>Ecoterra is a green crypto project that’s promoting sustainability with a unique recycle-to-earn rewards system.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252412" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="1379" height="771" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2.jpg 1379w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2-1024x573.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2-768x429.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture5-2-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px" /></a></p>
<p>The recycle-to-earn system revolves around Ecoterra’s Web3 app. Users scan the barcode of the packaging they want to recycle, and Ecoterra matches it to material in its database.</p>
<p>Once users deposit their recyclables at a reverse vending machine, Ecoterra releases ECOTERRA tokens as a reward.</p>
<p>Users can hold onto their ECOTERRA or exchange them, but they can also use ECOTERRA to buy carbon credits. Ecoterra has partnered with solar and wind energy projects to offer certified carbon credits that can offset users’ own emissions.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to Ecoterra, including a marketplace and sustainability report cards for businesses. The platform has the potential to become one of the key players in an eco-friendly revolution.</p>
<p>Ecoterra is currently offering ECOTERRA on presale at only $0.0085, a discount of 15% from the expected listing price. The presale has raised more than $4.25 million so far, indicating that investors have a lot of confidence in this project’s future.</p>

<h2>Deelance Raises Over $1 Million to Change the Future of Work</h2>
<p>Deelance is reimagining the future of work and taking on established companies like Upwork, Freelancer, and Fiverr.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252413" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1.jpg" alt="Picture6" width="1379" height="787" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1.jpg 1379w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1-300x171.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1-1024x584.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1-768x438.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture6-1-50x29.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px" /></a></p>
<p>This crypto project is building a decentralized, Web3 freelance marketplace that offers lower fees and more powerful features than existing marketplaces. Deelance plans to charge just 2% for businesses, the lowest fee in the industry.</p>
<p>One of Deelance’s innovations is to enable freelancers to be paid in crypto, thus eliminating costly foreign transaction fees. The platform is also creating a way to turn intellectual property into NFTs, thus resolving questions over who owns what aspects of a piece of contract work.</p>
<p>Deelance is also creating a metaverse where freelancers and businesses can meet. The metaverse will enable users to advertise their services, rent virtual office space, host meetings, and much more.</p>
<p>In order to rent space or ads in Deelance’s virtual world, freelancers and businesses will need DLANCE. This ERC-20 token is on presale now at a price of $0.033. The presale has already raised more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Deelance expects to launch DLANCE at a price of $0.057, so early investors have a chance to lock in paper returns of 72%.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[While the financial system remains safe from crypto right now, growing interconnectedness combined with a run on a major stablecoin could cause that to change, says the EU.  ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) published a report on Thursday outlining the top 3 nightmare scenarios in which a crypto industry crisis could bleed in and pose “systemic risk” to the broader financial system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The top risk listed is a potential run on a “large reserve-backed stablecoin,” such as Tether (USDT) or USD Coin (USDC). </span></p>
<h2>Crypto’s Connection to TradFi</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In its 77-page <a href="https://www.esrb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/reports/esrb.cryptoassetsanddecentralisedfinance202305~9792140acd.en.pdf?853d899dcdf41541010cd3543aa42d37" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">report</a>, the ESRB argued that as the volatile crypto industry grows, so too does its connection to the mainstream financial world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The board doesn’t believe this interconnectedness poses any sort of “systemic risk” to “fundamental services” in the immediate future, noting “only sporadic correlation between the booms and busts of crypto-assets and traditional finance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, there are a variety of ways that this risk can manifest down the line. These include a failure to identify how forms of interconnectedness develop, and further adoption of crypto technologies within traditional finance itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, one of the main connections between crypto and TradFi are reserve backed stablecoins. These are crypto-assets that remain price pegged to a relatively price-stable, non-crypto asset like fiat currency or gold, and are backed by reserves containing those assets. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A run on a reserve-backed stablecoin would generate forced selling of marketable debt and withdrawals from banks,” wrote the ESRB. “There is always the possibility that this could turn into a broader panic.”</span></p></blockquote>
<h2>Stablecoin Panic</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stablecoin panic is nothing new to the crypto industry. In May 2022, Tether suffered </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/tethers-circulating-supply-reduced-by-7-billion-in-a-week/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">withdrawal pressure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> within the billions of dollars in May 2022, but still managed to keep its peg to the dollar. USDC depegged for multiple days in March 2023 after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which held much of the reserves backing the coin, prompting many holders to flee into USDT. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crypto is also connected to TradFi through banks and other institutions that facilitate conversions between crypto assets and fiat currency. The board noted that these institutions can also face runs and fail – much like Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate bank, and Signature Bank in March. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Overall, at this stage, this report concludes that the connections between the crypto-asset and traditional financial worlds remain extremely modest.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from a stablecoin run, the board claimed that a rise of prominence in crypto assets within the payment system could cause risk to transmit into the TradFi world. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned of similar risks surrounding El Salvador, to which it </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/president-bukele-bites-back-as-el-salvador-snubs-imfs-advice-to-stop-using-bitcoin/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">recommends</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> abandoning Bitcoin as legal tender. </span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[ Base clarified that there no plans to issue a network token.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coinbase-incubated Base is gearing up for a mainnet launch as the Ethereum layer 2 ecosystem heats up. Path to Base mainnet includes a certain set of objectives to be met. The official timeline for the mainnet launch has not been revealed yet, but Optimism&#8217;s upcoming Bedrock upgrade remains a crucial factor.</p>
<h2>Base Mainnet</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/coinbase-launch-eth-layer-2-network-based-on-optimism-op-token-pumps-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Base</a> testnet, which is based on a roll-up agnostic superchain powered by Optimism, has been running since February this year, during which it focused on aspects such as auditing the OP Stack and Base infrastructure to increase platform security, as well as load testing the infrastructure to ensure ot can support scale.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We’ve been building towards Mainnet Genesis, the first step of delivering a decentralized platform that scales Ethereum with fast, low-cost and secure transactions.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>While Base is currently being incubated by Coinbase, the end goal for it is to become fully decentralized. Mainnet Genesis is the first step towards achieving the same, the latest <a href="https://base.mirror.xyz/gxOzGCE-9C7cNZBCo4Ubkkxr87L8BcHDfn5HViSdYGg" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">blog post</a> announced. So far, Base has reported the completion of the Regolith hard fork on the testnet. An infrastructure review with the OP Labs team has also been conducted.</p>
<p>Base is now anticipating a successful upgrade of Optimism&#8217;s Bedrock in addition to the completion of reviews. Moving forward, the layer 2 platform said that it will work towards completing its protocol audits with no critical issues as well as maintaining testnet stability.</p>
<h2>Bedrock Upgrade</h2>
<p>The popular layer-2 blockchain, Optimism, had recently <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/optimism-bedrock-upgrade-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">announced</a> that the long-awaited Bedrock upgrade is slated for June 6th and will require 2-4 hours of downtime for OP Mainnet.</p>
<p>The main aim of the upgrade is to significantly cut down on transaction fees, improve network security, and enhance compatibility with Ethereum, thereby paving a new era of efficiency and functionality for the Optimism network as it faces stiff competition from other layer 2 networks.</p>
<p>It also represents the first network upgrade to receive a green light from the Optimism governance council’s Token House.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The BNB Chain Luban upgrade is right around the corner. Here's what users can expect from it.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;Build &#8216;N&#8217; Build&#8221; Chain, formerly known as the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) will be going through a hard fork in June. The network upgrade is called Luban and will introduce three evolution proposals.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>
<ul>
<li>The BSC Luban upgrade is scheduled to take place on June 11th, provided regular network activity. It is a hard fork and will introduce the implementation of three evolution proposals (BEPs). Namely, these are BEP-126, BEP-174, and BEP-221.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc/releases/tag/v1.2.4" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">According</a> to the official GitHub repo update, this is what the upgrades will deliver.</li>
<li>BEP-126 (in its first part) is aimed at introducing a &#8220;fast finality mechanism.&#8221; In essence, this is a step that aims to finalize a block and once the block has been finalized, it will not be reverted forever. The 7-step process is thoroughly explained <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP126.md" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>BEP-174 is titled Cross Chain Relayer Management. The proposal introduces a brand new governance proposal type that&#8217;s designed to manage the set of whitelisted relayers. In more non-technical language, it&#8217;s aimed at introducing a new way to manage Relayer Manager public keys that will be stored in the genesis contract on the BSC. Relayer Managers will be able to manage their individual relayer public keys.</li>
<li>The last one is the CometBFT Light Block Validation proposal (BEP-221) and it proposes a system that would add a new contract to the networks that make use of the technology.</li>
</ul>

			            <description><![CDATA[Worldcoin closes a successful fundraising round of $115 million backed by some of crypto's most prominent VCs. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following OpenAI&#8217;s astonishing success, another project backed by its CEO Sam Altman has closed a significant funding round amidst a bleak year for crypto investments.</p>
<p>The crypto ID project &#8211; Worldcoin &#8211; has raised $115 million in a Series C funding round led by Blockchain Capital. Other participants in the funding round include a16z, Bain Capital, and Distributed Global.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worldcoin, which falls under the umbrella company of Tools for Humanity, is a unique open-source protocol that involves scanning people&#8217;s irises.</li>
<li>According to its website, the biometrics are captured by the Worldcoin Orb, an imaging device that captures users&#8217; irises and high-resolution images of their bodies and face.</li>
<li>Worldcoin has had a controversial start since it first leaked in mid-2021. Despite reports of security lapses, the platform claimed to have <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/openai-boss-sam-altman-to-raise-100m-for-worldcoin-crypto-project-ft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">exceeded</a> a million signups and between 100 and 200 Orbs operational at any given time.</li>
<li>The high-profile project also gained tremendous traction in China more recently.</li>
<li><a href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Reports</a> alleged that fraudsters are purchasing iris scans from the black market to register on the platform.</li>
<li>In response, Worldcoin said that the company does not have an issue with iris scans on the black market but revealed the detection of numerous cases of fraud involving its digital passport, the verification protocol that is used to determine real identities.</li>
<li>Prior to this, TechCrunch had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/12/hackers-stole-passwords-of-worldcoin-orb-operators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">claimed</a> that hackers were able to install password-collecting malware onto the devices of WorldCoin operators.</li>
