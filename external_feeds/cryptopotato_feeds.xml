			            <description><![CDATA[The two main factors for this are believed to be increased scrutiny, blacklisting, and increased attention from law enforcement.
]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A good number of high-profile attacks on the crypto ecosystem took place last year, targeting everything and everyone from Phantom wallets to smart contracts themselves.</p>
<p>A common choice of <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/random-numbers-dont-lie-a-closer-technical-look-into-recent-defi-hacks/" data-wpel-link="internal">target</a> was cross-chain bridges, which allowed hackers to make off with serious bounties, most notably in the case of Harmony.</p>
<h2>Sharp Decrease in Attacks</h2>
<p>However, times seem to be changing, according to a new report from cybersecurity researchers at TRMLabs.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.trmlabs.com/post/crypto-hacks-down-70-in-q1-2023" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">paper</a>, the total value stolen via exploits and hacks has decreased by 70% year-over-year since Q1 2022. Although this may seem biased, considering that Q1 2022 was when the $600 million Ronin bridge <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/largest-crypto-hack-ever-ronin-bridge-exploited-for-600m-in-eth-and-usdc/" data-wpel-link="internal">attack</a> took place, the data holds up even when the rest of 2022 is taken into account. In total, almost $3.7 billion worth of funds were stolen by bad actors last year.</p>
<p>In fact, less value was stolen during Q1 2023 than in any quarter of 2022. In the previous quarter of 2023, the total value stolen only added up to about $400 million across nearly 40 separate attacks – about two-thirds were from the Ronin Bridge hack alone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the victims of the attacks often manage to get back part of the stolen bounty, which is already, on average, a third of what it was a year ago.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The average hack size also took a hit in Q1 2023 – to USD 10.5 million from nearly USD 30 million in the same quarter of 2022, even as the number of incidents was similar (around 40). To date, hacking victims have recovered over half of all stolen funds in Q1 2023.”</p></blockquote>
<h2>Increased Scrutiny Prevents Losses</h2>
<p>Although it is impossible to tell the exact reason for the decline in the scope of the attacks – which could be anything between better cybersecurity measures, sheer boredom, or a guilty conscience – the researchers at TRMLabs believe increased attention from law enforcement officials may be the main contributor here.</p>
<p>Even in cases where the exploit that took place did not violate hacking laws, regulators still took action for other reasons. For instance, Avraham Eisenberg’s “profitable trading strategy” has landed him in <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/mango-markets-exploiter-avraham-eisenberg-wants-to-keep-47m-as-bounty/" data-wpel-link="internal">trouble</a> with the SEC, which charged him with manipulating securities.</p>
<p>Illegal exploits have also declined. Ever since Tornado Cash, the most well-known instrument for laundering dirty crypto, was sanctioned by the U.S., all addresses related to the mixer have been blacklisted, making it harder for cybercriminals to cash out the proceeds of their attacks.</p>
<p>However, the researchers warn that this lull in attacks may be temporary and urge crypto devs to remain alert.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The FBI noted that these types of scams often target Asia-based victims. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) issued a warning on fake job ads that lure people to Southeast Asia, where &#8220;victims are held against their will and forced to commit international crypto scams on unsuspecting victims.&#8221;</p>
<p>These scam mills usually put up ads on social media and lure their victims by promising well-paid jobs. Upon arrival, however, victims have their passports taken and are forced to work by scamming innocent people. Furthermore, if workers were unsuccessful, they would reportedly face torture, abuse, murder, or be sold to another gang.</p>
<h2>FBI Issues Warning</h2>
<p>According to the press <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2023/PSA230522#fn2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">release</a>, the FBI warned US citizens and individuals living or traveling abroad to be cautious of false job advertisements linked to labor trafficking. The intelligence service said threat actors target victims, primarily in Asia, in employment fraud schemes by posting false job advertisements on social media and online employment sites.</p>
<p>The fake jobs could range from tech support, call center customer service, and beauty salon technicians, the FBI stated. Lucrative benefits, salaries, and accommodation are offered in order to lure victims.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Often throughout the process, the location for the position is shifted from the advertised location. Upon job seekers’ arrival in the foreign country, criminal actors use multiple means to coerce them to commit cryptocurrency investment schemes, such as confiscation of passports and travel documents, the threat of violence, and use of violence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The victims are then forced to must pay off mounting debt &#8211; travel fees, room, and board. When the debt gets worse when they’re often sold to other criminal groups.</p>
<p>The FBI has detailed a few steps to avoid falling into such traps. This includes researching the advertised company before accepting a job offer, as well as keeping an eye out for &#8220;vague language&#8221; about the company or limited employment details. Job-seekers should also be wary of advertisements with unusually high salaries and many perks.</p>
<h2>Crypto Scam Rings</h2>
<p>The latest warning comes amidst numerous reports of crypto scam rings using enslaved individuals. In November last year, the Cambodian government found itself on the receiving end of severe backlash for allegedly turning a blind eye to Chinese crime rings that human trafficked almost 100,000 migrant workers and forced them to run online scams, including fraudulent crypto ICOs.</p>
<p>More recently, Philippine National Police (PNP) <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/philippine-police-bust-crypto-scam-rescues-over-1000-human-trafficking-victims-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">rescued</a> 1,000 human trafficking victims who were forced to toil up to 18 hours a day for cryptocurrency scams earlier this month. After busting the scam ring, the authorities arrested 12 suspected ringleaders.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been consolidating within a narrow range after breaking below the 50-day moving average. The market is currently situated between two notable levels, leaving room for several potential scenarios to unfold.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h2>The Daily Chart:</h2>
<p>The price on the daily timeframe has yet to display a notable upward or downward movement. If a rally takes place in the upcoming weeks, the first resistance level to watch is the 50-day moving average positioned around $28K, followed by the crucial $30K level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, for holders, the key support areas to rely on are the $25K level and the 200-day moving average of around $23K. The RSI indicator remains below the 50% threshold without much movement, indicating the current bearish momentum and increasing the likelihood of a downward move in the short term.</p>
<figure id="attachment_252703" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252703" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-252703 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_2705231" width="2560" height="1441" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-300x169.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-768x432.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-2048x1153.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/BTCUSDT-Daily-May-27-2023-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-252703" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>The 4-Hour Chart:</h2>
<p>On the 4-hour chart, the price remains within a significant descending channel. Although there was a recent upward push prompted by the minor support level at $26K, there is still a strong possibility of a decline towards the lower boundary of the channel and the support area at $25K.</p>
<p>Conversely, for a rally to occur, the market must first break through the resistance level at $27,500. If this happens, the chances of a breakout above the channel and a subsequent retest of the resistance area at $30K would increase.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/profile/u/Edris?tab=quicktake" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Edris</a></strong></p>
<h3>Bitcoin Miners Reserve</h3>
<p>While Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been relatively stagnant, examining on-chain metrics can help us understand the underlying dynamics.</p>
<p>The following chart focuses on the Bitcoin miner reserve metric, which quantifies the amount of BTC held by miners, a significant group within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>The data clearly illustrates a consistent decline in this metric over the past 9 months, indicating that miners have been selling their coins to cover operational expenses or mitigate risks in an uncertain macroeconomic climate.</p>
<p>This decline has intensified, signifying that miners are capitalizing on the recent price increase to sell their coins at a higher level. If this trend persists, a bearish reversal will likely occur in the near future. The continuous selling pressure from miners could result in an oversupply of bitcoins in the market, leading to a potential downtrend in price.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The trader stands out because all their profits are realized, and they do not hold any bags.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On-chain analyst and whale tracker Nova has spotted a profitable average trader that became a whale within five months. The said wallet 0x*************121F760e, who has “nailed” every trade since January, has a record of more than 10,000% realized profit.</p>
<p>Nova noted that the whale’s success stemmed from good trading strategies, not luck, as they had properly managed every win and loss.</p>
<h2>From Average Trader to Whale</h2>
<p>According to Nova’s <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoGirlNova/status/1661382808923693057?s=20" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Twitter thread</a>, the anonymous trader stands out from others because their profits are realized. Calling the trader a “real alpha,” the crypto analyst lauded them for attaining the position through their performance and not other sources of revenue, just like most whales.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There are plenty of whales in the market, but not all of them are necessarily good traders. A rich person can fill his crypto portfolio, revealing a huge balance but still be a terrible trader. People would be expecting alpha but getting shit instead. Whale 0x743 is nothing like that. Even more crazy is that he started just like us this year,” Nova said.</p></blockquote>
<p>A deeper analysis of the activities of whale 0x743 shows that they do not hold any bags or make crazy purchases. Nova said the trader exhibited “discipline and good trade behavior” by moving on from their losses and not riding them “all the way down to oblivion.”</p>
<h2>A Perfectly Managed Portfolio?</h2>
<p>The current <a href="https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0x7431931094e8bae1ecaa7d0b57d2284e121f760e" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">portfolio</a> of whale 0x743 is worth about $578,345, relatively smaller than a few days back, with most of the assets being moon bags from their previous trades. This is because the whale takes profit from the wallet and fills it back when they make new trades.</p>
<p>Nova found that within four days, the whale realized over $400,000 in profit from $35,000 worth of RefundCoin (RFD) purchased over the weekend. Last month, they also made hundreds of thousands of dollars from $10,000 worth of Wojak (WOJAK).</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/pepe-coin-explodes-1200-weekly-while-crypto-markets-stagnate-this-weeks-recap/" data-wpel-link="internal">Pepe memecoin mania</a>, whale 0x743 made a couple of six-figure profit moves from $8,000 worth of PEPE after nearly selling the top. Through the strategy of HODLing no bags, the whale had a 3,000% return on investment for the memecoin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trader has never lost more than a few thousand dollars. Their biggest has been $12,000 lost to a Ribbit (RIBBIT) trade.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that dealing with memecoins could turn out to be a rather unprofitable strategy as well for some, just like <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-every-whale-is-a-winner-this-one-lost-147k-in-eth-on-memecoins/" data-wpel-link="internal">this example</a>.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ether balance on the centralized crypto exchanges has reached a five-year low.  According to the latest data from Glassnode, there are currently 17.8 million ETH on exchanges &#8211; a level not seen since July 2016.</p>
<ul>
<li>This figure essentially <a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=ETH&amp;category=&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchanges&amp;s=1556704664&amp;u=1684972800&amp;zoom=" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">represents</a> less than 15% of the Ethereum network&#8217;s total token supply. To put things into perspective, the exchange balance was recorded to be around 26% during 2021&#8217;s bull market.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Such a trend is typically deemed bullish as it means the supply of the crypto-asset available for purchase is limited. Additionally, there&#8217;s not a lot of ETH ready to be sold immediately on CEXs.</li>
<li>ETH supply on exchanges began dropping in September 2022. The decline was even more pronounced after FTX slid into bankruptcy two months later as the subsequent events shook investor confidence in centralized custodians.</li>
<li>However, the decreasing ETH balances on exchanges this month coincides with a rise in staking. As such, the figures for staked ETH have <a href="https://query.nansen.ai/public/dashboards/Hk93n66vsO0uvycfui8ypF2xcpNhpraxfwX5AWZJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">increased</a> from 19.3 million before the Shapella upgrade to more than 21.3 million since the beginning of May.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-the-ethereum-shanghai-shapella-upgrade-everything-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">upgrade</a> on April 12 essentially enabled validators to withdraw their staked Ether from the Beacon Chain after three years. Notably, more and more validators have re-staked their ETH, thereby triggering a decline in the supply of the token can be considered bullish for its price trajectory.</li>
<li><em>CryptoPotato</em> earlier <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/thats-a-first-after-shanghai-ether-staked-volume-exceeds-withdrawals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that the Ether staking volume exceeded the amount of the crypto-asset being withdrawn within the week after the Shapella upgrade.</li>
<li>The influx <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/1-month-after-shapella-staked-ether-eth-exceeds-20m/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">appears</a> to have been driven by institutional staking service providers and investors reinvesting rewards after withdrawal.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[Huobi Token is another notable performer on a weekly scale, perhaps due to the positive developments around the exchange.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After charting the latest multi-weekly low at under $26,000, bitcoin has performed better and even neared $27,000 earlier today.</p>
<p>Most alternative coins have also charted minor gains on a daily scale. Render Token emerges as this week&#8217;s best performer from the top 100.</p>
<h2>BTC to Challenge $27K?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin tried its hand at taking down the resistance level at $27,500 a few times this past week but to no avail. The latest rejection came on Tuesday, and it turned out to be a rather violent one.</p>
<p>It first pushed BTC south to just under $27,000 before the bears took complete control of the market and drove the asset further south to a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-dumped-to-2-week-low-apecoin-nosedives-8-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">two-week low</a> at $25,900. The bulls finally decided to act at this point, and they prevented any further declines.</p>
<p>Just the opposite, bitcoin started regaining some traction and <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/btc-stable-above-26k-as-xrp-ltc-arb-jump-3-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">jumped</a> above $26,000 almost immediately. The past 24 hours brought another minor leg-up that drove the asset to over $26,900. However, the cryptocurrency has been unable to challenge the $27,000 resistance line as of now and sits a few hundred dollars below it.</p>
<p>Its market capitalization remains under $520 billion, while its dominance over the altcoins stands still at 46.2%.</p>

<h2>RNDR, HT Up Double Digits Weekly</h2>
<p>Most altcoins have produced minor gains, similar to bitcoin, in the past 24 hours. Ethereum dipped below $1,800 a few days ago but managed to reclaim that level yesterday. Another slight increase since then has pushed the second-largest crypto to $1,830 as of now.</p>
<p>Dogecoin, Solana, Polkadot, Litecoin, and Shiba Inu are with similar daily gains. Ripple, Cardano, Polygon, and Avalanche have all jumped slightly more &#8211; up to 2%.</p>
<p>Looking at the charts on a weekly scale shows that the two most notable gainers are Render Token and Huobi Token. The two are up by 16% and 13%, respectively. In the case of HT, it&#8217;s perhaps due to the recent <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/huobi-to-launch-hong-kong-venue-on-june-1-report/" data-wpel-link="internal">positive news</a> regarding the exchange.</p>
<p>The total crypto market cap has seen a minor increase as well and is up to $1.120 trillion as of now.</p>

<h2>Huobi Rebranding and Expansion</h2>
<p>As the first <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ht-shots-up-7-as-huobi-announced-expansion-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">step</a> of its expansion plans, Huobi underwent a rebranding in November last year after the company&#8217;s acquisition by About Capital Buyout Fund the previous month. It sought to establish a presence in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange also said it will also ramp up its investments across Southeast Asia, Europe, and other regions while simultaneously exploring strategic mergers and acquisitions to expand its ecosystem, as well.</p>
<p>However, its tryst with the Malaysian regulatory agency was a setback. The Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM), in a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/malaysian-regulator-orders-huobi-to-halt-its-illegal-operations-in-the-country-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">statement</a> on May 22, said Huobi Global failed to register as a crypto exchange operator and was ordered to cease all activity. It was also directed to disable its website and mobile applications on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Web3 Advancement</h2>
<p>Hong Kong <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hong-kong-confirms-crypto-commitment-at-web3-conference-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> its stance of powering ahead to position itself as a regional crypto hub amidst an industry-wide clampdown in the West after Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po reiterated the city&#8217;s crypto commitments at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival in April.</p>
<p>To that extent, Hong Kong&#8217;s SFC released a <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> on the consultation on policy recommendations earlier this week, agreeing to enable licensed virtual asset providers (VASPs) to cater to retail investors, provided that operators assess an understanding of the risks involved.</p>
<p>The guidelines for the VASPs will include requirements in terms of asset custody safety, cybersecurity standards as well as the segregation of client assets. All platforms associated with the digital asset industry in Hong Kong are required to apply for licenses under the new regime, failing which would result in fines and jail terms.</p>
