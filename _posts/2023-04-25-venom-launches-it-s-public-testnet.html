<p>Venom, the first Layer-0 blockchain licensed and operated by Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM), has officially launched its public testnet after years of development. That milestone represents a significant achievement in Venom's roadmap as it prepares to launch on the mainnet. As part of its growing ecosystem, Venom has also unveiled several in-house developed decentralized applications (dApps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The Venom Testnet Has Arrived
<p>The testnet has been designed to cater to both ecosystem users and developers, allowing developers to test and debug dApps and blockchain protocols while enabling users to experience them firsthand. The program's primary goal is to promote innovation and community building within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Developers and users can quickly try out the testnet in two simple steps. First, download the Venom Wallet from the Apple App Store or Google Play Store for mobile devices or as a Google Chrome extension for desktops. Second, users can start testing the Venom ecosystem by claiming a free testnet allocation.</p>
<p>Peter Knez, the Chair of the Venom Foundation Council, said, "We're thrilled to announce the launch of Venom's public testnet, which is a crucial step towards our upcoming mainnet launch. With our highly scalable and reliable asynchronous blockchain, we're confident that developers will be able to build innovative dApps, while users can experience them firsthand."</p>
<p>Developers can build on the asynchronous Venom blockchain, which boasts ultra-fast speeds of up to 100k TPS and dynamic sharding. Those are two core concepts to enhance scalability and network reliability. In addition, Venom has curated a repository of developer documentation to equip developers with the necessary tools and knowledge to begin building.</p>
Plenty of Benefits for Developers
<p>Venom's network boosts interoperability, making it a valuable tool for developers, while its low transaction fees make it user-friendly for global adoption. Several dApps are set to debut on Venom testnet, including Venom Wallet, Venom Scan, VenomPools, Venom Bridge, Venom Stake, Web3.World, WeUp, NFT Mint, and Oasis.Gallery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can perform transactions and test the native Venom wallet while experiencing these dApps. Launching Venom's public testnet is a crucial milestone in the blockchain industry. It will provide a platform for developers to build innovative dApps, while users can experience them firsthand.</p>
