<p>Shiba Inu has been on a roll lately, with its unique blend of meme culture and cutting-edge technology captivating the cryptocurrency world: a cute dog mascot and community-driven approach <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-investors-scoop-billions-of-shiba-inu-kucoin-ceo-reveals-why-hes-holding-shib-for-the-long-term/">became a favourite</a> among investors and traders alike. But what really sets Shiba Inu apart is its upcoming Shibarium project and how it could potentially impact the price of SHIB, especially in the face of forecasts of a $0.001 price.</p>



<p><a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-shiba-inus-metaverse-sees-major-developments/">Shibarium</a> is essentially an upcoming Layer-2 blockchain network encompassing a decentralized exchange (DEX), Metaverse, and games that will be built on Ethereum for the Shiba Inu blockchain. The DEX will enable users to trade SHIB and other tokens in a completely decentralized manner without the need for a centralized exchange. This is a significant development, as decentralized exchanges are becoming increasingly popular due to their greater security and transparency.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-sets-shibarium-apart"><strong>What sets Shibarium apart?</strong></h2>



<p>One of the key benefits of Shibarium is that it will incentivize users to hold SHIB in order to participate in the platform. Users who hold SHIB will be able to stake it on Shibarium and earn rewards in the form of other tokens. This will create a demand for SHIB, potentially increasing its price.</p>



<p>Another way that Shibarium could impact the price of SHIB is through increased exposure. As a decentralized exchange built on the Shiba Inu blockchain, Shibarium will likely attract much attention from the cryptocurrency community. This could lead to more people becoming interested in SHIB, which could increase demand and its price.</p>



<p>Of course, it&#8217;s important to note that the price of SHIB is notoriously volatile, and projections of a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/0-001-shib-price-beckons-as-shiba-inus-shibarium-public-beta-finally-set-to-go-live-this-week/">$0.001 price</a> should be taken with a grain of salt. However, Shibarium could potentially provide some stability to the price of SHIB, as it will create major use cases for the token beyond speculation. If Shibarium proves to be successful, it could also lead to other developments on the Shiba Inu blockchain, which could further increase the value of SHIB.</p>



<p>All in all, Shibarium is a significant development for Shiba Inu and can potentially impact the price of SHIB in several ways. By incentivizing users to hold SHIB and creating exposure for the token, Shibarium will likely drive up demand and create some stability for the price. However, it&#8217;s important to remember that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously unpredictable, and investors should always research and approach any investment cautiously.</p>

<ul>
<li>BTC price regains $29,000 level after considerable volatility this past week resulting in diverse speculations on the asset’s future growth. </li>



<li>BTC continues to surge this year amid a weaker US dollar and several banking turmoils springing up the “<em>haven” </em>sentiments in the market.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Bitcoin margin and derivatives market show more optimism as the asset reclaims $29,000 after several experts predicted a $25k drop. </li>
</ul>



<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has had a wild run this year after recording over 72% growth over the past months with several indicators pointing upward despite slight price corrections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The price of BTC was riddled with a little over 10% price fluctuations between $27,000 and $30,000 from April 25 to May 1. On a much <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-pierces-30000-for-first-time-since-june-as-bernstein-calls-btc-faster-horse-compared-to-gold/">positive</a> front, BTC is up 72% year to date (YTD) together with the S&amp;P 500 has made 9%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From its yearly high of over $30,000, BTC dropped as low as $21,700 with some experts predicting a sharp decline as low as $25,000 before another upward movement. However indicators like Bitcoin margin and derivatives market contradicts this view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data from OKX shows that traders increased their margin lending ratio between April 17 and April 28. On April 27, it recorded a positive 43% ratio on BTC longs marking its highest level in 40 days. Margin trading gives insight into the stance of professional traders because they borrow assets to leverage their positions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To properly get a grasp of traders&#8217; sentiment, the long-to-short metric is used which gathers traders’ positions from perpetual and spot contracts giving better analysis. BTC currently trades at $28,190 at press time after ending April at $29,230.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-derivatives-market-is-equally-positive">The derivatives market is equally positive&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Like the margin market, the BTC derivatives market shows strength despite failing to break past the $30,000 level. According to the long-to-short indicator, traders increased long positions with futures between April 17 and April 28.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Binance, the long-to-short ratio increased with longs moving from 1.12 to 1.26 on April 30. A similar increase was also recorded on OKX after the long-to-short ratio increased from 0.66 on April 27 to 0.93 on May 1. As both future and margin market indicators show strength, some BTC faithful have expressed optimism about the asset’s growth. </p>



<p>The price of Bitcoin has climbed this year with a weaker US dollar and several <a href="https://zycrypto.com/btc-price-makes-slight-gains-in-the-wake-of-first-republic-banks-imminent-price-fall/">banking</a> debacles. First Republic Bank joins Signature and Silicon Valley Banks to become one of the most recent bank collapses this year. The fall in these three banks has sparked widespread speculation on BTC being the haven when traditional finance crumbles. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-warns-that-pepe-has-no-utility"><strong>Binance warns that PEPE has no utility</strong></h2>



<p>Binance warned in their statement that the PEPE token &#8220;has no utility and was created by an anonymous team&#8221;, so they invited their users to properly research before investing in these types of tokens.</p>



<p><em>“FLOKI and PEPE are relatively new tokens that pose a higher than normal risk, and as such will likely be subject to high price volatility. Please ensure that you exercise sufficient risk management, have done your own research in regards to FLOKI and PEPE’s fundamentals, and fully understand the projects before opting to trade the tokens.”</em></p>



<p>Additionally, they explained that “there are signs that certain insiders or team members were able to buy 7% of the total token supply minutes after TGE.” This means that the price of PEPE in dollars could collapse at any time if project members with the largest holdings decide to sell their tokens.</p>



<p>Even on the PEPE website, they warn that &#8220;the coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only&#8221;, and it was created to become the largest of its kind, surpassing popular ones like Dogecoin (DOGE) or Shiba Inu (SHIB).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PEPE price increased more than 1200% in a week</strong></h2>



<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s warnings, the FUD around these meme coins has been so great that even on Twitter, the hashtag #PEPE became a worldwide trend with more than 4 million tweets at the time of Binance&#8217;s announcement.</p>



<p>This led to the price of PEPE, which already had an increase of over 800% during the last week, rising to a high of 136% today, from $0.0000019 to a peak of $0.0000045.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-8-1024x430.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80605"/></figure>



<p>At the time of writing, PEPE maintains a market cap of over $1.1 billion, according to CoinGecko. This market cap has been amassed in less than a month since its creation.</p>

<p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has introduced a new legislative proposal to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and safeguard investors.</p>



<p>Known as the CRPTO Act, the said regulation proposes several measures, such as requiring independent auditing and the publishing of financial statements by crypto companies, preventing individuals who own crypto exchanges from also owning the companies that trade on those exchanges, and prohibiting crypto exchanges from keeping custody of customers’ funds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The legislation also seeks to prevent conflicts of interest, financial shenanigans and requires platforms to reimburse customers who are victims of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“Rampant fraud and dysfunction have become the hallmarks of cryptocurrency and it is time to bring law and order to the multi-billion-dollar industry,”</em> James said in a Friday <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2023/attorney-general-james-proposes-nation-leading-regulations-cryptocurrency">statement,</a> adding, “<em>These commonsense regulations will bring more transparency and oversight to the industry and strengthen our ability to crack down on those that don’t pay respect to the law.”</em></p>



<p>The proposed legislation is a response to growing concerns over the cryptocurrency industry&#8217;s lack of transparency and oversight, which has been plagued by rampant fraud and dysfunction, leading to a spate of high-end financial scandals.</p>



<p>The latest proposal comes even as the state of New York <a href="https://zycrypto.com/new-york-regulator-strengthens-anti-fraud-unit-to-curb-crypto-related-crime/">intensifies efforts</a> to rein over the crypto industry, especially after the collapse of FTX last November. Recently, James filed lawsuits against KuCoin and CoinEx, accusing the two exchanges of failing to register as securities and commodities brokers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, she warned Nexo against operating illegally and ordered it to stop issuing Binance USD (BUSD), the third largest stablecoin by market cap. In addition to cautioning investors against dabbling with crypto assets severally, in November 2022, James urged Congress to adopt legislation prohibiting investing retirement funds in cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>That said, her latest proposal continues to receive support from various lawmakers and industry players who see it as creating fair and several environments for crypto investors in New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“I applaud New York State Attorney General Letitia James for the timely introduction of this legislation to protect New Yorkers from financial harm by establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework for the opaque cryptocurrency market,”</em> said&nbsp;State Senator Kevin Parker. <em>“The cryptocurrency industry must be held to the same macroprudential financial regulations as our traditional financial institutions to ensure accountability and market stability.”</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, New York watchdogs aren’t the only ones tightening their nose around crypto. Various federal and government agencies, including the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/pro-crypto-congressman-mulls-pushing-legislation-to-remove-secs-gary-gensler/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), continue to scrutinize crypto activities even as the US grapples with adopting comprehensive legislation for the fast-growing industry.</p>

<p>PEPE, the latest <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-and-doge-killer-pepe-coin-eyes-monstrous-highs-despite-already-gaining-2000-in-a-week/">meme coin sensation</a>, has been on a tear, soaring roughly 400% in the past week as investors pour money into the token, hoping to make some returns. On Friday, the meme coin surged as high as $0.0000045 after being listed on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange.</p>



<p>The price, however, faced a sharp pullback Saturday, plunging roughly 40% as some earlier investors, taking advantage of the week’s rally, booked profits. Following the price drop, various investors have been hit hard, with one whale losing just over half a million dollars.</p>



<p>On Sunday, May 2, on-chain analytics firm Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1655083589967683584">highlighted</a> a whale who lost approximately $541,000 worth of PEPE after buying a substantial sum about two days ago. Reportedly, the anonymous entity purchased 962.3B $PEPE worth $2.46M along with 70 $WBTC worth $2.07M and 470 $ETH worth $937K. However, by noon on Sunday, his PEPE stash had taken a loss of approximately $541K.</p>



<p>PEPE was launched mid-last month as a meme coin, paying homage to the popular internet meme Pepe the Frog. Although its website mentions that the token has no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return, investors have been flocking to buy it, especially after some <a href="https://zycrypto.com/how-this-early-pepe-buyer-turned-260-into-almost-8-million-amid-meme-coin-frenzy/">early investors</a> made staggering profits.</p>



<p>In less than three weeks, the token has attracted a significant market cap of just over $1 billion and currently ranks 44<sup>th</sup> among the largest cryptocurrencies. Notably, Sentiment has been highlighting various whale purchases, with some buyers <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1654351841189318658">swapping</a> meme coins such as Shiba Inu and DOGE for PEPE.</p>



<p>Meme coins have been gaining popularity in the cryptocurrency market recently, despite being absent for nearly a year following last year’s brutal winter. These tokens are created based on popular memes and have no real-world use cases. They are often created as a joke, but some, like Dogecoins and Shiba Inu, have gained significant traction and market value due to their enhanced use cases.</p>



<p>Notably, as PEPE has no formal team or roadmap and is purely for entertainment purposes only, it remains highly speculative and can lead to substantial losses within short periods, according to some experts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>“If all of a sudden people realize that PEPE has no value and it collapses, you’re going to wipe a billion dollars off this market in minutes. The sooner these things collapse the better because we don’t want it to create a greater market contagion,” </em>crypto analyst Ran Neuner said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the recent loss incurred by the PEPE whale highlighting the highly volatile nature of meme coins and the risks involved in investing in them, investors must exercise caution and thoroughly research the token and its potential risks before investing.</p>



<p>At press time, PEPE was trading at $0.000002888, down 0.54% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Is meme coin season really back?</p>



<p>Pepe (PEPE), the token which sprouted out of the &#8220;Pepe the Frog&#8221; meme and went live a little over two weeks ago, has already minted many millionaires overnight.</p>



<p>One early PEPE buyer swapped 0.125 ETH worth $260 for 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens last month. Those tokens are currently worth nearly $8 million, according to blockchain analytics firm Arkham.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-pepe-millionaire"><strong>PEPE Millionaire</strong></h2>



<p>Meme coins have enjoyed somewhat of a renaissance in recent weeks. PEPE has seen <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-and-doge-killer-pepe-coin-eyes-monstrous-highs-despite-already-gaining-2000-in-a-week/">particularly high interest</a> as investors flock to the frog-themed token, hoping to repeat the success of rival dog-themed meme coins Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (INU).</p>



<p>The newly-launched PEPE received a massive boost yesterday after the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, listed the token in the platform’s so-called innovation zone. PEPE soared another 124% over the past day, pushing the frog-inspired token’s market cap above the $1 billion mark. One PEPE is currently worth $0.000003 per CoinGecko. With an impressive market value of over $1 billion, PEPE is now the 40th largest cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>Arkham recalls that buyer dimethyltryptamine.eth, who remains anonymous, scooped up $260 worth of PEPE last month, and his stockpile has now ballooned to almost $8 million. However, this PEPE holder could encounter problems trying to realize that profit due to liquidity concerns around the meme coin.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is PEPE?</strong></h2>



<p>Pepe creators branded it “the most memeable memecoin in existence.&#8221; The token has a circulating supply of 420 trillion, a reference to &#8220;4/20,&#8221; a popular cannabis culture slang.</p>



<p>Traders have a knack for jumping on the meme coin craze, mainly after the meteoric rise of tokens such as dogecoin and Shiba inu — which rocketed to tens of billions in market capitalization during the previous bull market.</p>



<p>Pepe appears to have taken the crown as traders’ favourite meme coin. Earlier this week, trading volume for PEPE surpassed that for both DOGE and SHIB.</p>



<p>While PEPE’s huge rally has turned some early investors into millionaires — on paper, at least — dimethyltryptamine.eth has yet to sell his tokens, underscoring a popular trend of long-term holding strategies among crypto investors.</p>

<p>May 2023 started with yet another tumultuous week for the US Banking sector. On May 1, 2023, the federal government seized First Republic Bank following weeks over which depositors and investors pulled out their money. First Republic Bank was initially bailed out in March 2023 after receiving US$30 billion in deposits from the United States&#8217; (U.S.) largest banks.</p>



<p>According to a May 1, 2023 press release, JPMorgan Chase confirmed that it had acquired a substantial majority of assets and assumed the deposits and certain liabilities of First Republic Bank through a competitive bidding process from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</p>



<p>According to a company blog post, Gemini crypto exchange revealed plans to expand to the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region to grow its international business and capitalize on increasing demand for crypto and Web3 products. On May 1, 2023, Gemini announced that its derivatives platform, Gemini Foundation, was open for trading to eligible customers except those in the U.S., the United Kingdom, and the European Union.</p>



<p>On May 2, 2023, Coinbase Global Incorporation announced the launch of Coinbase International Exchange, which shall offer derivatives trading out of Bermuda. Coinbase International Exchange will offer perpetual Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures to institutional investors outside the U.S.</p>



<p>On May 2, 2023, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for March 2023. The survey revealed that job openings decreased to 9.6 million on the last business day of the month, down from almost 10 million reported for February 2023.</p>



<p>The decline in job openings suggests some softening in the U.S. labour market. The number of hires and total separations remained unchanged at 6.1 million and 5.9 million, respectively, while layoffs and discharges (1.8 million) increased.</p>



<p>On May 3, 2023, the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Policy Committee (FOMC) raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points, taking the Fed funds rate to a target range of 5.00% to 5.25%. The FOMC will closely monitor incoming information and assess the implications for future monetary policy.</p>



<p>On May 4, 2023, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank decided to raise its three key interest rates by 25 basis points, noting that though headline inflation had declined over recent months, underlying price pressures remained. The ECB interest rate hikes are effective May 10, 2023.</p>



<p>In the 24 hours before the Fed’s interest rate decision, Bitcoin and Ether traded at around US$28,300 and US$1,850, respectively, according to CoinGecko data. However, after the Fed interest rate announcement, Bitcoin and Ether tested the US$29,000 and the US$1,900 price marks, respectively, though both cryptocurrencies have retraced slightly as of press time.</p>

<p>Do Kwon, co-founder and former CEO of now-defunct Terraform Labs, is facing a jail term of up to 40 years in South Korea, the country where he committed most of his crimes.</p>



<p>The prosecutor overseeing Kwon’s probe believes that the repatriation of the South Korean national would be the best way to serve justice to investors who were affected by the unprecedented collapse of the Terra ecosystem back in May 2022.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-kwon-s-extradition-to-s-korea-would-best-serve-justice-to-terra-victims-prosecutor"><strong>Kwon’s Extradition To S.Korea Would Best Serve Justice To Terra Victims: Prosecutor</strong></h2>



<p>South Korean prosecutors are pushing for Do Kwon to face justice in his native homeland.</p>



<p>Kwon is accused of orchestrating the fall of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) alongside the network’s native asset LUNA, which saw over $40 billion wiped out from the crypto market and sparked fears of contagion across the market.</p>



<p>The leader of the South Korean prosecutors&#8217; team investigating the implosion of the two cryptocurrencies, Dan Sung-han, notes that South Korea is where most of Kwon’s crimes took place and his accomplices are also based there. “Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice [to investors]”, the prosecutor said in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/south-korean-prosecutor-calls-for-crypto-entrepreneur-do-kwon-to-face-charges-in-home-country-639f5515">interview </a>with <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>.</p>



<p>As such, Sung-Han is pushing for the former Terraform Labs CEO to face criminal charges in his home country, despite efforts from the U.S. government to extradite him.</p>



<p>Kwon and his associates are facing charges of fraud, breaches of Korean capital markets laws, using bots to manipulate transaction volumes, bribery, and a string of other financial crimes.</p>



<p>If found guilty, Do Kwon would likely face an unparalleled jail term for a financial crime in the nation’s history. Per Sung-han, it could potentially transcend the 40-year prison sentence handed out to Seoul-based Optimus Asset Management CEO Kim Jae-Hyun.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the disgraced crypto mogul has requested that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">charges </a>brought against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) be dismissed.</p>



<p>Whether Kwon will be extradited to South Korea or the United States will be determined once Montenegro authorities conclude their case against him for document forgery charges.</p>

<p>Pepe Coin is a meme coin based on the Pepe the Frog meme, with the latter gaining popularity on the internet in the mid-2010s. Pepe has been used as a meme in various contexts, often to convey humour or sarcasm. PEPE as a cryptocurrency entered the crypto market in April and has since made staggering gains, despite the creators stating that the value of PEPE is primarily based on speculation and hype rather than any intrinsic value or use case.</p>



<p>Memecoins are cryptocurrencies based on internet memes or pop culture references created for entertainment or as a joke. Some examples include Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Baby Doge, and Floki Inu. While their prices fluctuate significantly, they are considered highly speculative and risky investments due to their lack of underlying value or use case. Pepe Coin is a newer meme coin gaining traction and may signal a shift away from dog-themed coins.</p>



<p>Pepe Coin was launched without the use of traditional methods such as an ICO, presale, or airdrop, relying solely on the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme to generate investor interest. Within days of its launch, its price increased by 2000%, propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of more than $396 million.</p>



<p>The number of wallets holding PEPE has increased from 7000 in mid-April to 79000 at the start of May. The coin has set itself the goal to surpass <a href="https://zycrypto.com/doge-army-anticipates-stellar-dogecoin-rally-to-the-moon-as-dogeday-approaches/">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/as-shibarium-renews-bullish-drive-for-0-001-shib-shiba-inus-metaverse-sees-major-developments/">Shiba Inu</a>, according to its website. It can be traded on Uniswap, OKX, and Houbi, amongst others, a be listed on nd is on the verge of going live on major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, or Kraken. Crypto Twitter is in full anticipation that it will soon be listed and that explosive growth will continue.</p>



<p>Last weekend, traders experienced significant slippage when trying to convert large amounts of PEPE into other currencies, like ETH, due to a lack of liquidity despite a recent rise in liquidity pool activity.</p>



<p>With a self-reported circulating supply of 420.69 trillion PEPE tokens compared to a circulating supply of 139.22 billion DOGE, it is difficult to see how many newcomers are needed to reach similar volumes, and it remains to be seen how many people will buy into the latest meme graze.</p>



<p>Additionally, it must be said that PEPE has no intrinsic value and does not appear to have plans to add any features. Pepe Coin&#8217;s future is uncertain, with some experts predicting it will remain significant, while others believe it will follow in the footsteps of other short-lived meme coins such as Grimacecoin and Pump Coin. Grimacecoin, for example, experienced a brief increase in value following a McDonald&#8217;s tweet, but its price eventually returned to its original level.</p>



<p>According to the developers&#8217; website, investors may want to consider the following because “$PEPE is a meme coin with no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. There is no formal team or roadmap. The coin is completely useless and for entertainment purposes only.”</p>



<p>Then again, internet memes, especially crypto meme coins, are notoriously difficult to predict, and PEPE sees itself as the king of memes.</p>

<p>Bitcoin has not moved much lately, and that is having a ripple effect on most cryptocurrencies apart from newly launched meme coins like PEPE.</p>



<p>This week, the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization mainly traded sideways, creating a tight price squeeze heading into the weekend. On Friday, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategys-bullish-stance-on-bitcoin-stronger-than-ever-as-firm-post-q1-2023-profits/">Bitcoin</a> was trading at $29,000, up 0.33% in the past 24 hours and down roughly 1% in the past week.</p>



<p>According to onchain analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s recent behaviour can be pointed to constant selling by short-term holders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-short-term-holders-offload-btc"><strong>Short-Term Holders Offload BTC</strong></h2>



<p>In its latest weekly on-chain newsletter, the firm noted that whereas the majority of supply remains held by longer-term, the weight of short-term investors is currently prevailing over the price action within the uptrend.</p>



<p><em>“Among both Long-Term and Short-Term&nbsp; Holder cohorts sending coins to exchanges, the dominance of the Short-Term Holders remains a consistent 90%-95% of total inflows,” </em>wrote Glassnode.<em> “Of note is the increase of profit taking by STHs in 2023, denoted by the deeper dark red zone, which accounts for 58% of exchange inflows at present.”</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="590" src="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-1024x590.png" alt="" class="wp-image-80544" srcset="https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-1024x590.png 1024w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-300x173.png 300w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7-768x443.png 768w, https://zycrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-7.png 1431w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As per the firm, since early Jan, there have been two waves of profit-taking by short-term holders, surpassing the total profit taken by long-term holders. <em>“Within the current market, the second wave of short-term holders profit realization aligns with the recent correction,”</em> it added.</p>



<p>The firm noted that as this cohort continues to sell its coins, the market will likely experience volatility, and Bitcoin could <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-at-29000-but-pundit-says-it-could-drop-lower-after-losing-one-crucial-level/">slide lower</a>.</p>



<p><em>“We observed that sell pressure by new investors was a key driving force that established resistance at $30k. Should this present correction resume, the cost basis of the young supply holders at $24.4k may well be a psychological level to monitor in the weeks ahead.”</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Large Whales Deviate To Buying</strong></h2>



<p>However, it is important to note that as small-term holders continue to take profit, large whales with over 10,000 BTC seem to be accumulating. On Friday, Glassnode tweeted that this group has shifted “from a distributive regime to one of aggressive coin absorption.”</p>



<p>“Checkmate”, the lead onchain analyst at the firm, later clarified the tweet, noting that this metric excludes exchanges. Instead, he noted it showed the behaviour of &#8216;ETF-style sinks though like MicroStrategy, large institutions, GBTC, and WBTC over the last 30 days. This implies that these institutions could have significantly prevented Bitcoin&#8217;s price from declining recently.</p>

<p>Cardano&#8217;s highly-anticipated Hydra upgrade has finally arrived, with the first Hydra Head now open on the Cardano mainnet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a Thursday announcement by Input Output Global (IOHK), the team behind Cardano, hydra head version 0.10.0, was released in late March on the mainnet, setting pace for other releases in its category aimed at boosting Cardano’s performance.</p>



<p>Hydra is a layer 2 scalability solution for <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardanos-transaction-volume-sees-huge-upsurge-amid-price-fluctuations-ada-network-in-bullish-outlook/">Cardano</a> that aims to increase transaction speed through low latency, high throughput, and minimized transaction cost. The Hydra family of protocols was designed to make Cardano more scalable and adaptable for various use cases that require fast and cheap transactions.</p>



<p><em>“Our goal is to make Cardano possible to grow and increase its adoption by making it more scalable. We do that by building several protocols to make these situations possible,” </em>Sebastian Nagel, lead software engineer of Hydra, noted.</p>



<p>Nagel further emphasized that the Hydra family of protocols is meant to help Cardano become more scalable and flexible in several use cases. Hydra Head protocol is the first of many building blocks on Hydra aimed at enabling applications to offload some transactions from the global Cardano network into more local contexts, where the transactions are only run by involved parties, increasing transaction speeds.</p>



<p>Nagel further clarified that Hydra is not a network upgrade, meaning no hard fork will be involved.</p>



<p>“<em>Hydra is not a network upgrade, so there is no hard fork. There’s nothing really the whole network is waiting on-it’s just flipping a switch, and everything is fast,”</em> he added.</p>



<p>However, Nagel emphasized that it is not yet a finished product, and there will be more releases to incorporate more use cases.</p>



<p><em>You now have this version 0.10.0 available. It’s not done yet, but it is a very good starting point. There will be more releases to incorporate more user needs. Our focus lately has been making it possible to run on the mainnet. Our next focus is really to bring in more use cases,” </em>he went on.</p>



<p>The release came days after Cardano developers&#8217; <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-poised-for-ultra-bullish-surge-following-latest-hydra-upgrade-development-milestone/">showcased</a> the progress of the Hydra Head running smoothly on the mainnet. That said, the release of version 0.10.0 is a significant milestone for the blockchain and its ecosystem. It represents a major step forward in developing Cardano&#8217;s scalability and ability to handle complex smart contracts. Furthermore, as the Hydra family of protocols expands, Cardano is well-positioned to take advantage of its scalable solutions and attract new users and projects to its network.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the news has strengthened ADA, trading at $0.38 at press time, up just over 2% in the past 24 hours as per CoinMarketCap data.</p>

<p>Stripe, a leading financial infrastructure platform for businesses, has announced the launch of its first fiat-to-crypto onramp product. </p>



<p>The onramp, initially available to US-based customers, is designed to make purchasing cryptocurrency for customers of Web3 companies easier. According to Stripe, the new product aims at helping businesses willing to provide crypto and blockchain-enabled services but typically encountered onboarding difficulties in the past.</p>



<p><em>“Companies interested in offering cryptocurrency- and blockchain-enabled experiences often face a cold start problem: Their customers don&#8217;t have the crypto in their wallets to carry out transactions. Stripe’s onramp allows customers to purchase crypto at the precise moment they need it. They could purchase Ethereum, for example, and immediately use it to buy an NFT</em>,” the firm noted in a Friday <a href="https://stripe.com/zh-cn-hk/newsroom/news/fiat-to-crypto-onramp">statement.</a></p>



<p>Meanwhile, following today’s announcement, Stripe now offers two implementation options for its onramp. The first one lets developers put a crypto purchasing widget on their website with only a few lines of code, while with the second one, businesses can direct their customers to the onramp on “crypto.link.com” without needing any code.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;With our onramp options, Web3 companies can now outsource a bunch of the very important but tricky pieces to Stripe—things like conversion and auth optimization, identity verification, fraud prevention, and so on,&#8221;</em> said Guillaume Poncin, head of engineering for crypto at Stripe. <em>&#8220;This allows companies to focus on what’s unique to their business and helps their customers start using Web3 services quickly and safely.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Notably, the Stripe-hosted onramp is built for many of the use cases developed by Web3 companies around the globe, including Brave, Safe, 1inch, and Lens Protocol.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;We&#8217;re delighted to welcome Stripe into LensFrens to reduce payment friction and encourage content monetization,&#8221; </em>said Lens Founder Stani Kulechov. <em>&#8220;By adding this payment feature, users can easily collect their favourite content and back the creators they admire.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>As demand for crypto products skyrockets, Stripe has been positioning itself as a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/stripe-now-supports-cryptocurrencies-once-again-after-changing-its-mind-in-the-past-welcome-the-institutions/">key player</a> in the space, offering various solutions to help businesses easily accept and process cryptocurrency transactions. In the recent past, the Dublin-based firm has witnessed an uptick in crypto businesses utilizing its other products, including its global payout service using the USDC stablecoin.</p>



<p>That said, Friday’s announcement is a significant development that aims to address the adoption barrier faced by Web3 companies. By offering an easy and convenient way for US-based customers to purchase crypto, the US is likely to witness further crypto adoptions as products in the sector become more accessible to the general public.</p>

<p>As some countries like the United States continue to restrict innovative technologies like Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, other Latin American countries, such as <a href="https://zycrypto.com/tag/el-salvador/">El Salvador</a>, are working to boost the growth of their tech industries.</p>



<p>On May 4th, Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, announced the enactment of a law that eliminates taxes on innovative technologies, including software creation, coding, artificial intelligence, and other fields.</p>



<p>The law<a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654121271548866560"> signed</a> by Bukele will exempt fiscal taxes on these technologies for at least 15 years. Additionally, it includes the elimination of capital gains tax, paid when obtaining profits from the sale of an asset.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ve just signed into law, the INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING INCENTIVES ACT, that eliminates all taxes (income, property, capital gains and import tariffs) on technology innovations, software and app programming, AI, computer and communications hardware manufacturing. <a href="https://t.co/rZtGzPgVzW">pic.twitter.com/rZtGzPgVzW</a></p>&mdash; Nayib Bukele (@nayibbukele) <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1654121271548866560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>El Salvador wants to become a technological leader in Latin America</strong></h2>



<p>The bill was approved on April 19th by the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador with 69 votes in favor and none against during the 103rd plenary session of the legislative body.</p>



<p>Congresswoman Elisa Rosales stated during the plenary session that the new Legislative Assembly and the Executive Branch are working to position the country as a leader in Latin America on technological manufacturing.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;There are five incentives being granted for 15 years, and we are not establishing a minimum investment amount because we want to encourage all those StartUps. We have a different vision; we are positioning our country with a different face internationally,&#8221; </em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-el-salvador-bets-on-emerging-technologies-to-improve-its-economy"><strong>El Salvador bets on emerging technologies to improve its economy</strong></h2>



<p>Congressman Estuardo Rodríguez pointed out that the Law for the Promotion of Innovation and Technological Manufacturing will “contribute significantly to the country&#8217;s economic development,&#8221; creating more jobs for young people.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the new law will create opportunities for the development of artificial intelligence, a cutting-edge technology used daily by millions of users and companies to improve their efficiency and productivity.</p>



<p>Thanks to Nayib Bukele&#8217;s technological proposals, such as enacting the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-country-secures-first-400-btc-purchase/">Bitcoin Law</a>, which establishes the use of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador, the country has become one of the most attractive nations for cryptocurrency companies.</p>



<p>As recently <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitfinex-awarded-first-ever-digital-asset-service-provider-license-in-el-salvador/">reported</a> by ZyCrypto, Bitfinex became the first cryptocurrency exchange to expand to El Salvador after acquiring a digital asset license allowing it to operate in a regulated manner in the country. Will other major exchanges follow?</p>

<p>U.S. regulators, not least of all the Securities and Exchange Commission, have taken an aggressive tack lately with the crypto industry. Amid the regulatory headwinds, Coinbase’s and Ripple’s top legal experts met to discuss pressing matters in the fast-growing crypto space.</p>



<p>The news of the meeting has prompted speculation about the U.S.’s largest and best-known exchange relisting Ripple’s cryptocurrency XRP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-and-coinbase-legal-officers-hang-out"><strong>Ripple And Coinbase Legal Officers Hang Out</strong></h2>



<p>The top lawyers from Ripple and Coinbase convened for a recent offsite meeting to discuss pressing concerns in the vibrant crypto landscape.</p>



<p>Coinbase’s chief legal officer, Paul Grewal, took to Twitter earlier today to express his appreciation to Ripple’s Stuart Alderoty for being invited to the meeting and suggested more meetings in the future. Alderoty then tweeted his gratitude to Grewal for taking the time to connect with the Ripple legal team.</p>



<p>Details of the meeting were sparse, but both Ripple and Coinbase are currently at an impasse with the U.S. SEC. Ripple Labs was sued back in December 2020 for allegedly selling unregistered securities in the form of XRP.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Coinbase — which has become the second-largest crypto exchange, trailing only Binance — was <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-action-against-coinbase-triggers-ballistic-reaction-from-crypto-community/">slapped </a>with a Wells Notice by the SEC in March over potential violations of U.S. securities law. In a document last week, the San Francisco-headquartered platform pushed back against the SEC’s enforcement notice.</p>



<p>These two U.S.-based companies have often called for formal rulemaking within the crypto assets sector, which the watchdog agency has ignored and chosen regulation by enforcement instead. In recent months, the SEC has taken action against notable industry players, including digital asset exchanges Bittrex, Kraken, Gemini, crypto lender Genesis and individual actors such as Tron founder Justin Sun. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>But Will Coinbase Relist XRP?</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase has previously <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-case-takes-surprising-turn-as-coinbase-asks-court-for-permission-to-support-ripple/">requested </a>the court for permission to file a friend of the court (&#8220;amicus&#8221;) brief in Ripple’s case with the SEC, arguing that the lawsuit threatens the broader industry. Grewal has also, in recent weeks, hailed the legal defense mounted by Ripple. </p>



<p>Many XRP fans are once again suspecting that Coinbase could soon relist XRP on its platform following the offsite meeting, where the two chief legal officers are seen pictured in a close friendly pose.</p>



<p>Even if Grewal and Stuart’s body language indicates improving cordiality between Coinbase and Ripple, a relisting of XRP soon seems unlikely at this point. As <em>ZyCrypto </em><a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-will-get-relisted-on-coinbase-immediately-after-ripples-victory-over-sec-exchanges-chief-legal-officer-hints/">reported</a>, Grewal pointed out in a recent interview with Tony Edward that a possible timeline for relisting depends on various factors.</p>
