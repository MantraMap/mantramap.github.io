The Sandbox (SAND): Expanding Its User Base
<p class="s5">The decentralized gaming virtual world, the Sandbox (SAND), is expanding its presence in Asia by creating a local ecosystem with over 40 partners. They aim to empower users by providing updated tools for generating content and collaborating with educational institutions, including renowned institutes like HKDI and HKUST. </p>
<p class="s5">By Q3 2023, virtual LAND owners and creators can expect improved content management tools, allowing for a wider range of experiences.

Get Ready For Enhanced DeFi Experience With EOS (EOS)
<p class="s5">The EOS (EOS) ecosystem has been experiencing notable advancements, attracting attention from enthusiasts, investors, and stakeholders. One significant development is a recent webinar that shed light on the EOS EVM and its advantages for Ethereum (ETH) developers. </p>
<p class="s5">The EOS EVM webinar provided insights into the adoption expectations, target audience, development process, funding, and maintenance of EOS EVM.
