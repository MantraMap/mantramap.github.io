<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By: </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/TradingRage" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><strong>Edris</strong></a></p>
<h3>XRP/USDT Daily Chart:</h3>
<p>Against USD, the price has been consolidating in a narrow range between $0.45 and $0.5. The 50-day moving average, currently around $0.5, is currently pushing the cryptocurrency lower. If XRP drops toward the $0.43 level, the 200-day moving average near that price is expected to provide strong support.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if XRP  breaks above the 50-day moving average, investors could be optimistic as the $0.6 resistance is likely to be tested.</p>
<p>This scenario could be ideal for Ripple as the market might enter a mid-term bullish phase after months of consolidation.</p>

<h3>XRP/BTC Daily Chart</h3>
<p>The market has been trending downward lately. The price has been on a free-fall since the breakdown of the 1,800 SAT level and the 200-day and 50-day moving averages earlier in June.</p>
<p>However, the key 1,500 SAT support zone is currently holding the XRP price from further drops. Additionally, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages printed a bullish crossover a few days back, increasing the probability of a rebound in the short term.</p>
<p>The RSI is also showing values close to the oversold area, boosting the chances of a bullish reversal in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>However, despite these positive signals from indicators, the price action remains bearish, and there is still a high probability of a bearish breakout below the 1,500 SAT level, which could lead to a subsequent crash toward the 1,300 SAT zone in a short period of time.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has been struggling to surpass the significant resistance region of $30K for some time now, despite an overall bullish outlook. Recent price movements have shown bearish signals that could potentially lead to a short-term reversal.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s bullish rally has come to a halt upon reaching the crucial resistance region of $30K. This price range holds significant psychological resistance and has acted as a major barrier to the price for several months.</p>
<p>However, there are indications of a double-top bearish reversal pattern forming in conjunction with declining and weakening bullish momentum. This suggests the possibility of a reversal and a consolidation phase before the market determines its next direction.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that if the price is rejected at this critical resistance, a drop toward the dynamic support level of the 100-day moving average at $28K becomes highly likely.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259079" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259079" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-259079 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-scaled.jpg" alt="btc_price_chart_0607231" width="2560" height="1324" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-768x397.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-2048x1060.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BTC-Daily-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259079" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>In the 4-hour timeframe, the diminished bullish momentum becomes more apparent as the price has been consolidating around the $30K mark for an extended period. Following a prolonged period of consolidation, a bearish double-top pattern has emerged, causing a slight decline as selling pressure outweighs demand.</p>
<p>However, it is important to wait for confirmation of the double-top pattern, which requires the price to fall below the neckline at $29.8K. If successful, Bitcoin&#8217;s next target would be the static support region at $27.5K.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that a clear bearish divergence is visible between the RSI indicator and the price, increasing the likelihood of a short-term downturn.</p>
<p>In summary, Bitcoin is currently facing significant resistance at the $30K level, accompanied by bearish signals and weakening bullish momentum. A reversal and consolidation phase may be in the cards, potentially leading to a short-term decline.</p>

<h2>On-chain Analysis</h2>
<p><strong>By</strong> <strong><a href="http://twitter.com/Greatest_Trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has been on a strong bullish rally since the start of 2023, leading to profitable returns for many investors. The NUPL metric, illustrated on the chart, represents the disparity between market cap and realized cap divided by market cap. Essentially, this metric serves as an indicator of the proportion of investors who are in a profitable state.</p>
<p>Values above 0 indicate that investors are making profits, and a rising trend suggests an increasing number of investors entering the profitable zone. The recent upward movement in the NUPL metric, which reached its previous high from April, implies that more investors are now experiencing profitable returns. This serves as a significant indication of the prevailing bullish sentiment in the market.</p>
<p>Consequently, if the metric surpasses its previous high simultaneously with further price appreciation, it would generate heightened buying pressure and establish an unequivocally bullish market condition.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After surpassing the 100-day moving average and retracing in the form of a pullback, Ethereum&#8217;s price initiated a rally that reached the resistance level of $2K. However, it has now temporarily paused, resulting in a consolidation phase around this crucial resistance.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
<p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/greatest_trader" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">Shayan</a></p>
<h3>The Daily Chart</h3>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price successfully broke above the 100-day moving average and the upper trendline of the descending channel, subsequently retesting them during a pullback. This led to increased buying pressure and a significant price rise, reaching the critical resistance region of $2K.</p>
<p>However, due to the prevailing selling pressure around this vital level, the price faced rejection and began consolidating. Notably, the $2K zone aligns with a prior major swing in Ethereum&#8217;s worth, making it a formidable barrier.</p>
<figure id="attachment_259082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-259082" style="width: 2560px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-scaled.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="wp-image-259082 size-full" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-scaled.jpg" alt="eth_price_chart_0607231" width="2560" height="1324" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-300x155.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-1024x530.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-768x397.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-1536x795.jpg 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-2048x1060.jpg 2048w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ETH-DAily-2-50x26.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-259082" class="wp-caption-text">Source: TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h3>The 4-Hour Chart</h3>
<p>Analyzing the 4-hour timeframe, it becomes evident that the momentum of the rally has weakened, and the price has formed a bearish head and shoulders reversal pattern. This suggests a bearish outlook for the price in the short-term, potentially leading to minor rejections.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a result of the recent price drop, Ethereum has reached an ascending trendline (indicated in green) and is on the verge of breaking below it. If the price falls below the trendline, which currently acts as support, a cascade toward the significant support zone of $1.7K becomes highly likely.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ethereum&#8217;s price appears to be confined within a static range between the $2K resistance and the $1.7K support zones, undergoing consolidation for the mid-term perspective.</p>

<p>Ethereum&#8217;s price has recently undergone a significant upward movement following a period of consolidation. This upward momentum is likely to attract the attention of investors and traders, especially those involved in the perpetual futures market who engage in speculative trading.</p>
<p>The Open Interest Metric, which measures the number of active futures positions, has shown a slight increase and reached its two-month high. This suggests that there could be higher market volatility due to a greater possibility of both long and short positions being liquidated.</p>
<p>As a result, it seems reasonable to anticipate a continued upward trend in the medium term, as the futures market has not yet reached an overheated state. However, it is important to consider that this potential uptrend may also coincide with increased volatility characterized by sudden and significant price fluctuations.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that unforeseen events could disrupt the current scenario and impact the market dynamics. Therefore, it is essential to monitor any developments that may influence Ethereum&#8217;s price movement and market sentiment.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The HODLing attitude from investors can be attributed to the expectation of positive price action upon completion of the halving event.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to data compiled by blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, about 13% of Litecoin&#8217;s (LTC) total supply has remained untouched for five years.</p>
<p>Analysts at the company <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1676212959670853633" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">speculated</a> that the dormancy might be attributed to either &#8220;unwavering confidence&#8221; in the Litecoin project or the loss of assets. Regardless of the reason for the inactivity, the finding puts LTC&#8217;s average holding time at 2.1 years.</p>
<h2>13% of LTC Supply Dormant for Five Years</h2>
<p>Litecoin, often called the silver to Bitcoin&#8217;s digital gold, has recently seen increased on-chain activity as investors prepare for the network&#8217;s upcoming third halving. The HODLing attitude from investors could be connected to the expectation of positive price action upon completion of the event.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoin-sees-increased-network-activity-ahead-of-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">halving</a>, less than five weeks away, will reduce the block rewards paid to miners by half. While the event is expected to occur on August 2, 2023, at block 2,520,000, the date remains subject to the network&#8217;s hash rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>Miners&#8217; reward will drop to 6.25 LTC from 12.5 LTC, reducing the coin production rate on the network. This mechanism aims to create scarcity to boost LTC&#8217;s value, counteracting inflation and encouraging a stable growth trajectory for the crypto asset.</p>
<p>With this in mind, investors have begun to flock to the network, accumulating LTC or refusing to let go of their holdings.</p>
<p>In May, <em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoin-sees-increased-network-activity-ahead-of-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> that the total LTC addresses with balances increased to 8.5 million from the end of April. New and active addresses on the network soared close to their all-time highs (ATHs) attained in February. Notably, Litecoin&#8217;s new address count briefly exceeded that of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>LTC Soars to 14-Month High</h2>
<p>Besides the increased on-chain activity, LTC&#8217;s market value has recorded some significant gains recently. Within the past week, the asset&#8217;s price <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/litecoin-ltc-soars-to-14-month-high-above-100-bitcoin-btc-reclaims-30k-weekend-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">surged</a> to a 14-month high, hitting the $110 mark. Currently trading at $102.60, LTC has become the tenth largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to data on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Similarly, Litecoin&#8217;s hash rate has soared to a new ATH of 797.72 tera hash/second (Th/s). The network&#8217;s mining difficulty has also hovered around a recently established ATH set at 26.38 million.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Shiba Inu ($SHIB) price is rebounding, with the token rising over the last week.</p>
<p>Following two bearish daily closes in a row, $SHIB is now exhibiting upwards momentum, prompting traders to reconsider their sentiment toward the token.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow meme coins Wall Street Memes ($WSM) and Thug Life ($THUG) are also making waves as their respective presale phases continue to gather momentum.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu on Cusp of Rally as Trader Optimism Spikes</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, $SHIB is trading around the $0.00000757 level, rebounding aggressively from the nearby support level at $0.00000735.</p>
<p>This rebound has provided the fuel needed for a possible rally, boosting investor optimism in $SHIB.</p>
<p>Price has also respected the rising trendline on the 4H time frame, which has been in play since June 28.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259096" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-7-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>$SHIB has rejected this trendline three times in the past fortnight – indicating a firm support base for upward movement.</p>
<p>These recurring rejections indicate that crypto investors are &#8220;buying the dip,&#8221; hinting that Shiba Inu could have the potential for sustained momentum if it continues to hold above this crucial trendline.</p>
<p>Further adding to the bullish hypothesis, price is attempting to break through the 20-day and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) on the 4H chart, which would signal a dramatic shift in market sentiment.</p>
<p>This sentiment shift may already be occurring – <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinGecko community analysis</a> states that more than 66% of users are “feeling good” about $SHIB today.</p>
<h2>$SHIB Price Boosted By Token Burns &amp; Shibarium Excitement</h2>
<p>Several factors are playing into Shiba Inu’s resilience and impressive price rebound.</p>
<p>Firstly, as noted by the <a href="https://twitter.com/shibburn/status/1676818308169859073?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Shibburn</a> Twitter account, over 64.8 million $SHIB tokens were burned in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>This represents a 362% increase from the previous day – indicating a significant reduction in supply that may be contributing to the bullish price movements.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259094" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="327" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7-300x163.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture3-7-50x27.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Secondly, the main Shiba Inu News Twitter account, which boasts over 331,000 followers, <a href="https://twitter.com/ShibalnuNews/status/1676560229738205185?s=20" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> that the lead $SHIB developer Shytoshi Kusama is dropping hints that the long-awaited Shibarium network will launch next month.</p>
<p>Shibarium is a Layer-2 blockchain network being built for the Shiba Inu ecosystem on top of the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>This network promises to offer faster and cheaper $SHIB transactions, along with improved scalability – helping the Shiba Inu ecosystem grow and thrive.</p>
<p>Overall, the ongoing token burns and exciting Shibarium developments paint a promising picture for $SHIB in the short-to-medium term.</p>
<h2>Which Other Meme Coins Look Primed for Growth?</h2>
<p>As Shiba Inu gears up for a bullish phase, other meme coins are also presenting interesting growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes and Thug Life are two such coins, both experiencing huge momentum in their respective presale phases.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Memes Could Be the Next Meme Coin King After Raising $12.8m</h2>
<p><a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care/?referrer=shiba-inu-coin-price-rebounds-as-traders-become-bullish-with-wall-street-memes-thug-life-also-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes ($WSM)</a> has been gaining significant attention as it capitalizes on the cultural impact of internet memes within the crypto community.</p>
<p>The concept behind Wall Street Memes revolves around merging the world of finance with meme culture, which has proven to be a winning combination in recent years.</p>
<p>During the project’s ongoing presale phase, Wall Street Memes has managed to raise $12.8 million, showcasing the strong interest of early adopters.</p>
<p>The token’s appealing tokenomics, which sees large portions of the supply dedicated to marketing and community rewards, adds to its allure and highlights the developers’ focus on long-term sustainability.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259091" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="301" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4-300x150.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture4-4-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This approach has been a huge hit with early investors, given that the Wall Street Memes <a href="https://t.me/wallst_memes" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram channel</a> has grown to over 11,000 members.</p>
<p>Moreover, high-profile influencers are beginning to take note. Crypto Mario, who has nearly 500,000 subscribers, released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swsO411v3OM&amp;ab_channel=CryptoMario" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">video</a> claiming that $WSM could be the &#8220;next leader of meme coins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Endorsements like this have undoubtedly helped increase the buzz around Wall Street Memes, which has now reached fever pitch.</p>
<p>With the ongoing presale now in Stage 21 out of 30, over two-thirds of the token allocation has already been snapped up – meaning investors only have a limited time left to acquire $WSM at a discounted rate before its exchange listings.</p>

<h2>Thug Life Rides Meme Coin Wave with Ambitious Roadmap &amp; Nears $500,000 Milestone</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.care/b_thuglife_33357?referrer=shiba-inu-coin-price-rebounds-as-traders-become-bullish-with-wall-street-memes-thug-life-also-rising" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Thug Life ($THUG)</a> is another meme coin currently making waves in the crypto scene.</p>
<p>Inspired by the popular “Thug Life” meme, the $THUG token has managed to capture the interest of retail traders worldwide.</p>
<p>The token’s ongoing presale has been highly successful, with over $480,000 raised in just one week.</p>
<p>Thug Life&#8217;s presale is unique in the sense that 70% of the token supply is reserved for early investors.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259090" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5.jpg" alt="Picture5" width="602" height="380" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-300x189.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture5-50x32.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This strategy ensures that the community, not the developers, controls most of the token supply.</p>
<p>Adding to the excitement is Thug Life’s branding, which features the globally recognized persona of Snoop Dogg.</p>
<p>While there is no direct connection between Snoop and Thug Life, the fact that the well-known rapper is familiar with the crypto market suggests that there may be opportunities for future collaborations.</p>
<p>With Thug Life’s roadmap already laying out plans for CEX listings, token burns, and a $100 million market cap, the project looks set for success in the months ahead.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Most altcoins have also turned red now, with LTC slumping by over 5% on a 24-hour scale.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin charted a new 13-month high at precisely $31,500 earlier today but was sharply rejected at that point and pushed down hard by $1,500.</p>
<p>This has resulted in a lot of pain for over-leveraged long traders, as the total value of liquidations has shot up to over $140 million in a day.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>CryptoPotato</em> <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-cash-jumps-8-daily-bitcoin-challenges-31k-again-market-watch/" data-wpel-link="internal">reported</a> earlier today BTC&#8217;s voyage to $31,000, which actually resulted in the asset breaking above that level and tapping $31,500 (on Bitstamp) for the first time in over a year.</li>
<li>This notable price surge comes amid growing interest in the asset, especially after BlackRock, and several other financial giants, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/not-just-blackrock-these-companies-have-also-filed-for-spot-bitcoin-etf-in-the-us/" data-wpel-link="internal">filed</a> to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF.</li>
<li>However, the tides quickly changed in the following hours as BTC was not only unable to continue upwards or remain at that level but was sharply driven south.</li>
<li>In a matter of an hour, the cryptocurrency plummeted by over $1,500 and slipped to just under $30,000.</li>
<li>Several altcoins have suffered as well, with ETH dropping below $1,900, while ADA, MATIC, AVAX, and DOGE have slumped by 3%.</li>
<li>Litecoin, on the other hand, has dumped by almost 6% in a day and has nosedived beneath $100. BCH and LEO remain among the few larger-cap alts still in the green.</li>
<li>This enhanced volatility has resulted in over $140 million worth of liquidations, <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">according</a> to CoinGlass. Somewhat expectedly, over 93% of all 46,000 wrecked traders have had long positions.</li>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; Los Angeles, California, July 6th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>DeSo, the leading layer-1 blockchain for decentralizing social media, has issued a groundbreaking challenge: a $1 million bounty for visionary founders capable of building a decentralized competitor to Reddit using its infinite-state blockchain. This unprecedented opportunity arises amid escalating discontent with centralized social media platforms, which monopolize content and data.</p>
<p>Reddit recently sparked controversy within its community following a decision to limit API access. This move provoked a series of 48-hour subreddit blackouts in protest. This price hike for their API has forced existing third-party developers to shut down as maintaining their applications becomes impossible.</p>
<p>As Reddit prepares to go public, it is paving the way for fresh products and its in-house developer platform. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman revealed an interest in capitalizing on the platform&#8217;s wealth of data: “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” he commented. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”</p>
<p><div class="embed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeaX3Wj6Tpg?showinfo=0"></iframe></div></p>
<p>This controversy and others highlight the ongoing problems with centralized social media platforms. It&#8217;s not just Reddit; the landscape of web2 social media is changing. Over the past weekend, <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1675214274627530754?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1675214274627530754%7Ctwgr%5E710eb89f7542583e9dfbe2e54ddcce2fe5db35ed%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cbsnews.com%2Fnews%2Ftwitter-outage-prompts-response-from-elon-musk%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Elon Musk </a>temporarily restricted the number of posts Twitter users can read per day, inciting significant backlash:</p>
<blockquote><p>“To address extreme levels of data scraping &amp; system manipulation, we’ve applied the following temporary limits: Verified accounts are limited to reading 6000 posts/day, Unverified accounts to 600 posts/day, and New unverified accounts to 300/day”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Against this backdrop, <a href="https://www.deso.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DeSo</a> is rising as a viable challenger.</p>
<p>Positioned at the forefront of social media disruption, DeSo offers up to $1M to support builders ready to architect an on-chain alternative to Reddit. This opportunity facilitates the creation of a user-led, creator-owned decentralized platform, one where you own your content as securely as you own your Bitcoin.</p>
<blockquote><p>DeSo&#8217;s founder, Nader Al-Naji, reflected on the recent dissatisfaction with Reddit: &#8220;These protests represent a broader societal shift. They are indicative of a new paradigm in how creators and users interact with social media. As trust in mainstream media and corporations falters, people are gravitating towards platforms that grant them autonomy over their content and social graph, much like owning Bitcoin does with money.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<h2>The DeSo Way</h2>
<p>Imagine an on-chain Reddit where users hold full control over their content and cannot be censored or banned at the protocol level. This concept introduces the idea of &#8216;community as an asset,&#8217; where users and moderators can directly own and monetize their content, transitioning from mere respect and clout to tangible rewards.</p>
<p>This is only possible on the DeSo blockchain, which offers novel monetization features, including creator coins, NFTs, tokens, tipping, etc. With DeSo, your identity, profiles, content, and social graph are 100% on-chain, fostering a censorship-resistant layer where the community can moderate at scale instead of a centralized gatekeeper.</p>
<p>This is a call to arms for ambitious founders and builders who want to make lasting changes to social media the DeSo way.</p>
<h2>Investment and Applicant Criteria</h2>
<p>DeSo is prepared to invest up to $1M to fund a Reddit competitor built on its platform. Ideal candidates are seasoned founders with robust technical expertise and a proven history of building consumer products from the ground up.</p>
<p>Candidates should thoroughly understand DeSo&#8217;s vision for a decentralized Reddit and have strategies for user acquisition and engagement in a crypto-native way.</p>
<p>An enticing pitch demonstrating early signs of positive user feedback and usage is also expected. All applications should be submitted on <a href="https://openfund.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">Openfund.com</a> to enable detailed evaluation.</p>
<p>For comprehensive instructions on how to apply and more information about how to apply, please read our original proposal and our formal announcement.</p>
<p>Once fully comprehended the opportunity at hand, please submit your proposal with all relevant links<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc-KH29Tcbrt5KuMwLYnRbQWmyqbfoXqldFgjUJQQJiqLrNQg/viewform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external"> here.</a></p>
<h2>About Deso</h2>
<p>Raising $200 million from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/deso-foundation/investor_financials" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">leading investors</a> such as Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, Coinbase Ventures, and more, <a href="https://www.deso.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">DeSo</a> is a pioneering layer-1 blockchain whose mission is to decentralize social media, much like Bitcoin and Ethereum have decentralized finance.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; DUBAI, DUBAI, July 6th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p>The options trading market gets another boost thanks to yet another collaboration between the cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BIT and the duo of Darley Technologies and DWF Labs.</p>
<p>Just recently, BIT rolled out options tied to Cardano&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bit.com/usd-options?type=ADA" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-wpel-link="external">ADA</a> token in collaboration with strategic partner Darley Technologies and market maker DWF Labs. Today, LADYS Options marks a significant milestone in the industry as the world&#8217;s first Meme-coin Options brought to the market for both institutional and retail traders.</p>
<p>Options might be seen as an intimidating instrument for new traders or existing spot traders. This type of derivative gives the trader the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price on or before a specific date. The core functionalities of options are binary: the right to buy the asset is a call option, and the right to sell it is a put option.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our intention is to simplify access to options trading for all traders, providing an interface that is simple to understand and instruments that are in line with what communities are passionate about. Meme-coins are an excellent way to engage people to learn options trading&#8221; said Andrei Grachev, the Managing Partner of DWF Labs.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are proud to announce the listing of LADYS options as the world&#8217;s first meme-coin options, made possible through the support of our esteemed partners, Darley Technologies and DWF Labs.&#8221; Said Justin Buitendan, the Global Head of Institutional Sales of BIT, &#8220;Meme coins have experienced rapid growth, and we are thrilled to provide our clients with an additional avenue to enhance their trading strategies. LADYS options mark the starting point of an exciting journey, and there are more exciting opportunities on the horizon.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The incredible popularity of the LADYS token, as well as the sudden sprout of related projects, made it the perfect candidate for the first Meme-coin Option to be traded, thanks to the alliance between BIT, DWF Labs, and Darley Technologies.</p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Indians have shown interest in digital assets lately (especially during the COVID-19 pandemic), whereas some leading crypto-related companies have decided to expand their presence in the Asian nation.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The First Such Event in India</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a document seen by </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CryptoPotato</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, the upcoming &#8220;India Blockchain Week&#8221; will be the first Web3 event with pan-industry agenda in India.

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano ($ADA) finds its recent momentum slowing down, with the token’s price dropping 5% in the past two days.</p>
<p>After a period of sustained positivity, it appears that the bears have regained control – leading many to speculate that $ADA may be on the precipice of another downtrend.</p>
<p>In contrast, new Web3 platform Launchpad XYZ ($LPX) continues to turn heads in the market and has succeeded in raising over $1.1 million through its ongoing presale.</p>
<h2>Cardano Stumbles as Bullish Momentum Comes to an End</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, the $ADA price is hovering around $0.286, following two bearish daily closes in a row.</p>
<p>Price has rejected the resistance zone at $0.300, which was also tapped at the end of June.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for $ADA bulls, price has broken below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) – a commonly-used proxy for a token’s short-term trend.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259008" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="288" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5-300x144.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture1-5-50x24.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This break below the 20-day EMA signals that bearish pressure could now start mounting on Cardano.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cardano/onchain-analysis/" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CoinMarketCap</a> data, a whopping 88% of $ADA holders are out of the money at the current price – an indicator that the market conditions are causing unease among Cardano investors.</p>
<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/ADA?pid=coingecko&amp;utm_source=coingecko_widget" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">IntoTheBlock</a> reveals that the number of large $ADA transactions has decreased by 24%, further evidencing the lack of interest from the crypto community.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Uncertainty Adds to $ADA’s Woes</h2>
<p>The recent price drop signifies that $ADA bulls are opting to take profits rather than wait for an extended uptrend.</p>
<p>Regulatory events in the US have pushed Cardano into murky waters after the SEC categorized $ADA (along with several other cryptos) as securities last month.</p>
<p>Following this, major platforms like Revolut, Robinhood, and eToro have announced plans to delist the token – adding further pressure to $ADA’s position in the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-259010" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="401" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Picture2-6-50x33.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>This decision to delist $ADA indicates a wave of caution from trading platforms, even though most in the crypto community contest the “security” label that the SEC has placed on Cardano.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the uncertainty surrounding the token has impacted its price, evidenced by its inability to sustain positive momentum for more than a few days.</p>
