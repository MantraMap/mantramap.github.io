<p>BaseFEX is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange platform. It provides traders with the ability to trade various cryptocurrency futures contracts with leverage. BaseFEX offers a range of features and tools for trading, including a user-friendly interface, advanced trading charts, risk management options, and a customizable trading experience.</p>

<p>A large investor, known as a &#8220;whale,&#8221; has recently made a deposit of 4.62 million RDNT tokens (equivalent to 1.4 million dollars) at cryptocurrency exchange Binance. This deposit suffered a loss even though the value of the token had increased earlier that day.</p>



<p>It appears that this whale had been accumulating tokens for the past two months, spending a total of 1.55 million USDC to purchase the 4.62 million RDNT tokens.</p>

<p>These purchases were made through a platform called Odos Protocol, and the average price paid per token was $0.3353. </p>

<p>Despite the loss incurred through the recent deposit, it is unclear whether the whale plans to sell their RDNT tokens. If they were to do so at current market prices, they would face a loss of approximately $157,000. However, there may be other factors at play that influence the whale&#8217;s decision to hold onto their tokens or sell them at a later time.</p>

<p>ShapeShift is a popular cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to quickly and easily trade one cryptocurrency for another without the need for creating an account or undergoing a lengthy registration process. It was founded in 2014 by Erik Voorhees and has gained recognition in the crypto community for its simplicity and privacy-focused approach.</p>



<p>ShapeShift is its ability to facilitate instant cryptocurrency swaps. Users can select the cryptocurrency they want to convert and the cryptocurrency they want to receive, and ShapeShift will execute the trade at the current exchange rate. ShapeShift supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, making it convenient for users to exchange various digital assets.</p>



<p>ShapeShift is its non-custodial nature. Unlike traditional exchanges, ShapeShift does not hold user funds in its platform. Instead, it enables direct peer-to-peer transactions between users&#8217; wallets, allowing for increased security and control over their assets. This also means that ShapeShift does not require users to create an account or provide personal information, enhancing privacy and anonymity.</p>



<p>ShapeShift has evolved over time and introduced additional features to its platform. This includes the ShapeShift API, which allows developers to integrate ShapeShift functionality into their own applications, and ShapeShift Membership, a subscription-based program that offers benefits such as higher trading limits and rewards.</p>



<p>ShapeShift underwent a significant change in 2021, transitioning from its original model to a decentralized exchange (DEX) known as ShapeShift DAO. As a DEX, ShapeShift DAO operates on a blockchain network, enabling users to trade cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner while maintaining control over their funds.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="513" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-1024x513.png" alt="ShapeShift Reviews: Your Multi-Chain Crypto Home Base?" class="wp-image-199608" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-1024x513.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-768x385.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-1536x770.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-2048x1027.png 2048w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-750x376.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-97-1140x572.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="ShapeShift Reviews: Your Multi-Chain Crypto Home Base? 12"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>ShapeShift works as a cryptocurrency exchange platform that allows users to trade one cryptocurrency for another in a quick and straightforward manner. Here&#8217;s an overview of how SS typically operates:</p>



<ol>
<li>Selection of Cryptocurrencies: Users start by selecting the cryptocurrencies they want to exchange. SS supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies, including popular ones like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and many others.</li>



<li>Input of Receiving Address: Users provide the wallet address where they want to receive the converted cryptocurrency. This address must correspond to the selected cryptocurrency.</li>



<li>Confirmation of Transaction Details: SS displays the exchange rate and the amount of cryptocurrency that will be received based on the current market rate. Users review and confirm the transaction details before proceeding.</li>



<li>Sending the Initial Cryptocurrency: Users initiate the trade by sending the initial cryptocurrency they want to exchange to a unique deposit address provided by SS. This can be done by scanning a QR code or manually entering the address.</li>



<li>Verification of Transaction: SS monitors the blockchain network to confirm the receipt of the initial cryptocurrency. Once the transaction is verified, SS proceeds to the next step.</li>



<li>Sending the Converted Cryptocurrency: After the verification, SS sends the converted cryptocurrency to the receiving wallet address specified by the user. The transaction is executed at the current exchange rate provided at the beginning of the process.</li>



<li>Transaction Completion: Once the converted cryptocurrency is sent, the transaction is considered complete. Users can verify the transaction on the blockchain network by checking the receiving wallet address.</li>
</ol>



<p>ShapeShift operates as a non-custodial exchange, meaning it does not hold user funds or require user accounts. Users maintain control over their wallets and private keys throughout the exchange process, which enhances security and privacy. However, it also means that ShapeShift does not offer features like account balances or transaction history.</p>



<p>ShapeShift provides a user-friendly interface on its website and also offers an API for developers to integrate its functionality into their own applications. By simplifying the cryptocurrency exchange process and emphasizing user control and privacy, ShapeShift aims to provide a convenient solution for users seeking to swap cryptocurrencies efficiently.</p>

<li>Fee Calculation: SS&#8217;s fees are integrated into the exchange rate to provide users with a transparent and simplified trading experience. This means that the exchange rate you see at the beginning of the transaction already includes the applicable fees, so you don&#8217;t need to calculate them separately.</li>



<li>Fee Disclosure: SS provides transparent fee disclosure during the transaction process. Before confirming the trade, you will see the exchange rate and the resulting amount of the converted cryptocurrency, which includes the fees.</li>

<p>ShapeShift had a mobile app available for both iOS and Android devices. The ShapeShift app provided users with a convenient way to access and manage their cryptocurrency exchanges on the go. However, it&#8217;s important to note that the availability and features of the ShapeShift app may have evolved or changed since then, and I recommend checking the official ShapeShift website or app store for the most up-to-date information on the ShapeShift app.</p>



<ol>
<li>Cryptocurrency Trading: The SS app likely allows users to trade one cryptocurrency for another directly from their mobile devices. Users can select the cryptocurrencies they want to exchange, input the necessary addresses, and complete the transactions.</li>



<li>Wallet Integration: The app may integrate with users&#8217; cryptocurrency wallets, allowing them to securely store and manage their digital assets within the app. This integration simplifies the process of initiating trades and accessing funds for exchanges.</li>



<li>Account Management: The SS app might offer features for managing user accounts, such as viewing transaction history, checking balances, and monitoring the status of ongoing trades.</li>



<li>Price Tracking and Alerts: SS app users may have access to real-time cryptocurrency price tracking, enabling them to stay updated on market trends. Additionally, the app might provide price alerts to notify users of significant price movements or specific price targets.</li>



<li>Security Features: ShapeShift likely incorporates security measures in its app, such as encryption, two-factor authentication (2FA), and biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or face recognition) to ensure the safety of user accounts and transactions.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">ShapeShift Security</h2>



<p>ShapeShift places a strong emphasis on security to protect user funds and personal information. Here are some of the security measures and practices employed by ShapeShift:</p>



<ol>
<li>Non-Custodial Model: SS operates as a non-custodial exchange, which means that it does not hold user funds. Users retain control over their wallets and private keys throughout the exchange process. This reduces the risk of hacking or theft from centralized exchange wallets.</li>



<li>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): SS offers optional two-factor authentication as an extra layer of security. Users can enable 2FA using authenticator apps, such as Google Authenticator or Authy, to provide an additional verification step during account access.</li>



<li>Secure Communication: ShapeShift employs encryption protocols, including HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), to ensure secure communication between users&#8217; devices and the ShapeShift platform. This helps protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</li>



<li>Wallet Integration: SS allows users to use their own cryptocurrency wallets for trading. By utilizing existing wallets, users can leverage the security features of their preferred wallet providers, such as hardware wallets or secure software wallets.</li>



<li>Privacy-Focused: SS respects user privacy and does not require users to create accounts or provide personal information during the exchange process. This reduces the risk of data breaches and protects user anonymity.</li>



<li>Ongoing Security Audits: SS conducts regular security audits and assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. This helps ensure that the platform maintains a robust security posture and stays up to date with the latest security best practices.</li>



<li>Bug Bounty Program: ShapeShift operates a bug bounty program, encouraging security researchers and the wider community to report any security vulnerabilities they discover. This allows ShapeShift to address potential issues promptly and reward those who contribute to the platform&#8217;s security.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color">Conclusion</h2>



<p>ShapeShift caters to users who prioritize simplicity, privacy, and instant exchanges. It is important for users to conduct their own research and understand the fees, risks, and features associated with ShapeShift before engaging in cryptocurrency trading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The founder of Not Larva Labs said he has evidence of the Zagabond scam created by Azuki, and he is willing to testify in court.</em></li>



<li><em>AzukiDAO proposes to hire a lawyer to recover 20,000 ETH from the founder of Zagabond and sue the project.</em></li>



<li><em>So far, the vote has exceeded the majority to pass it.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Jeremy Cahen (Twitter nickname PAULY), founder of NFT marketplace Not Larva Labs, said he would happily help the Azuki community take legal action against co-founder Azuki Zagabond.</strong></h5>

<p>Jeremy Cahen also said that Zagabond and his team fraudulently appropriated more than $100,000,000 from the community. Jeremy would love to testify in court about all this, and I have full personal information about many of the team members involved in these scams.</p>

<p>Specific content includes: hiring a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zagabond, the founder of Azuki, accusing the organization of having many Rug projects; withdrawing 20,000 ETH issued by Elementals from the team and distributing it to the DAO to promote the growth of the entire Azuki community and provide rewards and incentives for artists, content creators, and builder. So far, the vote has exceeded the majority to pass it.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="818" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-1024x818.png" alt="AzukiDAO&#039;s Lawsuit With Founder Zagabond To Recover 20,000 ETH Get Support" class="wp-image-199593" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-1024x818.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-300x240.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-768x613.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-1536x1226.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-750x599.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92-1140x910.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-92.png 1721w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="AzukiDAO&#039;s Lawsuit With Founder Zagabond To Recover 20,000 ETH Get Support 17"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Azuki Dao provides financial support for 20000E Dao. Funds will be used to help us organize a Study Group for the Lawsuit. The proposed voting deadline is July 3. It is known that AzukiDAO and 20000E DAO were founded by members and former owners of the Azuki community, not the official Azuki group.</p>



<p>Ahead of the news on May 10, 2022, the founder of the Azuki team, ZAGABOND.ETH, <a href="https://mirror.xyz/0x1Cb8332607fba6A780DdE78584AD3BFD1eEB1E40/yG8rI1lpQGLPhZch0kjxYRjKTtA9rAL51zg-ZrURyAc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> in a mirror post that the Azuki team has operated three projects CryptoPhunks, Tendies, and CryptoZunks, in the past year.</p>



<p>At the heart of the controversy is their supposed strategy of &#8216;pulling the rug&#8217;, used in the &#8220;Azuki Elementals&#8221; casting process. The move deeply upset the staunch holders of the project.</p>

<p>Originating from the launch of Azuki&#8217;s new series, &#8220;Azuki Elementals&#8221;. The series sold out in less than 20 minutes for 2 ETH each, raising an impressive $38 million.</p>



<p>Many issues surfaced during the launch, from grievances about the short 10-minute time period for Mint being whitelisted to site overload leading to Mint errors and duplications &#8211; overduplication of features between the original Azuki and the new Azuki Elementals. Investors expressed concern about the potential dilution of the first-generation Azuki&#8217;s value. The controversy escalated when the project team reportedly moved 20,000 ETH shortly after the launch.</p>



<p>The event was marred with allegations of unfair behavior and the dizzying price drop of the original Azuki collection, which <a href="https://coincu.com/199468-azuki-nft-floor-price-dropped-54-last-7-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plummeted</a> from over 17 ETH just a week ago to just 5.8 ETH.</p>

<p>This document provides a market overview for the week of June 26th to July 2nd. The content includes updates and analyses of market trends and movements during this period.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Quick look market overview about big news!</strong></h2>



<p>Binance&#8217;s L2 opBNB network is currently running on the testnet. There is a lot of information about this airdrop with the slogan that if you missed BNB in 2017, you should not miss this one, although Binance has announced that there is no airdrop. The way to do it is similar to other L2s, by going to the faucet token testnet and experiencing it.</p>



<p>Binance Labs announces the results of the 5th Incubation Program, consisting of 5 projects receiving investment out of 12 selected for review: Bracket Labs, DappOS, Kryptoskatt, Mind Network, and zkPass. More than 900 projects were registered for the 5th incubation round, but only 12 were selected for review. Finally, only 5 projects were invested in, showing the program&#8217;s strict requirements. Binance Labs also revealed that the 6th incubation round is about to open for registration. Interested projects should follow Binance&#8217;s Twitter for the latest updates.</p>

<p>MicroStrategy has just bought an additional 12,333 $BTC. The average estimated price of this amount of $BTC is $28,136, meaning that the fund currently has a profit of ~$27.6M.</p>



<p>The chairman of the Fed said that interest rates could be raised two more times. Some macroeconomic news from last week: The PCE inflation index decreased to 3.8%, much lower than the estimated 4.6%. Core PCE is at 4.6%, lower than the estimated 4.7%.</p>



<p>SEC said: &#8220;BTC ETF applications are not yet complete,&#8221; causing the price of BTC to drop to 29,500 in the middle of the week. Some updates on Bitcoin Spot ETF:</p>



<p>Fidelity, Wisdomtree, Invesco/Galaxy, and VanEck have all amended their proposals for Bitcoin Spot ETF and submitted new versions to the SEC.</p>



<p>ArkInvest also revised its proposal, but only the current version was modified. This means that the SEC did not return the proposal, so over time, if an ETF is approved, Cathie Wood ArkInvest will be the first company.</p>



<p>All proposals state that they: &#8220;expect to participate in a monitoring agreement with Coinbase, Inc.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bitwise also revised its proposal but did not include any sharing agreement language.</p>



<p>Companies are working very quickly.</p>



<p>BlackRock has not yet revised its text, and on the Nasdaq website, BlackRock&#8217;s proposal is still listed as &#8220;pending.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is important to note that the SEC has not made any official announcements, and all information we hear is from the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>With its intuitive interface, Shakepay simplifies the process of entering the world of cryptocurrencies, particularly for Canadian users.</p>



<p>Shakepay&#8217;s key features include the ability to buy and sell cryptocurrencies using Canadian dollars (CAD), instant transfers between Shakepay users, the SP Card for cryptocurrency spending, and a secure cryptocurrency wallet.

<p>While Shakepay has its strengths, such as its user-friendly interface and instant transfers, there are also some limitations to consider. Shakepay has a limited selection of cryptocurrencies available for trading, and it is currently only accessible to Canadian residents. The platform charges fees for transactions and services, which users should take into account when using the platform.</p>

<p>Shakepay works as a cryptocurrency platform and mobile application that simplifies the process of buying, selling, and spending cryptocurrencies. Here&#8217;s an overview of how Shakepay works:</p>



<ol>
<li>Account Creation: To get started with SP, users need to download the SP mobile app from the App Store or Google Play Store. After installing the app, users can create an account by providing their personal information and completing the verification process.</li>



<li>Funding the Account: Once the account is set up, users can link their bank accounts to the SP app. This allows them to transfer funds from their bank account to their SP account in Canadian dollars (CAD). The linked bank account is used to deposit and withdraw funds.</li>



<li>Buying and Selling Cryptocurrencies: With funds in their SP account, users can buy cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). SP offers a simple interface where users can enter the amount of cryptocurrency they wish to purchase and confirm the transaction. The app will display the current exchange rate and any associated fees. Selling cryptocurrencies follows a similar process, where users can choose to sell their digital assets and receive the proceeds in CAD.</li>



<li>Cryptocurrency Wallet: SP provides a built-in cryptocurrency wallet where users can securely store their digital assets. The wallet supports multiple cryptocurrencies, allowing users to hold and manage different tokens in one place. SP implements security measures, such as two-factor authentication and cold storage, to safeguard users&#8217; funds.</li>



<li>Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrencies: SP allows users to send and receive cryptocurrencies to and from other SP users instantly. Users can simply enter the recipient&#8217;s Shakepay username or scan a QR code to initiate a transfer. This feature makes it convenient for friends or family members to send and receive cryptocurrencies within the SP ecosystem.</li>



<li>Shakepay Card: SP offers a prepaid Visa card known as the SP Card. This card is linked to users&#8217; SP accounts and allows them to spend their cryptocurrencies at any merchant that accepts Visa. When making a purchase, the selected cryptocurrency is automatically converted into the local currency at the current exchange rate, providing a seamless spending experience.</li>



<li>Security and Compliance: SP places a strong emphasis on security and compliance. It employs industry-standard security measures, including encryption, multi-factor authentication, and cold storage for cryptocurrency storage. SP is also regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) as a Money Services Business (MSB), ensuring compliance with applicable regulations and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.</li>
</ol>



<p>Shakepay simplifies the process of buying, selling, and spending cryptocurrencies by providing a user-friendly interface, instant fund transfers, a secure wallet, and the Shakepay Card for easy cryptocurrency spending.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Security firm Dedaub reckons that three-quarters of an administrator&#8217;s private key being stolen led to the carnage on PolyNetwork.</em></li>



<li><em>However, the cause could be Rug Pull or offline software running on three of the four admins was compromised.</em></li>



<li><em>The Poly team has paused their EthCrossChainManager smart contract on several chains, notably Metis, BSC, and Ethereum.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research by security firm Dedaub said that the root cause of PolyNetwork attack could be the theft of three-quarters of the administrator&#8217;s private key.</strong></h5>

<p>Security firm Dedaub stated in a blog post that the root cause of the attack on the PolyNetwork cross-chain interaction protocol was not a logic error in the smart contract but most likely 3/4 errors in smart contracts. Poly Administrator&#8217;s private key has been stolen or misused.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Poly chain hack technical postmortem explains how the signature scheme of the cross-chain bridge was used as intended in smart contract Merkle verifier.<br><br>It is presumed the keeper private keys were compromised (or misused).<a href="https://t.co/EXwSedk9cD" target="_blank">https://t.co/EXwSedk9cD</a></p>&mdash; Dedaub (@dedaub) <a href="https://twitter.com/dedaub/status/1675627338371874816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">July 2, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Dedaub also mentioned that it took PolyNetwork seven hours to respond to the attack, while the attacker orchestrated several transactions across multiple chains to take advantage of this. So far, there is no clear evidence that the private keys were stolen. It could be Rug Pull, or maybe offline software running on three of the four admins was compromised.</p>



<p>Suppose Poly developers confirm that the attack is linked to a compromised signing key. In that case, it raises questions about the applicability of a centralized cross-chain bridge that controls a lot of money.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The attack also showed less-than-perfect monitoring of the Poly group of the underlying bridge. If the protocol has been established with a rapid monitoring solution, this will significantly reduce the response time and potentially save some affected money.</p>



<p>It was reported yesterday that hackers had released over a dozen assets across several chains through Poly Network, worth $35 billion. The Poly team <a href="https://coincu.com/199536-polynetwork-57-assets-10-blockchains-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has paused</a> their EthCrossChainManager smart contract on several chains, most notably on Metis, BSC, and Ethereum.</p>



<p>There are reports that the attackers have transferred more than $5 million in cryptocurrencies on chains like Ethereum.</p>



<p>This is not the first time PolyNetwork has been hacked. Previously on August 10, 2021, caused more than $600 million in damage, but fortunately, the amount was refunded.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Recently a report has begun to spread rumors that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has resigned.</em></li>



<li><em>However, SEC PR told FOX reporters that Gensler would not step down.</em></li>



<li><em>President Gary Gensler is on a full-blown assault on the crypto industry, most notably the recent lawsuit with Binance and Coinbase.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A fake website recently started<a href="https://www.thecryptoalert.com/post/sec-sources-confirm-gary-gensler-resignation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spreading rumors </a>that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has resigned, but that is not true.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81-1024x576.png" alt="Report SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Resigned Is It True?" class="wp-image-199554" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81-1024x576.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81-750x422.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81-1140x641.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-81.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Report SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Resigned Is It True? 30"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The site publishes only a few articles. Some crypto bloggers are also spreading this rumor. In it, one of the sources reporting Gensler&#8217;s resignation is the CoinDesk website. CoinDesk cited an unnamed source as saying that Gensler resigned immediately. However, CoinDesk later updated its story to say that the source was mistaken and Gensler did not leave.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>After the rumor spread, FOX Business Network (FBN) reporter Charles Gasparino attempted to get an answer from SECGov, and as expected, its media department announced that Gary Gensler was not resigning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>At the beginning of June, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched two major legal actions against two leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, accusing the exchanges of violating the US securities laws.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-82.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="788" height="443" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-82.png" alt="Report SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Resigned Is It True?" class="wp-image-199555" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-82.png 788w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-82-300x169.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-82-768x432.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-82-750x422.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 788px) 100vw, 788px" title="Report SEC Chairman Gary Gensler Resigned Is It True? 32"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the heart of this attack is Gary Gensler, who was appointed SEC chairman in February 2021. Gensler today looks like <a href="https://coincu.com/193410-sec-chair-gary-gensler-warns-crypto-frenzy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the crypto industry&#8217;s worst enemy</a>, putting out what sounds like a complete negation of the entire point of the existence of cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>Having said that, since his first year as head of the SEC, Gensler has consistently believed that most cryptocurrencies fit the definition of securities and crypto exchanges. Cryptocurrency needs to be registered with the SEC, and stablecoins are &#8220;poker chips&#8221; to gamble on cryptocurrencies that pose systemic economic risks.</p>



<p>At the same time, Gensler said in testimony before Congress that the US government and Congress should develop more definitive rules for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>However, contrary to this argument, Coinbase has always made the point that the SEC has been deliberately dodging the requirement to make specific regulations for the crypto industry and many other companies in the industry for a long time. However, the crypto companies is still accused of non-compliance.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Litecoin halving just 29 days, 20 hours, and 45 minutes (17682 blocks) ahead of the Litecoin (LTC) block reward halving.</em></li>



<li><em>Litecoin (LTC) price has increased by almost 31% in the past seven days and is currently trading at $114.</em></li>



<li><em>Most investors expect the Litecoin price to increase after the halving event, as the number of rewards will decrease, thus increasing demand.</em></li>

<p>Most investors expect the Litecoin price to increase after the halving event, as the number of rewards will decrease, thus increasing demand. However, there are several other factors to consider.</p>



<p>A significant trend to watch is the influx of new miners. The long-term value of LTC is predicted to increase as supply decreases. As a result, many will want to participate in the possible bull run.</p>



<p>Each LTC price halving is usually very chaotic. This includes a significant price pump, a corresponding correction, a price low, and a local rally to the top. After the halving, the price of LTC was corrected from the high at that time. It will then form a new low followed by a sharp rise to a new all-time high. Therefore, we will likely see a post-halving price pump on August 2, 2023. And according to previous halvings, the price could correct before reaching a local top.</p>



<p>According to experts&#8217; analysis, the cryptocurrency shows a bullish bias and could be close to converting the $100 resistance level into support. This could lead to a major breakout and sustained rally that could lead the token to hit $130 in the near future.</p>

<p>The attack affected 57 assets across 10 blockchains. The team has begun communicating with centralized exchanges, cybersecurity experts, and individuals with relevant knowledge. Users with information are also encouraged to contact the platform. The network also expects attackers to cooperate and return users&#8217; assets to avoid any potential legal consequences.</p>

<p>To further mitigate risk, PolyNetwork contacted most of the project teams and urged them to withdraw liquidity from decentralized exchanges quickly. It also advised users holding affected assets to withdraw liquidity and unlock LP tokens quickly.</p>



<p>According to Beosin Alert monitoring, hackers minted over $34 billion in assets across multiple chains, and some of the stolen funds (approximately $800,000) were moved to the Ethereum address: 0xe0Afadad1d93704761c8550F21A53DE3468Ba599.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 2, blockchain security unit Peckshield<a href="https://coincu.com/199488-polynetwork-suspected-hacking-released-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reported</a> that PolyNetwork had encountered a certain vulnerability, allowing attackers to mint a large number of tokens on many different chains. Specifically, looking at the hacker&#8217;s address, it can be seen that he interacted with Poly Network and minted $42.1 billion worth of tokens.</p>



<p>In the past, PolyNetwork on August 10, 2021, was attacked by bad guys, siphoning up to $611 million. It was the most severe crypto hack in history up to that point, surpassed only by Axie Infinity&#8217;s Ronin bridge hack in March 2022, which caused $622 million in damage. Under pressure from the project and the crypto community, the hacker returned almost all the money taken from the attack a few days later.</p>
