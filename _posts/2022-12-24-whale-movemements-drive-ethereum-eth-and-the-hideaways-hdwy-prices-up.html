<p>Ethereum (ETH) price distances from the negative momentum after two whale addresses moved for the first time in four years. </p>
<p>Investors are getting every opportunity they can to make a profit out of updates like these, with Ethereum (ETH) missing growth expectations in 2022.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) has also welcomed big purchases as crypto investors rushed to pile up on their HDWY holdings before it closes its initial presale on December 31.</p>
<p class="s7">Two Ethereum (ETH) Whale Addresses Move</p>
<p>On-chain analysis shows two Ethereum (ETH) addresses moved for the first time in four years. The movements, one with 13,103.99 ETH and another at 9,878.00 ETH, are believed to have come from the Genesis and Poloniex trading platforms.</p>
<p>The collective number of 22,982.00 ETH currently holds a market value of $27.71 million.</p>
<p>In situations like this, it is safe to say that whales are moving their holdings out of mainstream exchanges in anticipation of a bull run to come. </p>
<p>Investors prefer storing their holdings in cold storage as this is a safer way to do it. Thousands of hacking incidents cost investors billions of dollars yearly, and many have been linked to crypto exchanges.</p>
<p class="s7">Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis</p>
<p>Let us look at Ethereum (ETH) price closely before buying into the surge.</p>
<p>ETH is down 8.54% in the last seven days In total, the crypto major has declined 70% this year. It is one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies of 2022, disappointing analysts&rsquo;forecasted $10,000 price hit for the year. </p>
<p>Newcomer The Hideaways (HDWY) has outperformed Ethereum (ETH) after giving early investors a 900% in the last three months.</p>
<p>On the upside, Ethereum (ETH)&rsquo;s technical indicators are showing signs of recovery. Its relative strength index has recently climbed to 45.68, meaning the oversold pressure has stabilized for now.</p>
<p>We can see ETH heating back at $1,350.00 before the bulls try to climb back to $1,500.00 - a level it had not visited since November 8.</p>
<p class="s7">Investors Accumulate The Hideaways (HDWY) Before Presale Closes</p>
<p>Crypto fans pile on The Hideaways (HDWY) before the new project takes off. </p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is the most successful presale project of 2022, selling 50% of its offerings at the height of the FTX crash which sent Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) to the bottom.</p>
<p>The Hideaways (HDWY) is the first-ever initiative to make real estate investing affordable and decentralized. It offers NFTs tied to real-world assets and gives out up to 20% passive income yield every month. </p>
<p>Nowadays, you&rsquo;re more likely willing to take a risk on a new project with a bright long-term potential than on existing crypto majors without a clear utility. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss your chance while The Hideaways (HDWY) is still offered at $0.10. It will not be long before the price climbs to $1. </p>
