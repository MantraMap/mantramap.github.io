										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Singh was integral in the founding of FTX, faces charges</li>
<li>Code was written to help Alameda take out unlimited line of credit &nbsp;</li>
<li>Singh and Gary Wang borrowed hundreds of millions</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>US authorities are ramping up pressure on Sam Bankman-Fried&rsquo;s inner circle as they scrutinize Nishad Singh, a former close FTX associate according to insiders. Singh was integral in the founding of FTX. He has not been charged with anything, but he may be.&nbsp;Bloomberg&rsquo;s Sonali Basak <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rtFRwbklos">reports</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Is Singh cooperating?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Basak says:</p>
<p><em>We don&rsquo;t know, but we do know he was in the &ldquo;penthouse&rdquo;, he lived with SBF. He was an insider who was really close friends with Sam&rsquo;s brother. Gary Wang, who pled guilty, is cooperating. Part of the CFTC&rsquo;s allegations are that code was written to help Alameda take out this unlimited line of credit that has essentially been found to be customer money. The aim is to see what role Nishad Singh played.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>Who else was in the penthouse?</h2>
<p>Who else might prosecutors be looking at? One issue is the cooperators in the investigation. Damian Williams of the US District Attorney&rsquo;s office said there are <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/cnbc-analyst-it-could-take-months-for-ftx-fallout-to-be-fully-uncovered/">thousands of documents</a>, signal messages, etc. Is it just the penthouse you&rsquo;re looking at, or is it the broader FTX empire?</p>
<p>Basak brought up Ryan Salem, who was found in the court documents in the Bahamas to have tipped off <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/bahamas-denies-allegations-it-told-bankman-fried-to-mint-new-coins/">Bahamian authorities</a>. Then, there&rsquo;s the entity FTX.US, which is said to be more shielded. There are things people knew&hellip;that this &ldquo;penthouse suite&rdquo; kept from them.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Follow the money</h2>
<p>When Singh&rsquo;s name first came up, the new control of FTX had taken over. They put out that report and they talked about this idea that SBF had taken out about a billion dollars in loans through Alameda. They also said Singh and Wang had borrowed hundreds of millions. That&rsquo;s the allegation. They have not responded, at least not publicly.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Whose loans went where?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Some of the information is coming from the bankruptcy filings. The prosecutors are not bankruptcy experts. The authorities are working on tracking &ldquo;whose loans went where to buy what.&rdquo; Ultimately, you&rsquo;re going to have to seize those assets and get that money back.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The domino effect&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In related news, crypto broker Genesis Global Trading eliminated 30% of its staff. Withdrawals have been halted by Genesis Lending for over a month. The question is: how much of this is contained to lending and how much is it a bigger problem for crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group&rsquo;s (DCG) head Barry Silbert, who is a big Wall Street voice?&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The Gemini-Genesis drama&nbsp;</h3>
<p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/genesis-cameron-winklevoss-and-dcgs-barry-silbert-spar-over-frozen-funds.html">reported</a> that Cameron Winklevoss, co-founder and president of Gemini crypto exchange, accused Silbert of engaging in &ldquo;bad faith&rdquo; tactics. He wants to resolve a thorny lending dispute with the company that emerged after FTX collapsed.</p>
<p>The dispute arose from an agreement between Gemini and Genesis Lending, a DCG subsidiary. &nbsp;Gemini offered customers yields of up to 8% through its lending product Gemini Earn. To generate that yield, Gemini lent customer funds to Genesis Global Capital, which lent them out to institutional clients.</p>
<p>Gemini&nbsp;suspended redemptions for its Earn&nbsp;service a few days after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Genesis Global Capital also suspended its loan services. While Gemini denies any link to FTX, Genesis tweeted in November that they had around $175 million in funds locked inside FTX.</p>
<h3>Conflict resolution deadline is tomorrow&nbsp;</h3>
<p>On January 2, Cameron Winklevoss wrote an open letter to Barry Silbert, alleging the latter had refused to meet with the Gemini team on numerous occasions. He set a deadline on January 8 when Gemini wants to see a proposal to resolve the conflict&hellip;or else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a fiery letter, the hosts on Bloomberg conceded. Basak concluded:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>When these things are hashed out on Wall Street, they are done behind investment bankers and lawyers. In crypto, they&rsquo;re done on Twitter&hellip;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li>Shares are down by more than 90% from their all-time high in November 2021&nbsp;</li>
<li>Silvergate is a &ldquo;great example of everything that&rsquo;s wrong with this industry&rdquo; &nbsp;</li>
<li>They were working on a MMF, the most dangerous link in the crypto chain </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Jim Cramer <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/01/06/cramer-explains-why-silvergate-is-a-pivotal-part-of-the-crypto-ecosystem.html">talked about</a> why Silvergate is a &lsquo;pivotal&rsquo; part of the crypto ecosystem on Mad Money, CNBC.</p>
<p>Silvergate&rsquo;s shares plummeted, losing more than 43% yesterday, then another 2% or so. They are down by more than 90% from their all-time high in November 2021. According to the bank, the crypto industry&rsquo;s breakdown caused a run on deposits, prompting it to fire 40% of its staff and sell assets at a major loss. Silvergate held deposits for FTX units and <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/alameda-liquidates-millions-worth-of-tokens-for-bitcoin/">Alameda</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Stocks can always go lower&nbsp;</h2>
<p>According to Cramer, stocks can always go lower and as long as they&rsquo;re above zero, it&rsquo;s fine. However, Silvergate is a pivotal part of the crypto ecosystem because it&rsquo;s a &ldquo;great example of everything that&rsquo;s wrong with this industry.&rdquo; Cramer said:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The bank made a series of horrifying disclosures, which caused (the drastic fall). If we don&rsquo;t address it, I worry that the market cap will shrink to the point where we won&rsquo;t be allowed to talk about it on air.&nbsp;</em></p>
<h2>History of Silvergate Bank</h2>
<p>Silvergate Bank was founded as a savings and loan association in 1988. It was transformed into a bank in 1996 by Dennis Frank and Derek J. Eisele. At first, it was quite small with just three branches in southern California.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2013, CEO Alan Lane made a personal investment in Bitcoin, and the bank went into crypto. They launched services to companies in the crypto space, especially <a href="https://coinjournal.net/exchanges/">crypto exchanges</a>. They got in very early according to Cramer, when most banks didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with Bitcoin. Then, it was &ldquo;really only Bitcoin.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silvergate grew rapidly thereafter, reaching $1.9 billion in assets by 2017. The company was listed in November 2019 at a stock price of $13. The price had risen by 1580% in November 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why did they fail?</h2>
<p>As mentioned, the price is now down over 90% from then. Cramer explains:</p>
<p><em>Silvergate established the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a payment network for the crypto space. You can send USD to other Silvergate customers instantly, 24/7, just like crypto transactions. The bank also offered loans with Bitcoin as collateral. They were working on their own stablecoin, like a pseudo money market fund (MMF) that allows you to go in and out of the market without friction, which is the most dangerous link in the crypto chain.</em></p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic is up 18% in the week</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The network has witnessed an increased hash rate</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic still faces bear pressure at $19</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic (ETC/USD) has been of bull interest in the last two days. Despite losing by an intraday 1% on Friday, it was still up 18% in the week. A majority of these gains happened on January 04, 2023. The gains pushed the cryptocurrency above a crucial descending trendline that has contained ETC for a while. But how far can ETC gains continue?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ethereum Classic was tipped for success when Ethereum <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/ethereum-finally-migrates-to-a-proof-of-stake-after-completing-the-merge/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>shifted to the Proof of Stake</u></a> protocol. Ethereum Classic is itself a Proof of Work protocol. Thus, Ethereum&rsquo;s shift, also known as the Merge, was expected to push PoW miners to Ethereum Classic. Although initially boosting the price, ETC later crashed as the speculations waned.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The latest ETC gains reignite hopes of miner activity on Ethereum Classic. While the hash rate went downward in December 2022, it started to gain momentum toward the new year. The hash rate improved from 97.5975 TH/s on December 27 to 111.7497 TH/s on December 30, according to CoinWarz data. That could indicate increased miner activity and ETC transactions which boosted prices after the new year. But buyers may need to exercise caution at the current price level.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Bullish ETC still facing bearish pressure despite breakout</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETCUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>ETC/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows momentum has increased strongly for ETC. The MACD indicator is attempting to break above the neutral zone. However, bears are trying to force a correction after ETC reached resistance at $19.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What to do with ETC?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Despite breaking above the descending trendline, ETC is facing a correction. The price is yet to trade above the previous high.</p>
<p dir="ltr">A break above the $19 resistance is the needed validation to consider further upsides. Investors should only&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/ethereum-classic/buy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>buy ETC</u></a> if it recovers above $19 with a confirmed bullish momentum. At the current price, ETC still faces a slump back to the $14 bottom price.&nbsp;</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Binance coin has been bearish since the FTX collapse&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The cryptocurrency trades on an upside at $255&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">BNB faces resistance at $266, a crucial resistance level</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">While 2022 was largely bearish for almost every cryptocurrency, Binance (BNB/USD) was relatively stable. That&rsquo;s not to mean that the cryptocurrency was bullish, but at least bears did not run riot as they did for most <a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a>. It helped BNB hold strengths. At one time before the collapse of FTX, BNB neared the $400 price level. Since then, BNB has remained bearish. What happened?</p>
<p dir="ltr">The collapse of FTX ignited fears that no crypto exchange was too big to fail. Investors rushed to decentralised exchanges that benefited from huge outflows from centralised peers. Binance, the world&rsquo;s largest centralised crypto exchange, was among the culprits of the shift. That sent the native token BNB tumbling to $220 by mid-Dec.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Further fears were heightened by Binance&rsquo;s proof of reserves. As CoinJournal <a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/will-this-worrying-binances-proof-of-reserves-crash-bnb-further/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reported</u></a>, an audit report raised questions showing that the exchange was not sufficiently collateralised. BNB has been suffering in the aftermath, although the latest recoveries are promising.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB is facing resistance at $266 after recent recoveries</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/06/1673038949867-a6553cea-237b-4076-92fc-594d5450c262.png" width="600" height="313" class="fr-fic fr-dii"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSDT/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">BNB is mildly bullish on the daily chart. A bullish MACD crossover was initiated, supporting an improved momentum for the cryptocurrency. However, the MACD indicator is bearish. Bulls are yet to close above the neutral zone, which separates the bullish and bearish momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">BNB also trades below the resistance at $266. This is the level bulls defended strongly before the FTX-inspired crash. Therefore, the level is a key test for the bulls.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>BNB price action next</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">A continuation of the current recovery could see BNB return to its former self and turn $266 into support. For this to happen, bulls must overcome the resistance and break higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the flip side, bears will try to position themselves as the <a href="https://coinjournal.net/binance-coin/#:~:text=What%20is%20BNB%20price%20today,trading%20volume%20of%20%24381.11M." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>BNB price</u></a> reaches $266. Already, there is some resistance developing below the resistance zone. A failed breakout will see bears try to force a correction. That could see BNB continue to consolidate below before buyers have another chance.</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Near Protocol (NEAR/USD) ended 2022 on a low note. At just $1.26 on December 31 2022, NEAR is among the worst-performing&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/cryptocurrencies/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>cryptocurrencies</u></a>, having started the year above $16. The selloff in the cryptocurrency accelerated in November 2022 post-FTX collapse. Investors earmarked the cryptocurrency after reports showed FTX had invested in Near Protocol tokens for nearly $50 million.</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as 2023 kicked off, investors have been accumulating the Near Protocol tokens. With a surge of nearly 20% in the past week, NEAR is one of the top-gaining cryptocurrencies. That is underlined by a huge buy-side volume spike as the token bottomed at $1.25. The spike saw NEAR hit $1.65.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>NEAR price outlook and analysis amid increased bullish pressure</strong></h2>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NEARUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NEAR/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The daily chart outlook shows NEAR trading at the descending trendline. The cryptocurrency has been trading on a system of lower lowers and lower highs. The token has retraced at the descending trendline, with the volume indicators showing the entry of bears.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Will NEAR sustain the gains?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">There are no clear indicators for the recent surge in&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/near-protocol/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>NEAR price</u></a>. It could be due to investors spotting an opportunity as the price crashed following the collapse of FTX.</p>
<p dir="ltr">From the price action and technical indicators, NEAR is still bearish and may not sustain gains. Bears are beginning to gain control of price as it hits the descending trendline. With the bear market showing little signs of abating, the recovery could be hard to come for NEAR. Buying the token on a confirmed uptrend is recommended.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">XRP has stalled for the last 3 weeks</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The price has been tied to the crypto sentiment and case with SEC</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Garlinghouse expects a &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo; in crypto regulation in 2023</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/what-is-ripple/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Ripple</u></a> (XRP/USD) trades around $0.33, a level it started for 2023. The cryptocurrency has held the price zone for the past three weeks. Bulls recovered quickly as the price slid to $0.30 on January 2. But still, the upside remains limited. What holds for XRP this year?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Well, much is expected for cryptocurrencies this year after a disastrous 2022. A possible improvement in the macro situation will definitely boost the price, although this looks unlikely in the first quarter. For XRP, Ripple&rsquo;s case with the US SEC will be an additional factor. While there have been glimpses of Ripple&rsquo;s success, the crypto community still remains unsettled over the outcome. For Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, 2023 carries some optimism. But as he advises, it needs caution.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Garlinghouse is not new to throwing punches at the US regulator since the case against Ripple started. Taking to Twitter to share views about crypto in 2023, Garlinghouse believes it is time for regulatory clarity on crypto in the US. Without referring to the pending case with the SEC, the Ripple CEO says it is time to define &ldquo;security&rdquo; in the digital asset sector. He still believes the US stands a chance if regulations come fast, and 2023 could be the year of a &ldquo;breakthrough.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">But as the XRP classification case drags on, there is no notable price change as the outlook reflects caution. Still, the latest price action may excite buyers.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>XRP stalls above the $0.31 support</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://media.igms.io/2023/00/06/1673020201530-7e6ffeb1-e02b-4d15-b547-3553297e232c.png" style="width: 600px" class="fr-fic fr-dib" width="600" height="318"></p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>XRP/USD Chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">A technical outlook shows bulls have successfully defended $0.31 support. An interesting highlight was when a strong bullish pin bar formed as the price slid below the support. The formation of the pin bar underlined that buyers quickly arrested the price drop and stabilised it. However, momentum is weak, with the MACD remaining bearish.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What next for XRP?</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/ripple/#:~:text=What%20is%20XRP%20price%20today,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>XRP price</u></a> may struggle further, but buyers will be observant if prices approach $0.31. The level is a clear buying zone to watch.&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Decentralisation is how blockchain should be used</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Kosala Hemachandra, CEO of MyEtherWallet, told Cointelegraph in a&nbsp;<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/podcasts" rel="nofollow"><u>recent interview</u></a>, that he believes blockchain technology should be used for decentralised purposes.</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to the CEO, creating centralised products defeats the purpose of using&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/glossary/blockchain/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>blockchain technology</u></a>. He said;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>&ldquo;Blockchain, at its core, is a decentralised solution, so why would we create products that are centralised? Because we are defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">Self-custody has been gaining traction in the cryptocurrency space since the&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/this-week-in-crypto-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>collapse of the FTX crypto exchange</u></a> two months ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">MyEtherWallet remains one of the oldest noncustodial wallets in the Ethereum ecosystem. According to the CEO, the wallet went live roughly two weeks after the Ethereum mainnet launch.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">He added that the company continues to operate as a decentralised wallet because it believes it is the only proper way to use blockchain technology.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr"><strong>MyEtherWallet not planning to do an airdrop soon</strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr">Hemachandra revealed that MyEtherWallet is not planning to do an airdrop or launch its token soon. The CEO said the company doesn&rsquo;t see any use case for their own tokens at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">However, the company is working on certain features to enable it to compete with Meta Mask, another leading Ethereum-focused wallet.</p>
<p dir="ltr">MyEtherWallet will be adding support for more blockchain networks, and it recently launched a multichain browser extension. The CEO revealed that MyEtherWallet recorded a surge in users following the FTX saga as users look for decentralised solutions to storing their assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the moment, MyEtherWallet has more than three million users, most of them in the United States and Japan.&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Cryptocurrency prices remained on edge in the first week of the year. Bitcoin remained in a consolidation phase below $17,000. Ethereum remained stuck at $1,200 while the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies remained below $900 billion. Here is the crypto price predictions for some of the top trending coins like Tron, Huobi Token, and VIDT.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Tron&nbsp;</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Tron is a second-generation blockchain project that was started by Justin Sun. It is a blockchain operating system that handles billions of transactions on a daily basis. The network is also associated with other blockchain projects like Sun, JustLend, and JustStables. Also, it has an association with Huobi, BitTorrent Chain, and USDD.</p>
<p dir="ltr">TRX price crashed hard as concerns of its exposure to Huobi continued. There are concerns that Huobi could go out of business. As a result, Tron dropped to the lowest level since November 23. It has moved below all moving averages while oscillators like the MACD and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) drifted downwards. Therefore, the outlook of TRX during the weekend is bearish, with the next key support level to watch being at &nbsp;$0.04.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr">Huobi Token</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Huobi Token (HT) came under pressure after the company announced a new round of layoffs. As we wrote in this&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/news/is-huobi-safe-why-customers-should-be-withdrawing-funds/"><u>article</u></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>there are concerns about the company&rsquo;s liquidity. After the collapse of FTX, there are questions about&nbsp;<a href="https://coinjournal.net/compare/best-cryptocurrency-exchanges/"><u>crypto exchanges</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and their respective tokens. Huobi has not published its reserve data and its results.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, it has seen outflows in the past few days. Data compiled by DeFi Llama showed that users have withdrawn over $114 million in the past month and $90 million in the past 24 hours. Therefore, the Hubi Token price will likely continue falling during the weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">VIDT Datalink</p>
<p dir="ltr">VIDT Datalink is a blockchain project in the data storage industry. It was started by a group of artists in 2019 and then it transitioned into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). It is mostly used in data storage of NFTs and other valuable items.</p>
<p dir="ltr">VIDT price crashed to an all-time low in 2022 as concerns about its role in the blockchain industry emerged. It also dropped as demand for NFTs declined. This week, however, VIDT price rose to a high of $0.030, the highest point since December 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the hourly chart, it has moved above its moving averages while the MACD moved above the neutral point. With volume being low, I suspect that the VIDT price will plunge during the weekend.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin price has been in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks.</p>

<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The US will publish the latest non-farm payrolls (NFP) data.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Strong jobs numbers will be bearish for BTC.</p>

</ul>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/what-is-bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price has been in a tight range in the past few months. BTC/USD has remained between last month&rsquo;s low of about 16,285 and a high of 18,455. Bitcoin has dropped by more than 22% from the highest level in November.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">US non-farm payrolls data</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://coinjournal.net/bitcoin/"><u>Bitcoin</u></a> price has been in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. The next key catalyst for the BTC price will be the upcoming American jobs data. Economists surveyed by Reuters believe that the economy added more than 200k jobs while the unemployment rate remained at 3.7%. If analysts are accurate, it means that the economy added millions of jobs in 2022.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They also expect the data to show that the country&rsquo;s wages held steady in December. The average hourly earnings are expected to have risen by 5.0% while the participation rate remained at 62.1%. These numbers will come a day after ADP published strong jobs numbers. They showed that the economy added 235k jobs.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Stocks open lower after jobs data showed the labor market is still strong" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GqgO7xAzBdQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">US jobs numbers have an impact on Bitcoin prices because they tend to influence the Federal Reserve. The Fed has a dual mandate to ensure that inflation and unemployment rate are steady. It tends to hike rates when inflation is rising. In 2022, the bank hiked rates by 450 basis points.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The NFP payrolls data will come two days after the Federal Reserve published minutes of the past meeting. These minutes revealed that the Fed was considering hiking interest rates in 2023 in a bid to bring inflation lower.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All signs are that inflation is easing. In December, inflation data showed that consumer prices dropped to 7.3% in November. With gasoline prices and natural gas prices falling, there is a likelihood that inflation eased.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Bitcoin price will likely drop if the US publishes strong jobs data because it will mean that the Fed will continue hiking rates.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/?exchange=BITSTAMP"><u>BTC chart by TradingView</u></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The four-hour chart showed that Bitcoin has been in a consolidation phase in the past few weeks. As a result, it has remained at 25-day and 50-day moving averages. It is also moved slightly above the Woodie pivot point while the Average True Range (ATR) has pointed downwards.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Therefore, Bitcoin will likely remain in this range in the coming days as investors wait for the upcoming US inflation data. The key level to watch will be at $15,800.</p>
