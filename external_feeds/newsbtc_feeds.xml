					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is forming a base above the $25,500 support. BTC could start a fresh increase if it clears the key $26,200 resistance zone in the near term. Bitcoin is holding the key $25,500 support zone and consolidating. The price is trading above $26,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a major rising channel forming with support near $25,750 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if there is a move above the $26,200 resistance. Bitcoin Price Could Soon Recover Bitcoin price is still trading above the $25,400 support zone. BTC remained supported after the US CPI report was released which showed the inflation eased to 4% in May 2023. The price is slowly moving higher above the $25,800 level. It cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $26,260 swing high to the $25,713 low. Besides, there is a major rising channel forming with support near $25,750 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin price is now trading above $26,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. It seems to be facing resistance near the $26,150 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $26,260 swing high to the $25,713 low. The first major resistance is near the $26,200 level. A clear move above the $26,200 resistance might start a fresh increase. The next major resistance is near the $26,775 level, above which the bulls might send BTC toward the $27,000 resistance zone. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near the $27,200 level, above which Bitcoin might rise toward the $27,500 resistance. Any more gains above the $27,500 resistance zone might send the price toward the $28,000 resistance zone. Fresh Decline in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $26,200 resistance, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $25,780 level and the channel zone. The next major support is near the $25,500 level, below which the price might struggle to remain in a positive zone. In the stated case, the price could drop toward the $25,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $25,750, followed by $25,500. Major Resistance Levels – $26,150, $26,200, and $26,775.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Ethereum (ETH) has experienced a sharp decline since Saturday, dropping from the $1,838 line down to the current level of $1,738 while XRP traded sideways. This has caused concern among investors and traders in the Ethereum market. However, experts and analysts believe the recent disclosure of the Hinman documents on June 13th could mark a relief wave for Ethereum&#8217;s price.  The Hinman documents refer to a series of emails and memos from the former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, recently released to the public. The Hinman documents include a series of emails and memos from the former director of the SEC, who declared in 2018 that Ethereum&#8217;s native token, Ether, is not a security.  Related Reading: Bitcoin Market At Decision Point: Will This On-Chain Retest Be Successful? Ethereum Traders Should Keep An Eye On The XRP Case Recently, the release of emails from former SEC official William Hinman regarding Ethereum has caused a stir in the cryptocurrency community. While some have claimed that the documents are a smoking gun for the cryptocurrency, others have downplayed their significance. However, analyst Adam Cochran has argued that the documents are a nuance that puts current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler in a corner.  The Hinman speech attempted to clarify the SEC&#8217;s position on digital assets, such as ETH and XRP, and their relation to security regulations. In his speech, Hinman went beyond the scope of the Howey test and attempted to understand the nuanced intent of users vs. investors. He also questioned the concept of morphing, or whether something can be a security and then later not a security. The feedback comment from SEC staff specifically noted to him that they wanted to pivot to the discussion of &#8220;what is a security&#8221; rather than the idea of morphing. And that their concerns came from implication differences between the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Hinman specifically drew attention to the idea that &#8220;promoters&#8221; have a very specific legal analysis point &#8211; and that even a coordinated group of actors working on something wouldn&#8217;t rise to the level of being deemed the promoter if their efforts weren&#8217;t essential. The draft on Ethereum, which came after meeting with Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder, and his lawyers, noted that Ethereum was not at such time a security and that secondary sales didn&#8217;t raise Securities Act concerns &#8211; only Exchange Act and Commodities Act concerns.  According to Cochran, that footnote is of incredible importance as it notes that the SEC internally viewed secondary sales not as sales of the promoter at the time.  Furthermore, Cochran believes the documents are damning for Gensler&#8217;s position because they acknowledge the idea of &#8216;reverse-morphing&#8217; of an asset becoming a security. Suppose the SEC wanted to argue that Ethereum is a security today. In that case, they must acknowledge the idea of &#8216;morphing&#8217;, prove the burden of a promoter being liable for all secondary sales of an asset ever, and break every precedent of horizontal and vertical commonality. Cochran further claimed:  For Gary to conclude that proof-of-stake Ethereum is a security, he would both need to fight a landslide of precedent on the most litigated part of Howey analysis &#8211; and admit to the idea that securities status can change over time with decentralization. Related Reading: Terra Classic Continues To Brush Off Market Downtrends, Buy Now? Overall, many market analysts believe that disclosing the Hinman documents could boost Ethereum&#8217;s price in the short term. This is because it removes some of the regulatory uncertainty surrounding Ethereum and could increase investor confidence in the cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[In a significant development in the legal dispute between Ripple, a blockchain company utilizing XRP in its On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) solution for cross-border transfers, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Hinman materials have now been unsealed.

					<description><![CDATA[The ongoing crackdown by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on the crypto industry has taken a toll on one of the largest exchanges in the market, Binance.  The SEC recently filed a lawsuit against Binance.US, which has resulted in a significant decline in the value of Binance Coin (BNB). BNB has dropped more than 23% in the last week alone, currently trading at $238. Related Reading: Ethereum Bears Set Their Sights On Next Downside Target If $1,700 Support Breaks Binance CEO&#8217;s Bitcoin Sell-Off As reported by NewsBTC, BNB is facing a potentially catastrophic situation after an exploit on the Binance Smart Chain&#8217;s Binance Bridge. The exploit could liquidate $200 million on Venus Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) if the BNB price drops to $220. Given these developments, reports now suggest that Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zao, sell spot Bitcoin (BTC) to prevent BNB from falling to $220. This move has been taken to defend against the liquidation of BNB at this key level, but it also capped the upside potential of Bitcoin. The practice of selling spot Bitcoin to purchase BNB is known as a &#8220;liquidation waterfall,&#8221; it is a common tactic used by exchanges to protect their users from significant losses. As spot Bitcoin is sold off, BNB is purchased, which helps to defend the $220 liquidation level. However, this also puts a cap on the upside potential of Bitcoin as the selling pressure on Bitcoin increases. According to the crypto trader “JW”, Binance and CZ have been selling spot Bitcoin at an alarming rate to support BNB, as seen in the chart above, which has resulted in the decline of Bitcoin&#8217;s value. While this move may help defend against the liquidation of BNB, it can potentially negatively impact the wider cryptocurrency market. In addition, despite positive economic news from the US, Bitcoin is struggling to break through its newly formed resistance at $26,400 and is currently trading at $25,800. The US Consumer Price Index indicates that the country&#8217;s inflation is slowing down, creating a more “relaxed” economic environment.  However, concerns over regulatory crackdowns and alleged selling pressure from Binance and its CEO are mounting, resulting in selling pressure preventing the largest cryptocurrency from continuing its bullish trend. Bitcoin Analyst Anticipates Drop To $24,000 According to cryptocurrency analyst Michael Van de Poppe, Bitcoin is currently facing a crucial resistance level at $26,400 and has been unable to break through it. As a result, Van de Poppe expects the markets to drop into the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled for tomorrow.  Van de Poppe&#8217;s analysis suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s price may experience some downward pressure in the short term. However, he also sees this as an opportunity for traders to buy into the market at a lower price point.  Related Reading: Crypto Frenzy: Whale Accumulates 1.5 Trillion SHIB, Sparking Surge In Price The area around $24,500-$25,000 is a significant support level, and if Bitcoin&#8217;s price drops to this mark, it could present an attractive buying opportunity for investors.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows a Bitcoin metric is approaching a crucial retest that can make or break a rally. Will the bulls come out on top? Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Realized Profit/Loss Ratio Is Nearing 1 Level According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, a successful retest here would be constructive for the price of the asset. The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;realized profit/loss ratio,&#8221; which measures the ratio between the profits and losses that Bitcoin investors throughout the network are realizing right now. The metric works by going through the on-chain history of each coin being sold to see what price it was last acquired at. If this previous price for any coin was less than the BTC value that it&#8217;s now being sold/moved at, then the coin&#8217;s sale is said to be realizing some amount of profit. Naturally, the opposite case would imply that loss realization is occurring with the coin&#8217;s movement. The metric takes the sum of all such profits and losses being harvested in the market and finds the ratio between them. When the value of this ratio is greater than 1, it means that the market as a whole is realizing some amount of profit currently. On the other hand, values under this threshold imply losses are more dominant in the sector right now. In the context of the current discussion, the realized profit/loss ratio for the entire market is actually not the metric of focus, but the version specifically for the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs) is. The STHs are one of the two major groups in the Bitcoin market and include all the investors who have been holding onto their coins since less than 155 days ago. Related Reading: Bitcoin Stuck In Historically Tight Range, Calm Before The Storm? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) BTC STH realized profit/loss ratio over the last couple of years: The value of the metric seems to have been going down in recent days &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day EMA Bitcoin STH realized profit/loss ratio has been above 1 during the past few months, suggesting that profit realization has been the dominant force. This naturally makes sense, as the rally occurred during this period, which would have made it so that these investors would be in plenty of profits. Recently, however, the metric has been going down as the price has observed a decline. From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator is now closing in toward the 1 mark. The 1 line has historically held immense significance for the market, as it serves as the point where the STHs are just breaking even on their selling. During bearish periods, this line has usually provided resistance to the price of Bitcoin, while it has switched to being a support point during bullish regimes. The reason behind this interesting pattern lies in the fact that investors look at their break-even mark very differently between the two types of markets. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Whale Transfers Spike, Bearish Sign? In a bearish environment, investors see the break-even mark as an ideal exiting point, as that way, they can at least avoid getting into losses. Thus, a lot of selling takes place at the level, leading to the price feeling resistance. Similarly, the investors look at the level as a profitable buying opportunity during rallies, so they participate in some buying at it. Obviously, if the current rally has to have any chance at going, this retest of the 1 level would have to be successful. If a breakdown happens here, however, then a bearish regime might return for Bitcoin. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, up 1% in the last week.

					<description><![CDATA[The price of Ethereum is currently on a downtrend and is approaching a significant support level. In the past 24 hours, there has been little movement on the chart, while on the weekly chart, ETH has experienced a depreciation of over 3%. This downtrend in Ethereum is consistent with the volatile behavior of Bitcoin, which has been moving back and forth around the $26,000 price mark. Other altcoins have also been exhibiting similar patterns and the technical analysis of Ethereum indicates a bearish influence. Both the demand and accumulation levels on the chart have remained low. So it is crucial for Ethereum to move away from the $1,700 support line to avoid further bearish pressure. If the price falls below this level, it may become challenging for Ethereum to recover. Related Reading: MATIC Price Displays Recovery But Can Bulls Sustain The $0.50 Support? Additionally, for Ethereum to initiate a recovery, Bitcoin needs to halt its sharp retracement on its own chart. The decline in the Ethereum market capitalization also suggests that sellers currently have the upper hand in the market. Ethereum Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,750. Following a rejection at the $1,840 price level, ETH has been experiencing a downtrend with unsuccessful attempts at recovery. The coin faces overhead resistance at $1,770. If Ethereum manages to surpass this resistance level, it may receive support from the bulls and potentially reach $1,800. Conversely, if sellers exert further pressure, Ethereum could drop below its nearest support level at $1,700. A decline below this level would likely lead to a price of around $1,660 for ETH. The volume of ETH traded in the last session was indicated as red, suggesting low buying strength in the market. Technical Analysis Since the beginning of June, ETH has experienced a notable decrease in demand, which has coincided with increased market volatility. As a result, buyer confidence has declined. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the market is oversold, as it is below both the half-line and the 40-mark. Additionally, the price of ETH has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average, suggesting low demand and indicating that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. However, if ETH can surpass the $1,770 level, there is potential for demand to make a comeback. Breaking above this resistance level could attract buyers and potentially lead to an increase in demand for Ethereum. In addition to the previously mentioned indicators, other technical indicators on the chart of the altcoin suggest sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures price momentum and potential reversals, has formed red signal bars and these bars are associated with sell signals for the altcoin. Related Reading: Cardano Price Falls Below Key Support Levels, Will It Continue To Fall? The Bollinger Bands, which represent price volatility and fluctuation, have started to diverge. This suggests that the price of the altcoin may experience increased fluctuations in the upcoming trading sessions. Given this, it is crucial that ETH holds the $1,700 support or risk rapid decline.

<p>At the time of writing, ETH was trading at $1,750. Following a rejection at the $1,840 price level, ETH has been experiencing a downtrend with unsuccessful attempts at recovery. The coin faces overhead resistance at $1,770.</p>
<p>If Ethereum manages to surpass this resistance level, it may receive support from the bulls and potentially reach $1,800. Conversely, if sellers exert further pressure, Ethereum could drop below its nearest support level at $1,700.</p>
<p>A decline below this level would likely lead to a price of around $1,660 for ETH. The volume of ETH traded in the last session was indicated as red, suggesting low buying strength in the market.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of June, ETH has experienced a notable decrease in demand, which has coincided with increased market volatility.</p>
<p>As a result, buyer confidence has declined. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the market is oversold, as it is below both the half-line and the 40-mark.</p>
<p>Additionally, the price of ETH has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average, suggesting low demand and indicating that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market.</p>
<p>However, if ETH can surpass the $1,770 level, there is potential for demand to make a comeback. Breaking above this resistance level could attract buyers and potentially lead to an increase in demand for Ethereum.</p>

<p>In addition to the previously mentioned indicators, other technical indicators on the chart of the altcoin suggest sell signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which measures price momentum and potential reversals, has formed red signal bars and these bars are associated with sell signals for the altcoin.</p>

<p>The Bollinger Bands, which represent price volatility and fluctuation, have started to diverge. This suggests that the price of the altcoin may experience increased fluctuations in the upcoming trading sessions. Given this, it is crucial that ETH holds the $1,700 support or risk rapid decline.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The bustling realm of cryptocurrencies is abuzz with a major development centered around Shiba Inu (SHIB). This news broke as Lookonchain, an on-chain analyst platform, reported a transaction involving a significant accumulation of Shiba Inu tokens by a major holder. This transaction took place on notable exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase and has made waves in the crypto community. According to Lookonchain&#8217;s data, a SHIB holder, identifiable by the address &#8220;0x40B3,&#8221; has recently added a colossal 1.5 trillion SHIB tokens to their portfolio. At current market rates, this acquisition equates to approximately $10 million. A History Of Accumulation Notably, this particular holder, &#8220;0x40B3,&#8221; has a history of substantial SHIB purchases. The holder had previously acquired 5.3 trillion Shiba Inu tokens, translating to around $35.5 million. On May 16, &#8220;0x40B3&#8221; made a transfer of 20 trillion SHIB tokens to another address, &#8220;0x73AF,&#8221; amounting to roughly $134.4 million. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price At The Most Crucial Point In Its History? Owing to these sizable transactions, &#8220;0x40B3&#8221; has garnered attention within the crypto ecosystem. The scale of their holdings, rendering them the largest nonexchange holder of Shiba Inu, emphasizes their influence on the SHIB market. Impact On The SHIB Market The acquisition of the recent 1.5 trillion SHIB tokens by &#8220;0x40B3&#8221; had an immediate effect on the SHIB price. In just 15 minutes following the acquisition, the price of Shiba Inu surged over 1.5%. This brief window of time encapsulated the influence wielded by &#8220;whales,&#8221; or large-scale investors, over the price volatility in the cryptocurrency markets. Moreover, the SHIB price appears to be on a recovery path, with an uptick of nearly 25% since its recent low of $0.00000591 last Saturday. This rebound illustrates the dynamism of the cryptocurrency market and the significant role large investors play in shaping it. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu has shown a continuous uptick in the past 24 hours. SHIB which is one of the largest meme coins by market capitalization has recorded a brewing rally up by 3% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu currently trades at $0.00000678 after trading below $0.00000600 on Tuesday. Interestingly, despite the current uptick, SHIB&#8217;s trading volume has plunged a bit from $185 million this time last week to $104 million in the past 24 hours. However, the meme coin&#8217;s market capitalization has seen a more than $700 million loss in the past 7 days. SHIB&#8217;s market cap has plunged from $4.7 billion last Tuesday to $3.9 billion as of today. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Could Soar To Major Highs Soon, Here’s Why In other news, the upcoming launch of Shibarium has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the Shiba Inu community due to some recent developments. Initially, LucieSHIB, a well-known advocate for Shiba Inu, set expectations for the launch of the eagerly awaited Shibarium mainnet, suggesting a timeframe between the second and third quarters of 2023. Nonetheless, according to recent posts from the same individual, the launch might experience a postponement from its initial projected timeline, causing a wave of speculation among market participants and aficionados.&#8221; Featured image from Shutterstock, Chart from TradingView]]></description>

Visit Mirax → Your Guide to Choosing the Best Crypto Crash Gambling Sites The number of Crash gambling sites is growing rapidly, and you want to locate the best games. So how can you find the best sites, and what are the criteria for selecting them? In this article, we will tackle all the important questions, so you can embrace the opportunity of safe and convenient Crash online gambling. Let&#8217;s take a look at the top things to consider when choosing the best crash gambling site for your needs. Convenient and Safe Gambling Sites In our opinion, the best crash gambling sites should ensure a convenient and safe experience for players. You should aim to stick with reputable and trusted brands with a proven track record of servicing gamblers with the best possible offers, while also providing top security measures. Before stepping into one of the Crash betting sites, you want to check its license, history, implemented encryption technology, and third-party certificates of trust. Diverse Payment Options A good site for Crash gambling should accept a wide range of payment methods. This includes all the top cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, LTC, ETH, DOGE, BCH, and others. Most crypto gamblers might also appreciate the inclusion of fiat currencies so that they can quickly convert their holdings into crypto and return them to fiat. Apart from the number of available payment options, you need to know the minimum deposit amount, required fee, and withdrawal terms, such as limits, payout time, and so on. Bonuses on Crypto Crash Gambling Sites The best crash gambling sites should offer you a decent selection of bonuses. If you can find anything from the welcome bonus, deposit bonuses, free spins, and no-deposit offer to reload offers, VIP bonuses, bookmakers&#8217; offers, and similar deals, you have a win-win situation. You’ll probably also value the fact your Crash site appreciates your time spent on its platform and delivers regular perks to its loyal customers. But you should also pay attention to the promotion&#8217;s terms and conditions. This includes checking the wagering requirements, promo codes, and other details that could make a difference. Playthrough requirements serve to show the number of times someone has to wager the bonus amount plus crypto deposits before the withdrawal. Remember that some bonuses are only accessible if you insert a bonus code in the designated tab. Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals Many players feel unprepared to jump into the crypto-only gambling experience. They usually look for hybrid platforms that offer both crypto and fiat currencies. This makes them feel safer and more comfortable before making a full transition. However, finding an end-to-end (crypto-only) Crash gambling site comes with multiple benefits for users. This includes an anonymous gambling experience, faster deposits and withdrawals, higher withdrawal limits, and lower fees. Sites That Prioritize Customer Satisfaction While spending your time on crypto Crash gambling sites, you’ll probably have to contact customer support at some point. And if the site of your choice doesn&#8217;t respond within a reasonable timeframe, you’ll probably feel neglected. You want to deal with customer-centric support that handles all your requests in a timely way. That&#8217;s where our recommended best Crash gambling sites come into play, providing super fast and useful answers via chat, email, or phone. Pros of Crash Gambling Sites Choosing the best crash gambling sites is a good option for several reasons. Apart from providing a crypto-friendly experience, they are good places for customers looking to win big and receive their winnings in the blink of an eye. 24/7 Accessibility Cryptocurrency Crash sites are available 24/7, so you just choose your preferred time and join the action. In addition to regular access, you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy table games, slot games, live dealer action, sportsbook choices, football, and plenty of other interesting options. The brands keep improving their offers, so you will always have something in the gaming library. Instant Payouts on Crash Gambling Sites Your crypto arrives almost instantly, so you don&#8217;t have to wait hours or days to see your balance updated with your new earnings. Winnings appear in a matter of seconds, and you can open your favorite games immediately and start collecting points. Anonymous Gameplay Getting started with a crypto Crash game also means full anonymity for you. No one will breach your privacy and steal your data. This is as opposed to traditional brands, which will seek your name, date of birth, and other sensitive information that you don&#8217;t want to share elsewhere. Provably Fair Games Provably fair games are an important aspect of the cryptocurrency casino industry, ensuring transparency and fairness in online gambling. This concept was introduced to address concerns about the integrity of online casino games, particularly in the context of crypto transactions. The provably fair games offer players the ability to independently verify the fairness of each game round by examining the underlying algorithms, seeds, and random number generation processes. When it comes to crash gambling games, the provably fair mechanisms typically involve the use of cryptographic hashes and seeds. Before each game round, a server seed and a client seed are combined and hashed to determine the outcome of the crash multiplier. The server seed is provided by the casino and kept hidden until the game round ends, while the client seed can be chosen by the player or generated by their device. Once the round is over, the server seed is revealed, allowing players to verify that the outcome was determined fairly. By rehashing the seeds and comparing the result with the crash multiplier displayed during the game, players can ensure that the game was not rigged or manipulated in any way. This level of transparency and verifiability builds trust between players and crypto casinos. It assures players that the game results are truly random and eliminates concerns about the house having an unfair advantage. The provably fair games also encourage casino operators to maintain a trustworthy reputation, as any attempts to manipulate the outcomes would be easily detectable. Enhanced Features and Experiences In usual cases, the best crash gambling sites follow the trend and offer modern sleek designs, a convenient user-interface, great features, and overall thrilling gameplay experiences. This comes with impressive content from the top software providers, such as Microgaming and NetEnt, along with tournaments for competitive gameplay. Mobile Optimized Crash Games If you choose Crash blockchain casinos, you&#8217;ll be able to access the games from different devices, including Android and iOS. This is because crypto casinos and their games are perfectly optimized for a smaller screen, so they fit the needs of various readers. The gameplay is also available in the dedicated apps. Worldwide Crash Gambling Trend Crash gambling games continues to gain traction in different markets around the world. This has made it easier to find great options and just jump in and join the action. The game has become the first choice of people in different countries, including the US and the UK, where people look for additional ways to claim rewards and benefit from better RTP. If you also take into consideration better payouts and an enhanced player experience, there is no doubt that Crash gambling games are now the leading option. Mastering Crash Games Finding a decent crypto Crash website is just one step before you embark on regular betting action. Before that, you should be aware of Crash gambling rules and how to make the most out of this game. After its official launch in 2014, Crypto Crash has become one of the most demanded products in the market. The idea behind the launch was to design a game suited for crypto enthusiasts. What&#8217;s interesting about this game is its resemblance to crypto market fluctuations. First, you will have the line going up just as crypto prices spike in value. After a while, it falls, resembling the potential collapse of your favorite coins. If you’re a complete beginner at crypto Crash gambling games, you won&#8217;t have a complicated time getting started. A crash game is simple to play, and your rounds are available in short-time sequences. How To Get Started with Ease The first step when you get started with a Crash Bitcoin game is setting the amount of your bet. Then you click Bet (next round), and the game can begin. You’ll start the game at a 1.00x multiplier, and it will move up from there. You’ll see the multiplier go up along with the line representing it. It is possible to cash out anytime and collect the multiplier shown. The most important thing is that you pick a multiplier according to your preferences while cashing out on time to prevent losing everything. Remember that multipliers can increase drastically, but your task is to be ready for a quick reaction. Furthermore, the best crash gambling sites constantly add more features to spice up your experience. For example, you’ll find options for both automatic and manual gameplay. Choosing a manual bet allows you to control the amount you bet in every round. Another option is to set automatic bets and enjoy as many rounds as possible. You can even set the maximum loss or profit figure, a feature that automatically ceases your gameplay when you reach a certain limit. Cashout is another option that provides you with automatic cashouts once you arrive at a specific multiplier. Once you learn the basics of Crash gambling, you’ll be able to sample casino games on different websites and adjust your preferences. Pro Tips for Maximizing the Experience The truth is that a Crash gambling are games of chance, although they are provably fair games, they are still based on pure luck. Crypto gambling sites always have an edge over players, and no strategy can guarantee profit and a 100% successful outcome.

In this regard, the best crash gambling strategy for players is to simply enjoy your time on the crash game. And who knows, maybe you can win more than you’ve ever imagined. Risk And Reward Do you want big wins or small and steady earnings? Choosing the former option means that you should prepare yourself for frequent losses. This crash gambling approach works best if you set the automatic cashouts at a certain multiplier. You can easily get a decent return on investment by sticking with this approach. Just make sure you play with the best Crash platforms, and you are good to go. Alternatively, if you look for big wins, you should be patient enough to watch the multipliers reach high levels. Sometimes, it could take you months or years to reach the desired amount. But once you hit a huge multiplier, you can become a millionaire.

<h2>Your Guide to Choosing the Best Crypto Crash Gambling Sites</h2>
<p>The number of Crash gambling sites is growing rapidly, and you want to locate the best games.</p>
<p>So how can you find the best sites, and what are the criteria for selecting them? In this article, we will tackle all the important questions, so you can embrace the opportunity of safe and convenient Crash online gambling.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the top things to consider when choosing the best crash gambling site for your needs.</p>
Convenient and Safe Gambling Sites
<p>In our opinion, the best crash gambling sites should ensure a convenient and safe experience for players. You should aim to stick with reputable and trusted brands with a proven track record of servicing gamblers with the best possible offers, while also providing top security measures.</p>
<p>Before stepping into one of the Crash betting sites, you want to check its license, history, implemented encryption technology, and third-party certificates of trust.</p>
Diverse Payment Options
<p>A good site for Crash gambling should accept a wide range of payment methods. This includes all the top cryptocurrencies, such as BTC, LTC, ETH, DOGE, BCH, and others.</p>
<p>Most crypto gamblers might also appreciate the inclusion of fiat currencies so that they can quickly convert their holdings into crypto and return them to fiat.</p>
<p>Apart from the number of available payment options, you need to know the minimum deposit amount, required fee, and withdrawal terms, such as limits, payout time, and so on.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-528781 size-full" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pilot-standing-infront-of-plane.jpg" alt="Bitcoin crash gambling sites bonuses" width="1920" height="645"/></p>
Bonuses on Crypto Crash Gambling Sites
<p>The best crash gambling sites should offer you a decent selection of bonuses. If you can find anything from the welcome bonus, deposit bonuses, free spins, and no-deposit offer to reload offers, VIP bonuses, bookmakers&#8217; offers, and similar deals, you have a win-win situation.</p>
<p>You’ll probably also value the fact your Crash site appreciates your time spent on its platform and delivers regular perks to its loyal customers. But you should also pay attention to the promotion&#8217;s terms and conditions.</p>
<p>This includes checking the wagering requirements, promo codes, and other details that could make a difference.</p>
<p>Playthrough requirements serve to show the number of times someone has to wager the bonus amount plus crypto deposits before the withdrawal. Remember that some bonuses are only accessible if you insert a bonus code in the designated tab.</p>
Crypto Deposits and Withdrawals
<p>Many players feel unprepared to jump into the crypto-only gambling experience. They usually look for hybrid platforms that offer both crypto and fiat currencies.</p>
<p>This makes them feel safer and more comfortable before making a full transition. However, finding an end-to-end (crypto-only) Crash gambling site comes with multiple benefits for users.</p>
<p>This includes an anonymous gambling experience, faster deposits and withdrawals, higher withdrawal limits, and lower fees.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-528781 size-full" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pilot-flying-biplane.jpg" alt="Crash gambling sites that offer good customer satisfaction" width="1920" height="645"/></p>
Sites That Prioritize Customer Satisfaction
<p>While spending your time on crypto Crash gambling sites, you’ll probably have to contact customer support at some point.</p>
<p>And if the site of your choice doesn&#8217;t respond within a reasonable timeframe, you’ll probably feel neglected. You want to deal with customer-centric support that handles all your requests in a timely way.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where our recommended best Crash gambling sites come into play, providing super fast and useful answers via chat, email, or phone.</p>
<h2>Pros of Crash Gambling Sites</h2>
<p>Choosing the best crash gambling sites is a good option for several reasons. Apart from providing a crypto-friendly experience, they are good places for customers looking to win big and receive their winnings in the blink of an eye.</p>
24/7 Accessibility
<p>Cryptocurrency Crash sites are available 24/7, so you just choose your preferred time and join the action. In addition to regular access, you&#8217;ll be able to enjoy table games, slot games, live dealer action, sportsbook choices, football, and plenty of other interesting options.</p>
<p>The brands keep improving their offers, so you will always have something in the gaming library.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-528781 size-full" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pilot-by-his-biplane.jpg" alt="Crash gambling sites payments" width="1920" height="645"/></p>
<b>Instant Payouts on Crash Gambling Sites</b>
<p><strong>Your crypto arrives almost instantly, so you don&#8217;t have to wait hours or days to see your balance updated with your new earnings.</strong></p>
<p>Winnings appear in a matter of seconds, and you can open your favorite games immediately and start collecting points.</p>
Anonymous Gameplay
<p>Getting started with a crypto Crash game also means full anonymity for you. No one will breach your privacy and steal your data.</p>
<p>This is as opposed to traditional brands, which will seek your name, date of birth, and other sensitive information that you don&#8217;t want to share elsewhere.</p>
Provably Fair Games
<p>Provably fair games are an important aspect of the cryptocurrency casino industry, ensuring transparency and fairness in online gambling.</p>
<p>This concept was introduced to address concerns about the integrity of online casino games, particularly in the context of crypto transactions.</p>
<p>The provably fair games offer players the ability to independently verify the fairness of each game round by examining the underlying algorithms, seeds, and random number generation processes.</p>
<p>When it comes to crash gambling games, the provably fair mechanisms typically involve the use of cryptographic hashes and seeds. Before each game round, a server seed and a client seed are combined and hashed to determine the outcome of the crash multiplier.</p>
<p>The server seed is provided by the casino and kept hidden until the game round ends, while the client seed can be chosen by the player or generated by their device.</p>
<p>Once the round is over, the server seed is revealed, allowing players to verify that the outcome was determined fairly. By rehashing the seeds and comparing the result with the crash multiplier displayed during the game, players can ensure that the game was not rigged or manipulated in any way.</p>
<p>This level of transparency and verifiability builds trust between players and crypto casinos. It assures players that the game results are truly random and eliminates concerns about the house having an unfair advantage.</p>
<p>The provably fair games also encourage casino operators to maintain a trustworthy reputation, as any attempts to manipulate the outcomes would be easily detectable.

Enhanced Features and Experiences
<p>In usual cases, the best crash gambling sites follow the trend and offer modern sleek designs, a convenient user-interface, great features, and overall thrilling gameplay experiences.</p>
<p>This comes with impressive content from the top software providers, such as Microgaming and NetEnt, along with tournaments for competitive gameplay.</p>
Mobile Optimized Crash Games
<p>If you choose Crash blockchain casinos, you&#8217;ll be able to access the games from different devices, including Android and iOS.</p>
<p>This is because crypto casinos and their games are perfectly optimized for a smaller screen, so they fit the needs of various readers. The gameplay is also available in the dedicated apps.</p>
Worldwide Crash Gambling Trend
<p>Crash gambling games continues to gain traction in different markets around the world. This has made it easier to find great options and just jump in and join the action.</p>
<p>The game has become the first choice of people in different countries, including the US and the UK, where people look for additional ways to claim rewards and benefit from better RTP.</p>
<p>If you also take into consideration better payouts and an enhanced player experience, there is no doubt that Crash gambling games are now the leading option.

<h2>Mastering Crash Games</h2>
<p>Finding a decent crypto Crash website is just one step before you embark on regular betting action. Before that, you should be aware of Crash gambling rules and how to make the most out of this game.</p>
<p>After its official launch in 2014, Crypto Crash has become one of the most demanded products in the market. The idea behind the launch was to design a game suited for crypto enthusiasts.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this game is its resemblance to crypto market fluctuations. First, you will have the line going up just as crypto prices spike in value. After a while, it falls, resembling the potential collapse of your favorite coins.</p>
<p>If you’re a complete beginner at crypto Crash gambling games, you won&#8217;t have a complicated time getting started. A crash game is simple to play, and your rounds are available in short-time sequences.</p>
How To Get Started with Ease
<p>The first step when you get started with a Crash Bitcoin game is setting the amount of your bet. Then you click Bet (next round), and the game can begin.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">You’ll start the game at a 1.00x multiplier, and it will move up from there.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">You’ll see the multiplier go up along with the line representing it. It is possible to cash out anytime and collect the multiplier shown.</li>

					<description><![CDATA[Over the last 24 hours, SUI has put on a tremendous rally and has risen over 15% in this time period. With this rally, the altcoin has moved once more into bullish territory, which begs the question of whether SUI would be on its way back to $1 soon. SUI Crosses $0.7 After Rising Over 15% SUI returned to its bullish trend on Monday with a sharp recovery that saw its price rise quickly. The resulting surge in price saw the digital asset’s price rise above $0.7 after touching as low as $0.5 on Saturday.

The rise in price comes at a time when most of the market is still nursing loss with Bitcoin barely holding on to the $26,000 level. As such, this suggests some level of deviation on the part of the altcoin from the general market trend, which could point toward more upside to come. Is The Race To $1 Back On? Following its much-anticipated launch back in May 2023, the price of SUI traded well above the $1 price mark even as presale participants were able to sell their coins at a huge markup. However, the digital asset quickly lost footing above this level and dropped back down rapidly.
