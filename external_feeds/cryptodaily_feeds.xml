</p>
Maxpread Technologies Allegedly Used AI to Generate a Fake CEO
<p>Both Maxpread Technologies and Harvest Keeper have been accused of misrepresenting their CEOs. Maxpread allegedly created a computer-generated avatar named &ldquo;Gary&rdquo; to represent their CEO, and Harvest Keeper allegedly used an actor to represent their CEO.</p>
<p>The DFPI suggests Maxpread Technologies promoted its &ldquo;profitability&rdquo; using a promotional YouTube video featuring an avatar built on Synthesia.io, which was programmed to read a screenplay.</p>
<p>Synthesia.io&rsquo;s AI technology utilizes deep learning algorithms to create life-like animations and speech, enabling users to generate high-quality content. A YouTube video was published on April 8 featuring CEO &ldquo;Michael Vanes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The DFPI, however, indicates that such a person does not exist, and Maxpread&rsquo;s previous chief marketing officer and corporate brand manager, Jan Gregory, is the company&rsquo;s actual CEO.</p>
<p>Forbes reports Elizabeth Smith, a representative from DFPI, explained in an email that the agency had traced the avatar to Synthesio.io, where it had been named &ldquo;Gary.&rdquo;</p>
Harvest Keeper Employed an Actor to Perform as CEO
<p>Harvest Keeper took a slightly different approach. The agency alleges that it employed a human actor to perform the role of the company&rsquo;s CEO. The company also claimed to use AI to boost its trading profitability, but instead, it appears to rely on humans.</p>
<p>Neither organization has responded to the accusations.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>BTC/USD Tests 27119 Target:&nbsp; Sally Ho&rsquo;s Technical Analysis &ndash; 23 April 2023</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained near recent multi-session lows early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 27283.59 area, a downside price objective associated with selling pressure that intensified around the 29102.69 area.&nbsp; Traders recently pushed BTC/USD as low as the 27133 area, a move that represented a test of the 27119.69 level that became technically significant when selling pressure strengthened around the 30012.14 area.&nbsp; Downside price objectives related to recent depreciating ranges and levels include the 27119, 26533, 26085, 25604, and 24103 levels.&nbsp; Following recent price activity, retracement levels and areas of potential technical resistance include the 29159, 29383, 29408, 29657, 29701, 29965, 30012, 30413, and 30472 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following recent price activity, retracement levels and areas of potential technical support include the 27370, 26664, 25309, 25094, 23954, 23255, and 21415 levels.&nbsp; Upside price objectives include the 31477.37, 32501.23, 32989.19, 34583.96, 34658.69, 35222.66, 37765.28, and 38403.97 levels.&nbsp; &nbsp;Another important price objective is the 31846.88 area, a level that represents the 50% retracement of the depreciating range from 48233.76 to 15460.&nbsp; &nbsp;Traders are&nbsp;observing&nbsp;that the&nbsp;50-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;is&nbsp;bullishly indicating above the 100-bar MA (4-hourly)&nbsp;and&nbsp;above the&nbsp;200-bar MA (4-hourly).&nbsp; Also, the 50-bar MA (hourly) is bearishly indicating below the 100-bar MA (hourly) and below the 200-bar MA (hourly).</p>
<p>Price activity is nearest the&nbsp;200-bar MA&nbsp;(4-hourly) at 28492.91 and the&nbsp;50-bar MA&nbsp;(Hourly) at 27895.21.</p>
<p>Technical Support&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;27119.16/ 26533.04/ 25604.51 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected below.</p>
<p>Technical Resistance&nbsp;is expected around&nbsp;31986.16/ 32989.19/ 34658.69 with&nbsp;Stops&nbsp;expected above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Those who bought in early on NEAR Protocol (NEAR) and Litecoin (LTC) are now generating profits, but do not feel discouraged if you did not - meet Sparklo! Some experts even believe this presale star could yield the same or more earnings than the coins above. Let&rsquo;s find out why! </p>
<p class="s7">NEAR Protocol (NEAR) Integrates With Mailchain</p>
<p>NEAR Protocol (NEAR) recently announced its partnership with Mailchain, the Web3 communication layer. The Multichain SDK will enable NEAR Protocol (NEAR) developers to provide confidential connectivity to decentralized applications (dApps) built on its network. </p>
<p>However, NEAR Protocol (NEAR) has not been performing well on the value charts recently, as it currently trades at $2.18, falling 0.86% in the past 24 hours. Not only that, the trading volume for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) also decreased by 13% in that same time, sinking to $134,378,615. </p>
<p>And with the moving averages for NEAR Protocol (NEAR) all in the red, many investors are sidestepping it for other projects with more room for growth. </p>
<p class="s7">Litecoin (LTC) Now Supported By Nabox</p>
<p>In recent news, the Nabox wallet has added support for Litecoin (LTC). With this development, the adoption of Litecoin (LTC) continues growing steadily - but its value leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has a value of $91.14, which is a drop of 4.68% overnight. Moreover, the technical analysis for Litecoin (LTC) shows that bears still have it in their palm, with its moving averages and technical indicators showing sell signals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With all of these charts in mind, experts predict that Litecoin (LTC) may continue this downtrend as it falls to its support level of $90 soon. </p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Become A Future Market Leader </p>
<p>Are you looking to invest in rare and precious metals such as platinum, silver, and gold? Sparklo, an upcoming decentralized alternative-investment platform, may be the perfect one for you as it brings advantages its rivals lack. </p>
<p>On this Ethereum-based platform, users may purchase or trade fractionalized NFTs backed by real-world exquisite silver, gold, or platinum bars! Not only that, if you buy a full NFT, you may also receive the asset underpinning it delivered to an address of your choice! </p>
<p>Since Sparklo is currently in Level One of its public presale, the token value is very affordable - only $0.015. We believe this is an excellent opportunity to purchase a potential blue-chip token for a meager price since some analysts have even hinted it could rise to $0.50 by October 2023!</p>
<p>Sparklo has also focused on security, with an audit by InterFi Network already complete and a KYC audit in its final stages. Moreover, liquidity will be locked for 100 years while team tokens for 1,000 days - eliminating any rug-pulls! </p>
<p>Sign up for the presale now to become an early investor in this project expected to boom by 3,200% soon!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) are two crypto projects that have made it big in the crypto industry due to their unique design. While Polkadot (DOT) focuses on efficient cross-chain transfer, Decentraland (MANA) aims to benefit creators by monetizing content and applications.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is another unique upcoming project focusing on providing freelancers and investors with various benefits. While Uwerx has a positive projection for 2023 and beyond, Polkadot(DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) are not that fortunate. Here is a detailed take on the three popular crypto projects.</p>
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) Posts Small Gains</p>
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) is an open-source protocol that can work on multiple blockchains and connect them for cross-chain transfer. It is popular for its Web3 connection and enables users to create new apps, services, and institutions.</p>
<p class="s6">Priced at $5.92, Polkadot (DOT) has a 24-hour trading volume of $178,662,274. From its initial price of $0.30, Polkadot (DOT) increased to its all-time high of $47 in May 2021 but later started declining and is yet to recover. The future outlook for Polkadot is positive but experts predict that the gains will not be substantial.</p>
<p class="s6">Decentraland (MANA) Not Showing Recovery Signs</p>
<p class="s6">Decentraland (MANA) is a virtual reality platform that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create, enjoy, and monetize applications and content. Decentraland (MANA) grew in popularity due to the various experiences that users have created on the virtual land they purchase via the platform.</p>
<p class="s6">Priced at $0.562 now, Decentraland (MANA) has a 24-hour trading volume of $77,611,210. When it was launched in 2017, Decentraland (MANA) was valued at around $0.024. It has since increased in value and reached its all-time high of $5.90 in November 2022 after which it started declining and is now at $0.5. The price prediction for Decentraland (MANA) is not positive with the digital currency declining in value drastically.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx (WERX) Assures Efficiency and Affordability</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is a freelance-based crypto project in its presale stage. The upcoming platform assures important advantages such as a 1% flat fee, improved transparency in the storage of records, and intellectual property rights protection.</p>
<p class="s6">Valued at $0.0065, Uwerx is in Stage 1. With its liquidity fixed to be locked at the end of the presale and subsequently for 25 years, Uwerx is drawing investor attention. As per crypto experts, Uwerx has a high probability of becoming a potent force in the freelancing segment due to its basic structure that allows improved efficiency and affordable fees.</p>
<p class="s6">Why Investors Rely on Uwerx (WERX)</p>
<p class="s6">While Polkadot (DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) show vague signs of recovery, the future outlook for Uwerx looks excellent. As per industry experts, the project can turn into a popular blue-chip crypto that can be held at a very good price.</p>
<p class="s6">Seasoned crypto investors are aware that investing in early projects provides an opportunity to hold crypto at an affordable price and make substantial gains. We believe that Uwerx has the structural makeup required to provide a lucrative investment chance.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx (WERX) Will Lead the Crypto Market</p>
<p class="s6">Big investors have become wary of the high volatility of established cryptos like Decentraland (MANA) and Polkadot (DOT). Amidst the present turmoil that the industry faces, investing in a new crypto like Uwerx presents a lucrative opportunity that users should not miss out on.</p>
<p class="s6">The fact that it has undergone a full audit by InterFi Network and SolidProof is another reason for investors relying on it. Its inherent benefits position it as a main investment option in the resilient gig economy. The team's declaration will be upheld when they abandon the ownership of smart contracts when the project is ready to be listed on centralized exchanges.</p>
<p class="s6">With the Uwerx presale in progress, it poses a wonderful investment opportunity you should grab onto, before the price increase later on today.. Visit the Uwerx presale now to earn a 25% purchase bonus and stand a chance to win $5,000 in a competition!</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) are two crypto projects that have made it big in the crypto industry due to their unique design. While Polkadot (DOT) focuses on efficient cross-chain transfer, Decentraland (MANA) aims to benefit creators by monetizing content and applications.</p>
<p class="s6">Uwerx is another unique upcoming project focusing on providing freelancers and investors with various benefits. While Uwerx has a positive projection for 2023 and beyond, Polkadot(DOT) and Decentraland (MANA) are not that fortunate. Here is a detailed take on the three popular crypto projects.</p>
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) Posts Small Gains</p>
<p class="s6">Polkadot (DOT) is an open-source protocol that can work on multiple blockchains and connect them for cross-chain transfer. It is popular for its Web3 connection and enables users to create new apps, services, and institutions.</p>
<p class="s6">Priced at $5.92, Polkadot (DOT) has a 24-hour trading volume of $178,662,274. From its initial price of $0.30, Polkadot (DOT) increased to its all-time high of $47 in May 2021 but later started declining and is yet to recover. The future outlook for Polkadot is positive but experts predict that the gains will not be substantial.</p>
<p class="s6">Decentraland (MANA) Not Showing Recovery Signs</p>
<p class="s6">Decentraland (MANA) is a virtual reality platform that is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can create, enjoy, and monetize applications and content.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s5">The blockchain space is ever-evolving, and new projects are popping up consistently, aiming to provide a solution to some specific issue that has been a part of the traditional investment space.</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo is one such project that will be the go-to platform where investors can easily begin making investments in fractionalized NFTS that represent precious metals.</p>
<p class="s5">With the decrease in the value of competing projects such as Polygon (MATIC) and Solana (SOL), investors and traders aiming to get the most out of the space will typically diversify at these times.</p>
<p class="s7">Polygon (MATIC) To Participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace</p>
<p class="s5">The official Polygon (MATIC) Twitter page made an announcement that on April 21, 2023, Jordi Baylina and Bobbin Threadbare will participate in Starkware&rsquo;s L2 Peace. </p>
<p class="s5">Additionally, Polygon (MATIC) will also hold a Polygon (MATIC) zkEVM Mainnet Beta AMA where they will provide updates on security, performance metrics, and the roadmap.</p>
<p class="s5">On April 20, 2023, the Polygon (MATIC) cryptocurrency traded at $1.09. In the last 24 hours, Polygon (MATIC) decreased by 1.3%, and its overall decrease in the last two weeks has been at 4.3%.</p>
<p class="s7">Helium Network Migrates To Solana (SOL), but it's Coin Still Loses Value</p>
<p class="s5">Solana (SOL) made a huge announcement on April 19, 2023, noting that Helium Network completed its upgrade and finished its migration to the blockchain.</p>
<p class="s5">The Helium Network will now run on top of Solana (SOL), and the global IoT and Cellular data will be powered by the network.</p>
<p class="s5">When we go over the value of Solana (SOL), on April 20, 2023, the cryptocurrency traded at $22.75. In the last 24 hours, Solana (SOL) dipped by 1.6%, and in the last seven days, it has been down by a total of 4.7%. Based on this, it is clear why investors are beginning to diversify away from Solana (SOL) into presale-stage projects.</p>
<p class="s7">Sparklo (SPRK) To Bring Fractional NFT Ownerships in Gold, Silver, and Platinum</p>
<p class="s5">Sparklo will be the go-to investment platform that will enable anyone on a global scale an opportunity to begin making investments in silver, gold, and platinum through fractional ownership of non-fungible tokens (NTs). This means that on top of Sparklo, every time an investment is made, an NFT is minted. </p>
<p class="s5">Investors can buy a specific percentage of an NFT, a fraction, or they can buy the entire NFT. Upon gaining ownership of an NFT fully that is a representation of a gold bar, for example, they can have it delivered at a location of their choosing. As for its price, the Level One presale has placed the SPRK token at a value of $0.015. Analysts predict that its value will jump 40x in the upcoming months.</p>
<p class="s5">The team is also processing a KYC application, but the network has already been audited by InterFi network and will have its liquidity locked for 100 years.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>US-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has revealed that it is planning to open an offshore derivatives platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision was announced as regulatory pressures in the United States continue to grow, with a mass withdrawal of crypto organizations currently taking place.&nbsp;</p>
A New Crypto Derivatives Platform&nbsp;
<p>The move comes shortly after Gemini announced that it would be relocating its engineering hub and developers to India. Gemini revealed its plans to launch an offshore derivatives platform under a new division called the Gemini Foundation. According to Gemini, the new platform would allow users based outside the US to trade in the spot and derivatives markets. According to the official announcement, the platform&rsquo;s first product would be a BTC perpetual contract denominated in GUSD, which is Gemini&rsquo;s stablecoin with its value pegged to the United States dollar. Following this, an Ethereum perpetual contract (ETH/GUSD) is also expected to launch. According to the statement,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gemini Foundation will allow eligible customers to leverage their crypto assets to achieve long or short crypto exposure in order to manage risk, generate returns, and gain directional exposure. Eligible customers will be able to trade both spot and derivatives products and execute all of their trading strategies within a secure and trusted platform.&rdquo;</p>

Available In A Host Of Jurisdictions&nbsp;
<p>According to Gemini, the Gemini Foundation will allow eligible users to leverage their crypto assets and gain exposure to the underlying asset&rsquo;s value without actually owning the asset. The derivatives trading platform will be available to users in a number of countries such as Hong Kong, India, Israel, Singapore, Thailand, Bermuda, Bahamas, British Virgin Islands, Brazil, Bhutan, Cayman Islands, Egypt, Chile, Guernsey, El Salvador, Jersey, Nigeria, New Zealand, Panama, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Saint Vincent &amp; Grenadine, Saint Lucia, South Korea, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, Thailand, Uruguay, and Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has yet to be any clarity on an exact launch date. However, the announcement did feature a link for interested users to sign up and gain priority access. Users that sign up will be notified once the platform is ready.&nbsp;</p>
Search For A Favorable Regulatory Environment Continues&nbsp;
<p>Gemini&rsquo;s decision comes as regulatory scrutiny against crypto firms in the United States continues to get more intense. Since the beginning of the year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has hit several crypto firms operating in the US with a host of charges. Many view these actions as necessary following the catastrophic collapse of FTX and the implosion of TerraUSD. As a result, the first few months of 2023 have been incredibly difficult for the crypto space and crypto entities operating in the United States. Gemini has already announced that it is relocating its engineering hub and all of its developers to India. However, the country is yet to fully embrace the idea of cryptocurrencies, although there is an easing of its position when it comes to digital assets. This could be a result of the evolving crypto environment in South Asia. The country&rsquo;s finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, has proposed that G20 nations create a standard framework for crypto and digital assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, despite being located outside the United States, the Gemini Foundation could still be in the crosshairs of regulatory authorities based in the United States. Binance is not based in the United States, yet it was sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for several alleged violations. FTX also was based in the Bahamas, but that did not prevent CEO Sam Bankman-Fried from facing criminal charges in the United States.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>A recent incident involved a vulnerability found in the WebAssembly feature (WASM) of Trust Wallet.&nbsp;</p>
App vulnerability discovered
<p>A security researcher discovered the vulnerability and immediately alerted Trust Wallet. Upon investigation, Trust Wallet's team discovered that the vulnerability may allow attackers to execute malicious code directly on the devices of users. The team took immediate action to mitigate the risks and released a security update for the app.</p>
<p>Whilst the vulnerability, which was first reported in November 2022, has been patched, and all addresses that were created after this date are safe, Trust Wallet reports that two exploits managed to steal the value of $170,000 USD.</p>
<p>The Trust Wallet team has assured all users that anyone affected will be reimbursed from any losses. A process has been created to this effect, and affected users have been asked to move the balances on any vulnerable address as soon as possible.</p>
Trust Wallet urges user precautions
<p>As per a recent announcement by the Trust Wallet team, users of the wallet are advised to update to the latest app version. They should also be wary of any suspicious or unexpected emails, messages or links that are related to their Trust Wallet account.</p>
<p>The Trust Wallet team also urged its users to adhere to basic security measures, including updating their apps and devices, creating strong passwords and enabling 2-factor authentication (2FA).</p>
<p>Users of Trust Wallet should also avoid disclosing sensitive information such as recovery phrases or private keys to anyone. Downloading the Trust Wallet App from trusted sources is important, including the official Trust Wallet Website or app store.</p>
<p>The Trust Wallet team assures users that there have been no losses or thefts as a result. They are still investigating the vulnerability, and working on implementing additional security measures in order to prevent future incidents.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Do Kwon, the recently arrested CEO of Terraform Labs, denies that he defrauded investors, and says that SEC allegations are unfounded.</p>
<p>Do Kwon is denying SEC allegations that he defrauded his investors by selling Terra, his blockchain platform. Kwon was recently arrested by US authorities in Montenegro, as he and a colleague were attempting to board a plane to Dubai with false travel documents, and is currently being held without bail.</p>
SEC improperly using its power
<p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Do Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers have asked for the judge to throw out the SEC&rsquo;s lawsuit on the grounds that it had exceeded its authority by failing to prove that US investors had been defrauded.</p>
<p>Taken from what Do Kwon&rsquo;s lawyers have so far said, it would appear that the defence will mainly be based on what the lawyers are saying is a failure by the SEC and the executive branch to agree on exactly what constitutes a security as regards cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The filing by the lawyers asserts:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The SEC&rsquo;s improper assertion of power here by trying to shoehorn all cryptocurrencies into its definition of a &lsquo;security&rsquo; fails,&rdquo;</p>

Fraudulent securities offering
<p>Terra is a platform for creating stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets, like the US dollar. The SEC claims that Kwon, Terraform Labs, and Terraform, raised $25 million through a fraudulent security offering. It is alleged that investors were told that they would get a return from Terra's stablecoin UST.</p>
<p>Kwon is a Korean national and has been detained in an American detention facility since his arrest. His legal team claims that Kwon is not a flight threat and should be freed on bail. US authorities, however, argue that Kwon is a flight threat and could possibly flee. Both the US and South Korea are seeking extradition.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">The MadLads NFT public mint, initially set for launch on 4/20, was been postponed for over a day, due to a groundswell of interest in the project. It later launched after setting up a honeypot trap for bots.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The surge in demand for the MadLads NFT collection was reportedly caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack. However, the exact nature of the attack is yet to be confirmed, whether it was intentional or was caused by an external threat actor trying to hijack or sabotage the project.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A DDoS attack occurs when multiple systems flood a targeted server, system, or network with a massive volume of traffic, overwhelming its resources and causing it to become slow or unresponsive. In the MadLads situation, the billions of requests routed through the crypto wallet Backpack exceeded the platform's capacity, effectively leading to a DDoS attack.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The excessive traffic not only affected the Backpack wallet but also impacted other aspects of the Solana ecosystem, such as knocking out two RPC nodes (access points to the Solana blockchain) and the user interface on Cloudflare, a service that helps prevent DDoS attacks.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As a result, MadLads NFT co-creators Armani Ferrante and Tristan Yver announced the delay, effectively postponing the public mint by 24 hours or so, in order to address the issue and ensure the infrastructure could handle the influx of users seeking to mint the MadLads NFTs.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The overwhelming demand for the MadLads NFTs also impacted other aspects of the Solana ecosystem. The heavy traffic managed to knock out two RPC nodes which serve as access points to the Solana blockchain, as well as the interface for Cloudflare, a routing platform that helps prevent DDoS attacks. The demand has likely driven a surge in signups for Blue Coral's Backpack wallet app, which is the only wallet supporting the MadLads collection.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The MadLads collection, a project closely associated with the Solana duo, has sparked immense interest, making it one of the hottest NFT mints in Solana's recent history. According to Ferrante, billions of requests routed through the crypto wallet Backpack, which is also a product of Ferrante and Yver's startup, Blue Coral Inc., far exceeded the platform's capabilities, leading to the DDoS attack.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MadLads represents a new kind of NFT called xNFTs, which are more than just JPEG images on a blockchain. xNFTs also represent tokenized code that signifies ownership rights over its execution. The MadLads collection is intended to be the first xNFT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">During a Twitter Spaces conversation with approximately 9,500 listeners, Ferrante explained the magnitude of the situation:</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"[the demand was] orders of magnitude more insane than anything we've dealt with up until this point."</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">He recounted a series of internet outages that initially forced a one-hour delay and ultimately led to the 24-hour postponement. The excitement within the Solana community led to some NFT traders seeking any possible advantage to gain access to the MadLads collection.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Some individuals even followed a Substack post's erroneous advice, suggesting that purchasing custom RPC nodes from Solana developer project Helius would increase their chances of minting a MadLads NFT. This misinformation prompted Helius CEO Mert Mumtaz to claridfy in the Helius Discord server that the custom RPC nodes would not significantly improve one's chances of minting a MadLads NFT.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Since the delay, the MadLads NFT collection successfully went through with its mint.</p>

While the mint went through, the MadLad team's decision to place a honeypot trap to lure in bots who wanted to automate mints was controversial in its methods. While the team said that all funds have been returned, some users report that their funds in $SOL still haven't been given back.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">CoreWeave, a specialized cloud provider, recently announced the successful completion of a $221 million Series B funding round. This comes after the company previously raised $50 million from lead investor Magnetar Capital in November 2021.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The latest round saw contributions from major silicon design firm NVIDIA, Nat Friedman, and Daniel Gross, with Magnetar Capital taking lead. The funds raised are set for allocation for the purpose of expanding CoreWeave's cloud infrastructure for massive computational workloads such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, visual effects, rendering, batch processing, and pixel streaming. According to CEO and co-founder Michael Intrato, NVIDIA's support will prove instrumental in helping the company continue to scale its operations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Established in 2017, CoreWeave utilizes clourd technology to scale graphics processing unit (GPU) computational resources, offering solutions it claims are "35 times faster and 80% less expensive" than competitor offerings. Initially, the firm began as an Ethereum miner, using GPUs to verify transactions on the previously proof-of-work blockchain.</p>
Why the transition?
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The transition of companies like CoreWeave from focusing on crypto and blockchain to artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies can be attributed to various factors, including market trends, technological developments, and the growth potential in AI-driven industries.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">This shift is also indicative of the increasing competition in the crypto and blockchain landscape. As more businesses and startups emerge in this space, companies that initially built their foundation in crypto and blockchain technology may find it chall;enging to maintain their edge. By diversifying into AI and other emerging technologies, they can explore new opportunities and tap into different market segments, thereby mitigating the risks associated with relying solely on the crypto market.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Technological developments also play a significant role in this shift. As the capabilities of AI and machine learning (ML) continue to advance, their applications in various industries are growing exponentially. Companies like CoreWeave can leverage their existing expertise in computational resources and infrastructure, which are essential for both blockchain and AI, to cater to the growing demand for high-performance computing in AI-driven industries.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">"AI has reached an inflection point, and we&rsquo;re seeing accelerated interest in AI computing infrastructure from startups to major enterprises,&rdquo; shares Manuvir Das, Vice President of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA. </p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">NVIDIA itself has made some harsh statements, comparing crypto to AI.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Another reason for this shift is the changing landscape of blockchain technology itself. For instance, Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchain platforms, has transitioned from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model. This change has rendered Ethereum mining unattractively less profitable, and alongside it, the use mining GPUs became unfit, affecting companies like CoreWeave which initially focused on crypto mining.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">CoreWeave's latest funding will facilitate the expansion of its specialized cloud infrastructure for compute-intensive workloads, including AI and machine learning, visual effects, rendering, batch processing, and pixel streaming. This strategy enables CoreWeave to deliver purpose-built solutions capable of outperforming larger, more generalized cloud providers. The new capital will also support the opening of two new U.S.-based data centers this year, bringing CoreWeave's total North America-based data centers to five.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">&ldquo;CoreWeave&rsquo;s innovative, agile and customizable product offering is well-situated to service this demand and the company is consequently experiencing explosive growth to support it. We are proud to collaborate with NVIDIA in supporting CoreWeave&rsquo;s next phase of growth as it continues to bolster its already strong positioning in the marketplace," shares Ernie Rogers, COO at Magnetar.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">With the rise in demand for generative AI technology, CoreWeave is poised to capitalize on this burgeoning market. Its partnership with industry leaders such as NVIDIA and Magnetar Capital is key to bolstering its efforts at scaling and expansion, positioning the company to become a significant player in the rapidly evolving world of AI and cloud-native technologies.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/04/societe-generale-introduces-euro-pegged-stablecoin-on-ethereum-update</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Forge (SG Forge), the digital asset subsidiary of the prominent French banking firm Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, has unveiled a new stablecoin, CoinVertible ($EURCV), pegged on the Euro. The stablecoin was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, and will be exclusively available for qualified institutional clients.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale has not disclosed the requirements for qualifying to access the $EURCV stablecoin, only stating that it has pre-qualified institutional clients who have passed for its KYC verification process. The launch can be seen as a response to the growing demand for an on-chain asset that can be used for cross-border settlements. In effect, this bridges a gap between traditional capital markets and the digital asset management, particularly those linked in decentralized finance and the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The stablecoin also aims to offer new solutions for corporate treasury management, cash flow and on-chain liquidity management, as well as cash pookling initiatives for funding and refinancing. However, the new stablecoin was met with a certain degree of criticism from blockchain developers, highlighting some concerning traits inside the contract code.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A software engineer known as Cygaar has recently discovered that the stablecoin could potentially allow the bank to seize and burn all its users' funds through certain functions in its smart contract. Cygaar criticized the bank's choice of system, stating that Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale would have been better off using JPMorgan's Onyx or an internal database for a centralized settlement layer.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Origin Protocol developer Scott Mitchell expressed skepticism about the stablecoin's feasibility on Ethereum from an economic perspective. He argued that even with batch validation and low gas costs, the system would still be too expensive at scale.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Another developer, 0xfoobar, pointed out that the code requires every ERC20 transfer to be approved by the centralized registrar in a separate Ethereum transaction before it can be processed.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Pseudonymous smart contract engineer alephv.eth also drew attention to this issue, noting that the bank coded the system in such a way that it necessitates the whitelisting of all users and the processing of all user transfers and ERC20 approvals before executing the "transferFrom" function. This could significantly slow down the transaction speed for the stablecoin and complicate the process.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As concerns mount over the EUR CoinVertible smart contract's design and functionality, it remains to be seen how Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale-Forge will address these issues and whether the stablecoin will gain traction among institutional clients given the issues highlighted by blockchain developers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The EURCV stablecoin will be traded under the ticker symbol EURCV, accessible only to investors who have been onboarded by Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. In the coming weeks, SG-Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger will assess the interest of prospective clients and address their questiopns as part of the gradual adoption process.</p>

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Forge (SG Forge), the digital asset subsidiary of the prominent French banking firm Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, has unveiled a new stablecoin, CoinVertible ($EURCV), pegged on the Euro. The stablecoin was launched on the Ethereum blockchain, and will be exclusively available for qualified institutional clients.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale has not disclosed the requirements for qualifying to access the $EURCV stablecoin, only stating that it has pre-qualified institutional clients who have passed for its KYC verification process. The launch can be seen as a response to the growing demand for an on-chain asset that can be used for cross-border settlements. In effect, this bridges a gap between traditional capital markets and the digital asset management, particularly those linked in decentralized finance and the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The stablecoin also aims to offer new solutions for corporate treasury management, cash flow and on-chain liquidity management, as well as cash pookling initiatives for funding and refinancing. However, the new stablecoin was met with a certain degree of criticism from blockchain developers, highlighting some concerning traits inside the contract code.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">A software engineer known as Cygaar has recently discovered that the stablecoin could potentially allow the bank to seize and burn all its users' funds through certain functions in its smart contract. Cygaar criticized the bank's choice of system, stating that Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale would have been better off using JPMorgan's Onyx or an internal database for a centralized settlement layer.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Origin Protocol developer Scott Mitchell expressed skepticism about the stablecoin's feasibility on Ethereum from an economic perspective. He argued that even with batch validation and low gas costs, the system would still be too expensive at scale.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Another developer, 0xfoobar, pointed out that the code requires every ERC20 transfer to be approved by the centralized registrar in a separate Ethereum transaction before it can be processed.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Pseudonymous smart contract engineer alephv.eth also drew attention to this issue, noting that the bank coded the system in such a way that it necessitates the whitelisting of all users and the processing of all user transfers and ERC20 approvals before executing the "transferFrom" function. This could significantly slow down the transaction speed for the stablecoin and complicate the process.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As concerns mount over the EUR CoinVertible smart contract's design and functionality, it remains to be seen how Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale-Forge will address these issues and whether the stablecoin will gain traction among institutional clients given the issues highlighted by blockchain developers.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The EURCV stablecoin will be traded under the ticker symbol EURCV, accessible only to investors who have been onboarded by Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale through its Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures. In the coming weeks, SG-Forge CEO Jean-Marc Stenger will assess the interest of prospective clients and address their questiopns as part of the gradual adoption process.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The newly introduced stablecoin is designed to adhere to major market standards, including the open-source interoperability and securitization framework known as Compliant Architecture for Security Token (CAST).

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">As the cryptocurrency market continues to experience fluctuations, investors are increasingly seeking more stable and promising alternatives. Amid the downtrends observed in established coins such as Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB), Sparklo is a shining light for those seeking refuge from market volatility. </p>
<p class="s7">This innovative platform offers a unique approach to investment opportunities, capturing the attention of investors looking for the next big thing in the crypto space. </p>
<p class="s9">Solana (SOL) in Crisis: Investors Lose Trust in the &ldquo;Ethereum Killer&rdquo;</p>
<p class="s7">Solana (SOL), once heralded as the &ldquo;Ethereum Killer,&rdquo; is now facing a severe crisis as investors and users lose trust in the platform. Despite high anticipation, Solana (SOL) has suffered a steep decline in value, dropping from an all-time high of $250 in late November 2021 to under $10. Solana (SOL) dramatic downfall has been attributed to a combination of factors, including technical problems and security flaws that have severely impacted investor confidence in the project.</p>
<p class="s7">One of the primary causes of Solana (SOL) decline has been its security issues, which have manifested in a series of hacks and vulnerabilities over recent months. Solana (SOL) breaches have raised serious concerns about the reliability and safety of the blockchain platform, further eroding investor confidence.</p>
<p class="s9">Binance Coin (BNB) Struggles Amidst Controversies and Investor Skepticism </p>
<p class="s7">Binance Coin (BNB), once considered a dominant player in the world of digital asset marketplaces, has experienced a tumultuous few months. Following the collapse of rival exchange FTX, Binance Coin (BNB) seemed to be in an advantageous position, but the subsequent fallout brought unwelcome attention to the platform&rsquo;s finances, leading to a decline of over 50% in the value of Binance Coin (BNB) this year.</p>
<p class="s7">Despite Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao&rsquo;s attempts to alleviate concerns among users and investors by attributing the value decline to external factors and scare tactics, larger withdrawals and increasing apprehensions about the Binance Coin (BNB) financial stability have surfaced in recent weeks, alongside reports of money laundering charges. It is time to look beyind Binance Coin (BNB) and Solana (SOL).</p>
<p class="s9">Sparklo (SPRK) Presale offers good value for money</p>
<p class="s7">Investing in cryptocurrency can be an excellent way to achieve financial growth, but finding the right opportunity can be challenging. With the sheer number of projects out there, it can be hard to differentiate between those with genuine potential and those that are just riding the hype train. However, Sparklo seems to be one of the former, a project with a unique proposition that is poised to offer investors significant value for their money.</p>
<p class="s7">With a presale priced at just $0.015 that offers attractive tokenomics, including a total maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens, 60% of which is available in the presale, Sparklo (SPRK) is an investment opportunity that should not be overlooked. In addition, the team behind Sparklo (SPRK) has demonstrated its commitment to building a successful platform through its rigorous development process and partnerships with established players in the crypto space.</p>
<p class="s7">Investors can also rest assured that the Sparklo (SPRK) project has undergone an independent audit to ensure that it is both secure and reliable. This is a crucial factor in the world of cryptocurrency, where security breaches and hacks can have devastating consequences for investors.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s7">One of the major flaws of decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the security of digital assets held in their vaults. The DeFi sector has been the constant target of cybercriminals, who are often successful, stealing millions in crypto.</p>
<p class="s7">Updates from Wormhole, one of the largest bridges between Solana and other blockchains, show that the loss from the hack makes it the second-largest DeFi hack on record. As a result, Solana (SOL) has continued to tank. </p>
<p class="s7">On the brighter side of DeFi, analysts have predicted possible use cases of Sparklo, combined with the momentum it is building could make the project a top 100 crypto within the first year of its launch.</p>
<p class="s9">Solana (SOL) Tanks 8% as Wormhole Hack Hit $320 Million</p>
<p class="s7">The price of Solana (SOL) has tanked 8% in the last 24 hours as reports show that the losses of the Wormhole hack surpassed $320 million &ndash; now making it the second-largest DeFi hack on record.</p>
<p class="s7">The attack on Wormhole started with the hacker&rsquo;s Solana account. After the attack, the hacker then swapped the SOL in his account for USDCet (Wormhole USDC), before bringing it across to Ethereum to move the funds.</p>
<p class="s7">The losses of Solana (SOL) are compounded by a market-wide sell-off, which has seen 3% of the global crypto market cap lost in just 24 hours. With today&rsquo;s loss, Solana (SOL) now trades at $23, despite trading at over $110 year-over-year.</p>
<p class="s7">If Solana (SOL) fails to hold the $23 level, the price of the asset could fall as low as $20. However, if it manages to find enough bullish momentum in the coming days, then Solana (SOL) could retest the $25 level.</p>
<p class="s9">Analysts Predict Top 100 Spot for Sparklo</p>
<p class="s7">Despite the broader crypto markets suffering from bearish sentiments at the moment, analysts predict that Sparklo &ndash; which has been gaining grounds as an alternative investment platform &ndash; could outperform the market and claim a top 100 spot within a year of its launch. </p>
<p class="s7">Analysts are bullish about the prospects of Sparklo because of its unique, problem-solving platform which will allow users to be able to purchase rare and precious metals, such as silver, gold, and platinum in form of fractional NFTs, meaning you can own gold without needing to buy an entire bar. </p>
<p class="s7">Users won&rsquo;t need to be worried about a possible Wormhole incident as the smart contracts and reserves of Sparklo have been audited by the InterFi Network. According to the Sparklowhitepaper, all the NFTs minted on the platform will be backed by physical assets, further raising trust in the project</p>
<p class="s7">In addition, the current liquidity and reserves of Sparklo will be locked in for 100 years. Sparklois currently in presale for $0.015. These are the reasons why analysts predict that when Sparklolaunches, it could outperform the entire crypto market.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC/USD) remained under pressure early in the Asian session as the pair continued to orbit the 28340.37 area, representing the 23.6% retracement of the broad appreciating range from 19568.52 to 31050.&nbsp;&nbsp; The pair was unable to sustain a recent brief rebound to the 28371.88 area and extended the sell-off to the 27815 area.&nbsp; Stops were recently elected below the 28479.91 area, a downside price objective linked to selling pressure that intensified around the 30500 area.&nbsp; Downside price objectives related to recent depreciating ranges and levels include the 27758, 27283, 27119, 26533, 26085, 25604, and 24103 levels.&nbsp; Following recent price activity, retracement levels and areas of potential technical resistance include the 29159, 29383, 29408, 29657, 29701, 29965, 30012, 30413, and 30472 levels.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market remains volatile. But analysts have seen signs that indicate a massive pump for Uwerx, PancakeSwap (CAKE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Increased DeFi activity and a more risk-on macroeconomic environment are the driving forces behind this predicted surge. Investors who want to capitalize on this incoming rally, need to act fast. </p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX)Analysts investigating Uwerx noted two key points: the 25-year liquidity lock following launch and the audits completed by InterFi Network and Solidproof. Two fundamental indicators of a project with a long-term vision. Uwerx leads a paradigm shift for the gig economy and will create an industry-first decentralized freelancing platform. Uwerx will employ blockchain technology to deliver a platform better suited to freelancers, one that is more secure and transparent and does not charge exorbitant platform fees. Upwork made more than $373 million in service fees in 2020, and this heavy bureaucratic attitude with escrow services has harmed the growth of freelancing, making it more difficult for newer players to enter the space. Uwerx will provide an alternative and, as a result, has the potential to become a blue-chip project used by millions worldwide. Some have already stated their expectations for the current presale price of $0.0065 to increase to $7 by the end of 2023. </p>
<p>PancakeSwap (CAKE)</p>
<p>PancakeSwap (CAKE) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that allows users to trade through the use of liquidity pools. PancakeSwap (CAKE) has displayed steady growth since its launch in 2020. PancakeSwap (CAKE) grew partly because of its speed, and PancakeSwap (CAKE) is one of the fastest DEXs due to its deep liquidity and the BSC network.</p>
<p>Increased DeFi activity on the BSC always leads to price appreciation for PancakeSwap (CAKE). The PancakeSwap (CAKE) token is an integral part of the PancakeSwap (CAKE) platform, and holders who lock their tokens receive yield boosts on the core farms. &nbsp;Shiba Inu (SHIB)</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has announced the launch of Shibarium, a layer two scaling solution built on Ethereum. Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders have understandably been excited by the news. Shiba Inu (SHIB) will pump on the release, and more importantly, it will add another use case for Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens.</p>
<p>The release of Shiba Inu (SHIB) layer two will further fuel the enormous Shiba Inu (SHIB) token burn. Analysts expect a solid performance in 2023 for Shiba Inu (SHIB) with this continued commitment to development from the team. Breakout Year For Uwerx (WERX)Uwerx will explode in 2023. It provides real-world utility, and coupled with growing DeFi activity and a more risk-on environment; investors should not be surprised when they see the WERX token start rocketing through the rankings. Exclusive to the presale period is a 25% bonus, this bonus will not be available after, so we would definitely say to act quickly getting in.Presale: invest.uwerx.network</p>

They invested during a project's early stages, capitalizing on its growth opportunity and solid fundamentals while maximizing its profits. This strategy has always been very lucrative, and we would like to introduce a perfect chance for you to utilize it - Uwerx! It is a project currently in phase 1 of its presale with an opportunity to surpass both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Gala (GALA) in 2023 as it becomes a top-tier crypto platform with millions of supporters. </p>
<p class="s7">Uwerx (WERX) To Become The Most Profit-Yielding Coin</p>
<p>The freelance industry will soon have a new dominating platform with features that other traditional freelance platforms do not have, joining its ranks. This platform will be Uwerx - the first-ever blockchain-based freelance platform!</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to solve some of the freelance industry's problems- through blockchain technology! Both freelancers and companies will benefit from lower fees (1% vs. 20%) since Uwerx will cut out the intermediary escrow service and much more! Decentralized storage will bring greater trust and security and more significant record-keeping since every piece of information will be kept on the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about security, another area that is very important when making your investment choice. The famous auditing firms InterFi Network and Solidproof have already finished two audits of the project, all while the minds behind Uwerx will place a lock on project liquidity for 25 years after its launch. These safety nets genuinely reflect the team's long-term faith and confidence in the project and are a good sign for any potential buyer. Since the token price is only $0.0065, now is the right time to buy into a possible top 10 coin at a low cost. With many crypto insiders predicting a $2.80 price point by July 2024, we believe that Uwerx may be one of the most profitable investment choices in 2023! </p>
<p class="s7">The Shiba Inu (SHIB) Value Goes Up</p>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), established in 2020, is a spoof of Dogecoin (DOGE), another joke coin. The currency was developed by the Shiba Inu (SHIB) team as a way of rewarding content providers.</p>
<p>Recently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) developers unveiled "Shibarium" proposals, describing intentions to introduce a layer-2 blockchain. This news helped the Shiba Inu (SHIB) value go up 25% in the past week, which is currently worth $0.00001116. Its trading volume has also shot up 350% in the past 24 hours, but some investors are still skeptical. For it to reach the $1 mark, the developers must make many changes, and even though Shiba Inu (SHIB) may see green charts in the future, those who wish for more significant profit should look for other projects with more utility cases. </p>
<p class="s7">Gala (GALA) Sinks By 11%</p>
<p>Gala (GALA) is a brand-new gaming environment built on Ethereum. The Gala (GALA) coin was launched in 2020 but has already become quite attractive among players to send and receive payments within the environment. </p>
<p>This popularity helped the Gala (GALA) coin reach its all-time high of $0.8367 in 2021. However, the token has been on a downward trend ever since then. Currently, the Gala (GALA) coin is heading down a negative trajectory again, dropping by 11% in a single day as it is currently trading at $0.04622. Another negative indicator is that its market cap has also been losing strength, going down 11.60% in the same period. Experts believe this bearish trend is bound to continue as Gala (GALA) fails to reach the $0.050 support level.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S.-based crypto exchange has recently acquired the license required to offer crypto trading services in the island territory of Bermuda.&nbsp;</p>
Coinbase Bermuda Receives License
<p>At a time when U.S. regulators, like the SEC, are making it harder and harder for crypto companies to survive, Coinbase has made the prudent decision to take matters offshore. The crypto exchange had recently applied for the operational license for the offshore haven of Bermuda. In a blog published on the company website on April 19, it was revealed that the application was approved, and the license was granted to Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coinbase Bermuda Ltd. has obtained a Class F License under the Digital Asset Business Act from the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA).&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to reports, thanks to the license, Coinbase is all set to launch a crypto derivatives exchange in Bermuda as soon as next week.&nbsp;</p>
BMA Makes Bermuda A Crypto Haven
<p>The announcement also addressed the factors which drove the company to branch out its operations to the island, touching upon the comprehensive digital assets regulation guidelines that were passed in 2018. Furthermore, the announcement claimed that the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) is a highly respected and experienced financial regulator with tremendous leadership and was also another contributing factor to the establishment of Coinbase Bermuda Ltd. The fact that BMA is also a member of several international organizations and has worked closely with other regulatory agencies around the world is an added advantage.</p>
<p>The team wrote,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Working with global regulators is key to the Coinbase mission, as we continue to increase economic freedom in the world. As the most transparent and trustworthy centralized exchange, Coinbase will help bring the next billion users into the cryptoeconomy.&rdquo;</p>

Trouble With SEC
<p>The company&rsquo;s CEO, Brian Armstrong, has categorically stated that the crypto firm will be exploring all its offshore options, especially regulatory havens like Bermuda, unless there is more clarity from the UK and U.S. watchdogs. Coinbase has recently been in trouble with the SEC, which has served the company with a Wells notice. The high probability of a lengthy court battle with the regulatory watchdog could have been a key motivating factor to its increased offshore efforts lately. Other than Bermuda, the firm is also in talks with the financial regulators in Abu Dhabi about a potential operating license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company hinted at its regulatory troubles,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coinbase chose to become a public company in the US because we believe the US would best be served by embracing this fundamental innovation, but we&rsquo;re also focused on international markets, many of which are moving forward with strategies to become &ldquo;crypto hubs.&rdquo; We would like to see the US take a similar approach, but a regulation by enforcement approach in the US is instead leading to a disappointing trend for crypto development in the US.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
