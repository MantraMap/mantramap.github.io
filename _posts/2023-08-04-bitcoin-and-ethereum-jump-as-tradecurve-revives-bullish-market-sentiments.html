<p class="s6">The presale of Tradecurve has rejuvenated the crypto market, and bulls have become active too. According to analysts, this new project has massive growth potential, and can become a new market king soon.</p>
<p class="s6">It has emerged as a serious challenger to well-established titans like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which are facing sluggishness.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
Bitcoin (BTC) Miners Suffer A Drop In Revenue
<p class="s6">A couple of months ago, Bitcoin (BTC) miners were raking in big revenues, due to the mania around the Ordinals protocol. However, as the hype around Ordinals wanes, transaction activity on the Bitcoin (BTC) network has returned to normal.</p>
<p class="s6">This has caused a slump in the revenue of Bitcoin (BTC) miners. As per the data from IntoTheBlock, transaction fees on the Bitcoin (BTC) network have plummeted by 38% since March. However, Bitcoin miners are holding onto their tokens as they hope for a further increase in the price of BTC.</p>
<p class="s6">Meanwhile, the market value of Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a surge of 14% in the past 30 days. As a result, Bitcoin (BTC) currently changes hands at $30,195.15.</p>
Ethereum (ETH) Whales Sell Their Tokens
<p class="s6">The latest on-chain data has revealed that Ethereum (ETH) whales have aggressively sold off their tokens. For instance, an Ethereum whale recently sold 4,549 ETH tokens worth about $8.78 million.</p>
<p class="s6">The whale bought Ethereum (ETH) tokens on January 9 at a price of $1,319. According to market experts, the sell-off pattern indicates that Ethereum (ETH) whales want to cash out the benefits before any unforeseen market downfall in future. Interestingly, after the court&rsquo;s verdict in the SEC-XRP case, Ethereum (ETH) surged to approximately $2030. But since then, Ethereum&rsquo;s (ETH) value has suffered a drop of more than 5%.</p>
<p class="s6">At the time of writing, Ethereum (ETH) trades at $1,910.38.</p>
Tradecurve's Momentum Aligns with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH): A Triumvirate Fueling Market Revival
<p class="s6">In a remarkable synergy with the established giants Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), Tradecurve is infusing a fresh dynamism into the market, showcasing its potential to stand alongside the titans.</p>
<p class="s6">Crypto aficionados have long been looking for an exchange that could help them trade several assets with one account. To meet this growing demand, Tradecurve has entered the crypto arena. It is a comprehensive decentralized exchange that allows the trading of several assets on a single user interface. The asset classes available here include cryptocurrencies, stocks, Forex, bonds, and more.</p>
<p class="s6">Since the demand for decentralized exchange has surged to a new high, this new platform can soon become a market leader. CoinGecko&rsquo;s data showed that the growth rate of decentralized exchanges in Q1 2023 was more than 33%.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform enables people to trade a wide range of assets without relying on fiat payments. The platform ensures that the identities of its users are never revealed as traders need not go through any KYC verification process. This feature makes it more privacy-focused than existing exchanges, such as Bakkt and Revolut, where traders must submit their private details.</p>
<p class="s6">The platform will give exclusive deposit and level-up bonuses, among other perks. It also offers a VIP account service and high-leverage trading that starts from 500:1. Besides, it is equipped with a mechanism that ensures negative balance protection. The presale of the platform&rsquo;s native token, TCRV, is currently running at a price tag of $0.025.</p>
<p class="s6">TCRV tokens have been built on the Ethereum blockchain. As per market forecast, the tokens&rsquo; value will increase by 50x during the presale, and 100x after launch on multiple CEXs and Uniswap. The platform has already more than 17,000 registered users to its presale.</p>
