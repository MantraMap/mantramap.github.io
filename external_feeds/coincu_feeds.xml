<p>According to Nansen&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1676623317137256448" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/nansen_ai/status/1676623317137256448" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, over 500,000 unique wallets have bridged to Starknet from Ethereum, depositing a total of over $65 million on the network. The majority of these wallets have bridged very low amounts, with 60% of depositors bridging between $1 and $100, and 94% of depositors bridging less than $1,000.</p>

<p>In terms of wallet age, most wallets (~75%) are less than one year old. The breakdown is as follows: 24.5% of wallets are 1-year-old or older, 41% are between 3-12 months old, 26.6% are between 1-3 months old, 6.78% are between 1 week &#8211; 1 month old, and 1.1% are less than 1 week old.</p>

<p>ETH is the dominant bridged asset, accounting for nearly 75% of all assets bridged, largely due to it having by far the highest maximum cap imposed by StarkWare. JediSwap is the top protocol by total value locked, with more than 2x the TVL of second place, and the only non-AMM is the lending protocol zkLend &#8211; the native L2 money-market protocol built on Starknet. The relatively low TVL can be largely attributed to the restrictions imposed on the network.</p>

<p>The platform has recently announced the release of Alpha V0.12.0, which aims to enhance performance and scalability. The update targets Starknet&#8217;s Sequencer to address throughput and latency challenges. This is a significant milestone in Starknet&#8217;s journey to scale Ethereum.</p>

<p>While it is still in its infancy with limited performance, there is relatively significant activity, and updates like Starknet 0.12 are expected to improve TPS in Q3. Deposits on Starknet greatly accelerated from mid-March when the deposit caps were raised again.</p>

<p>Tieshun Roquerre, known as Pacman, responded to Twitter chatter about whether Blur is responsible for the decline of the market.</p>



<p>Pacman clarified that since its launch in October 22, the floor prices of some NFT collections have gone up, while others have gone down. He also pointed out that Blur injected liquidity into NFTs through their airdrop, which led to an increase in floor prices. On the other hand, $40 million of liquidity was removed via the Azuki mint, which caused a decrease in floor prices. Pacman also acknowledged that liquidity is the main factor that affects the market&#8217;s movement.</p>

Even the premier collections have been affected by the decline. For instance, the floor price of Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club has decreased to 28 ETH (approximately $53,000), the lowest it has been in over 18 months, and less than half its value at the beginning of the year, according to NFT Price Floor data. Additionally, the floor price of Azuki, another popular collection, has plummeted after the mishap in the launch of a new set of NFTs by its creator, Chiru Labs.</p>

<p>Blur, the Paradigm-backed marketplace for pro traders, was blamed for the decline. Lior Messika, whose venture firm Eden Block is an investor in Yuga Labs, pointed out that NFT whales who had previously identified as “collectors” are now branding themselves as traders or even “Blur farmers,” which has distorted the space. Brad Kay also attributed a large part of the Azuki sell-off to <a href="https://coincu.com/194832-blur-token-will-be-unlocked-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blur</a>&#8216;s lending platform.</p>

<p>According to the ASXN <a href="https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1676670721655984128?s=20" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://twitter.com/asxn_r/status/1676670721655984128?s=20" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, MakerDAO&#8217;s MKR token has seen impressive growth over the past few weeks, with a 40% increase in the past seven days alone. This growth is attributed to several factors, including the Smart Burn Engine proposal, the expansion of the Spark protocol, and the deployment of the MKR repurchase contract. MakerDAO&#8217;s earned fees have also been rapidly growing, currently earning $315,000 in fees daily. </p>

<p>The Smart Burn Engine launch governance proposal is transitioning MakerDAO from a buy and burn model to a new approach called the POL model. Additionally, the rapid growth of Spark, a lending platform that uses a credit line from Maker called a Dai Direct Deposit Module (D3M), is contributing to the growth of MKR.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Coincu <a href="https://coincu.com/197005-makerdao-purchasing-700m-bonds/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://coincu.com/197005-makerdao-purchasing-700m-bonds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported </a>that the issuer of stablecoins and decentralized finance protocol MakerDAO purchased another $700 million in US Treasury bonds, bringing the platform&#8217;s DAI stablecoin reserve to $1.2 billion.</p>



<p>MakerDAO is an open-source project on the Ethereum blockchain and a Decentralized Autonomous Organization created in 2014. The project is managed by people around the world who hold its governance token, MKR. Through a system of scientific governance involving Executive Voting and Governance Polling, MKR holders manage the Maker Protocol and the financial risks of Dai to ensure its stability, transparency, and efficiency. MKR voting weight is proportional to the amount of MKR a voter stakes in the voting contract, DSChief. In other words, the more MKR tokens locked in the contract, the greater the voter&#8217;s decision-making power.</p>

<p>Again, RichQuack stated that its cryptocurrency balance of roughly $100,000, namely USDT and QUAK, had disappeared from the Hotbit platform. Thus yet, no other projects or investors have reported any breach or assault save RichQuack.</p>



<p>The exchange said that among its holdings are locked assets that will be opened in 2-3 year periods. It was proposed that these assets be transformed into more liquid form at the same intervals and given to HTB token holders.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The stablecoin issuer said it is considering developing a stablecoin in Japan under the new regulations.</em></li>



<li><em>Japan was one of the first countries to have a law governing stablecoins, and it went into effect on June 1.</em></li>



<li><em>Stablecoins must be pegged to yen or other legal tender and guarantee the holder the right to redeem them at face value.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Circle is planning to expand its business by considering issuing a stablecoin in <a href="https://coincu.com/155519-japan-will-lift-ban-foreign-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan </a>once the country&#8217;s regulatory framework comes into effect on June 1.</strong></h5>

<p>According to CoinDesk, Circle co-founder and CEO Jeremy Allaire said that in light of the fact that the stable money management law took effect on June 1, Circle is considering issuing a stablecoin in Japan.</p>



<p>If the plan is successful, Japan could become an extremely large market if it is applied to cross-border trade, foreign currency trading and global trade.</p>



<p>Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed interest in the Japan partnership he visited last month.</p>



<p>In a historic move, Japan&#8217;s parliament passed the regulatory framework around stablecoins in early June, providing a safety net for investors. This makes Japan one of the first major economies to pass legislation specifically for stablecoins.</p>



<p>Reportedly, Japan&#8217;s revised &#8220;Payment Services Law&#8221; will certify fiat currency-backed stablecoins as &#8220;electronic payment methods&#8221; and authorize their issuance.</p>

<p>The bill provides clarity around the definition of stablecoins, which will now be considered digital currencies and must be linked to a yen or other legal tender, ensuring holders have the right to redeem them at face value.</p>



<p>Stablecoins can currently only be issued by licensed banks, registered remittance agents, and trust companies. The bill does not address existing asset- or algorithm-backed stablecoins. However, exchanges in Japan do not list stablecoins.</p>



<p>Japan has moved to relax some of its crypto rules, such as token listing and taxation, but overall the country is considered to have strict regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>BlackRock CEO sees Bitcoin as an &#8220;international asset&#8221; and advocates for a Bitcoin ETF.</em></li>



<li><em>BlackRock&#8217;s ETF application fueled Bitcoin&#8217;s price increase and attracted institutional investors.</em></li>



<li><em>Fink, once skeptical, now recognizes Bitcoin&#8217;s value and BlackRock&#8217;s track record supports ETF approval.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In an <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6330640643112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a>, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that Bitcoin is an &#8220;international asset,&#8221; only weeks after the world&#8217;s biggest asset management sought to launch a spot Bitcoin ETF.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-341.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="926" height="694" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-341.png" alt="BlackRock CEO Praises Bitcoin As An International Asset" class="wp-image-200437" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-341.png 926w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-341-300x225.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-341-768x576.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/image-341-750x562.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 926px) 100vw, 926px" title="BlackRock CEO Praises Bitcoin As An International Asset And Sparks ETF Frenzy 19"></a></figure></div>


<p>On <em>Fox Business</em> on July 5, Fink said that crypto was essentially &#8220;digitizing gold,&#8221; implying that US authorities should investigate how an ETF directly connected to Bitcoin might democratize finance. Fink often remarked on important events influencing the crypto industry during his tenure at <a href="https://coincu.com/198667-ark-invest-blackrock-locked-in-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BlackRock</a>, including the collapse of FTX in 2022 and increased interest in <a href="https://coincu.com/200349-valkyrie-to-re-file-bitcoin-spot-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“I do believe the role of crypto is digitalizing gold, in many ways. Instead of investing in gold as a hedge against inflation, a hedge against the onerous problems of any one country, or the devaluation of your currency whatever country you’re in – let’s be clear, bitcoin is an international asset, it’s not based on any one currency and so it can represent an asset that people can play as an alternative,” said Fink.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With its application, BlackRock, which controls $9.5 trillion in assets, helped spark a Bitcoin run, prompting institutional investors to pour money into the area and pushing the price to reach a 12-month high. Fink said that BlackRock has previously worked closely with authorities on ETF applications and that the firm&#8217;s track record would assist in the approval of this current proposal.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“What we’re trying to do with crypto is make it more democratized, and make it much cheaper for investors,” he added.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the BlackRock CEO said that he was first dubious about cryptocurrency due to its usage as a payment tool for illegal operations, he has subsequently changed his view. Bitcoin was originally referred to by Fink as an &#8220;index of money laundering.&#8221; Years later, though, he conceded that Bitcoin was a valuable asset and that BlackRock had profited from its investment in the digital currency. He has maintained that the asset would expand.</p>



<p>Last month, BlackRock submitted an application to develop a spot Bitcoin ETF, which was immediately followed by several other firms, including <a href="https://coincu.com/196154-fidelity-follows-blackrock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity</a>. The asset management has a near-perfect track record of having ETFs authorized by the SEC, but the commission has never accepted an application for a spot Bitcoin ETF.</p>

<p>According to a report from Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, investigators from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have concluded that bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network and its former CEO violated US rules before ending up in bankruptcy as it is now.</p>



<p>With the conclusion, the agency could file a lawsuit in federal court as early as this month under US rules if a majority of the trustees uphold the finding. One of the people said that law enforcement attorneys have determined that Celsius misled investors and should have registered with the regulator and that former CEO Alex Mashinsky had also broken the rules.</p>

<p>According to May court filings, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and federal prosecutors from Manhattan have also launched a series of investigations into the company. Bloomberg notes that both the SEC and representatives of the United States Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on the status of the investigations.</p>



<p>On June 16 last year, securities regulators from five different US states opened an investigation into Celsius three days after the company abruptly stopped withdrawing user funds on May 13. </p>



<p>As of today&#8217;s update, the lending platform has taken steps to<a href="https://coincu.com/200416-celsius-moved-74m-altcoins-into-btc-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> move</a> around 74 million altcoins into Bitcoin (BTC) and Etherum (ETH) in a plan to refund users stuck on the platform. According to the balance sheet for April, the total altcoin sell pressure amounts to $279M.</p>

<p>According to data from the crypto data platform Arkham, the Celsius wallet holds about $615 million in crypto, including $296 million in Bitcoin and $120 million in ethereum.

<p>In addition, Arkham&#8217;s report also states that network address Celsius (0x1C…9074) has staked 40.96 thousand ETH, worth about $75 million, for ETH2 staking contract through Figment from date May 10 to 12.</p>



<p>As previously reported, on June 30, a New York court <a href="https://coincu.com/199297-celsius-can-convert-all-altcoins-to-btc-eth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approved</a> Celsius to convert its altcoins into bitcoin and ether from July 1.</p>



<p>Celsius is preparing a plan to refund users &#8220;stuck&#8221; on the platform. Accordingly, the company will sell all altcoin balances on customer accounts in exchange for BTC &amp; ETH. According to the balance sheet for April, the total altcoin sell pressure amounts to $279M:</p>

<p>Except for CEL, which is the native token of Celsius, most are MATIC and ADA. These are all highly liquid coins, with such a selling force that can not be expected to affect the price of these tokens much. This gives users of the platform some peace of mind about the future repayment plan.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Israel&#8217;s parliament approves tax breaks for the crypto industry, mirroring those enjoyed by high-tech enterprises.</em></li>



<li><em>The measure aims to halve the tax on cryptocurrency options and attract international investment to Israel.</em></li>



<li><em>The country is taking steps to regulate the digital asset market and promote clarity through proposed tax payment systems.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On Wednesday, a <a href="https://main.knesset.gov.il/activity/legislation/laws/pages/lawbill.aspx?t=lawsuggestionssearch&amp;lawitemid=2202412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measure</a> to extend some tax breaks available to Israel&#8217;s high-tech enterprises to the country&#8217;s crypto industry received preliminary approval in the Knesset, the country&#8217;s parliament.</strong></h5>

<p>The plan, which aims to change Israel&#8217;s Income Tax Code, also proposes halving the 50% tax on workers&#8217; cryptocurrency options. In this sense, the objective is to extend the tax break enjoyed by employees in the conventional high-tech sector to the digital asset company.</p>

<p>Dan Illou, a lawmaker from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#8217;s Likud party, said in a statement that the measure had the support of Netanyahu&#8217;s coalition administration. The law also fits with the current administration&#8217;s goals to entice international investment to <a href="https://coincu.com/170775-israel-a-web3-technology-powerhouse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, according to <em><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/07/05/israeli-lawmakers-support-axing-crypto-capital-gains-tax-for-foreigners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinDesk</a></em>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">&#8220;Up until now, workers in the crypto industry had to pay double the tax on their options compared to workers in the traditional high-tech industry. Moreover, foreign investors in the blockchain industry were not entitled to the same benefits as those entitled to investors in the traditional high-tech industry,” said Illouz.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The most recent development comes as Israel attempts to control the expanding digital asset company. Shira Greenberg, Chief Economist at Israel&#8217;s Ministry of Finance, proposed ideas for regulating the country&#8217;s digital asset market in November, including the creation of systems for tax payment on digital asset operations to eliminate impediments and promote clarity.</p>

<p>Early this year, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) <a href="https://coincu.com/157938-israel-securities-authority-digital-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> to develop a new regulatory framework for digital assets that primarily come under its control, which might bring more clarity to the industry. The amendments would add digital assets to the current category of “financial instruments” in Israeli securities law and define them as digital representations of value that are utilized for financial investment, and that can be exchanged using a distributed ledger.</p>
