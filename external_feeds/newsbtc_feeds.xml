					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price is down 5% and trading below the $26,000 level. BTC is now at risk of a move toward the $25,000 support in the near term. Bitcoin started a sharp decline below the $27,000 level. The price is trading below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could correct higher but upsides might be limited above $26,200 and $26,400. Bitcoin Price Takes Hit Bitcoin price failed to start a fresh increase above the $27,000 resistance. BTC started a fresh decline below the $26,500 support and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. The price is down 5% and there was a move below the $26,000 support. It even retested the $25,400 support zone. It is now consolidating below $26,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $26,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now facing resistance near the $25,900 level. It is near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $27,489 swing high to the $25,400 low. The next major resistance is near the $26,100 level and the trend line. The main resistance sits near the $26,500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent drop from the $27,489 swing high to the $25,400 low, above which the price might start a decent increase. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next key resistance is near the $26,700 level. An upside break and close above $26,700 could start a decent increase toward $27,200. Any more gains above the $27,200 resistance zone might send the price toward the $27,500 resistance zone. More Losses in BTC? If Bitcoin’s price fails to clear the $26,100 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $25,400 level.

					<description><![CDATA[In a significant development this week, Bitcoin price has crossed bearish on the weekly LMACD (Logarithmic Moving Average Convergence Divergence), marking the first time this has occurred in 2023. Does this mean further decline for BTCUSD, or do bulls still have a chance to save the recent uptrend? Bitcoin Momentum Takes A Turn For The Bears Last night, the weekly candle in BTCUSD opened with a bearish crossover of the LMACD. Today, we saw a key support level fail at $27,000, prompting the cryptocurrency&#8217;s value tumble to $25,000. This bearish crossover and selloff interestingly coincides with an announcement from the SEC about enforcement action against the cryptocurrency giant, Binance.

					<description><![CDATA[In a shock move that has forced the cryptocurrency markets lower, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 5 sued Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange, accusing them of 13 charges, one of which is allegedly enabling the trading of unregistered securities. Top of the list, the regulator said, was that Binance allegedly allowed the trading of several crypto assets, including BNB, the platform&#8217;s native currency; Cardano&#8217;s ADA; and MATIC, the token priming the Polygon ecosystem. XRP Not A Security? The SEC didn&#8217;t mention payment company Ripple, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, a platform through which the company bases its flagship products. The two entities have been entangled in a legal fight since late 2020, when the regulator accused the payment company of allegedly selling an unregistered security, XRP.  It should be noted that despite the regulator mentioning XRP, the coin&#8217;s price is lower and weighed by the market-wide collapse that has so far wiped billions in value from the total crypto market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap (CMC), a coin tracker. Related Reading: Ethereum Top 10 Whales Now Hold 31.8M ETH, A New All-Time High When writing on June 5, the total cryptocurrency market cap had contracted by over 5% to $1.09 trillion. During this time, the XRP price has been down 7% in the past 24 hours.  However, comparing the current performance to how XRP faired last week, the coin is the only one in the green territory, adding 3%. This means XRP has outperformed all the top-10 cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and Bitcoin. The failure of the SEC to mention XRP in their lawsuit could be a huge boost for the token and its ecosystem in the days and weeks ahead. This is especially considering the ongoing case.  Ripple Supporters Remain Bullish Despite SEC&#8217;s Accusations The case is ongoing, but there have been rulings in recent weeks that make XRP supporters optimistic. The presiding judge has denied SEC&#8217;s motion to seal the Hinman documents.  Although the SEC vehemently campaigned for these documents to remain private, claiming they were deliberative and privileged, the judge said the public had the right to know since they are relevant to the case.  These documents are critical in the case as they detail internal communication by the SEC on how they classified XRP as a security.  Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) A Security? Price Collapses On SEC v. Binance Lawsuit Still, the judge is yet to make a ruling though the SEC, in March 2023, filed an amended complaint against Ripple, claiming they were engaged in market manipulation.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies have taken a hit in the wake of recent news regarding Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume. The market has reacted with concern to the disclosure of a complaint against the exchange, which has sparked a wider downtrend throughout the cryptocurrency industry. As of this writing, Bitcoin has declined by over 5% in response to the news, trading at $25,700. This drop in value mirrors the current market sentiment as investors grapple with the implications of the complaint against Binance. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Urges ADA Investors to Beware of New Scams The Bitcoin MA Standoff According to the analysis firm Material Indicators, their popular Fire Charts tool shows approximately $6.3 million in bid support defending the 200-week moving average (MA) placed at $25,200 for Bitcoin. If the bid support can maintain its strength and consolidate above this level, it would be a bullish sign for Bitcoin&#8217;s prospects. However, Material Indicators notes they are not confident that the 200-week MA will hold without additional bid support. The 200-week MA is crucial for Bitcoin, representing a long-term trend line historically supporting the cryptocurrency. A breach of this level could signal further downside for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market. Furthermore, Market analyst Maartun has reported $650 million of Bitcoin open interest flushed from the market, resulting in a 5% price decline. Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts not settled in the Bitcoin futures market. These contracts represent positions taken by traders who are betting on the future price of Bitcoin. The $650 million of open interest flushed from the market suggests that traders were caught off guard by the sudden decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, highlighting the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market. However, the market will likely remain volatile in the short term as investors continue to digest the news surrounding Bitcoin and the wider regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen how this will impact the industry in the long term, but for now, investors are bracing themselves for further turbulence in the cryptocurrency industry. Crucial Moment For The Crypto Market The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has been volatile in recent months, experiencing significant ups and downs as the market reacts to various news and events. However, many analysts remain bullish on the market&#8217;s long-term prospects, citing increasing adoption and institutional interest as factors that could drive prices higher in the future. However, according to trader and analyst Michael Van De Poppe, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is currently undergoing a test of its 200-week moving average and exponential moving average (EMA). This is a significant technical indicator that traders and analysts closely watch as it provides insight into the market&#8217;s long-term trend. Van De Poppe explains that if the market can hold above the 200-week MA and EMA, it could signal the current correction&#8217;s end and a new bullish trend. On the other hand, if the market fails to hold above the 200-week MA and EMA, it could indicate a continuation of the bear market.  Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) A Security?

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MI_Algos/status/1665737862376050689?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According </a>to the analysis firm Material Indicators, their popular Fire Charts tool shows approximately $6.3 million in bid support defending the 200-week moving average (MA) placed at $25,200 for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>If the bid support can maintain its strength and consolidate above this level, it would be a bullish sign for Bitcoin&#8217;s prospects. However, Material Indicators notes they are not confident that the 200-week MA will hold without additional bid support.</p>

<p>The 200-week MA is crucial for Bitcoin, representing a long-term trend line historically supporting the cryptocurrency. A breach of this level could signal further downside for Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Market analyst Maartun has <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1665639402087882754?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported </a>$650 million of Bitcoin open interest flushed from the market, resulting in a 5% price decline.</p>
<p>Open interest is the total number of outstanding contracts not settled in the Bitcoin futures market. These contracts represent positions taken by traders who are betting on the future price of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The $650 million of open interest flushed from the market suggests that traders were caught off guard by the sudden decline in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, highlighting the ongoing volatility of the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>However, the market will likely remain volatile in the short term as investors continue to digest the news surrounding Bitcoin and the wider regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. It remains to be seen how this will impact the industry in the long term, but for now, investors are bracing themselves for further turbulence in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
Crucial Moment For The Crypto Market
<p>The total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market has been volatile in recent months, experiencing significant ups and downs as the market reacts to various news and events. However, many analysts remain bullish on the market&#8217;s long-term prospects, citing increasing adoption and institutional interest as factors that could drive prices higher in the future.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1665779265520975872?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according </a>to trader and analyst Michael Van De Poppe, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrency market is currently undergoing a test of its 200-week moving average and exponential moving average (EMA). This is a significant technical indicator that traders and analysts closely watch as it provides insight into the market&#8217;s long-term trend.</p>

<p>Van De Poppe explains that if the market can hold above the 200-week MA and EMA, it could signal the current correction&#8217;s end and a new bullish trend. On the other hand, if the market fails to hold above the 200-week MA and EMA, it could indicate a continuation of the bear market. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Bitcoin Ordinals protocol developers have introduced a new upgrade to rectify over 71,000 invalid inscriptions previously untradeable. These inscriptions often result from incorrect usage and were rendered useless and untradeable until now. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here’s What To Watch Out For However, with this recent development, developers have taken the first step toward addressing this long-standing problem. Developers Unleased the New Ordinals Protocol Version 0.6.0 Bitcoin Ordinals refer to nonfungible asset artifacts that allow data to be inscribed onto the smallest unit of Bitcoin, known as a satoshi. According to Dune Analytics, $45.5 million have been generated from 10.8 million ordinal inscriptions since the beginning of this year. On June 4, a notable developer, Raphjaph, announced that Ordinals&#8217; latest version, 0.6.0 is available. He added that this development would mark a turning point in recognizing these previously unrecognized inscriptions enabling them to be traded once again. Essentially, &#8220;Cursed Inscriptions&#8221; was coined to describe inscriptions generated through improper usage or manipulation of opcodes during the creation.  As a result of these processes, the inscriptions became invalid and unacknowledged by the system. Ordinals creator Casey Roadarmor first proposed to fix the issue in late April by recognizing and converting these cursed inscriptions to &#8220;Blessed&#8221; ones. Related Reading: Ethereum Top 10 Whales Now Hold 31.8M ETH, A New All-Time High Roadarmor desired to modify the ordinals protocol to recognize multiple inscriptions per transaction, inscriptions with unrecognized even headers, etc. As such, the enhancements in the latest version optimize the &#8220;ord&#8221; system, streamline inscriptions, and ensure client agreement, enhancing efficiency, flexibility, and compatibility. Meanwhile, Ordinals promoter LeonidasNFT said that the “cursed inscriptions,&#8221; as recognized by the Ordinal&#8217;s latest version, act as a &#8220;stepping stone,&#8221; offering a pathway for previously invalid inscriptions to become visible. Ordinals Spark Controversy and Record Transaction Costs Since the inception of the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol in January 2023 by Casey Rodarmor, there have been multiple speculations concerning its transaction costs and slower speeds. One of the most significant concerns raised by the community is the undeniable and undesired impact of Ordinals on Bitcoin&#8217;s network capacity and scalability. There has been a sharp increase in BTC transaction fees caused by the surge in BRC-20 activity which relies heavily on Ordinal inscriptions. The trading frenzy surrounding BRC-20 meme-coins like Pepe (PEPE) pushed transaction costs to their highest levels since 2021. The blockchain has been experiencing massive congestion as users continue to pour BTC into minting new tokens settled via Ordinals inscriptions. On May 7, the congestion reached a critical point when Binance halted BTC withdrawals temporarily due to approximately 400,000 pending transactions congesting the mempool. Balancing the innovation brought by Ordinals with the need for a scalable Bitcoin network poses a challenge that must be addressed to ensure the continued success of the cryptocurrency.

					<description><![CDATA[Data from Glassnode shows that the current Bitcoin price is where the cost basis of a large number of coins lies. Here’s what this means. 780,000 BTC Was Acquired Near The Current Spot Prices According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, 4.6% of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply has its acquisition price near the current spot prices of the asset. The relevant indicator here is the “entity-adjusted UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD),” which, in simple terms, tells us about how the cost basis of the investors is distributed right now. The cost basis here refers to the price at which they bought their coins, so this distribution shows us at which price how many coins were acquired by the holders. Note that this indicator has been adjusted for entities, meaning that all internal movements between the wallets owned by a single investor are removed from this data (an “entity” refers to a collection of addresses that Glassnode has identified to belong to the same holder). Naturally, this adjustment has been made because any movement between the addresses of the same entity would otherwise count as a sale. Thus, a fresh cost basis would be given to the investor (when in reality, it wouldn’t be so). Related Reading: Bloomberg’s Senior Macro Strategist Predicts More Pain Ahead For Bitcoin Now, here is a chart that shows what the URPD in the Bitcoin market looks like right now: Looks like the levels around the current price have a large amount of coins concentrated &#124; Source: Glassnode on Twitter As highlighted in the above graph, the levels around the current spot price of the cryptocurrency seem to be the largest center of cost basis in the market right now. In total, 780,000 tokens were purchased at these prices, which amount to around 4.6% of the entire circulating supply of the cryptocurrency. Because of this reason, the current price range that Bitcoin is trading in might be crucial for where the asset could go from here. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Topside Bias Vulnerable If It Continues To Struggle Below $28K “With such large swathes of Bitcoin concentrated within a tight price range, a move in either direction would send a significant amount of coins into a position of profit or loss, highlighting the acute sensitivity of our current position,” explains Glassnode. Major cost basis centers have historically played a notable role in the market because they act as important psychological levels. During bearish trends, investors prefer to sell when the prices fall to their cost basis, as they want to avoid getting into a loss. Similarly, holders prefer to buy more at their cost basis during bullish trends, considering it a profitable buying opportunity. It remains to be seen how the market will respond to the current situation in the coming days. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $26,000, down 5% in the last week. The value of the asset seems to have plunged down during the past day or so &#124; Source: BTCUSD on TradingView Featured image from Thought Catalog on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Glassnode.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The founder of the Cardano blockchain, Charles Hoskinson, took to Twitter to inform investors of a new scam scheme that has suddenly emerged focusing solely on ADA holders. According to Hoskinson, the scammers impersonate him to send messages to members of the ADA community. Related Reading: Bedrock Upgrade: How Optimism Game-Changer Could Impact OP Price In the post, the Cardano founder reiterated that he would &#8220;never email ADA holders directly.&#8221; He also disclosed that scammers have been trying different tactics to impersonate him and defraud ADA investors of their funds. Scammers Target ADA Community Members Hoskinson discovered the ongoing scam tactic through an unknown ADA enthusiast who contacted him about the malicious scheme. The ADA user reported that while impersonating him, the scammers sent emails concerning a newly launched project, the &#8220;Hoskinson Health and Wellness Clinic.&#8221;  The scammers wrote that the launch of the medical facility is part of Hoskinson’s vision to build a &#8220;strong&#8221; ecosystem for Cardano.  They also noted that the medical center, based in Wyoming, will include ADA as a payment option. The scammers’ emails mentioned that lives are easily lost when people fail to disclose their medical details on time.  So, they stated that easy availability and accessibility of medical information through innovative technology like Cardano would help to save more lives promptly. Related Reading: XRP Climbs 12% As Crypto Celebrates 11-Year Milestone Further, the malicious email stated that the newly launched medical facility is the first medical multichain on the Cardano network. It mentioned that the impact of such a project on the blockchain ecosystem and in life could scale quite high once this kind of project reaches its peak. Finally, the email persuaded ADA investors to research the medical chain project more while increasing their investment holdings in ADA. Hoskinson Offers Some Tips To Identify Scammers While notifying the investors about the ongoing scam, Hoskinson laid out some tips on identifying scammers. Hoskinson noted that the tips would help to fish out those impersonating the Cardano founder. The founder advises members of the ADA community to verify the identity of senders of suspicious emails by requesting them to do so. To ensure security, the verification process should involve obtaining Hoskinson&#8217;s Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key signature. Hoskinson has confirmed that scammers cannot replicate this signature. PGP keys are public encryption keys designed for the specific purposes of encrypting or signing emails, files, and directories. When you create a PGP key, the system generates a public and private key pair, enabling you to receive an encrypted message and open it. But you can send the public key to the sender and use your private key to decrypt the message when it comes. In that case, someone impersonating you cannot produce your public key, as Hoskinson pointed out. Meanwhile, ADA is trading at around $0.3748 when writing, indicating a drop of 1.78% over the past 24 hours. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that its market cap is about $ 13.07 billion.

<p>It mentioned that the impact of such a project on the blockchain ecosystem and in life could scale quite high once this kind of project reaches its peak.</p>
<p>Finally, the email persuaded ADA investors to research the medical chain project more while increasing their investment holdings in ADA.</p>
<h2>Hoskinson Offers Some Tips To Identify Scammers</h2>
<p>While notifying the investors about the ongoing scam, Hoskinson laid out some tips on identifying scammers. Hoskinson noted that the tips would help to fish out those impersonating the Cardano founder.</p>
<p>The founder advises members of the ADA community to verify the identity of senders of suspicious emails by requesting them to do so.</p>
<p>To ensure security, the verification process should involve obtaining Hoskinson&#8217;s Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) key signature. Hoskinson has confirmed that scammers cannot replicate this signature. PGP keys are public encryption keys designed for the specific purposes of encrypting or signing emails, files, and directories.</p>
<p>When you create a PGP key, the system generates a public and private key pair, enabling you to receive an encrypted message and open it. But you can send the public key to the sender and use your private key to decrypt the message when it comes. In that case, someone impersonating you cannot produce your public key, as Hoskinson pointed out.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Cardano (ADA) and the crypto market just took a punch from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The regulator filed a lawsuit against Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, contributing to the decline in prices across the nascent market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Poised For Significant Breakout: Here&#8217;s What To Watch Out For Cardano (ADA) trades at $0.35 as of this writing, recording a 6% loss in the last 24 hours. In the last week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 7% and stands amongst the worst performers in the top 10 by market capitalization, only surpassed by Binance Coin (BNB). SEC Fight Against Binance Splashes Cardano (ADA) According to the complaint filed by the U.S. regulator in the District of Columbia, Binance has been offering &#8220;unregistered securities&#8221; since its inception. These alleged securities under U.S. laws include Cardano (ADA), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Filecoin (FIL), Cosmos Hub (ATOM), Algorand (ALGO), and others. On the document, the SEC classifies ADA as a &#8220;crypto security,&#8221; a term which they coined in the last two years. The regulator provides an overview of the token&#8217;s history, claiming the following and potentially arguing against ADA&#8217;s decentralization: Today, three entities are responsible for Cardano: (1) the Cardano Foundation, a Swiss entity that is the legal custodian of the Cardano protocol and owner of its brand; (2) IOHK, an engineering company controlled by Hoskinson and Wood responsible for designing, building and maintaining the Cardano blockchain; and (3) Emurgo (…). To sustain their argument, the SEC claims that these entities hold over 16.7% of ADA&#8217;s total supply or 31.1 billion ADA. The regulator also claims that the companies sold the token to fund development, marketing, business operations, and other critical project areas. As of this writing, there is no official reply from these entities, or IOHK (IOG), the company behind Cardano&#8217;s development. Crypto Market Participating Over-reacting To Binance Lawsuit? Despite the lawsuit, some crypto community members call the event a &#8220;nothing burger.&#8221; The U.S. regulator is still to provide a clear legal framework for what constitutes a security in this country. In that sense, legal expert Collins Belton believes that today&#8217;s bad news could turn into a positive development for the long haul. Via his Twitter account, the expert stated: (…) this should actually be seen as a bit of a tension reliever for anyone that hasn’t been wildly deluded on Hopium. This complaint has been hanging above us like a sword of Damocles and letting it fall now in the depths of a bear is probably the best we could hope for. Related Reading: Ethereum Top 10 Whales Now Hold 31.8M ETH, A New All-Time High Belton also believes the crypto market could be &#8220;overstating&#8221; the complaint.

					<description><![CDATA[On-chain data shows the ten largest whales on the Ethereum network are now holding 31.8 million ETH, a new all-time high. Ethereum Holdings Of Top 10 Whales Have Now Surpassed August 2015 ATH According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the largest ETH whales have grown their supplies recently. The largest whales here refer to the ten largest addresses on the Ethereum network that aren’t associated with a centralized platform. Santiment has identified such self-custodial addresses, and entities like exchanges have been excluded here because their role in the sector is different from that of the normal whales. As the whales hold huge amounts in their wallets, they can significantly influence the market since their movements may produce noticeable effects on the price. Thus, The ten largest whales are the most powerful investors on the network. Naturally, since their behavior may impact the market, their movements are worth watching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Is Becoming Greener At An Unexpected Pace, Good For BTC Price? Now, here is a chart that shows how the combined balance of these large Ethereum whales has changed since the cryptocurrency first started trading back in 2015: Looks like the value of the metric has observed a sharp uptrend recently &#124; Source: Santiment on Twitter As you can see in the above graph, the largest players in the Ethereum ecosystem have been constantly growing their supplies in the last few years. However, there was an exception to this trend when the bear market started in 2022 and crashes like the LUNA collapse and the 3AC bankruptcy occurred. These investors&#8217; holdings had shrunk during this period, implying that they may have been participating in the market selloff. It wasn’t long, however, before these humongous holders started accumulating again. Their buying spree has also continued into the rally this year, and interestingly, the last couple of months have seen the supply of these investors observing an even sharper uptrend. The chart also shows the data for the Ethereum exchange supply, which is the total amount of ETH currently sitting in these platforms&#8217; wallets. It seems like when the whales started accumulating a few years back; the exchange supply had started heading down instead. This may imply that the coins being withdrawn towards self-custody were being absorbed by this cohort. Though, while the exchange supply has continued to decline recently, its drawdown has been much weaker. As the top ten Ethereum whales have rapidly accumulated during the same period, it would appear that the source of their fresh buying isn’t from the exchange-held tokens anymore.
