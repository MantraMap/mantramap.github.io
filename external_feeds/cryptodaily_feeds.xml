			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="s3">The crypto game market is still young, but it's expanding quickly. Several reasons contribute to its expansion, making it more appealing to players. The growing acceptance of blockchain technology is one such cause. Owing of its safety, openness, and decentralization, this technology is used in various sectors, including the gaming industry.</p>
<p class="s3">The rising need for interactive and immersive experiences is also contributing to the expansion of the crypto gaming industry. These days, players want games that feel more like the real world, and crypto games provide that.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="s3">Another appealing feature of crypto gaming is the possibility of profiting from crypto. Participating in games, performing tasks, and winning tournaments all provide players with opportunities to earn cryptocurrency. The development of the crypto sector is stimulated by this monetary incentive to participate in crypto gaming.</p>
<p class="s3">While still in its infancy, the crypto gaming sector shows great promise as a future powerhouse in the gaming sector. More sophisticated crypto games will likely be created as the sector matures, with more options for players to earn cryptocurrency and engage in immersive and interactive experiences.</p>
<p class="s3">Play-to-Earn Games</p>
<p class="s3">The popularity of Play-to-Earn games has skyrocketed in the crypto gaming community because they allow players to earn crypto as they play. These games' economies are based on cryptographic tokens and are constructed using blockchain technology. As a result of the popularity of these games, more play-to-earn games have emerged, making this genre one of the most exciting in cryptocurrency gaming companies.</p>
<p class="s3">Virtual Reality Games</p>
<p class="s3">While the concept of virtual reality (VR) games is not new, incorporating blockchain technology has increased the sense of realism experienced by players. Blockchain technology makes a safer and more transparent method of exchanging virtual assets and monetizing gaming experiences possible. Players of VR games have access to a 3D digital environment in which they may create, play, and sell their assets. Notably, this subgenre of crypto gaming also shows great potential for development and expansion.</p>
<p class="s3">This article will focus on 2023's best crypto games and where they rank. We will investigate which games have the greatest room for expansion and innovation based on their existing offers and future ambitions. By examining these games, we seek to inform players about the state of the crypto gaming industry and direct them toward the games with the most potential.</p>
<p class="s3">My Lovely Planet</p>
<p class="s3">My Lovely Planet by Ubisoft Lab is a mobile game with a simple but powerful idea. It lets you have fun while making a difference in the real world. As a player, you take on the part of a Lovely Protector whose goal is to make a safe, green, and beautiful island. There are minigames in the game that let you earn seeds, tickets, and stars that you can use to plant trees and get new pieces of scenery, and build places. Every time a tree is planted in the game, a real tree is also put in the real world. This makes it an unforgettable moment.</p>
<p class="s3">My Lovely Planet has already made a big splash, with 8,000 regular players, 30,000 members, and a 4.7 review on the App Store and Play Store. On the other hand, the game's goal is to bring together 100 million players by 2030 to plant 1 billion trees, clean up 1 million tons of trash from the ocean, and protect 40,000 threatened species. My Lovely Planet got the Unity For Humanity award for making a difference and is planning a token sale to reach more people and add new features, including its token sale coming up in a few days.</p>
<p class="s3">Blocklords</p>
<p class="s3">Blocklords, a strategy game resembling Age of Empires and Crusader Kings, allows players to begin as characters from various social classes and accumulate a fortune by conducting conflicts and collecting taxes. The community-first approach of MetaKing Studios is revolutionizing the game development industry, allowing players to experience the game, provide feedback, and collaborate with developers to influence the game's direction.</p>
<p class="s3">Blocklords is well on its way to becoming a significant force in the gaming industry, having received a staggering $15 million in pilot stage funding from well-known game industry titans such as Square Enix, Krafton, Fun Plus, Makers Fund, BITKRAFT, Delphi Digital, Animoca Brands, and ShimaCapital, among others. The Community-Beta version of the game is presently available, enabling players to experience its distinctive features and gameplay mechanics. Notably, by entering the community and obtaining a free in-game hero, players are able to collaborate with others, expand their empires, and defeat their adversaries for free.</p>
<p class="s3">OVAL3</p>
<p class="s3">OVAL3 is an innovative concept that fuses sports, gaming, and technology to create a one-of-a-kind Rugby gaming experience. The game provides a realistic and exciting take on the sport of Rugby by letting players collect, play, and win actual digital cards. OVAL3 has licenses for 42 clubs, over 2,000 players, and three leagues in France and the United States, and it seems set to shake up the gaming sector. Additionally, OVAL3 has partnered with Web3 industry leaders ERA2140, Pyratz Labs, and Markchain to provide state-of-the-art technical and promotional assistance.</p>
<p class="s3">Numerous aspects of OVAL3 make it a desirable choice, including the fact that the world's finest Rugby player, Antoine Dupont, is both an ambassador and a stakeholder. There are already over 3,000 users in the game's marketplace, and weekly transactions total over $30,000. The game is slated for release shortly, and the company is launching a token sale in the next few days to create the Rugby ecosystem token, which combines sports, gaming, and finance freshly and innovatively.</p>
<p class="s3">Fungiball</p>
<p class="s3">Fungiball is a one-of-a-kind fantasy game developed on the Polygon blockchain by combining professional tennis with NFTs. In-game NFTs reflect the current market worth of real-world tennis players. Avatars may be customized by the user, given NFTs, and used in tournaments for prizes. In Fungiball, NFTs stand in for different tennis abilities, and their relative scarcity establishes their relative value.</p>
<p class="s3">In addition to providing a great gaming experience, Fungiball also includes a marketplace for NFT trading and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that encourages participation from the community in policymaking. Players participating in tournaments and challenges can win Ethereum, NFTs, and other unique prizes. Rareness is used to classify the NFTs that stand for different tennis abilities. There is a well-defined plan in place for the future of Fungiball and a solid staff, partnerships, and licensing back it. The initial auction of 48 NFTs will occur during the French Open in early June, and the game's release is scheduled for the end of the year.</p>
<p class="s3">&nbsp;In Brief</p>
<p class="s3">Cryptocurrency gaming has gone a long way and will likely keep expanding. In-game asset trading and monetization have been made safer and more transparent via blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Some of the most exciting potential areas for development and innovation in the crypto gaming business include play-to-earn games and virtual reality games. We may anticipate the release of ground-breaking new games that expand the gaming universe as the industry develops.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Well-established crypto projects have become sluggish in terms of growth. Therefore, investors are looking for young projects, like Tradecurve, which are setting new records.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Polygon (MATIC) and Chainlink (LINK) have worked on improving their ecosystem, their value has been in the red zone. Therefore, holders of MATIC and LINK have started to shed their tokens to add TCRV to their investment portfolio.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) Joins Hands With De.Fi</p>
<p>To protect its ecosystems from issues like smart contract vulnerabilities, phishing, blind signing, and others, Polygon (MATIC) has collaborated with De.Fi. Under this partnership, Polygon (MATIC) will integrate De.Fi&rsquo;s antivirus into its ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The antivirus will include tools like De.Fi Shield, which will scan smart contract approvals, and downloaded files in the Polygon (MATIC) ecosystem. It will also enable Polygon (MATIC) users to assess the security of non-fungible tokens, or staking vaults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The price of Polygon (MATIC) has responded positively to the news. Polygon (MATIC) has risen by more than 1% on the weekly price chart. Currently, Polygon (MATIC) is available to trade at $0.86.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Coinbase Cloud Joins Chainlink (LINK)</p>
<p>Chainlink&rsquo;s (LINK) ecosystem has been expanding, and Coinbase Cloud is a new player to join it. Chainlink (LINK) has been working on improving its network efficiency to attract more users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is necessary as Chainlink (LINK) has been plummeting on the price charts for quite some time. The market value of Chainlink has dropped by 11% in the past month, and LINK is currently trading at $6.30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement by Chainlink (LINK), Coinbase Cloud will become a node operator on its system. Under this collaboration, Coinbase Cloud will use its infrastructure to strengthen the security of Chainlink&rsquo;s (LINK) oracle network. Chainlink (LINK) has big names on its roster of node operators, including Associated Press, Deutsche Telekom, and Swisscom.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve Wins Market Trust With Its Growth Potential</p>
<p>Currently, there are about 600 crypto exchanges, and the number of users is expected to increase from 420 million (2022) to more than 994 million by 2027. Thus, crypto exchanges can witness a surge in their adoption over the coming years. But one platform that is set to attract the most number of traders is the newly launched Tradecurve.</p>
<p>Earlier, traders had to create multiple accounts on different platforms to trade derivatives. However, on Tradecurve, users can trade cryptocurrencies, indices, Forex, CFDs, Options, and other derivatives with a single account. Therefore, it is destined to become one of the top three global trading exchanges.</p>
<p>Besides, existing trading exchanges, such as Binance and Bittrex have been caught up in intense legal scrutiny. Hence, traders are opting for Tradecurve for a safe and stable trading experience. TCRV will power the ecosystem, and its holders will get bonuses, discounts, and exclusive rewards. They can also earn rewards by staking their tokens to the platform&rsquo;s liquidity pool, which will be locked for two years.</p>
<p>The platform is moving towards raising $20 million during the presale phase, which is significantly higher than the ICO of Binance. A TCRV token is currently available for $0.015, and is expected to soar by 50x during the presale.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In what is looking like an upturn in the crypto market, some notable tokens have begun rallying in price. Some of such tokens are polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (AVAX).</p>
<p>More notably, Sparklo has also consolidated its position in the crypto market recently, prompting analysts to advise investors to prioritize Sparklo ahead of Polygon (MATIC) and Avalanche (AVAX) as it is a more viable investment option with more room for growth.</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) takes the market by storm&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only a few ardent investors may claim not to know about the waves and high potential that Sparklo has shown in the crypto market since its presale was announced weeks ago. This is following a sustained and steady momentum that Sparklo has, which is prompting more investors to join the project. Ahead of its imminent launch, Sparklo is geared to become the first innovative blockchain investment platform where members can buy, sell or own solid mineral assets like Silver, Gold and Platinum. These assets can be traded using fractionalized NFTs as a representation of the assets.</p>
<p>Also, traders can buy the SPRK token now that it is at a relatively low but ever-growing price value. At the price of only $0.026 per SPRK token, investors can buy the Sparklo token and position themselves for the exponential growth that the token will undergo in the near future. Interestingly, a 50% bonus is up for grabs when investors make a substantial purchase of the SPRK tokens. The project is already in the second phase of the presale and the bonus will end soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interfi Network has backed the Sparklo project by passing its audit at pre-launch. Moreso, investors are assured of the safety of their assets as liquidity will be locked for 100 years thereby preventing an event of a rug pull. We believe that Sparklo is a promising investment opportunity that you should check out below.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>positive price action for Polygon (MATIC)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is an Ethereum-based platform for scaling and infrastructure development of multiple types of applications. Within the last 24 hours, Polygon (MATIC) saw a significant +3.73% upturn in price value. This pegs the price of Polygon (MATIC) at $0.88 as of press time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In recent news, Mangrove, a decentralized exchange (DEX) will be launching on the Polygon (MATIC) network by June. This move will see an addition of an innovative DeFi tool to the Polygon (MATIC) network and further strengthen the network in the world of blockchain transactions. Although Polygon (MATIC) is making a giant stride, we recommend that you invest in a more stable project like Sparklo, which experts have predicted that its value will rise by more than 2000% this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) announces the introduction of an AI-powered blockchain</p>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is a layer one and decentralized blockchain that validates transactions using smart contracts. Recently, the co-founder of the Avalanche (AVAX) network, Emin G&uuml;n Siree announced at the Avalanche (AVAX) Summit II 2023 that the network is proposing a blockchain that will be powered by AI. Emin also highlighted that the AI would make use of Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs) to read and parse smart contracts.</p>
<p>In the crypto market, the Avalanche (AVAX) token saw a +3.63% increase in price value within the last 24 hours. As a result, the price of Avalanche (AVAX) is $14.80 currently. The positive price action of Avalanche (AVAX) may be related to the recent announcement of introducing AI into the Avalanche network.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto bull market sputters into action one niche that looks strong right now is crypto AI.</p>
Bitcoin makes it possible
<p>Bitcoin has broken out of its slow grind to the downside, and positive price action saw the king of the cryptocurrencies correcting back to the upside from last Thursday, culminating in a strong green candle on Sunday that took bitcoin back above $28,000.</p>
<p>While bitcoin has been doing its part in regaining lost momentum for the crypto sector, a certain niche within crypto looks to be the one to lead the rest into the next crypto bull market - economic factors allowing.</p>
AI is a strong crypto niche
<p>This is the niche of artificial intelligence (AI). Obviously, in the traditional financial world outside of crypto, AI is just about the strongest narrative there is, with the likes of ChatGPT becoming even more powerful, and other competitors now coming into the AI field.</p>

<p>Matrix AI (MAN) put on nearly 1300% since mid November of 2022, and following a 76% correction it looks primed to move higher again.

<p>Artificial Liquid Intelligence (ALI) was another powerfully thrusting AI crypto and gains of 1230% were an excellent return for only five weeks.

			  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the crypto bull market sputters into action one niche that looks strong right now is crypto AI.</p>
Bitcoin makes it possible
<p>Bitcoin has broken out of its slow grind to the downside, and positive price action saw the king of the cryptocurrencies correcting back to the upside from last Thursday, culminating in a strong green candle on Sunday that took bitcoin back above $28,000.</p>
<p>While bitcoin has been doing its part in regaining lost momentum for the crypto sector, a certain niche within crypto looks to be the one to lead the rest into the next crypto bull market - economic factors allowing.</p>
AI is a strong crypto niche
<p>This is the niche of artificial intelligence (AI). Obviously, in the traditional financial world outside of crypto, AI is just about the strongest narrative there is, with the likes of ChatGPT becoming even more powerful, and other competitors now coming into the AI field.</p>

			  <guid isPermaLink="false">https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/05/the-most-attractive-factors-of-dogemiyagi-avalanche-and-cardano</guid>
			  <description><![CDATA[<p>In a vast sea of diverse cryptocurrencies, each boasting distinct features and functionalities, it can be hard figuring out which ones are perfect for you. To those on the outside of the crypto community, it can seem like the only thing that matters about a coin is how much money it can make you - and while that is of course important, there are plenty of other things that every single crypto enthusiast looks for in these projects.</p>
<p>This article will talk about two top cryptos, Avalanche (AVAX) and Cardano (ADA), and what aspects they offer that attracted their user bases. Also, what type of users could be attracted to DogeMiyagi (MIYAGI), an exciting new meme coin project that's currently in presale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Cardano And Avalanche Are Straight Business</p>
<p>Both Cardano and Avalanche are very similar projects in many ways, so it makes sense to compare them as they undoubtedly have similar - if not the same - user bases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are Ethereum inspired blockchain networks that support tokens using less bloated, faster and more environmentally-friendly tech than many of the other competition on the market. Both built using PoS consensuses that allow them to offer these services without any catches, all while remaining affordable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The biggest difference between them is their intended usages. Whereas they both benefit from their aforementioned aspects, Avalanche is more focused on transaction speeds overall. Cardano on the other hand is driven by innovation, focusing on the development and creation of new tokens and other decentralized applications. With that being said, Avalanche can still be used for that too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When considering everything mentioned above, it&rsquo;s clear what type of crypto enthusiast is attracted to these projects: the serious kind that is completely focused on the growth and improvement of the industry for everyone rather than just their own personal profit.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>DogeMiyagi Is All About Fun</p>
<p>When you look at DogeMiyagi purely from the perspective of it being a meme coin, its quite easy to guess who the project will attract the most. Those crypto enthusiasts who find more enjoyment in the market when it isn&rsquo;t taking itself too seriously and all about crazy and exciting moves! The r/wallstreetbet users, the Elon Musk fans, the ones who helped blow the trend up in the first place.</p>
<p>But DogeMiyagi is actually more than just that! The platform that hosts the meme coin is all about community. It plans to establish a place where users can come to discuss current events in the crypto world while at the same time creating and sharing their own memes; all while earning through plenty of incentives. DogeMiyagi will also jump into the NFT space, creating its own secret club where users can buy the exclusive NFTs and a marketplace to trade them on.</p>
<p>Something else worth mentioning is that the project will become 100% community driven upon launch, meaning that users can personally take part in its evolution towards becoming the ultimate meme coin and platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DogeMiyagi will likely be perfect for users who both enjoy having fun but also want to have a tight knit community with a real sense of belonging, where you can make friends, get advice and develop both lasting relationships and investments in crypto.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know what type of users are most likely to gravitate towards different cryptos and what these cryptos do to attract them in the first place. Each one of these three are great investments to make regardless of what you&rsquo;re searching for though! DogeMiyagi is especially interesting at the moment because of its presale, which is selling out fast already!</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Hong Kong police force has launched a new platform to promote crime prevention in the metaverse. </p>
<p>The cybersecurity arm of the Hong Kong Police Force launched a platform to promote crime prevention in the metaverse. Dubbed &ldquo;CyberDefender,&rdquo; the platform aims to educate the public about the potential dangers emanating from the Web3 and metaverse space.</p>
<p>In a May 27 statement, the Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) of the Hong Kong Police Force warned that &ldquo;all crimes in the cyberspace could also happen in the metaverse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It added the platform is designed to prepare users for the &ldquo;challenges ahead in the digital age.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Ip Cheuk-yu of the CSTCB spoke at the event where CyberDefender was launched and where he discussed the dangers of the digital space.</p>
<p>He said:</p>

<p>The decentralized nature of virtual assets in Web3 may also increase the likelihood of cyber criminals targeting end point devices, virtual asset wallets and smart contracts.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector specifically referenced fraud, hacking, theft, and sexual offences, which can all occur in the metaverse, BeInCrypto reports.</p>
Virtual Asset-Related Crimes Cost Victims $1.7 Billion in 2022
<p>In the press statement, the Hong Kong police outlined what virtual asset-related crimes cost victims in 2022. 2336 virtual asset-related crimes were reported costing victims a total of $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Virtual asset-related crimes are also increasing significantly, with 663 such crimes reported in Q1 2023. Losses amounted to $570, representing a 75% increase compared to Q1 2022.</p>
<p>The police force said its educational initiative would specifically raise awareness among &ldquo;the younger generation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Police will continue to organize public educational initiatives on different themes through the &lsquo;CyberDefender Metaverse&rsquo; platform, raise the awareness among teenagers regarding the latest advancements in information technology, potential pitfalls and the importance of preventing technology crimes.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Balinese authorities said they would crack down on foreign tourists who pay for products and services using cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Tech in Asia reports the Bali Provincial Government threatened to impose strict sanctions on tourists and businesspeople who use cryptocurrencies for payments. Authorities decided to take action after a local news publication, Kompas, found tourists had been paying for services such as motorbike rentals, meditation practices, and meals using cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, digital assets are officially recognised as tradeable commodities on future exchanges but cannot be used as a payment method.</p>
<p>Bali Governor Wayan Koster spoke at a press conference on Sunday, where he warned foreign tourists of using crypto assets as a means of payment.</p>
<p>Koster said:</p>

<p>Foreign tourists who behave inappropriately, carry out activities that are not in accordance with visa permits, use crypto as a means of payment transactions, and violate other provisions will be dealt with strictly according to laws and regulations.</p>

<p>The Governor said individuals contravening the laws would be dealt with in terms of a 2023 law which states that individuals found conducting foreign exchanges without a necessary permit may be subject to one to five years in prison and a fine of 50 million ($3,300) to 22 billion rupiahs ($1.4 million).</p>
<p>Oversight of the crypto industry in Indonesia is governed by the Indonesia Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency, also known as Bappebti.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Arbitrum-based Jimbos Protocol has become the latest decentralized finance (DeFi) project to fall victim to a hack, resulting in the hacker stealing a significant amount of funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hack, targeting Version 2 of the Jimbos Protocol, resulted in a loss of $7.3 million.&nbsp;</p>
The Latest Hack to Rock DeFi&nbsp;
<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem continues to be a prime target for hackers, with the hack of the Jimbos Protocol the latest to occur. The protocol was hacked on the 28th of May, 2023, resulting in the loss of around 4000 ETH, worth around $7.3 million, according to data sourced from PeckShield. PeckShield posted an update regarding the hack on their Twitter handle, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears today&rsquo;s @jimbosprotocol hack leads to the 4090 ETH loss (w/ ~$7.5M). This hack is due to the lack of slippage control of liquidity-shifting operation -- such that the protocol-owned liquidity is invested into a skewed/imbalanced price range, which is exploited in a reverse swap for profit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Security analysts blamed the hack on a lack of slippage controls in the primary contract. This allowed the hacker to take out a flash loan, manipulate the price of the protocol&rsquo;s native token and steal the treasury funds. The protocol intended to issue a semi-stable token backed by a basket of crypto tokens. However, it seems like the protocol&rsquo;s mechanisms were not adequately developed, leading to a vulnerability that hackers exploited. As a result of the attack, the value of the protocol&rsquo;s native JIMBO token has dropped by 40%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flash loans have become a popular mode for hackers to steal funds on DeFi systems. These loans enable traders to borrow unsecured funds from lenders. However, they do not require any collateral because the smart contract considers the transaction complete only once the borrower repays the lender. Any borrower defaulting on the flash loan would cancel the transaction and return the funds to the lender.</p>
Jimbos Protocol Trying To Recover Funds&nbsp;
<p>Developers working with the protocol are exploring the best way forward and are working with the same security researchers that helped Euler Finance recover $200 million following their exploit. Furthermore, the team also added that they would contact the authorities by Monday if the attacker failed to return the stolen funds. The protocol shared an update on Twitter, stating,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick update: We are already working with multiple security researchers and on-chain analysts who helped with both the Euler Finance and Sentiment exploits. We will start working with law enforcement agencies tomorrow by 4 PM UTC if this isn&rsquo;t sorted out by then.&rdquo;</p>

DeFi&rsquo;s Hacker Problem&nbsp;
<p>The DeFi ecosystem has been plagued by hacking incidents, and while there has been a notable decline, the ecosystem continues to deal with the challenge of safeguarding vulnerabilities and restricting unauthorized access. This is despite constant efforts to enhance security measures governing the ecosystem. One recent flash loan attack targeted the 0VIX protocol, leading to the loss of nearly $2 million. Tornado Cash, a prominent privacy-focused protocol, also fell victim to a hack when unknown attackers compromised the protocol and accessed a significant number of TORN tokens. This led to considerable losses for the protocol.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Binance announced it created a cryptocurrency trading platform for Japanese residents set to launch this summer. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the launch of a crypto trading platform for Japanese residents. The world&rsquo;s largest crypto exchange said the platform would fully comply with Japanese crypto regulations.</p>
<p>Binance said:</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that we have created a new platform for residents in Japan in order to fully comply with local regulations.</p>

<p>Adding,</p>

<p>The new platform will be available this summer. We will inform the launch date and provide further details in the coming months.</p>

Binance Will Suspend Use of its Global Platform to Japanese Residents
<p>As part of the transition to Binance Japan, the exchange announced it would discontinue its crypto services for Japanese residents through its global platform by November 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The exchange further announced that users of its global platform would be able to move over to its new platform, which will be available after August 1, 2023:</p>

<p>Users of the global platform will be able to migrate to the new local platform through a new identity verification process (KYC), which will be available after August 1, 2023.</p>

Japan&rsquo;s Stance On Digital Assets and Blockchain Technology
<p>The Japanese government published a white paper in September 2022, which has since been approved, discussing implementing blockchain technology and CBDCs into its existing governance and technological frameworks.</p>
<p>The country has been embracing crypto rapidly, and as a result, several Japanese firms, including Toyota, Sony and NTT, have expressed a desire to embark on &ldquo;various decentralized offerings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Japan proved itself to be a significant player in the global crypto market and, as such, needs to address potential risks associated with the industry.</p>
<p>Most recently, the government announced it would enforce strict new AML measures across the crypto industry, set to take force from June 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Japan, as a member state of the G7, will further enforce the implementation of the &ldquo;Travel Rule&rsquo; established by the international financial watchdog, Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The &ldquo;Travel Rule,&rdquo; extensively discussed at the recent G7 summit hosted in Japan, requires financial institutions processing crypto transfers over $3,000 to disclose customer information with the recipient exchange or institution.</p>
<p>Japan&rsquo;s new regulatory framework further requires crypto exchanges registered in the country to verify customer identity and maintain detailed transaction records in line with AML standards.</p>
<p>The country&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) will oversee compliance with the new framework.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The utility token revolution is in full swing, led by trailblazing projects like Collateral Network (COLT), Quant (QNT), and Binance (BNB). As Collateral Network (COLT) enters its presale phase, early investors have a unique opportunity to join this disruptive project, set to reach 3500% gains before the presale ends. Let's examine the innovative features and real-world applications of these tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Collateral Network (COLT) to Reach 3500% Gains</p>
<p>Imagine a global lending system powered by blockchain technology that removes the need for banks and traditional financial institutions. Welcome to Collateral Network, a digital platform that offers a fresh and exciting take on the lending process.</p>
<p>In the world of Collateral Network, borrowers can use their valuable physical assets &mdash; think high-end watches, classic cars, and even pieces of fine art &mdash; as collateral for loans. The really cool part? These assets are turned into digital versions of themselves, known as NFTs or non-fungible tokens, which represent the value and uniqueness of each item.</p>
<p>Collateral Network takes it a step further by fractionating these NFTs, making it possible for many lenders to invest in a single loan, essentially crowdlending liquidity. This opens up the lending process to a global pool of lenders, potentially changing the game for borrowers everywhere. Lenders, in return, receive a passive income for the lent funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to utility tokens, Collateral Network is setting the standard. Holders of COLT are able to access powerful features, including:</p>
<p>&bull; Rewards for providing liquidity to the network</p>
<p>&bull; Access to new NFTs on the marketplace</p>
<p>&bull; Reduced marketplace fees</p>
<p>&bull; The best borrowing rates</p>
<p>Given the size of the global lending market, estimated to be around $4.5 trillion, the potential for Collateral Network to cause a major stir is substantial. With predictions suggesting the platform's market cap could reach into the billions, the current token price of $0.014 could offer an attractive entry point for investors looking to ride the wave of this groundbreaking lending platform. Experts are predicting that by the end of the presale, the token will reach $0.35, increasing by 3500% from its original price of $0.001. Furthermore, once it hits major exchanges, the token is set to surge by a further 100x.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Quant (QNT) Keeps its Bullish Momentum</p>
<p>Quant, the native token of the Quant Network, plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between blockchains. Its flagship product, Quant Overledger, is a multichain interoperability platform that connects and facilitates the movement of data between different data structures.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to use Quant Overledger must hold QNT tokens to access the platform's resources, and this high demand resulted in the token's price shooting up from $42 to $230 in 2022 when other altcoins suffered significant losses.</p>
<p>As the Quant Network gains popularity and attracts more developers and enterprises, the demand for the Quant token is expected to increase, positively impacting its price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analysts note that Quant is moving within a large Symmetrical Triangle on the daily timeframe. So, $100 is the support level, and a break above the resistance could lead to more gains in the near future.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY COLT TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Binance (BNB) Set to Increase Further</p>
<p>Binance Coin, the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, has carved out a significant place in the digital currency world due to its multifaceted utility. As one of the world's most renowned cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance offers over 170 coins and tokens for trading, with Binance Coin playing a pivotal role within its ecosystem.</p>
<p>Binance Coin offers tangible advantages to its holders, especially for those who frequently use the Binance platform. Primarily, Binance Coin is used to gain fee discounts when using it, but it also acts as fuel for the Binance Launchpad and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).</p>
<p>With so much utility, analysts foresee Binance (BNB) Coin continuing to move higher from the current price of $310 to $680 by the end of 2024 &mdash; not the largest of gains, but it still offers reliable value in the market.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s evident that the current dip the crypto ecosystem is going through is one of the worst ever, second only to the crash that happened a few years ago. Tokens like Polkadot (DOT) and Litecoin (LTC) that showed promise just a few months ago have all but fallen to their all-time lows. Due to this, investors have set their sights on the young upstart, Degrain (DGRN). This article examines why so many are bullish on the new token, even at the expense of OG coins like Polkadot (DOT) and Litecoin (LTC).</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) may not get to $100 until 2028</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) defines itself as an open-source sharded multichain protocol that connects and secures a network of specialized blockchains, facilitating the cross-chain transfer of tokens and other assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this way, Polkadot (DOT) enables different blockchains to be interoperable with each other, which is why it is called the internet of blockchains, i.e, Web3. Polkadot (DOT) has fallen more than 82% lower than its all-time high, but analysts have said that it may rally to $20 and above later this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compared to the Polkadot (DOT) token&rsquo;s all-time high of $55, $20 seems barely enough. That price will reportedly go to $100 in a couple of years, but investors may not be willing to wait that long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) investors may be diverting liquidity to Uwerx (WERX) presale</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) has been active in the ecosystem for nine years and has remained relevant. Litecoin (LTC ) is the native token of the blockchain, and at the moment, it is ranked among the top tokens as far as the market cap is concerned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, there have been complaints that Litecoin (LTC) is losing its grip because it lacks many of what new projects have - a strong brand, influential connection, or quirkiness. Litecoin (LTC) can only boast about its strong technical foundation, but analysts think the token value and market cap will rise in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all investors can afford to tie up liquidity when there&rsquo;s a potential better play out there. Right now, there&rsquo;s a buzz about a new token named Degrain (DGRN), and Litecoin (LTC) investors are jumping ship.</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) A Star Contender for Blue-Chip Crypto Status</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to launch the first decentralized freelance marketplace - the project&rsquo;s goal is to connect employers and freelancers without the high fees charged by industry leaders such as Upwork and Fiverr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is expected to attract millions of workers - industry experts predict that Uwerx could become a cornerstone of the freelance in 2024. In addition to the lower fees that blockchain brings about, Uwerx will play host to numerous other features such as a incentive-based rewards system, a premium feature system where tokens can be used to unlock premium features and the opportunity for users to earn tokens by staking their existing tokens on the platform. The WERX token will also act as the medium by which goods and services are exchanged which will foster active participation on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is poised to take a large bite out of an industry that is predicted to be worth close to $500 billion. Investors have shown great interest and confidence in the project and the presale is running strong. With liquidity locked in for 25 years after and audit approval already being granted, Uwerx is most likely to be the hottest contender for a cryptocurrency that will see the most growth within the next year. Get in now at $0.0315 as Uwerx is on it&rsquo;s final stage; most likely at this point, the purchase bonus of 20% will also see a decrease.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all investors can afford to tie up liquidity when there&rsquo;s a potential better play out there. Right now, there&rsquo;s a buzz about a new token named Degrain (DGRN), and Litecoin (LTC) investors are jumping ship.</p>
<p>Uwerx (WERX) A Star Contender for Blue-Chip Crypto Status</p>
<p>Uwerx aims to launch the first decentralized freelance marketplace - the project&rsquo;s goal is to connect employers and freelancers without the high fees charged by industry leaders such as Upwork and Fiverr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is expected to attract millions of workers - industry experts predict that Uwerx could become a cornerstone of the freelance in 2024. In addition to the lower fees that blockchain brings about, Uwerx will play host to numerous other features such as a incentive-based rewards system, a premium feature system where tokens can be used to unlock premium features and the opportunity for users to earn tokens by staking their existing tokens on the platform. The WERX token will also act as the medium by which goods and services are exchanged which will foster active participation on the platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uwerx is poised to take a large bite out of an industry that is predicted to be worth close to $500 billion. Investors have shown great interest and confidence in the project and the presale is running strong. With liquidity locked in for 25 years after and audit approval already being granted, Uwerx is most likely to be the hottest contender for a cryptocurrency that will see the most growth within the next year. Get in now at $0.0315 as Uwerx is on it&rsquo;s final stage; most likely at this point, the purchase bonus of 20% will also see a decrease.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Recently, the Ethereum (ETH) price has fluctuated quite a bit. New data suggests its value could stay below $1,900 for a while. While this may come as disappointing news for some investors, it's essential to understand the various factors contributing to it. Today, we will look at those factors while also focusing on Tradecurve (TCRV), as its presale is expected to see another 25% increase in the next seven days.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Register For The Tradecurve Presale&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) remains pegged below $1,900</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has been unable to break through the $1,900 level in the last two weeks. And if we look at the previous price jump, which occurred on May 6 as Ethereum reached $2,000, this fall seems concerning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investor interest has likely decreased because of the $8.80 average transaction price on the Ethereum network, but the global financial situation has also had an impact. On May 22, Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, said it is hard to foresee how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which aims to reduce inflation, will turn out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, there aren't many active addresses interacting with Ethereum decentralized apps. The number of active addresses decreased by 12% in the past month for the top 12 decentralized apps operating on the Ethereum network, potentially due to investor dissatisfaction with the high transaction prices of Ethereum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This data shows us that Ethereum will likely stay below $1,900 for the foreseeable future as it trades hands at $1,783.11 with a market cap of $214B, down 1.83% in the last day alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV) presale value to soar soon&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Ethereum is struggling as it slowly loses investor appeal, the Tradecurve (TCRV) presale displays a stellar performance. It has already jumped by 20% from its starting price of $0.01, and more price hikes are expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This project has enamored traders as it could disrupt the online trading market since it will allow all derivatives to be traded on a single account while using cryptocurrency as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Ethereum-based hybrid trading platform will have privacy and anonymity at the forefront as it will forgo the sign-up KYC requirements that traditional trading platforms such as eToro and Robinhood employ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traders from all over the globe may sign up for Tradecurve using an email only and just connecting a crypto wallet to the account - ensuring an utterly private trading environment where they can operate anonymously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users may subscribe to the Tradecurve automated trading &amp; artificial intelligence (AI) bots with a proven track record that will help them on their trading path. Or, those just beginning may utilize the copy trading feature, which allows users to replicate what experienced traders are doing (for a subscription fee).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Obtaining discounts on these subscriptions can be done by purchasing the utility token of Tradecurve, TCRV, which now has a value of just $0.012. But the presale is now in Stage 2, and price increases occur frequently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next week, for instance, a 25% increase will appear as the value will jump to $0.015. Since demand is high, with millions of tokens sold already, experts predict that TCRV will see a 50x increase as the presale continues advancing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a projected raise of $20M during its presale, Tradecurve will have a grand launch as its utility token may get listed on Uniswap or a major Tier-1 CEX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to this, a 100x increase can also be seen for TCRV after its launch. Those interested in backing this future top 3 global exchange can sign up for its presale below.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>As the year unfolds, the cryptocurrency landscape is due for a new cryptocurrency to make its mark among the most popular cryptocurrencies. InQubeta (QUBE) is a rising star that has received a lot of attention and shows immense potential for explosive growth.</p>
<p>InQubeta has set its sights on joining the ranks of established giants, moving in the same direction as Polygon (MATIC) and Ripple (XRP) by the end of this year. While these projects have already proven their worth, InQubeta's unique features and innovative approach have piqued the curiosity of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike.</p>
<p>In this article, we will delve into the compelling reasons why InQubeta has the potential to rank among the most famous cryptocurrencies by the end of 2023.</p>
<p>InQubeta (QUBE) Is A Great Investment For 2023</p>
<p>InQubeta represents a revolutionary force in the cryptocurrency industry with its innovative approach to DeFi and equity-based NFTs linked to AI start-ups. This unique combination provides users with constant profits while setting InQubeta apart from its competitors.</p>
<p>As the popularity of InQubeta continues to grow, investors and analysts are becoming increasingly optimistic about the DeFi project. Many predict that the token could rank among the most popular cryptos in 2023, and they believe that its trajectory could lead to even greater heights in the coming years. QUBE is bound for continued success with its well-positioned growth strategy and strong market reception.</p>
<p>The ongoing crypto ICO of InQubeta is well underway, with the token currently available at $0.007 per token. In just a month, the presale price will increase to $0.0087, providing early adopters a 24% return on investment. This robust performance in the crypto ICO phase further reinforces investor confidence in the platform and signals its growth potential to join the most popular cryptos in 2023. After InQubeta launches, it plans to execute cross-chain expansion, increasing the transfer of the QUBE across multiple blockchain networks. This will increase adoption and boost the overall value of the DeFi coin.</p>
<p>InQubeta has ambitious expansion plans. The DeFi project aims to establish its own native NFT marketplace and secure listings on various decentralized exchanges (DEXs), such as Coin Gecko and CoinMarketCap. By addressing pain points in traditional investment and offering long-term investment opportunities, InQubeta is one of the most credible cryptos with high growth potential and is emerging as a prominent player in the crypto space.</p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC) Connects Different Blockchains&nbsp;</p>
<p>Polygon (MATIC) is a blockchain solution for Ethereum. It solves the scalability problems of Ethereum and makes transactions quicker and less expensive. With many decentralized applications (dApps) switching to the platform last year, Polygon has experienced substantial growth.</p>
<p>By the end of 2023, Polygon's price will reach $2.37, according to DigitalCoinPrice. The price projection for MATIC by WalletInvestor, which projects $1.74 by the end of 2023, is more reasonable.</p>
<p>Ripple (XRP) Is A Fast And Reliable Cross-Border Payment Option</p>
<p>Ripple (XRP) is a digital currency on the Ripple blockchain platform. By delivering quick transactions, the platform hopes to transform the payment sector. The value of Ripple comes from its capacity to settle cross-border payments in seconds, as opposed to the days it takes other payment systems.</p>
<p>Although the forecasted price of XRP has received conflicting reviews, most analysts are optimistic about its future. Going by the buy-the-dip strategy, the price of the DeFi coin has recently dropped by 22% from recent highs. Analysts still believe it could bounce back, so purchase it while it is affordable.</p>
<p>Final Thoughts</p>
<p>As we venture further into 2023, the cryptocurrency landscape is abuzz with excitement, fueled by the remarkable rise of InQubeta. With its ongoing presale and price delivery, InQubeta will join the ranks of the most credible cryptos alongside established giants like Polygon and Ripple.</p>
<p>While the journey to widespread adoption is undoubtedly challenging, the time has come for InQubeta to captivate the crypto world and showcase its full potential. As investors and enthusiasts eagerly watch its every move, the coming months promise to be transformative for this emerging star.</p>
