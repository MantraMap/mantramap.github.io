					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin price continues to fall, dragging the broader crypto market down with it. BTC is down 4.52% in the last 24 hours, while ETH is down 4.10%. With a current price of $26,289, Bitcoin records its lowest value since March 14 this year, when the price dipped as low as $26,544. Why Is Bitcoin And Crypto Down? As always, the reasons for the deep pullback of the Bitcoin price are complex. Remarkably, there was actually good news on Wednesday, May 10, as the CPI continued to fall causing the Bitcoin price to rise as high as $28,317. However, then fake news about an alleged sale of 9,800 BTC by the U.S. government shook the market. The Bitcoin price flash crashed as a result and has seemingly not been able to recover since. But this narrative is only half the story. A variety of other factors are currently weighing on the crypto market: the dollar index (DXY) is currently experiencing a bounce and was recently able to hold above the historically important support, the liquidity issue intensified once again with the departure of US market makers Jump and Jane Street, BTC formed a (supposed) head and shoulders pattern in the 1-day chart, the congestion of the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains and last but not least a lot of FUD (US government selling, Binance US and Grayscale). Related Reading: Whales Keep Buying Bitcoin, What They Might Know That You Don’t Not surprisingly, uncertainty in the Bitcoin and crypto market is currently quite high. The Dollar Index (DXY) is currently hovering above historically crucial support at 101.8. Since early April, DXY has already been suspiciously close to support, but has so far been able to fend off any attack from the bears. As Christopher Inks of Texas Wet Capital writes, the DXY saw another move higher yesterday (to 102.056) and is currently preventing a rally in risk assets: The $DXY rally is making longs difficult this morning. So, if you&#8217;re trying to get long on risk-off assets it&#8217;s best to wait and watch for a bit. Liquidity Issues, A Bearish Chart Pattern And FUD Another bitter blow to the crypto market on Tuesday was the news of Jump and Jane Street&#8217;s departure from the U.S. crypto market. The move by the two major market makers comes as a result of regulatory uncertainty in the US. As NewsBTC reported, liquidity has been a huge problem before, which could now get worse. Due to low liquidity, higher volatility is likely as larger buy and sell orders move the market faster. In addition, a (supposed) head and shoulders pattern on Bitcoin&#8217;s 1-day chart is currently causing fear among traders. The pattern may signal a crash to $25,000.

Although 300,000 transactions are still waiting for confirmation in the mempool, the problem is slowly easing.

Binance US caused a stir in the last few days because the Bitcoin price showed a high price premium. The reasons have been the subject of much speculation. Grayscale is currently being hotly debated because DCG supposedly owes bankrupt crypto lender Genesis Trading about $575 million in May, with the loans coming due next week. The rumor says that Grayscale may be selling something on Coinbase to cover the capital needed to repay the loan. At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $26,289, initially receiving support from the 100-day EMA. Featured image from iStock, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Justin Sun, the vocal crypto supporter and co-founder of Tron and chief executive officer (CEO) of BitTorrent, says he will begin actively trading meme coins like PEPE.  Justin Sun Eying Meme Coins In a tweet on May 11, Sun, known for being a crypto whale, actively holding and transferring colossal sums of coins in the past, said he would begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects straight from his public cryptocurrency address.  However, as a disclaimer, all profits will be donated to charity.  I&#39;ve decided to begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects through my public address. Please note, I will personally bear all potential losses from these trades, and any profits made will be donated entirely to charity. &#8212; H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) May 11, 2023 He also added that though he might decide to buy certain coins and get exposure to a promising meme coin project, the said coin or project, regardless of its potential, may not be listed on Huobi or Poloniex. These are some of the early and most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges listing hundreds of tokens that Sun occupies an influential executive seat. Related Reading: Why Justin Sun’s Stablecoin USDD Is Struggling To Maintain Its Dollar Peg It is still unclear which project Sun has an eye on. At the same time, it could not be determined which of his crypto addresses the co-founder will use when trading meme coins.  Although Sun might be the co-founder of Tron, he has not shied from engaging in other projects deployed on public networks like Ethereum and others. Tron Co-founder Warned By Binance Following a warning from Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest exchange by client count and trading volumes, Sun reversed a $56 million transfer he had made in early May. There were concerns that Sun was planning a token grab of SUI, the native currency of the Sui Network.  Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will &#34;take action against it&#34;. SMH. Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales. On the bright side, blockchains are transparent&#8230; https://t.co/8Xs1oXjfVd &#8212; CZ 🔶 Binance (@cz_binance) May 1, 2023 WhaleAlert flagged Sun’s bulk $56 million transfer in TUSD. Before Zhao said, Binance would take action if he block-bought SUI from the Binance Launchpool. The exchange clarified that it wanted a fair airdrop to include active retailers and not “just a few crypto whales.”  Through the Launchpool, users can stake their crypto assets like SUI, providing liquidity, before receiving staking rewards.  Sun later apologized for the huge transfer, saying it was in error. The real intention, he clarified, was in the market-making of TUSD, a stablecoin. The Tron founder said: Regrettably, some of our team members were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Justin Sun, the vocal crypto supporter and co-founder of Tron and chief executive officer (CEO) of BitTorrent, says he will begin actively trading meme coins like PEPE. </p>
<h2>Justin Sun Eying Meme Coins</h2>
<p>In a tweet on May 11, Sun, known for being a crypto whale, actively holding and transferring colossal sums of coins in the past, said he would begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects straight from his public cryptocurrency address. </p>
<p>However, as a disclaimer, all profits will be donated to charity. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;ve decided to begin actively trading meme coins and promising projects through my public address. Please note, I will personally bear all potential losses from these trades, and any profits made will be donated entirely to charity.</p>
<p>&mdash; H.E. Justin Sun 孙宇晨 (@justinsuntron) <a href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1656598894158159872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">May 11, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>He also added that though he might decide to buy certain coins and get exposure to a promising meme coin project, the said coin or project, regardless of its potential, may not be listed on Huobi or Poloniex. These are some of the early and most liquid cryptocurrency exchanges listing hundreds of tokens that Sun occupies an influential executive seat.</p>

<p>It is still unclear which project Sun has an eye on. At the same time, it could not be determined which of his crypto addresses the co-founder will use when trading meme coins. </p>
<p>Although Sun might be the co-founder of Tron, he has not shied from engaging in other projects deployed on public networks like Ethereum and others.</p>
<h2>Tron Co-founder Warned By Binance</h2>
<p>Following a warning from Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest exchange by client count and trading volumes, Sun reversed a $56 million transfer he had made in early May. There were concerns that Sun was planning a token grab of SUI, the native currency of the Sui Network. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will &quot;take action against it&quot;. SMH.</p>
<p>Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales.</p>
<p>On the bright side, blockchains are transparent&#8230; <a href="https://t.co/8Xs1oXjfVd" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/8Xs1oXjfVd</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CZ <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f536.png" alt="🔶" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Binance (@cz_binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1652949031524376579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">May 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>WhaleAlert flagged Sun’s bulk $56 million transfer in TUSD. Before Zhao said, Binance would take action if he block-bought SUI from the Binance Launchpool. The exchange clarified that it wanted a fair airdrop to include active retailers and not “just a few crypto whales.” </p>
<p>Through the Launchpool, users can stake their crypto assets like SUI, providing liquidity, before receiving staking rewards. </p>

<p>Sun later <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1652954970000617474" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">apologized</a> for the huge transfer, saying it was in error. The real intention, he clarified, was in the market-making of TUSD, a stablecoin. The Tron founder said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Regrettably, some of our team members were not fully aware of the intended purpose for these funds and inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns. Upon realizing this error, we immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund of the funds.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is not immediately clear how Sun will proceed in trading and how the community will react to his purchases once he starts picking out worthy meme coin projects. Even so, what’s clear is that his addresses, like those of other influential crypto founders like Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin, will be actively tracked and copied.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The frenzy around meme-based cryptocurrencies continues, with a new player stealing the headlines from PEPE coin. Milady is the latest entrant in this space, and its self-organized meme coin, LADYS, is based on an anime avatar non-fungible token (NFT) collection. In just 24 hours, the value of Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin surged by an astonishing 5,250% and reached a trading price of $0.0000001528. Related Reading: Winner Takes All: Bitcoin And DXY Compete For Global Financial Dominance Milady Crypto Holders Beware? However, The surge in the value of Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin has been accompanied by a concerning rumor. It has been suggested that wallets holding Milady coins will be placed on the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) blacklist. This list maintained by the US Treasury Department identifies individuals and organizations subject to economic sanctions and other restrictions. The reasons behind this rumor are unclear, and it is important to note that any official sources have not confirmed it. However, such a move by the US government could have serious implications for anyone holding Milady coins. Being placed on the OFAC blacklist could make it difficult for individuals to conduct financial transactions or access certain services. It is unclear why such sanctions would target Milady. While using cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes has been a concern for regulators, there is no evidence to suggest that Milady or its LADYS coin is being used for anything illegal. Additionally, the idea that wallets holding a particular cryptocurrency would be targeted for sanctions is unusual. Despite the concerning rumor that wallets holding Milady coins may be placed on the OFAC blacklist, the cryptocurrency continues to experience a powerful uptrend and post significant gains. Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin has surged by over 71.5% within the last 24 hours. Despite the rumors, this remarkable growth indicates that investors and traders still show confidence in the cryptocurrency. Will LADYS Coin Follow The Footsteps Of DOGE And SHIBA INU For 100x Growth? In the world of cryptocurrency, the rise of meme-based coins has been nothing short of phenomenal. Coins like DOGE and SHIBA INU have skyrocketed in value, delivering massive returns to early investors. Some wonder whether Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin could be the next big thing in the meme coin world. According to Crypto Koryo, a popular cryptocurrency analyst, Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin has followed the same formula as other successful meme coins. The project&#8217;s Twitter and Telegram accounts were created on May 6th, and just two days later, the LADYS token went live. On the same day, the project posted its first tweet. However, what caught Crypto Koryo&#8217;s attention was that Milady&#8217;s team quickly reached out to several big influencers on Twitter. These influencers, including GevCrypto, AlmiraCrypto, and GiveAwayHost, have a combined following of over 2 million people. While these followers may be fake or bought, they are still enough to give Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin visibility and exposure to a large audience. The success of meme coins like DOGE and SHIBA INU has shown that social media hype and speculation can drive massive price increases quickly. However, as Crypto Koryo points out, the future of Milady&#8217;s LADYS coin is far from certain. While the coin has grown significantly, it could just as easily crash and burn depending on various factors. Compared to its nearest competitor PEPE coin, LADYS coin is currently leading the meme coin frenzy. While Milady&#8217;s LADYS has experienced significant growth, PEPE coin has suffered a decline of over 28% since yesterday.

					<description><![CDATA[Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter and a big supporter of Dogecoin, the original meme coin, is stepping down as the CEO of the social media platform to focus on product development. He will act as the chief technology officer (CTO) of Twitter. Elon Musk Stepping Down As Twitter CEO In a Tweet on late May 11, the technology billionaire said Twitter has since hired a CEO whom she will take over in six weeks. Excited to announce that I’ve hired a new CEO for X/Twitter. She will be starting in ~6 weeks! My role will transition to being exec chair &#38; CTO, overseeing product, software &#38; sysops. &#8212; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 11, 2023 Meanwhile, DOGE, like the rest of the crypto market, is down 32% from its April 2023 peak and likely to slide even lower following this announcement. Related Reading: Dogecoin Limps In A Bearish Market: What Traders Should Watch Out For Musk is an ardent supporter of cryptocurrencies and has specifically expressed his admiration for DOGE, the meme token. In numerous instances, DOGE prices have rallied following comments from Musk, mostly posted on Twitter. Like most meme coins, some argue that DOGE has no fundamental value, with supporters keen on riding the coin&#8217;s bullish and bearish cycles. During the last bull cycle, DOGE rallied to over $0.70, peaking when Elon Musk appeared on Saturday Night Live (SNL) show saying he was the &#8220;Doge master.&#8221;  Over the past few months, DOGE has crashed by over 85%, slumping to $0.05 in Q4 2022. However, this didn&#8217;t prevent Elon Musk from tweeting about the project. In April, DOGE prices rocketed when Twitter, the company Musk presently leads, temporarily changed its logo to the Shiba Inu dog associated with the meme project.  In response, DOGE spiked, adding as much as $4 billion, surging from around $0.07 to $0.10. Musk said he delivered on his promise by temporarily replacing the blue bird logo representing Twitter with Shiba Inu.

Musk used his pedestal as World&#8217;s richest man to operate and manipulate the Dogecoin Pyramid Scheme for profit, exposure, and amusement.

					<description><![CDATA[Over the past few days, the price of Cardano has been in a downward trend. This has led to the strengthening of bearish sentiment. In the last 24 hours, ADA experienced a dip of approximately 4.2%. Over the past week, the altcoin depreciated by close to 10%. These price fluctuations have raised concerns about investors&#8217; interest in Cardano. The same is reflected in the low buying strength and accumulation observed on the charts. Cardano finds itself trapped within a range, lacking a clear price direction, gradually eroding buyer confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds From $27,100 After Spike In Bearish Sentiment The bears have gained strength, causing an important support level to be breached and subsequently transforming into a resistance level for the altcoin. For Cardano to regain its previous price ceiling, buyers must reenter the market. Furthermore, the broader market conditions, including Bitcoin&#8217;s consolidation around the $27,000 zone, have prevented many major altcoins, including Cardano, from surpassing their immediate resistance levels. For ADA to overcome its nearest resistance, it relies heavily on the market&#8217;s overall strength. There has been a decline in market capitalization, further emphasizing the increase in selling strength. Cardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, the price of ADA stood at $0.35, and it is approaching a significant local support level that has played a crucial role in the past. The closest support line is $0.34, while the overhead price ceiling is $0.36. The altcoin&#8217;s ability to reclaim the resistance level largely depends on the bulls&#8217; ability to defend the price above the immediate support level. If the current level experiences a decline, the coin is likely to first drop to $0.34, and if the selling pressure persists, it may further decline to $0.33. It&#8217;s worth noting that the volume of Cardano traded during the last session has decreased, indicating a decline in buying strength. Technical Analysis Since ADA dropped below the $0.38 price level, its buying strength has failed to rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the 40-mark, indicating that ADA is nearing oversold territory on the daily chart. Furthermore, the asset&#8217;s price has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which suggests that sellers have taken control of the market&#8217;s price momentum. ADA has generated sell signals based on various indicators, suggesting a possible decline in price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which reveals price momentum and reversals, displayed red histograms associated with sell signals for the altcoin. Furthermore, the Directional Movement Index (DMI), responsible for indicating price direction, showed a negative trend with the -DI line (orange) positioned above the +DI line (blue). This implies a bearish sentiment in the market.

<p>At the time of writing, the price of ADA stood at $0.35, and it is approaching a significant local support level that has played a crucial role in the past.</p>
<p>The closest support line is $0.34, while the overhead price ceiling is $0.36. The altcoin&#8217;s ability to reclaim the resistance level largely depends on the bulls&#8217; ability to defend the price above the immediate support level.</p>
<p>If the current level experiences a decline, the coin is likely to first drop to $0.34, and if the selling pressure persists, it may further decline to $0.33. It&#8217;s worth noting that the volume of Cardano traded during the last session has decreased, indicating a decline in buying strength.</p>

<p>Since ADA dropped below the $0.38 price level, its buying strength has failed to rebound. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is below the 40-mark, indicating that ADA is nearing oversold territory on the daily chart.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the asset&#8217;s price has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average line, which suggests that sellers have taken control of the market&#8217;s price momentum.</p>

<p>ADA has generated sell signals based on various indicators, suggesting a possible decline in price. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, which reveals price momentum and reversals, displayed red histograms associated with sell signals for the altcoin.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Directional Movement Index (DMI), responsible for indicating price direction, showed a negative trend with the -DI line (orange) positioned above the +DI line (blue). This implies a bearish sentiment in the market.</p>

<p>The Average Directional Index (ADX) also attempted to move above the 20 mark. However, it indicates a lack of strength in the current price trend.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) and the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) have been battling for supremacy in the financial world, with both assets vying for dominance in a zero-sum game. The recent volatility seen in the markets is a testament to the intensity of this battle. It is becoming increasingly clear that the outcome of this showdown will have significant implications for both assets and the financial world. Related Reading: BONE Token Dominates India Exchange Poll, Outshining Rivals Like PEPE And FLOKI How Bitcoin Plans To Take On The Dollar According to JJ the Janitor, an analyst at Jarvis Labs, any decline in the dollar&#8217;s value is good for Bitcoin, and vice versa. This means that the two assets are competing for the same market share, and whichever one comes out on top will dictate the market&#8217;s direction for the rest of 2023. As JJ the Janitor notes, DXY has held above the crucial line of support at 100.80 since April 15. This has created market tension, as BTC and DXY have been consolidating in tightly compressed ranges. However, this month-long structure will break sooner or later, and both assets will enter into price discovery &#8211; one to the upside, the other to the downside. One notable thing about DXY, according to JJ the Janitor, is that since it peaked during March&#8217;s banking crisis, it has been unable to sustain any technical momentum. As a result, it has now registered six lower highs since March&#8217;s peak of 105.90, a strong confirmation that it is indeed stuck in a downtrend. For JJ,  if the dollar&#8217;s yearly low fails to hold upon retest, and if that failure sends DXY crashing below 100 without relief, it would create an ideal set-up for Bitcoin to make a series of higher highs this summer. This would be good news for BTC investors, who have eagerly anticipated a market breakout. Furthermore, The market structure of the DXY is beginning to resemble a pattern that Bitcoin displayed in the spring of 2022, according to JJ the Janitor. Moreover, JJ compared the current market structure of DXY to a chart pattern that BTC displayed last spring, which ultimately led to a collapse in the market. BTC Faces Risk Of Collapse Similar To Last Year&#8217;s Death Spiral? As JJ notes, just after the death spiral of LUNA and UST last year, Bitcoin appeared to be holding up surprisingly well while altcoins were collapsing. However, this resilience was short-lived, as BTC ultimately succumbed to a &#8220;head and shoulders&#8221; chart pattern and collapsed after the death spiral of LUNA caused CeFi exchanges like Celsius and BlockFi to go under. As seen above, DXY shows a similar head and shoulders pattern below resistance, which could signal a potentially disastrous outcome for the asset. This pattern is a bearish technical indicator that suggests a potential reversal of the current trend. However, there is a scenario in which the dollar could regain strength and spoil Bitcoin&#8217;s hope for new highs this summer. JJ the Janitor, suggests that if DXY were to move above the May high at 102.53 and then reconquer its 50-day and 100-day moving averages, it would be a clear signal for the market to go &#8220;risk-off.&#8221; This would be a sign of strength for the dollar and could result in Bitcoin crashing into another retest of its 200-day moving average. At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is hovering around $27,100, just below its 50-day moving average, indicating a notable decline of over 3.5% in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s market volatility has increased liquidations of both short and long positions, with Coinglass data indicating a peak of $174 million in the last 24 hours.

					<description><![CDATA[Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has shown significant weakness in today&#8217;s trading session after failing to continue on its instant price rally following yesterday&#8217;s release of the April CPI report at 4.9%. So far, the trading week has been negative for the alpha cryptocurrency as it is seen to decline further on its sixth consecutive bearish candle on the daily timeframe. In addition, the legendary crypto trader, Peter Brandt, has raised concerns and a sound warning about a potential bearish chart pattern formation which the alpha cryptocurrency is seen to complete on the daily timeframe. Will Bitcoin Bulls Yield To This Potential Bearish Chart Pattern Formation Earlier today, the legendary prop trader, Peter Brandt, identified a potential head and shoulders chart pattern forming for Bitcoin on the daily time frame.

A typical head and shoulders pattern could be seen on a price chart as a baseline with three peaks, where the highest peak (Head) is in the middle of two shoulders with lower peaks of almost the same heights. On establishing this definition, the head and shoulder pattern which is potentially forming for Bitcoin on the daily time frame indicates a bearish reversal of the asset as the second shoulder is seen to potentially form on the daily timeframe. If and when it forms successfully could mean a massive and continued decline in the price of the alpha cryptocurrency. The key areas surrounding the second shoulder formation are decisive levels for bulls and bears to gear into action. So unless Bitcoin bulls swing into action and save price, a successful formation of the second shoulder could occur, sending sell signal opportunities to crypto traders.

The market capitalization of the alpha cryptocurrency is also experiencing a 2.91% decline. However, the April Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, released yesterday, brought renewed hopes and positive sentiments back to the crypto markets as it stood at 4.9% lower than the expected 5.0%.

					<description><![CDATA[The Shiba Inu’s governance token, Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), will grab a new and prominent listing in India. BONE overtook PEPE and FLOKI, rising to the top in an exchange poll for the next crypto listing. Unocoin Poll Sees BONE At The Top A crypto exchange firm in India, Unocoin, recently conducted a poll on Twitter. The poll, which presented BONE, PEPE, and FLOKI tokens, sampled customers&#8217; feedback on the next coin for listing on the firm’s trading platform.

According to data, BONE is currently dominating the poll.  The Shiba Inu governance token shoved PEPE and FLOKI, with a wide gap accumulating about 84.7% of the total votes. Subsequently, PEPE has gathered just 7.2% of the votes while FLOKI crawls behind with 5.9% of the total votes. Given the open inclination of the customers to BONE, the crypto firm Unicoin may soon add the token to its trading platform. Once it happens, Unocoin will be the fourth crypto exchange in India to list BONE. The other exchanges are Surypto, Giottus, and FlitPay. Giottus crypto exchange announced the addition of BONE to its platform on May 10. The addition will see BONE traded as a pair with INR. Following the listing, Giottus also disclosed an exclusive giveaway contest to celebrate the addition of BONE.  This move aims to attract crypto enthusiasts, allowing them to win the prize of 2,000 INR. The contest is slated to end by 5 PM on May 15. 📢 New Listing Alert! 🚀 @Giottus is thrilled to announce the listing of $BONE on our platform, with trading starting today! 💥@Shibtoken Get ready to trade $BONE now on INR Pair#Giottus #BONE #Shibarium #ShibariumBETA #SHIBARMY #ShibaArmy #Shiba #Shiboshis #SHIB $BONE $SHIB… pic.twitter.com/3DQO7DXEBz &#8212; Giottus Crypto Platform (@giottus) May 10, 2023 To participate, the user will first join the Giottus social media.

					<description><![CDATA[The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has filed tax claims in the FTX bankruptcy as the defunct exchange’s creditors seek fund reimbursement. This recent report shows the IRS filed dues of $44 billion in taxes associated with FTX and its subsidiaries. The disclosure revealed the agency filed the tax bill under administrative claims, prioritizing them over the creditors&#8217; claims in the bankruptcy case.  Will Court Prioritize IRS Claims Over Creditors? A filing by the IRS claiming billions of dollars in tax owed by Alameda Research has been circulating online. The filing shows the IRS is claiming over $20.4 billion in unpaid partnership and payroll taxes from Alameda Research alone under administrative priority. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Blasts Above $28,000 Following 4.9% April CPI Report The IRS filed 45 claims worth $44 billion in unpaid taxes from the now-bankrupt FTX exchange and its sister companies. However, the tax filing category under administrative priority has drawn more attention than the amount after circulating the Internet. A section of the US Bankruptcy Code states that claims under administrative expenses receive priority distribution. That means administrative claims have the highest priority among creditor claims in a bankruptcy case.  The IRS tax bill under administrative claims means the court will likely consider them during funds distribution before other unsecured FTX creditors. However, the dispute is still in motion, and the court is yet to determine how the filing affects the situation. Nonetheless, the current situation sparked people’s curiosity. A partner at General Catalyst, Nick Van Eck, is curious about how to calculate the amount and where the funds will come from.  But while reactions across the internet continue to emerge, the IRS remained silent without providing any details regarding the matter.  FTX Closer To Repaying Creditors, Mulls Reopening Plans This development came after the news that FTX recovered $7.3 billion in assets, which was revealed by lawyers in an April 12 hearing at the Delaware bankruptcy court. FTT remains bearish l Source: Tradingview.comFurther investigations into the bankrupt exchange&#8217;s assets are still ongoing. However, the legal team disclosed that FTX may resume operations in Q2 of 2024.
