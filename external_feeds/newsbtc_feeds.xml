					<description><![CDATA[A recent development has caught the attention of on-chain analysts and Bitcoin enthusiasts alike. On-chain expert Axel Adler Jr, citing data from CryptoQuant, has revealed that wallets belonging to the &#8216;Humpback&#8217; cohort, have reached a new all-time high (ATH). This surge has raised speculation about the involvement of institutional giants such as BlackRock or Fidelity. Remarkably, not only humpback but also shrimps are currently displaying a historical high conviction. The Phenomenon Of Bitcoin Humpback Wallets The term &#8216;Humpback&#8217; refers to a specific cohort of wallets within the cryptocurrency ecosystem that hold an impressive amount of Bitcoin, surpassing the 5,000 BTC mark. The recent surge in these wallets reaching an ATH indicates a significant level of accumulation and activity within the crypto market. Related Reading: What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? Bulls Aren’t Running Out Of Steam Yet According to Axel Adler Jr, &#8220;The number of wallets in the &#8216;Humpback&#8217; cohort with a balance of over 5,000 BTC has shown a new ATH. Is this BlackRock, Fidelity, or other giants?&#8221; The mystery surrounding the identity of these major players has piqued curiosity and speculation about their motivations and impact on the market. From the on-chain data alone, it is not possible to determine which entity commenced the accumulation of BTC. However, the temporal connection with the ETF applications is striking. Regardless of the actual entity, a whale accumulation can be interpreted as a positive sign for the price. In this vein, expert Will Clemente recently stated: Even if Blackrock/Fidelity refile and the ETFs still get rejected by Gary, the cat is out of the bag &#8212; institutions want your Bitcoin and are looking to get a piece of this market. It is worth noting that Bitcoin&#8217;s whale &#38; shark addresses (different cohorts combined, wallets with 10 to 10,000 BTC) have continued to accumulate, with a big chunk of BTC buying coming in the last 2 weeks of June as news of ETF launches came out. On-chain-data provider Santiment tweeted on July 1 that the aforementioned cohorts have accumulated 154,500 BTC in the last week of June alone. &#8216;Shrimps&#8217; Show Crazy Conviction While the activity by Humpback wallets is astonishing another intriguing cohort known as the &#8216;Shrimps&#8217; has also come into focus. Lead analyst of Glassnode, Checkmate highlighted today the enthusiasm displayed by the Shrimp cohort in stacking sats (satoshi, the smallest unit of Bitcoin) at an astonishing rate. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could See Fresh “Liftoff” if It’s Able to Hold One Key Level He states, &#8220;Bitcoin Shrimp (&#60; 1 $BTC) are stacking sats at a rate of 33.8k $BTC per month. Issuance is ~27.0k $BTC/month. For every 1 new coin, Shrimp are taking 1.25 off the market. Crazy conviction on display.&#8221; The Shrimp cohort, consisting of smaller Bitcoin holders, showcases an incredible conviction and sustained buying behavior despite market fluctuations. As Checkmate points out, &#8220;The last time the little guy stacked this hard was 2017 ATH, buying the top. Five years later, they are stacking harder, faster, and in a more sustained manner, despite all the bullshit. Bullish.&#8221; The simultaneous rise of both the Humpback and Shrimp cohorts signifies a captivating dichotomy within the ecosystem. On one hand, the Humpback wallets, with their massive holdings, hint at the potential involvement of institutional giants like BlackRock or Fidelity. Their accumulation of Bitcoin could serve as a catalyst for increased adoption and market confidence. On the other hand, the resilience and conviction displayed by the Shrimp cohort highlight the broader appeal and democratization of BTC. Despite previous market downturns, the Shrimp class remains undeterred, stacking sats at an unprecedented pace and demonstrating unwavering belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin. At press time, the BTC price continued to hover below the $31,000 mark, trading at $30,728. Featured image from Thomas Kelley / Unsplash, chart from TradingView.com]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Lido (LDO), a prominent player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, has emerged as a frontrunner in the rapidly expanding Liquidity Staking Derivatives (LSD) sector.  Amidst the turbulence caused by the highly controversial lawsuit filed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June, the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has found itself in a state of uncertainty and caution. This legal battle has prompted many projects to reevaluate their strategies and has made investors more cautious in their approach. However, even in this challenging climate, the LSD space has managed to experience substantial growth and defy the odds. LSD Sector&#8217;s Dominance And Lido&#8217;s Remarkable Performance As per data from Messari, the LSD sector has demonstrated significant dominance in the cryptocurrency markets. One of the leading contributors to the sector&#8217;s expansion has been Lido, which has showcased impressive performance over recent months. SEC lawsuits against @BinanceUS and @Coinbase cause #DeFi TVL to plummet below $60B. But amidst the chaos, liquid staking protocols are thriving becoming DeFi&#8217;s dominating force by TVL. pic.twitter.com/RL9Qy8cwLE — Messari (@MessariCrypto) July 3, 2023 CoinGecko reports that currently, the price of Lido&#8217;s native token, LDO, stands at $2.16. While there has been a slight decline of 1.7% in the past 24 hours, the token has experienced a solid 15.7% increase in value during the last seven days. Source: Coingecko The surge in LDO&#8217;s price has also resulted in a noticeable increase in the MVRV ratio of the token. This signifies that a considerable number of addresses holding LDO have become profitable in the past few days, indicating a positive sentiment among investors and further fueling the success of Lido in the competitive DeFi landscape. Growth Amidst Concerns: Lido Declining APR Despite the notable growth and success witnessed by Lido, there has been a recent decline in the Annual Percentage Return (APR) offered by the platform. According to a recent LDO price report, his decline in APR over the past few days raises concerns about the attractiveness of using Lido for staking, potentially leading users to seek alternative options. Source: Dune Analytics The declining APR indicates that the rewards and returns generated from staking LDO tokens on the Lido platform have decreased. This development could discourage some users who prioritize maximizing their staking yields from continuing to use Lido. LDO market cap currently at $1.9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com As staking rewards play a crucial role in incentivizing users to participate in networks and secure their protocols, a sustained decline in APR might prompt individuals to explore alternative platforms that offer more competitive and potentially higher returns. Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor To maintain its position as a leading player in the LSD sector, Lido would need to address the declining APR and explore avenues to enhance the rewards offered to stakers, ensuring they remain competitive and appealing to their user base.

					<description><![CDATA[APT, the native token of the Aptos Network, is currently making market waves as it prepares for its upcoming token release in July. According to data by CoinMarketCap, APT has gained by 10.14% in the last 24 hours, emerging as part of the top gainers in today’s market.  Aptos Anticipates New Token Release According to data from the token tracker site Token Unlocks,  4.54 million APT tokens, valued at $36.94 million, are scheduled to be released on July 12. This upcoming token release will account for 2.17% of the total circulating supply.  For investors familiar with the APT market, this is quite normal, as the Aptos Network is programmed to unlock new tokens on the 12th of each month. These tokens are released to the Aptos Foundation as well as its user community to support ecosystem projects, provide grants, and push other community growth initiatives.  Related Reading: Coinbase Stock Soars Nearly 12% As BlackRock Reveals Surveillance Partnership However, while APT is currently gaining, the effects of token release on the market are unpredictable, as seen in previous times. In January, APT witnessed a jump of over 50% following the scheduled unlock but fell by 13% in February after the same event occurred. Following the launch of the Aptos Mainnet in October 2022, the total supply of APT tokens stood at 1 billion. Of this amount, data from Token Unlocks shows that 166.35 million APT tokens have been unlocked so far, representing only 17% of the total supply. APT Price Analysis On Saturday, October 19, 2022, the Aptos (APT) token made an impressive debut in the crypto market, reaching a market price of $100.  However, this was followed by a sharp downturn as the price plunged to the $3.5 level. Over the next three months, APT gradually recovered and climbed to the $20.00 price zone, where it was resisted.  Since then, the token has experienced an overall bearish trend losing over 58% of its value to date. APT Trading At $8.15 On The 1-Hour Chart &#124; Source: APTUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Looking at the APT hourly chart, the token’s current price movement suggests it has encountered a resistance zone at the price level of $8.33. If APT is able to break through this barrier, it will continue its bullish momentum and possibly trade as high as $8.82, which appears to be the next resistance zone.  Related Reading: USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>APT, the native token of the Aptos Network, is currently making market waves as it prepares for its upcoming token release in July. According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/" rel="nofollow">data by CoinMarketCap</a>, APT has gained by 10.14% in the last 24 hours, emerging as part of the top gainers in today’s market. </p>
<h2>Aptos Anticipates New Token Release</h2>
<p>According to<a href="https://token.unlocks.app/aptos" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> data from the token tracker site Token Unlocks</a>,  4.54 million APT tokens, valued at $36.94 million, are scheduled to be released on July 12. This upcoming token release will account for 2.17% of the total circulating supply. </p>
<p>For investors familiar with the APT market, this is quite normal, as the Aptos Network is programmed to unlock new tokens on the 12th of each month.</p>
<p>These tokens are released to the Aptos Foundation as well as its user community to support ecosystem projects, provide grants, and push other community growth initiatives. </p>

<p>However, while APT is currently gaining, the effects of token release on the market are unpredictable, as seen in previous times. In January, APT witnessed a jump of over 50% following the scheduled unlock but fell by 13% in February after the same event occurred.</p>
<p>Following the launch of the Aptos Mainnet in October 2022, the total supply of APT tokens stood at 1 billion. Of this amount, data from Token Unlocks shows that 166.35 million APT tokens have been unlocked so far, representing only 17% of the total supply.</p>
<h2>APT Price Analysis</h2>
<p>On Saturday, October 19, 2022, the Aptos (APT) token made an impressive debut in the crypto market, reaching a market price of $100. </p>
<p>However, this was followed by a sharp downturn as the price plunged to the $3.5 level. Over the next three months, APT gradually recovered and climbed to the $20.00 price zone, where it was resisted. </p>
<p>Since then, the token has experienced an overall bearish trend losing over 58% of its value to date.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/e2JfHdab/" alt="Aptos" width="1480" height="913"/></p>

<p>Looking at the APT hourly chart, the token’s current price movement suggests it has encountered a resistance zone at the price level of $8.33.</p>
<p>If APT is able to break through this barrier, it will continue its bullish momentum and possibly trade as high as $8.82, which appears to be the next resistance zone. </p>

<p>However, failure to push past the $8.33 price mark may induce a bearish trend with the possibility of the token falling to a market price of $7.14, which represents the next support level. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, APT is currently trading at $8.1556, with a 0.17% decrease in the last hour. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by $276 million, with a 137% gain. Aptos stands as the 33rd biggest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $2 billion. </p>

					<description><![CDATA[Stablecoins, the digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, have long been viewed as a potential bridge between the cryptocurrency world and the traditional financial industry. However, recent developments have cast a shadow of uncertainty over their perceived stability.  As global policymakers continue to grapple with concerns about the crypto sector&#8217;s impact on the established financial system, a surprising twist occurred when stress in the US banking industry reverberated throughout the stablecoin market.  According to Fitch Ratings, the tightening of financial conditions, culminating in the high-profile failures of several banks, notably including the collapse of the esteemed Silicon Valley Bank, had a profound impact on stablecoins.  Stablecoins: Market Shakeup For instance, Fitch Ratings reports that the market capitalization of USD Coin (USDC), a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio, experienced a sharp decline of over 25% in the first quarter. Although the coin&#8217;s value remains depressed, Fitch noted that it managed to recover its peg soon after.  Related Reading: Dwindling Optimism (OP) Value May Be A Result Of This Factor According to data from The Block, the total supply of stablecoins has decreased from $138 billion at the beginning of the year to $124 billion as of July 3. This decline in supply further underscores the challenges faced by stablecoins and their struggle to maintain stability amidst market turbulence. Chart: The Block Crypto Data “Significant volatility, shaken investor confidence, and temporary but sharp de-pegging occurred in the stablecoin market in March as shockwaves spread from traditional finance,” Fitch wrote. Tether Bucks Trend In contrast to USDC, Tether, another prominent stablecoin, observed a 12% increase in its market capitalization during the same period. Notably, Tether captured approximately 72% of USDC&#8217;s redemption volume, indicating a growing preference for Tether among investors.

From March to May 2023, these trading volumes decreased from $53 billion to $28 billion. This reduction signifies a decrease in activity within the stablecoin market, possibly driven by cautious investor sentiment in the face of ongoing market uncertainties. Bitcoin approaches the $31K territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com Fitch noted that efforts to regulate stablecoins have been unfolding at varying speeds in the United States and Europe, leading to notable differences in the reporting and transparency standards of these digital assets. The contrasting approaches taken by the two regions have resulted in distinct regulatory landscapes for stablecoins, causing direct consequences on their reporting and transparency practices.

					<description><![CDATA[After Bitcoin reached a new yearly high at $31,413, the buy side has so far failed to initiate a trend-following move north. Although the bulls fended off a sell-off last Friday in the wake of the SEC&#8217;s perceived concerns over a Bitcoin spot ETF approval, the momentum seems to be increasingly flattening, or isn&#8217;t it? What&#8217;s Next For The Bitcoin Price? As the market awaits an approval from the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), investors are seemingly exercising caution. While open interest in the Bitcoin futures market continues to rise, activity in the spot market has recently declined. This shift indicates that price action in recent days has been primarily influenced by futures traders. Analyst @52Skew noted on Twitter, &#8220;$BTC Spot CVDs &#38; Delta: Quite a bit of spot still being dumped on the market + no limit chasing today from coinbase buyers. Spot bid liquidity $30.5K.&#8221; Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Stampede: Bitfinex Report Points To Early Signs Of Bull Market This observation underscores the reluctance of investors in the spot market who may be waiting for a decisive move by the SEC. However, it should be noted that US markets were closed yesterday for the 4th of July holiday. Most recently, huge spot buying volume came from Coinbase, pushing the market up. So today will be interesting to watch if yesterday&#8217;s retracement is bought today by US investors. Bitcoin dominance, which had risen to resistance at 52.15%, has now consolidated somewhat, dropping to 51.25%. This consolidation, combined with the entry of investors into the altcoin sector, reinforces the prevailing wait-and-see attitude among investors. Analyzing the Bitcoin price, it is clear that the market is currently facing strong resistance in the $31,300 to $31,416 range. The support area at $30,700 is currently proving to be a critical mark to watch. Holding above this support could give buyers the opportunity to launch a renewed offense. If the Bitcoin price can break out dynamically above the year-to-date high, the next major chart hurdle awaits at $32,500. Yet, a temporary retracement to the support area at $29,800 could be acceptable to gain momentum for the next breakout attempt. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? So far, the bears have lacked follow-through. The sell side also failed in its attempt to sell off the BTC price in the higher time frames back below the psychologically important $30,000 level in recent days. The goal of the bears must be to push Bitcoin permanently below $29,800. Experts Remain Bullish For Now Renowned analyst Josh Rager believes the pullbacks won&#8217;t be as deep as many experts expect, suggesting that ETF approval, particularly from BlackRock, is a real possibility. He says, &#8220;Only an ETF rejection can cause pain, but I think BlackRock will be approved this time,&#8221; adding: The $24k, then up sentiment seems to be quite popular. I think people are overthinking it. Similar was said about Bitcoin needing to sweep $20k first. IMO, pullbacks won&#8217;t be this deep now and if we manage to see $25k again it won&#8217;t be until later on in the year after more upside before so. Similarly, NewsBTC lead analyst Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; believes in the bullish case for BTC in the near term. However, he stresses the importance of Bitcoin&#8217;s Relative Strength Index (RSI) entering overbought territory, as a failure to do so could indicate a lack of strong upside momentum: I want to see Bitcoin RSI push into overbought conditions by week end, or else I worry that this isn&#8217;t an impulse yet. We have a doji on the weekly, which signals indecision. We need to see follow through this week, or more correction becomes more probable w/ possible bear div.

					<description><![CDATA[Optimism (OP), a prominent Layer 2 network, is experiencing a noticeable decline in network activity as the hype surrounding meme coins takes a dip. Once bustling with vibrant transactions and a fervent community, Optimism now faces a subdued atmosphere as users shift their attention away from these speculative assets.  The decrease in meme coin fervor has had a direct impact on the overall engagement within the Optimism network, prompting questions about its long-term viability and adaptability in an ever-changing crypto landscape. Can the Layer 2 network adapt to evolving market trends and sustain its relevance in the face of shifting investor preferences? Declining OP Price And Network Activity Raise Concerns The price of OP on CoinGecko is currently at $1.29, indicating a 4.3% decline in the past 24 hours. However, despite this recent downturn, the coin has managed to sustain a seven-day rally of 1.5%, suggesting potential resilience and market support. Source: Coingecko Nevertheless, Optimism, the Layer 2 network housing decentralized exchanges (DEXes), has witnessed a significant decrease in daily on-chain transaction volume, leading to a concerning 59% decline over the past week. A new OP price report reveals a decline in network activity on the OP Mainnet since mid-June. The number of unique wallet addresses involved in daily on-chain transactions has exhibited a downward trend during this period. Related Reading: Litecoin $100 Milestone Indicates Promising Bullish Trends – Here’s Why As of July 2, there were 81,480 daily active addresses, representing a 45% decrease over the past three weeks. Source: Artemis These declining network activity figures raise questions about the future prospects of Optimism and its ability to attract and retain users in the face of changing market dynamics. Implications Of Waning Meme Coin Craze On Optimism Network The decline in network activity on Optimism can also be attributed to the waning craze surrounding meme coins, which have captivated the cryptocurrency market in recent months.  Meme coins, characterized by their humorous and often whimsical nature, gained immense popularity as investors sought quick and potentially lucrative investments. However, as the initial hype around meme coins fade, users are now shifting their attention towards other crypto assets, resulting in a noticeable decline in engagement on the Optimism network. OP market cap currently at $833 million. Chart: TradingView.com The implications of this shift in investor sentiment are significant for Optimism and its long-term viability. The network heavily relied on the surge of meme coin activity to drive transactions and foster a vibrant community. Can Optimism Win Back User Interest? With the decline in meme coin hype, Optimism now faces the challenge of retaining and attracting users who are seeking alternative avenues for potential gains.  Related Reading: USDC Circulating Supply Down 38% Since Jan. 1 – Will It Affect Price?

<p>Nevertheless, Optimism, the Layer 2 network housing decentralized exchanges (DEXes), has witnessed a significant decrease in daily on-chain transaction volume, leading to a concerning 59% decline over the past week.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://ambcrypto.com/optimisms-decline-fueled-by-waning-memecoin-craze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OP price report</a> reveals a decline in network activity on the OP Mainnet since mid-June. The number of unique wallet addresses involved in daily on-chain transactions has exhibited a downward trend during this period.</p>

<p>As of July 2, there were 81,480 daily active addresses, representing a 45% decrease over the past three weeks. </p>

<p>These declining network activity figures raise questions about the future prospects of Optimism and its ability to attract and retain users in the face of changing market dynamics.</p>
<h2><strong>Implications Of Waning Meme Coin Craze On Optimism Network</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://app.artemis.xyz/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">decline in network activity</a> on Optimism can also be attributed to the waning craze surrounding meme coins, which have captivated the cryptocurrency market in recent months. </p>
<p>Meme coins, characterized by their humorous and often whimsical nature, gained immense popularity as investors sought quick and potentially lucrative investments. </p>
<p>However, as the initial hype around meme coins fade, users are now shifting their attention towards other crypto assets, resulting in a noticeable decline in engagement on the Optimism network.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dyvBAqHW/" width="2315" height="1109"/></p>

<p>The implications of this shift in investor sentiment are significant for Optimism and its long-term viability. The network heavily relied on the surge of meme coin activity to drive transactions and foster a vibrant community.</p>
<strong>Can Optimism Win Back User Interest?</strong>
<p>With the decline in meme coin hype, Optimism now faces the challenge of retaining and attracting users who are seeking alternative avenues for potential gains. </p>

<p>The decrease in network activity raises concerns about the network&#8217;s ability to adapt to evolving market trends and maintain its relevance in the ever-changing crypto landscape.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Luminex, a Bitcoin Ordinals launchpad, has proposed a new standard called BRC-69, which will allegedly optimize the costs of inscribing on this network. This proposal comes barely a month after Bitcoin Ordinals’ developers introduced recursive inscriptions to address the block size limit of 4 MB. Unlike normal Ordinals inscriptions, recursive inscriptions can reference each others’ content through a special syntax. Related Reading: 75% Of Bitcoin Supply Now In Profit, Will A Drop Happen Here? BRC-69 Standard Can Reduce Inscription Fees By 90%: Luminex On Monday, June 3, Luminex introduced BRC-69, a new standard that will facilitate the creation of Recursive Ordinals collections. According to the launchpad, this BRC standard will help reduce inscription fees by 90%. In March 2023, the Ordinals protocol was updated to enable the minting of BRC-20 tokens, which have seen a significant level of adoption so far. According to data from Coingecko, there are currently 35,528 BRC-20 tokens in circulation, with a market cap of more than $249 million.  The increasing number of BRC-20 inscriptions has led to a scarcity of block space on the Bitcoin network. Consequently, BTC transaction fees have increased as there are more pending transactions. A quarterly report by IntoTheBlock revealed that the Bitcoin network fees surged by more than 300% in 2023 Q2. The BRC-20 standard &#8211; and the creation of new tokens &#8211; were reported to be one of the major driving forces of the increased on-chain fees. To ease this pressure on the network, Luminex has developed the BRC-69 standard, which it claims to be a &#8220;revolutionary standard&#8221;. It will help reduce the cost of inscriptions while helping to optimize the Bitcoin block space as the number of inscriptions rises, according to the launchpad. BRC-69 Standard To Cut Inscription Fees In 4 Steps The BRC-69 standard reduces inscription fees in a four-step process of “inscribe traits”, “deploy collection”, “compile collection”, and “mint assets”, Luminex claims. This means that minters only need to inscribe a single line of text instead of a full image. This text will serve as a reference, enabling the final image to be automatically rendered across Ordinals frontends, only using on-chain resources. “The end result? A flawlessly rendered image. Unlike other SVG recursive collections, these images can be dragged, dropped, and saved as typical image type Ordinals,” Luminex said. BTCUSD trading at $30,879 &#124; Source: BTCUSD chart from TradingView In addition to cost efficiency, Luminex’s proposal claims that the BRC-69 standard offers high flexibility and paves the way for other on-chain features. Some of these features include pre-reveal collection launching and on-chain reveals. It is worth mentioning that the Bitcoin Ordinals are still controversial in the cryptocurrency industry, as a large percentage of the Bitcoin community is opposed to the protocol. Many argue that this technology negatively impacts the efficiency and security of the Bitcoin network.
