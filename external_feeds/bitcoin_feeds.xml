<h2>SEC Seeks More Funding to Police Crypto</h2>
<p>Gary Gensler, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), talked about cryptocurrency during his testimony on Wednesday before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government regarding the SEC&#x2019;s Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 budget request.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I am pleased to support the President&#x2019;s FY 2024 request of $2.436 billion for SEC operations, to put us on a better track for the future,&#x201D; Gensler told lawmakers.</p>
<p>After outlining &#x201C;tremendous growth&#x201D; and changes in the U.S. capital markets, the SEC chairman stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#x2019;ve seen the Wild West of the crypto markets, rife with noncompliance, where investors have put hard-earned assets at risk in a highly speculative asset class.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Such growth and rapid change also mean more possibility for wrongdoing. As the cop on the beat, we must be able to meet the match of bad actors,&#x201D; he continued. &#x201C;With funding to meet the scale of our mission, we can be an even stronger advocate for the American public &#x2014; investors and issuers alike.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Our FY 2024 request would help [the Division of Enforcement] grow to 1,144 FTEs [full-time equivalents], allowing it to keep pace with the market challenges of the last decade. The majority of this increase relates to full-year funding for those staff positions authorized and hired in FY 2023,&#x201D; he explained, elaborating:</p>
<blockquote><p>These additional resources would strengthen the Division&#x2019;s ability to protect American families by addressing risks in the crypto markets, cyber and information security, and the resiliency of critical market infrastructure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gensler is often criticized for regulating the crypto sector by enforcement. The SEC chairman has stated that all crypto tokens, except bitcoin, are securities. However, the district court for the Southern District of New York recently ruled that <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XRP" 311999  target="_blank">XRP</a> is <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ripples-chief-legal-officer-breaks-down-ruling-in-sec-lawsuit-says-as-a-matter-of-law-xrp-is-not-a-security/">not a security</a>. Gensler stated that the SEC is &#x201C;<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-disappointed-with-xrp-ruling-on-retail-investors-chair-gensler-hints-at-more-crypto-industry-enforcement/">disappointed</a>&#x201D; by the ruling, especially concerning its potential impact on retail investors.</p>

Similar to the company&#8217;s KAS Miner KS3, the new FIL miner carries a hefty price tag of $38,888 per machine.</strong></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Bitmain Introduces On-Rack Filecoin Miner</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Bitmain <a href="https://twitter.com/BITMAINtech/status/1682009419465527297?s=20">announced</a> Thursday that it will begin selling a newly manufactured Filecoin (FIL) mining rig. Filecoin, a decentralized, blockchain-based storage network, was launched by Protocol Labs in 2017. Its mining algorithm, known as proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime, was originally designed to resist application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in an effort to encourage decentralization. Despite this, Bitmain and other manufacturers have developed ASICs specifically for mining FIL and also offer <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211022005210/en/Bitdeer-Announces-Availability-of-the-Highly-Demanded-Filecoin">FIL cloud mining contracts</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In the announcement on Thursday, Bitmain stated that the on-rack filecoin miner will be sold throughout the day on Friday for $38,888 per unit. Bitmain detailed that the machine offers 4,300T per unit and claims miners will begin earning immediately. While $38,888 is a high price for Bitmain ASIC rigs, it&#8217;s not the most expensive.</p>
<p dir="ltr"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The company previously sold a <a href="https://shop.bitmain.com/product/detail?pid=00020230515160139109i8HPxEdB068C">KAS Miner KS3</a> with a hashrate of 8,300G for $49,800, although the machine is currently sold out. Prior to the introduction of cloud mining services by firms such as Bitdeer and 1475, and Bitmain&#8217;s new miner, a token was launched in 2021 known as the filecoin standard hashrate token (FILST).</p>
<p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/filecoin-standard-hashrate-token/">details</a> from coinmarketcap.com, the coin is reportedly anchored by 1 GB of FIL full storage arithmetic. FIL, the blockchain&#8217;s native crypto asset, is the 31st largest digital currency by market capitalization, and its value has risen 18% against the U.S. dollar in the past 30 days. However, its current price is 98% lower than its all-time high of $236 per unit, recorded on April 1, 2021. Over the past day, the price of FIL has ranged from $4.25 to $4.56 per coin.</p>

<h2>NY Duo Set to Surrender More Than $2.8B in Historic Plea Deal</h2>
<p>The Department of Justice <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-seizes-94636-bitcoin-2016-bitfinex-hack-largest-crypto-seizure-to-date-2-people-arrested/">reported</a> the arrest of <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/an-in-depth-look-at-the-couple-accused-of-laundering-94636-bitcoin-from-the-2016-bitfinex-hack/">Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan</a> on February 8, 2023, for purportedly conspiring to launder proceeds from the theft of 119,754 bitcoins from Bitfinex. Morgan was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/accused-bitfinex-bitcoin-money-launderer-granted-permission-to-engage-in-legitimate-employment/">granted bail</a> in July 2022 with permission to seek lawful employment but her husband remained incarcerated. Now, one year after Morgan&#x2019;s release on certain terms, both individuals have struck a deal with the government.</p>
<p>Court documents filed on July 20 and 21, 2023 indicate that Lichtenstein and Morgan are due to appear before U.S. judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly on August 3. Furthermore, they must relinquish about 94,643.29837084 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> valued at $2.8 billion based on July 21 exchange rates. Notably, the couple possessed more than just <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> in their crypto portfolio; these additional digital currencies must also be forfeited to the U.S. government.</p>

<p>Other coins to be surrendered include 117,376.52651940 bitcoin cash (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BCH" target="_blank">BCH</a>) and an equal amount of bitcoinsv (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BSV" target="_blank">BSV</a>). The couple is also required to relinquish 118,102.03258447 bitcoin gold (BTG), 29,016.98 monero (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/XMR" target="_blank">XMR</a>), a collection of USDC held across multiple blockchains, .879544 curve dao (CRV) tokens, and 7,389,269.171 tether (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a>). The 7.3 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" target="_blank">USDT</a> was kept in decentralized finance (defi) liquidity pools for generating returns. Additionally, investigators found several thousand <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> and WETH stored at the couple&#x2019;s Manhattan residence.</p>
<p>The government also plans to confiscate various U.S. and Canadian gold coins held by the duo. Moreover, $228,266 from a JPMorgan Chase account, $2,460,375 taken from a Flagstar bank account previously linked to a Signature Bank account before the institution&#x2019;s collapse, and approximately $352,381.55 from a Wells Fargo bank account are all targeted for seizure as recorded in the court documents filed on July 20, 2023.</p>

The report, based on a survey of 29 industry specialists, reveals that 43% of panelists believe bitcoin is currently underpriced, 36% say it is priced fairly, and 21% consider it overpriced.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Predictions: Experts Forecast $38K End-of-Year Value, $42K Peak in 2023</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.finder.com/bitcoin-price-prediction-2023">Finder&#x2019;s average prediction</a> for the peak price of bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) in 2023 remains consistent with previous estimates, but the end-of-year projection has increased by 9% to $38,000. Futurist Joe Raczynski anticipates bitcoin to end 2023 slightly higher than the panel average at $40,000, citing growing institutional interest and the potential approval of a bitcoin spot ETF, which could result in substantial investments.</p>
<p>Martin Froehler, CEO of Morpher, believes bitcoin is currently undervalued, attributing his end-of-year prediction of $40,000 to the anticipated bitcoin halving event and the ongoing interest rate cycle. Froehler expects the macroeconomic headwinds to fade and foresees a significant price increase following the halving event.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the panel forecasts an average bitcoin price of approximately $100,000 by the end of 2025 and over $280,000 by the end of 2030. Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, predicts bitcoin to be valued at $115,000 and $260,000 by the end of 2025 and 2030 respectively, citing high inflation and mistrust in institutions as contributing factors.</p>

<p>On the more bullish end of the spectrum, Ben Ritchie, managing director at Digital Capital Management, projects <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> to be worth $150,000 by 2025 and $375,000 by 2030. Ritchie emphasizes the multifaceted utility of bitcoin. The Digital Capital Management executive said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin&#x2019;s utility extends beyond its function as a currency, encompassing data storage essential for the issuance of smart contract tokens and non-fungible tokens. Additionally, its robust security features contribute to its allure, instilling confidence among investors regarding the safekeeping of their bitcoin holdings.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Bearish Points of View</h2>
<p>However, not all panelists share the same level of optimism. Kate Baucherel, a digital strategist at Galia Digital, predicts bitcoin to remain at its current price of $30,000 by the end of 2023 before reaching $55,000 in 2025. Jeremy Cheah, associate professor of decentralized finance at Nottingham Trent University, gives a more modest prediction of $45,000 per <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> by the end of 2025, highlighting potential lawsuits and tighter market regulations as factors affecting the market.</p>
<p>John Hawkins, senior lecturer at the University of Canberra, expresses a more bearish view, forecasting bitcoin to be valued at just $20,000 by the end of 2023 and continuing to decline to $100 by the end of 2030. Hawkins considers bitcoin a speculative bubble and believes that the future lies in central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) rather than decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.</p>
<p>In terms of investment strategies, the majority of panelists (59%) advise buying bitcoin, while 33% recommend holding and only 7% suggest selling.

In a Wall Street Journal interview, the interim CEO, Chris Amani, discussed his team&#8217;s &#8220;vision&#8221; for rescuing the beleaguered blockchain project.</strong></p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Finds New Leadership, Attorneys Seek to Dismiss SEC Case Following Ripple Decision</h2>
<p>Chris Amani, Terraform Labs&#8217; fresh CEO, revealed that the incarcerated <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/do-kwon-moved-29-million-worth-of-coins-since-arrest-prosecutor-says/">Do Kwon</a> stepped down in March just before his <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terraform-labs-co-founder-do-kwon-arrested-in-montenegro-says-interior-minister/">arrest</a>. Previously serving as the company&#8217;s COO, Amani assumed the role of interim CEO. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/jailed-crypto-tycoon-do-kwons-company-appoints-new-ceo-d58fa058">Speaking</a> with the Wall Street Journal, he stated that the firm plans to develop applications offering &#8220;real utility.&#8221; Following the Terra blockchain ecosystem&#8217;s collapse in May 2022, numerous Terra Classic blockchain supporters <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terra-classic-advocates-propose-plan-to-re-establish-ustcs-peg-with-us-dollar-tokens-value-surges-by-over-9/">expressed</a> their desire to re-establish USTC&#8217;s peg to the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>A group of six unidentified developers <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/six-samurai-anonymous-developers-seek-to-revive-terra-classic-ecosystem/">submitted a plan</a> for rejuvenating the Terra Classic ecosystem. The new LUNA 2.0 token and Phoenix blockchain activity and value have significantly diminished, with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra">LUNA</a> down 96.63% from its peak on May 28, 2022. The cryptocurrency currently possesses a market valuation of approximately $207 million, and around <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Terra2">$6 million</a> in total value is locked across nine decentralized finance platforms. Amani did not specify whether Terra Classic or Terra Phoenix would be the primary focus of their efforts during his interview.</p>
<p>However, he assured that further information would be divulged in the coming months. “We have a vision for how we could salvage this, even though I think it’s going to be hard and it’s going to take a long time,” said Amani during the discussion. Roughly 15 of the company&#8217;s 40 employees were part of Terraform Labs before the stablecoin depegging incident led to the blockchain ecosystem&#8217;s downfall. Kwon was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/terras-do-kwon-receives-4-month-jail-sentence-in-montenegro-for-counterfeit-passport-usage/">sentenced</a> to four months in prison in Montenegro for allegedly using counterfeit identification at an airport, with prosecutors from the United States and South Korea seeking his extradition on various charges.</p>

<p>The CEO news broke after Terraform Labs lawyers asked the court for certain information related to FTX, believing this data could aid their defense in a lawsuit initiated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Additionally, defense attorneys <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150/gov.uscourts.nysd.594150.47.0.pdf">sought</a> dismissal of specific charges, following Ripple Labs&#8217; recent <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/us-judge-rules-xrp-not-necessarily-a-security-on-its-face-sending-xrp-supporters-into-celebration/">partial victory</a> against the SEC.</p>
<p>“Ripple is thus fatal to the SEC’s arguments that UST, LUNA, wLUNA, MIR, and mAssets were sold as investment contracts,” the court filing details. “This conclusion requires dismissal of the SEC’s fraud claims as well as its registration claims.”</p>

Prices rose as traders continued to react to a recent tweet from Elon Musk. Another notable gainer was polkadot, which rose nearly 7% higher.</strong></p>
<h2>Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) was a notable mover during Friday’s session, as the meme coin climbed to a multi-month high. This occurred as price continued its reaction to a recent Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1681691639922806784?s=20">tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.06855 on Thursday, DOGE/USD surged to an intraday peak of $0.07639 earlier today.</p>
<p>This resulted in dogecoin hitting its strongest point since May 6, when its price peaked above $0.0800.</p>

<p>One of the catalysts behind today’s move was a breakout of the 62.00 level on the relative strength index (RSI).</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the index is now at 64.24, with an upcoming resistance point of 66.00 a possible target for buyers.</p>
<p>Earlier momentum has marginally faded, with DOGE now trading at $0.074.</p>

<h2>Polkadot (DOT)</h2>
<p>Additionally, polkadot (DOT) also rallied to end the week, as the token rose by as much as 7% in today’s session.</p>
<p>DOT/USD jumped to a high of $5.69 on Friday, which was a day after the price fell to a bottom at $5.15.</p>
<p>As a result of this rally, polkadot peaked at its highest level since last Friday, when it reached a then two-month high of $5.74.</p>

<p>The token edged lower after bulls were unable to extend gains towards a key resistance level of $6.00.</p>
<p>Overall, this appeared to come as price strength failed to surge past its own ceiling at the 60.00 mark.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the indicator is now closing in on this point, and in the event it breaks beyond this zone, DOT will likely climb past the $6.00 mark.</p>

The U.S. attorney asserts that Bankman-Fried intended to discredit the government&#8217;s key witness by disseminating the diary content.</strong></p>
<h2>FTX Co-Founder Allegedly Leaked Caroline Ellison’s Diary Excerpts</h2>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) isn&#8217;t pleased with a New York Times (NYT) article that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/ex-alameda-ceo-caroline-ellisons-google-docs-diary-exposes-struggles-prior-to-ftx-collapse/">published excerpts</a> from former Alameda Research CEO <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/caroline-ellisons-testimony-claims-ftx-boss-sbf-directed-her-to-co-mingle-customer-funds-since-2019/">Caroline Ellison</a>’s online diary. A <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf">letter</a> to presiding judge Lewis Kaplan alleges the information was leaked by defendant Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced FTX co-founder. Although the department acknowledges the NYT article “does not indicate who provided the documents to the article’s authors,” prosecutors suspect the defendant was responsible.</p>
<p>U.S. attorney Williams states:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is apparent that documents were shared by the defendant with the article’s reporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prosecutors suspect the leak was disseminated to discredit Ellison, who will testify against Bankman-Fried in October. The government is requesting an order that “limits extrajudicial statements by parties and witnesses.” Bankman-Fried&#8217;s alleged actions are said to pose a &#8220;core concern&#8221; with “disseminating material related to the ‘testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses.’”</p>

<p>The Department of Justice details that leaks like these could potentially contaminate the jury pool and possibly &#8220;deter other witnesses from testifying.&#8221; The NYT article describes how Ellison&#8217;s romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried became problematic, and she questioned her suitability for leading Alameda Research.</p>
<p>“By selectively sharing certain private documents with the New York Times, the defendant is attempting to discredit a witness, cast Ellison in a poor light, and advance his defense through the press and outside the constraints of the courtroom and rules of evidence: that Ellison was a jilted lover who perpetrated these crimes alone,” Williams&#8217; letter to Kaplan concludes.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) remained in the red on Friday, as the cryptocurrency moved back below the $30,000 level.</p>
<p>After hitting a high of $30,406.45 on Thursday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD fell to a bottom at $29,638.10 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>This decline resulted in bitcoin moving near Tuesday&#x2019;s floor at $29,525, which was a one-month low.</p>

<p>The latest sell-off came as the relative strength index (RSI) dropped below a key support point at 49.00.</p>
<p>Currently, price strength is tracking at 48.09, with the 46.00 mark a potential target for sellers.</p>
<p>Additionally, the 10-day (red) moving average has begun separating from its 25-day (blue) counterpart, which could be a sign of an upcoming downturn.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>After making a strong rebound on Thursday, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) was largely lower in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD edged to a bottom at $1,879.73 earlier today, which comes a day after peaking around $1,920.</p>

<p>The index is currently tracking at 49.86.</p>

Anatoly Aksakov, who was involved in the recent adoption of the new digital ruble legislation, highlighted some of the advantages of programmable central bank money as he sees them.</strong></p>
<h2>Central Bank of Russia to Cap Digital Ruble Payments at CBDC Launch, Aksakov Expects</h2>
<p>Russia’s recently adopted digital ruble law allows the Bank of Russia to limit the use of its central bank digital currency (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank_digital_currency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CBDC</a>) and, according to the head of the parliamentary Financial Market Committee, Anatoly Aksakov, the monetary authority will set some restrictions after its initial introduction.</p>
<p>The legislation was <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-state-duma-passes-digital-ruble-law/">passed</a> by the State Duma, the lower house of Russian parliament, last week. On Wednesday, the Federation Council, the upper house of the Federal Assembly of Russia, approved the bill in turn. It will enter into force once it’s signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Parlamentskaya Gazeta newspaper, Aksakov pointed out that the digital incarnation of the Russian ruble will allow government authorities and the currency’s users to control how their money is being spent by others through smart contracts.</p>

<p>“For example, you give money to a child who goes to school, stipulating that the money can only be spent on breakfast, books or textbooks, and nothing else. Accordingly, no matter how great their desire is to use it for other purposes, it will be impossible to do so,” Aksakov explained.</p>
<p>“That is, the intended use of the money allocated by the parents to their child will be prescribed,” the lawmaker added. Which means no harmful sweets for pupils with parents’ digital rubles, the official publication of the Russian parliament elaborated.</p>
<p>The same principle will apply to the allocation of state money for the implementation of specific programs, Anatoly Aksakov emphasized. He believes this will increase the efficiency of the use of budgetary funds. Businesses can also take advantage of the programmable CBDC in their transactions, the lawmaker is convinced.</p>
