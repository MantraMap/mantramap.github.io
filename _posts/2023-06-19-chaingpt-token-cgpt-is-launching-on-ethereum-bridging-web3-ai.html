<p>Broadening its horizons and looking to increase its on-chain footprint, ChainGPT has begun its interchain movement by bridging the $CGPT token to the Ethereum Network.</p>
<p>Enabled through a partnership with ChainPort, KuCoin, BitGet, and other top-tier Web3 partners, ChainGPT has developed a decentralized bi-directional bridge between the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum for the $CGPT token. Now users will be able to transfer their $CGPT to and from the ETH and BNB/BSC networks seamlessly.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the bridge, the $CGPT token&rsquo;s on-chain presence expands, gaining access to the robust and vibrant ecology of the Ethereum network. Integrations into many of the world's leading DEFI protocols, the opening of token pools on DEXs, and the provision of added trading pairs against a broader segment of popular tokens becomes possible.</p>
What is $CGPT?
<p>At its core, $CGPT is enabling a decentralized economy for AI services. As the native token of the ChainGPT ecosystem, $CGPT serves the dual functions of a utility and governance tool. Its utility purpose is to provide access to a full suite of AI-powered Web3 tooling from NFT minting and community management to smart contract auditing and creation to launchpad tiering and beyond. Its governance function relates to the role of $CGPT in distributing ownership rights over the platform throughout its community members and giving them the opportunity to help steer the direction of the project&rsquo;s development.

Where will the ERC-20 version of $CGPT be supported?
<p>ChainGPT has been in communications with a multitude of exchanges that would be able to provide support immediately after instantiation. At this time, Kucoin, BitGet, and ByBit have confirmed support with a few select other major exchanges signaling their willingness.</p>
<p>On the front of decentralized venues for support, the most popular DEX in the world, UniSwap, will have a $CGPT token pool opened to provide instant listing and liquidity on Ethereum.</p>
<p>With the help of ChainPort, $CGPT&rsquo;s presence on major crypto directories and analytics portals including CoinGecko and Etherscan has been expedited.</p>
