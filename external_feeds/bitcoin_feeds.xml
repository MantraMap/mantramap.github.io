<h2>Hong Kong Aims to Become Regional Crypto Hub</h2>
<p>Hong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po reaffirmed the city&#8217;s crypto commitment at a web3 summit in Cyberport Monday.</p>
<p>Emphasizing that Hong Kong remains committed to becoming a regional crypto hub, the financial secretary <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-09/hong-kong-stresses-pro-crypto-stance-as-industry-reels">described</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As certain crypto exchanges collapsed one after another, Hong Kong became a quality standing point for digital asset corporates.</p></blockquote>
<p>He added that Hong Kong has a robust regulatory framework for crypto that &#8220;matches international norms and standards.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joseph Chan, the undersecretary for financial services and the Treasury for the government of Hong Kong, revealed at the same event that the city is preparing to issue more licenses for digital asset trading firms. Moreover, it is planning a consultation on crypto platforms to explore the potential for retail participation in the industry.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is pushing to become a regional crypto hub despite the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and several other crypto firms filing for bankruptcy. Last month, the city&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) issued a <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/news-and-announcements/news/doc?refNo=22PR103">statement</a> warning about the risks associated with crypto platforms offering deposits, savings, earnings, and staking services.</p>

<p>After years of strict regulations, Hong Kong is now pushing to make it easier for retail investors to trade crypto assets. Elizabeth Wong, the SFC&#8217;s director of licensing and head of the fintech unit, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-mulls-letting-retail-investors-trade-crypto-removing-professional-investor-only-requirement/">said</a> in October last year: &#8220;We&#8217;ve had four years of experience in regulating this industry … We think that this may be actually a good time to really think carefully about whether we will continue with this professional investor-only requirement.&#8221;</p>
<p>In November last year, Julia Leung, another SFC executive, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/hong-kong-actively-looking-to-establish-regulatory-framework-to-allow-crypto-futures-etfs-report/">said</a> the regulator is &#8220;actively looking&#8221; to set up a regulatory framework that allows retail investors to trade exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with exposure to cryptocurrency futures. In December, the city&#8217;s first <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8a0d3ae9-4957-4ae9-a59d-496d5abbf6a3">crypto futures ETFs</a> were launched.</p>

The management of the trading platform stated that they plan to &#x201C;strengthen its position&#x201D; as a domestic cryptocurrency exchange and change its name.</strong></p>
<h2>Huobi Experiences Significant Withdrawals as Subsidiary Huobi Korea Looks to Go Independent</h2>
<p>There has been much <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/huobi-layoffs-spark-controversy-and-speculation-justin-sun-claims-everything-is-fine/">speculation and many rumors</a> surrounding the cryptocurrency exchange Huobi Global, which rebranded to simply &#x201C;Huobi&#x201D; at the end of November 2022. Reports indicated that Huobi laid off 20% of its staff and plans to maintain &#x201C;a very lean team&#x201D; going forward.</p>
<p>Additionally, Huobi has experienced a significant amount of withdrawals recently. Cryptoquant statistics show that on November 2, 2022, Huobi held more than 20,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>. As of today, the cryptocurrency exchange&#x2019;s <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> reserves are approximately <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line">16,709 BTC</a>. Similarly, Huobi had 22 million <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> in reserves on November 2, 2022, but according to cryptoquant.com statistics, the current stash is down to <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/eth/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&window=DAY&sma=0&ema=0&priceScale=log&metricScale=linear&chartStyle=line">18.19 million</a>.</p>
<p>Amid the speculation, South Korean news outlet News1 has <a href="https://www.news1.kr/articles/4919434">reported</a> that Huobi Korea wants to break away from the parent company Huobi. News1 reports that Huobi Korea plans to purchase shares from the parent company and change its name. The &#x201C;equity relationship with Huobi Global will also be sorted out,&#x201D; according to the report, and the teams plan to hold a meeting between employees and top executives.</p>

<p>News1 reported that the name change and stake purchase will sever the ties between the two firms, allowing the Korean exchange to operate independently. One source told News1 that the name change was a significant event. &#x201C;Huobi Korea has suffered from being perceived as a foreign exchange, particularly with the image of a &#x2018;Chinese exchange,&#x2019;&#x201D; the source said. &#x201C;It can be interpreted as an effort to demonstrate that it is a &#x2018;domestic exchange&#x2019; that is as safe as it is.&#x201D;</p>

<h2>Lido Finance Emerges as Most Dominant Defi Protocol, Surpassing Makerdao in TVL Size</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets have been positive at the start of the second week of 2023, as the entire crypto economy has increased 3.6% to $893 billion on Monday around 11:00 a.m. (ET). Smart contract platform tokens have seen a 7.1% rise to $274 billion, which equates to roughly 30.68% of the entire crypto economy. Out of the top five smart contract platform coins, Solana (SOL) saw the biggest gain, rising 24.2% in 24 hours.</p>

Additionally, all five of the top smart contract assets have seen double-digit spikes over the last seven days. Again, SOL led the pack, jumping 72.3% higher this past week, and <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" target="_blank">ADA</a> increased by 28.8% during the same time frame. Ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" 311998  target="_blank">ETH</a>) saw the lowest increase over the last seven days compared to the top competitors, as the cryptocurrency is up 11.5% this week.</p>

<p>Of course, the increase in the price of smart contract platform tokens has led to a swelling of the total value locked (TVL) in defi as well. Since mid-December 2022, the TVL in defi was below the $40 billion range, but on January 9, 2023, it managed to climb back above that to roughly $41.1 billion on Monday. While Makerdao was the most dominant defi protocol, Lido Finance is now the most dominant with 15.92% of the TVL in defi. Lido has a TVL of around $6.54 billion, while Makerdao follows behind with $6.44 billion. Lido and Makerdao are followed by Aave, Curve, and Uniswap, respectively, in terms of TVL size.</p>

<p>Ethereum is still the most dominant in defi today, in terms of TVL size, as the chain&#x2019;s $24.61 billion represents 59.88% of the total $41.1 billion locked. Binance Smart Chain has the second largest TVL with $4.41 billion, Tron comes in third with $4.13 billion, Polygon takes the fourth position with $1.05 billion, and the fifth largest in defi today, as far as blockchains are concerned, is Arbitrum with $1.03 billion. Over the last day, the TVL in defi jumped 2.99% higher, but the TVL has a long way to go to reach the $178.55 billion high reached in November 2021.</p>

Moreover, SBF&#8217;s quantitative trading firm allegedly owes more than $55,000 to Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s beach resort, Margaritaville, after Alameda and FTX executives occupied 20 suites for a few months last year.</strong></p>
<h2>New Court Filings Detail Lavish Spending by FTX Co-Founder and Executives</h2>
<p>With every court filing published, it seems that FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s (SBF) so-called &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism">effective altruism</a>&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a top priority during the last nine months. On Jan. 8, 2023, Bitcoin.com News <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/sbf-fights-for-robinhood-shares-says-he-needs-them-more-than-ftx-customers-who-only-suffer-possibility-of-economic-loss/">reported</a> on SBF telling the court he needed access to the $460 million in Robinhood shares to &#8220;pay for his criminal defense.&#8221; Furthermore, the former FTX CEO explained that customers &#8220;face only the possibility of economic loss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, court filings <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/cryptocurrency/news/ftx-spent-nearly-7-million-on-food-and-over-15-million-on-luxury-bahamian-hotels-in-just-9-months-court-documents-show/articleshow/96795972.cms">reviewed</a> this week detail that FTX&#8217;s and Alameda&#8217;s executives spent tens of millions lavishly on residential accommodations, hotels, food, and flights last year. Records show that $15.4 million was spent on luxury hotels and accommodations. A great deal of that money was dedicated to paying for SBF&#8217;s $30 million luxury penthouse at the Albany oceanside resort. $3.6 million was used to purchase hotel rooms at the Grand Hyatt, a four-star hotel, and $800,000 was spent at the Rosewood, a five-star hotel.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-owes-55000-jimmy-buffett-margaritaville-hotel-bahamas-2022-11">Reports</a> also show that Jimmy Buffett&#8217;s beach resort, Margaritaville, is owed more than $55,000 as the resort&#8217;s management has registered as a creditor in the bankruptcy case. FTX&#8217;s and Alameda&#8217;s employees <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-06/why-does-bankman-fried-s-alameda-owe-bahamas-margaritaville-resort-50-000">reportedly</a> stayed in 20 suites for a number of months last year, racking up the bill but never paying for the Margaritaville accommodations. In addition to hotels, fancy suites, and luxury apartments, $3.9 million was spent on flights and private aircraft. When an FTX employee needed an Amazon package picked up from Miami, they would allegedly use a private plane to ship the boxes over to the island.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-collapse-bankruptcy-sbf-luxury-lifestyle-restaurant-2022-11?_ga=2.3215856.1359239506.1673272241-484459754.1673272241">Other reports</a> say the co-founder was so altruistic that SBF regularly spent more than $2,500 at the Nassau bistro for lunch and tossed millions at Bahamian politicians and officials prior to FTX&#8217;s collapse. Fox News <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/fallen-ftx-boss-spent-lavishly-bahamas-while-allegedly-misusing-customer-funds">disclosed</a> that SBF also owns a multimillion-dollar, 52-foot HCB yacht. On Jan. 6, 2023, Business Insider&#8217;s Pete Syme reached out to SBF&#8217;s lawyers to ask about the ostensible lavish spending the FTX co-founder is said to have participated in. &#8220;Lawyers for FTX and Bankman-Fried didn&#8217;t immediately respond to Insider&#8217;s request for comment,&#8221; Syme wrote.</p>

The move saw the token climb to its highest point since November, when it was embroiled in the FTX collapse. Cardano also moved higher to start the week, climbing by nearly 13%.</strong></p>
<h2>Solana (SOL)</h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) was one of Monday&#x2019;s big movers, as prices of the token rose by as much as 22%.</p>
<p>SOL/USD surged to an intraday high of $16.62 to start the week, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $13.47.</p>
<p>Today&#x2019;s rise in price pushed SOL to its strongest point since November 12, days after the token plummeted, after being exposed to the FTX/Alameda scandal.</p>

<p>From the chart, Monday&#x2019;s rally came following a breakout of a key resistance level at the $15.00 mark.</p>
<p>As a result of this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) has risen to 73.26, which is its strongest point since April.</p>
<p>Due to prices now being relatively overbought, there is a strong possibility that there could be a reversal in momentum in the coming days.</p>

<h2>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>)</h2>
<p>Cardano (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>) was another notable gainer to start the week, with the token climbing for a second straight day.</p>
<p>Following a low of $0.2865 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD hit a high of $0.3409 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>Like with solana, this move saw cardano hit its highest mark since November, and came after a breakout of a ceiling at $0.3250.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, as a result of today&#x2019;s rally, the 14-day RSI rose to a level not seen since September 2021.</p>
<p>Due to this, earlier gains have somewhat eased, and as of writing, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ADA" 312018  target="_blank">ADA</a>/USD is trading at $0.3247.</p>

The Fed has stated that it aims to bring inflation down to the 2% target, and the increases to the federal funds rate are intended to move toward this goal. However, Zoltan Pozsar, a U.S. macroeconomist and observer of the Fed, predicts that the central bank will start quantitative easing (QE) again by summer. Bill Baruch, an executive at Blue Line Futures, a futures and commodities brokerage firm, anticipates that the Fed will halt rate hikes by February.</strong></p>
<h2>Experts Weigh In on Possibility of Pausing Rate Hikes and Restarting Quantitative Easing</h2>
<p>Inflation in the U.S. saw a significant increase last year, but has since slowed. After seven rate hikes from the central bank, investors and analysts anticipate that the Fed will change course this year. In an interview with Kitco News, Bill Baruch, president of Blue Line Futures, <a href="https://youtu.be/__KpRarNkWE">told</a> Kitco’s anchor and producer David Lin that the U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to halt monetary tightening in February. Baruch pointed to the decrease in inflation and cited manufacturing data as one factor in his prediction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think there is a good chance that we don&#8217;t see the Fed hike at all in February,&#8221; Baruch told Lin. &#8220;We could see something from them that would surprise the markets in the first week of February.&#8221; However, Baruch emphasized that markets will be &#8220;volatile,&#8221; but also will see a strong rally. Baruch stated that the rate hikes &#8220;were aggressive,&#8221; and he noted that &#8220;there were signs in 2021 that the economy was ready to slow.&#8221; Baruch added:</p>
<blockquote><p>But with the Fed hiking those rates right through, that’s what slam-dunked this market down.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Repo Guru Predicts Federal Reserve Will Restart Quantitative Easing in the Summer Under the ‘Guise’ of Yield Curve Controls</h2>
<p>There is some uncertainty among analysts as to whether the Federal Reserve will choose to raise the federal funds rate or pivot in its course of action. Bill English, a finance professor at the Yale School of Management, <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/when-will-the-fed-stop-raising-rates/">explained</a> to bankrate.com that it is difficult to be certain about the Federal Reserve&#8217;s plans for rate hikes in 2023.</p>
<p>“It’s not hard to imagine scenarios where they end up raising rates a fair amount next year,” English said. “It’s also possible they end up cutting rates more if the economy really slows and inflation comes down a lot. It’s hard to be confident about your outlook. The best you can do is balance the risks.”</p>

<p>U.S. macroeconomist and Fed watcher Zoltan Pozsar, for his part, thinks the Fed will restart quantitative easing (QE) again by the summer. According to Pozsar, the Fed won’t pivot for a while and Treasuries will go under duress. In a recent <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/checkmate-situation-zoltan-pozsar-says-fed-will-restart-qe-summer-2023">zerohedge.com article,</a> the macroeconomist insists the Fed’s ‘QE summer’ will be under the “guise” of yield curve controls.</p>

<p>Pozsar believes that this will happen by the “end of 2023 to control where U.S. Treasuries trade versus OIS.&#8221; Citing Pozsar’s prediction, zerohedge.com’s Tyler Durden explains it will be like a “‘checkmate-like’ situation” and ​​the impending implementation of QE will occur within the framework of dysfunction in the Treasury market.</p>

The move comes days ahead of the upcoming U.S. inflation figures, and as traders continue to react to Friday&#x2019;s nonfarm payrolls (NFP). Ethereum was also higher, rising to a multi-week high in the process.</strong></p>
<h2>Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>) moved above the $17,000 level to start the week, as markets shifted their focus to this week&#x2019;s U.S. inflation report.</p>
<p>Following a low of $16,928.18 on Sunday, <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>/USD surged to a peak of $17,283.72 earlier in today&#x2019;s session.</p>
<p>The move saw <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a> climb to its highest point since December 16, when price was at a high of $17,525.</p>

<p>Looking at the chart, today&#x2019;s high came as the 10-day (red) moving average finally crossed over its 25-day (blue) counterpart.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) marginally moved past its recent resistance level at 60.00.</p>
<p>As of writing, the index is tracking at 60.46, with the next visible ceiling at the 63.00 zone.</p>

<h2>Ethereum</h2>
<p>Like <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC" 311996  target="_blank">BTC</a>, ethereum (<a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>) also rallied to a multiple-week high on Monday, with prices climbing above a recent ceiling at $1,300.</p>
<p><a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a>/USD raced to an intraday high of $1,324.01 earlier in today&#x2019;s session, which comes less than 24 hours after trading at a low of $1,261.95.</p>
<p>Similar to bitcoin, today&#x2019;s rally pushed ethereum to its highest point since mid-December, when the coin was above $1,350.</p>

<p>As can be seen from the chart, an upwards crossover of moving averages has also occurred here, with the RSI gaining momentum as well.</p>
<p>Currently, the index is tracking at 66.81, which is its strongest point since October 29, when <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/ETH" target="_blank">ETH</a> was trading upwards of $1,500.</p>
<p>Should bullish sentiment remain throughout the week, ethereum will likely climb past the $1,400 level.</p>

With the move, part of efforts to improve its capabilities in this field, the largest trading platform for digital assets joins a club of multinational corporations and financial institutions.</strong></p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange Binance Seeks Additional Sanctions Training for Its Compliance Team</h2>
<p>Binance, the leading cryptocurrency exchange in terms of daily trading volume, has joined the Association of Certified Sanctions Specialists (ACSS) which works to improve the qualification of sanctions compliance professionals employed by global companies.</p>
<p>“We will be leveraging the training materials, comprehensive databases, and deep networks within ACSS to further enhance the skills and expertise of our team,” Binance said in an announcement. It also pointed out that it’s the first crypto exchange among the members of ACSS, which was established in 2018.</p>
<p>As part of the certification process, all compliance specialists on Binance’s sanctions team as well as the money laundering reporting, compliance operations, and special investigations leads will be required to undergo training with the ACSS, the company explained.</p>

<p>The exchange expects the training to equip its sanctions team with the latest guidelines issued by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) on how to develop compliance programs and ensure that its experts understand the risks of violations in various jurisdictions.</p>
<p>“The blockchain industry is still in its early years, and it’s our priority to continue upholding the highest level of compliance amid a fast-evolving space,” commented Chagri Poyraz, Binance’s global head of sanctions. He emphasized that the company wants to continue to be among those that set the standard for security and compliance in the industry.</p>
<p>“ACSS, as an organization specializing in providing sanctions training for multinational corporations and financial institutions, will ensure the highest quality of training to the team at Binance in this dynamic sector and help advance compliance in the crypto industry,” added the association’s Executive Director Saskia Rietbroek.</p>
<h2>Binance Maintains Focus on Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>In the past couple of years, Binance has been focusing on efforts to improve regulatory compliance and in 2022 increased its compliance team to 750 members. The exchange has been <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-licensed-in-kazakhstan-as-provider-of-crypto-exchange-and-custody-services/">licensed</a>, <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-obtains-registration-as-crypto-service-provider-in-cyprus/">registered</a> or obtained <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-exchange-binance-approved-by-french-regulator-fully-regulated-digital-asset-service-provider/">approvals</a> to operate in 14 different jurisdictions, including France, Spain, Bahrain, Dubai, and Australia, the exchange detailed.</p>
<p>Binance has been also engaged in joint initiatives with national authorities in new markets. In December, it <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-help-azerbaijan-with-crypto-regulations/">offered</a> to support Azerbaijan in attempts to introduce regulations for digital assets and <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-launches-blockchain-education-program-in-kazakhstan/">launched</a> a blockchain education program in Kazakhstan after offering <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-advise-kazakhstan-on-crypto-regulations/">advice</a> on crypto regulations to its government, too.</p>
<p>The collapse of FTX, a major competitor of Binance which <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/troubled-crypto-exchange-ftx-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection-ceo-steps-down/">filed</a> for bankruptcy protection in Nov. 2022, led to increased regulatory scrutiny over the crypto industry around the world. Earlier last year, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/changes-of-services-to-users-in-russia-4887e569afdf4b1e89e024371d3a49b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complied</a> with EU sanctions imposed on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine by <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-limits-services-to-russian-users-to-comply-with-eu-sanctions/">limiting</a> services for Russian residents and entities.</p>

The company stated that starting Jan. 4, 2023, all cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals would be paused due to the changes in the service offer of one of its providers.</strong></p>
<h2>Airtm Removes Cryptocurrency Trading Options</h2>
<p>Airtm, a popular exchange used by freelancers in Latam, has announced it is winding down cryptocurrency trading and custody services. The company, which has more than 2 million customers in the region, disclosed in a message on its platform that they were retiring cryptocurrency-based services in its wallet, leaving customers unable to deposit or withdraw their cryptocurrency funds out of the exchange.</p>
<p>The action was taken by the company supposedly due to the change of the services offered by an unidentified provider. Local sources <a href="https://www.criptonoticias.com/negocios/airtm-elimina-bitcoin-criptomonedas-plataforma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">state</a> this provider is Wyre, a cryptocurrency-based payments firm, which has recently <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/wyre-announces-modification-of-withdrawal-policy-pushing-topps-to-temporarily-suspend-nft-marketplace-transactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> it is &#8220;scaling back&#8221; and announced a new limit for withdrawals after conflicting reports indicated the firm was winding down its operations.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the company further stated that available funds in crypto are being converted to Airusd, its dollar-pegged native stablecoin, claimed to be audited by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Some users reported having seen the exchange operations in their accounts, but their funds were still unavailable by Jan. 6.</p>

<h2>Bank Deposits Paused</h2>
<p>As part of a set of &#8220;preventive actions&#8221; exerted by the company, it is also making changes to the supported operations in European and U.S.-based banks. Airtm informed that direct deposits to these banks were suspended until further notice, affecting thousands of freelance customers that commonly make use of this feature.</p>
<p>However, the company did not indicate whether these measures were temporary or if it will include cryptocurrency trading and bank deposits again in the future.</p>
<p>In the past, Airtm was very active in Venezuela, having been the main facilitator for the delivery of a $300 bond given by the <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/disputed-venezuelan-gold-worth-1-8b-in-bank-of-england-vaults-remains-uncertain-after-dissolution-of-interim-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now-defunct</a> interim government to the medical workers of the country. This prompted the current government to try to <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-blocks-opposition-from-disbursing-18-million-to-health-workers-via-bitcoin-exchange-airtm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block</a> access to Airtm&#8217;s site.</p>
<p>Also, in 2018, the organization <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/fundraiser-aims-to-raise-1m-in-cryptocurrencies-for-venezuelans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> a fundraising campaign to give an airdrop of $1 million that would benefit more than 100,000 Venezuelans registered and identified on the platform.</p>

The man, who was arrested and charged for extorting the trading platform&#x2019;s owner, has been ordered to return the money he misappropriated.</strong>&#13;</p>
<h2>Vietnamese Court Jails Hacker for Attacking Crypto Exchange Website</h2>
<p>&#13;<br />
A resident of Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam has been given 10 years in prison for stealing 300 million Vietnamese dong (close to $13,000) from a crypto entrepreneur whose coin trading site he subjected to cyberattacks.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Nham Hoang Khang, the hacker, was charged with extortion and sentenced on Friday by the city&#x2019;s People&#x2019;s Court, the English-language edition of the VN Express daily reported. He was also ordered to return the stolen money.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The crypto exchange was established by Vu Ngoc Chau in 2018 to connect potential buyers and sellers of cryptocurrencies, taking a fee for the transactions it facilitated. Users were required to open accounts and provide personal information such as phone number, email address and a copy of an ID document.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In October 2020, Khang used his phone to create multiple accounts on the platform. He discovered that the website, T-rex.exchange, had several vulnerabilities that could be exploited to get hold of both data and digital currency.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
The following month, the hacker managed to gain control over the account of a T-rex employee and around 30,000 <a class="lar-automated-link" href="https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/USDT" 312012  target="_blank">USDT</a>. The team detected the unusual transactions and locked the account to prevent further operations with the cryptocurrency.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
Once he found that he no longer had access to the compromised account, Khang obtained the personal data of 29,000 customers and created a large number of fake orders, while threatening with further attacks.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
He also demanded to be paid $20,000, or else he would reveal that the exchange had been hacked. Chau, the owner, received multiple threats and eventually told his employees to send Khang 300 million dong. He filed a complaint with law enforcement authorities in mid-2021.&#13;<br />
&#13;<br />
In <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/vietnam-businesses-urge-for-blockchain-training-of-students-and-it-specialists/">Vietnam</a>, cryptocurrencies are not legalized or regulated yet. Despite their popularity among traders and investors, bitcoin and the like remain unrecognized as assets or means of payment by the State Bank of Vietnam and Vietnamese law.&#13;<br />
