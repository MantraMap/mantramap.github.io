<p>Singapore, Singapore, April 20th, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Rebranding from Kryptomon to KMON Genesis, the move will significantly lower the barriers of entry to one of the world's most popular web3 games.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Today, Pink Moon Studios, a leading web3 gaming company, announced the launch of a free-to-play mode for its renowned strategy game, KMON Genesis (formerly Kryptomon). KMON Genesis allows players to breed, collect, and trade unique creatures as they traverse the enthralling KMON universe. As one of the first web3 games in the world, KMON Genesis gives players a seamless gaming experience without the need to purchase NFTs in advance, further lowering barriers to entry to a broader range of players.</p><p class="ql-align-justify">Set in the Kryptomon universe, community members play as &ldquo;Trainers,&rdquo; taking care of their own NFT pets, which have a unique and mutable genetic code made up of 38 randomized parameters that determine their physical and behavioral characteristics. Kryptomons can learn, fall sick, get hungry, and protect their trainers when out on an adventure in the physical world. In turn, trainers will have to care for, feed, and train their Kryptomon partners in order to grow and prepare for the battles ahead. To incentivize gameplay, Pink Moon Studios shares revenue from KMON Genesis with its players by distributing weekly monetary rewards when they complete in-game challenges, which average $50 in tokens.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"></p><p class="ql-align-justify">"Our core mission has always been to make the enthralling KMON Genesis universe accessible to everyone.&rdquo; stated Umberto Canessa Cerchi, Founder &amp; CEO of Pink Moon Studios,&nbsp;&ldquo;The introduction of the free-to-play mode is a game-changer, inviting players from all backgrounds to experience the innovative and exciting world we've developed, without any financial barriers or web3-related technological hurdles."</p><p class="ql-align-justify">In a recent partnership with Playdex, Pink Moon Studios also introduced exclusive rental features for KMON on-chain assets, further enhancing the gaming experience and offering players even more flexibility and opportunities for growth within the game. To commemorate the launch of the free-to-play mode, Pink Moon Studios will host a community event showcasing its upcoming mobile MMORPG, World of Kogaea, which is currently under development. Players can obtain a unique digital collectible throughout the event by completing specified quests. Space for the special event is limited, and interested players are encouraged to register early to secure their spots.
