			  <description><![CDATA[<p>LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, May 23rd, 2023, Chainwire</p><p>Vertex Labs (Vertexlabs.uk), the brain behind the Caduceus metaverse protocol, Vertex Network and 3D metaverse platform, LightCycle, has acquired London-based digital art studio, Digimental Studio (Digimental), the driving force behind blue-chip 3D NFT fashion brand, HAPE for US$12 million. The acquisition completes Vertexlabs.uk offering as the world&rsquo;s leading provider of Web3 and AI infrastructure and marks a pivotal milestone for the global metaverse industry.</p><p>Through its acquisition of Digimental, Vertexlabs.uk will introduce a staking programme for its HAPE community members. Building on HAPE&rsquo;s collaborations with Italian fashion giant, Diesel and iconic global lifestyle brand, Jagermeister, HAPE will continue to form new partnerships with fashion, lifestyle and luxury players, providing them with unprecedented access and infrastructure support within the Web3 space. The shared vision is for HAPE to become the go-to destination within the fashionverse and a home for its community members, through its integration into Vertexlabs.uk&rsquo;s 3D metaverse platform, LightCycle. Digimental will lead on the creation and development of LightCycle.</p><p>Founded in 2011, Digimental Studio launched its prolific brainchild, HAPE, in 2021; with a current trading volume $US200 million, HAPE boasts the largest NFT community in the world with over 420,000 members on Discord and a global, cross-platform community of over 1 million members. HAPE rapidly achieved cult status and an insatiable collector-based following for its iconic digital art, rooted in cultural cues from street fashion, tech and music. Its release of 8,192 minted HAPES (unique Ethereum-based NFTs), broke NFT-release records when it drew in 450,000+ global community members to its HAPE Discord channel, with resale purchases exceeding US$20,000 per HAPE on OpenSea. Solidifying its foothold within the fashionverse, HAPE went on to partner with Italian fashion giant, Diesel, earlier this year to launch a co-created, limited edition NFT collection, offering exclusive physical and digital rewards; the collaboration forms part of HAPE&rsquo;s wider commitment to innovate together with brands, bridging the gap between Web2 and Web3.</p><p>The merge builds on Vertexlabs.uk&rsquo;s strategic partnership with HAPE, formed to supercharge HAPE&rsquo;s ecosystem by providing a vital infrastructure layer for Web3 projects&nbsp;and through the integration of tokenomics. Vertexlabs.uk&rsquo;s metaverse, Web3 and AI infrastructure is powered by decentralised edge rendering and offers an unparalleled solution. Its Caduceus metaverse protocol is modular and easy to adopt, with up to 100,000 fast transactions per second, extremely low gas costs and compatibility with EVM. This means developers can use its decentralised real-time edge rendering and AI computing for migration, immersion and streaming.</p><p>The merge also saw the successful integration of $CMP token into HAPE&rsquo;s native ecosystem, enabling holders to purchase on-chain digital clothing within the HAPE marketplace, using CMP, to create a seamless metaverse experience.</p>Ander Tsui, Founder &amp; CEO of Vertexlabs.uk said: &ldquo;Web3 is nothing without content. We have developed the world&rsquo;s first blockchain dedicated to metaverse development and now, by adding Digimental to our stable &ndash; together we can truly push the boundaries of the digital world, providing the infrastructure for the future of fashion and entertainment.&nbsp;HAPE&rsquo;s community is paramount in our growth strategy and we&rsquo;re excited that, through tokenisation and our soon-to-launch staking programme, HAPE and CMP token holders will reap the rewards.&rdquo;Matt Sypien, Founder, Digimental Studio added: &ldquo;Joining forces with Vertex Labs opens up an exciting new chapter for Digimental Studio. As we enter the Hape 2.0 era, our collaboration will push the frontiers of the digital world. Cultivating a loyal and engaged community has always been at the heart of HAPE&rsquo;s success. With Vertex Labs&rsquo; support, we will take this to the next level and offer our community unparalleled access and experiences in Web3. We are excited to forge new partnerships with bands leading the zeitgeist in fashion, music and culture and we are committed to continuing to innovate together.&rdquo;<p>About Vertex Labs </p><p>Vertex Labs is a Metaverse, Web3 and AI infrastructure provider, powered by decentralised, real-time edge rendering engine.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Uwerx is having one of the most successful presale events we have seen this year, but there&rsquo;s more to look forward to as the launch approaches. Having raised over a million dollars, Uwerx is getting the hype it deserves, and smart investors have taken the opportunity to get in early. Following the recent launch of SUI from its presale round, users have become more optimistic about the future of Uwerx.</p>
<p>With the impressive profit return for early buyers on SUI, one wonders if Uwerx can do a 300x or even more. Read on to find out Uwerx&rsquo;s potential to break the market with its pump after launch.</p>
<p>Sui(SUI) Successful Presale Event</p>
<p>Sui is a new layer-1 designated Proof-of-Stake(dPoS) blockchain network that was recently launched, and it looks to improve on existing industry frameworks. The network used the modified version of the new programming language, Move. The language was used by the discontinued Facebook project, Diem, and it&rsquo;s the same language Aptos uses. Interestingly, Sui and Aptos were both created by the same firm, Mysten Labs.</p>
<p>The project launched on May 3, but prior to that, it gave presale allocations to early testers on the network. For $45, they were able to buy up to 1500 SUI tokens, and right after launch, SUI went as high as $1.4, turning the 45 investment into over $2000. These are typical trends with presale tokens, especially with great utility, as you have with Uwerx.</p>
<p>The blockchain network is looking to become a solid network for NFTs and gaming, and considering the growth in both landscapes, there&rsquo;s an opportunity for profit in owning some SUI tokens.</p>
<p>Can Uwerx(WERX) Do A 30x?</p>
<p>Uwerx is the newest solution in a growing global gig industry, and it poses a huge profit opportunity for early adopters. According to Velocity Global, the global freelance industry is estimated to reach 9192.9 million by 2026, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%.</p>
<p>Uwerx is a blockchain-based solution aimed at decentralizing the industry so that more value can go back to users rather than predominant freelance companies in the industry. Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork charge up to 20% fees on transactions on their platform. With Uwerx, that amount is beaten down to 1%, allowing users to keep more to themselves. The 1% fee is also split to give value back to the community.</p>
<p>Uwerx has one unique tokenomics of any blockchain project in recent times. With WERX on presale, the project is offering up over 57% of the supply making the token majorly owned by the community. Another 10% will be in the liquidity pool, which will be locked for 25 years after launch to enable trades.</p>
<p>WERX is a reserve of value and serves as a reward for using the platform. Users can trade it for profit in the future, but there&rsquo;s a much bigger opportunity at the moment. WERX is selling on presale at $0.0315; expert price predictions suggest we could see the price go as high as $1.5 by Q4 of 2023, leaving a profit margin as wide as SUI.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Wondering if Ethereum's proof-of-stake (PoS) surpasses Monero mining in terms of profitability? Join us as we explore this topic and also shine a spotlight on Tradecurve, a unique exchange that revolutionizes trading by seamlessly merging centralized and decentralized features. Don't miss the opportunity to participate in the second presale phase of Tradecurve, where traders can unlock a new level of trading potential.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Is Ethereum PoS More Profitable Than Monero Mining?</p>
<p>Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to PoS has sparked discussions on whether this shift makes Ethereum more lucrative for miners compared to Monero. To shed light on this topic, let's explore the differences between mining these two popular cryptocurrencies and analyze their profit potential.</p>
<p>Mining Ethereum using the PoS mechanism involves validators locking up a certain amount of Ethereum as collateral to participate in the network's consensus protocol. In return, validators receive rewards in the form of additional Ether. On the other hand, Monero mining relies on the traditional PoW mechanism, where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. Miners receive newly minted Monero coins as rewards for their computational efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to profitability, several factors come into play. Ethereum's transition to PoS may lower mining profitability for individual miners, as they would require a significant amount of Ether to stake and participate in the validation process. Additionally, the reduced energy consumption and improved scalability of PoS may contribute to lower transaction fees, impacting miner earnings.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Monero mining, as a PoW-based cryptocurrency, offers opportunities for miners with sufficient computational power to solve complex algorithms. However, Monero's mining difficulty has increased over time, requiring more powerful hardware and increased energy consumption, which can impact profitability.</p>
<p>The choice between Ethereum PoS and Monero mining ultimately depends on individual circumstances and preferences. Miners with access to substantial Ether holdings and an interest in participating in Ethereum's PoS consensus may find it more profitable. Conversely, miners with powerful computational resources and a preference for traditional PoW mining may opt for Monero as a profitable option.</p>
<p>It is important to note that profitability in cryptocurrency mining is subject to various market conditions, network dynamics, and individual mining setups. Factors such as electricity costs, mining hardware efficiency, and the price of the mined cryptocurrency can significantly influence profitability. Therefore, it&rsquo;s difficult to outright say which coin is more profitable to mine in 2023, as it depends on the individual&rsquo;s circumstances and access to hardware.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tradecurve (TCRV)</p>
<p>Tradecurve has made headlines with the launch of its Web3 hybrid exchange. This innovative platform offers users the convenience of trading various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies, bonds, ETFs, CFDs, stocks, OTC derivatives, and forex, all from a single account. With a strong focus on liquidity and global market coverage, Tradecurve is positioned to establish itself as a leading global trading exchange.</p>
<p>One of Tradecurve's key selling points is its unwavering commitment to user privacy. Unlike traditional exchanges, Tradecurve does not require users to share personal data or go through lengthy KYC procedures when signing up. To ensure transparency, the platform incorporates the Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) mechanism, providing users with clarity and standardized pricing across different asset classes.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Tradecurve ecosystem lies its native utility token, $TCRV. This token empowers users with a wide range of benefits, such as automated trading, copy trading, access to trading academies in the metaverse, passive income generation through staking, VIP account status, and reduced subscription and trading fees.</p>
<p>To prioritize security, Tradecurve's development team has conducted thorough audits. Cyber Scope audited the $TCRV token, while AssureDeFi performed a team KYC. Furthermore, the team tokens will remain locked for three years, and the liquidity pool will be locked for two years, ensuring stability and trust.</p>
<p>The success of Tradecurve's stage one presale, which concluded within a week, is evident as the price of $TCRV surged from $0.01 to $0.012. Analysts project a staggering 5,000% price surge during the presale, prompting investors to seize the opportunity and acquire $TCRV before its value continues to rise. Early adopters and presale participants could potentially reap profits of up to 100x, underscoring the significance of getting involved at this early stage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to PoS has sparked discussions on whether this shift makes Ethereum more lucrative for miners compared to Monero. To shed light on this topic, let's explore the differences between mining these two popular cryptocurrencies and analyze their profit potential.</p>
<p>Mining Ethereum using the PoS mechanism involves validators locking up a certain amount of Ethereum as collateral to participate in the network's consensus protocol. In return, validators receive rewards in the form of additional Ether. On the other hand, Monero mining relies on the traditional PoW mechanism, where miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and add blocks to the blockchain. Miners receive newly minted Monero coins as rewards for their computational efforts.</p>
<p>When it comes to profitability, several factors come into play. Ethereum's transition to PoS may lower mining profitability for individual miners, as they would require a significant amount of Ether to stake and participate in the validation process. Additionally, the reduced energy consumption and improved scalability of PoS may contribute to lower transaction fees, impacting miner earnings.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Monero mining, as a PoW-based cryptocurrency, offers opportunities for miners with sufficient computational power to solve complex algorithms. However, Monero's mining difficulty has increased over time, requiring more powerful hardware and increased energy consumption, which can impact profitability.</p>
<p>The choice between Ethereum PoS and Monero mining ultimately depends on individual circumstances and preferences. Miners with access to substantial Ether holdings and an interest in participating in Ethereum's PoS consensus may find it more profitable. Conversely, miners with powerful computational resources and a preference for traditional PoW mining may opt for Monero as a profitable option.</p>
<p>It is important to note that profitability in cryptocurrency mining is subject to various market conditions, network dynamics, and individual mining setups. Factors such as electricity costs, mining hardware efficiency, and the price of the mined cryptocurrency can significantly influence profitability. Therefore, it&rsquo;s difficult to outright say which coin is more profitable to mine in 2023, as it depends on the individual&rsquo;s circumstances and access to hardware.</p>

With a strong focus on liquidity and global market coverage, Tradecurve is positioned to establish itself as a leading global trading exchange.</p>
<p>One of Tradecurve's key selling points is its unwavering commitment to user privacy. Unlike traditional exchanges, Tradecurve does not require users to share personal data or go through lengthy KYC procedures when signing up. To ensure transparency, the platform incorporates the Proof-of-Reserves (PoR) mechanism, providing users with clarity and standardized pricing across different asset classes.</p>
<p>At the heart of the Tradecurve ecosystem lies its native utility token, $TCRV. This token empowers users with a wide range of benefits, such as automated trading, copy trading, access to trading academies in the metaverse, passive income generation through staking, VIP account status, and reduced subscription and trading fees.</p>

<p>The success of Tradecurve's stage one presale, which concluded within a week, is evident as the price of $TCRV surged from $0.01 to $0.012. Analysts project a staggering 5,000% price surge during the presale, prompting investors to seize the opportunity and acquire $TCRV before its value continues to rise.

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Presently, investors are seeking projects that offer huge potential returns and are backed by tangible assets. While certain altcoins such as Polygon (MATIC) have experienced huge price declines, emerging projects like Sparklo have captivated the interest of investors and traders due to its innovative investment approach. This led to the success of Sparklo&rsquo;s stage one presale as the project now thrives in stage two.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; BUY SPRK TOKENS &lt;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Sparklo (SPRK) opens the precious metal industry to all</p>
<p>Sparklo is building an Ethereum-based platform set that will transform precious metals investment. Users will have the opportunity to invest in these metals by purchasing fractional or full portions represented as NFTs. These NFTs will be backed by physical gold, platinum, or silver bars. Also, Sparklo will deliver the actual precious metal to those who acquire the entire NFT.</p>
<p>Sparklo is currently in the second phase of its token presale and the SPRK token is available at just $0.026 apiece. Meanwhile, Sparklo prioritizes customer security and has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit by the InterFi network and successfully completed its KYC procedure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to foster trust and transparency, the platform's liquidity will be locked for 100 years, while team tokens will be locked for 1000 days. The aim is to prevent any sell-off once the project launches. Besides bars of these precious, Sparklo will also collaborate with jewelry stores to provide investors with early access to some jewelry products before they are made available on the market.</p>

<p>Polygon (MATIC) remains bearish despite active addresses spike</p>
<p>The Polygon (MATIC) blockchain has witnessed a surge in user traction lately, fueled by the introduction of new products and advancements. However, Polygon's (MATIC) price is yet to experience a breakout. According to Santiment, the number of Active Addresses (7d) rose by 22%, from 1.21 million to 1.47 million active addresses, between May 10th and May 22nd. If crypto investors continue staking in Polygon (MATIC) and user activity remains high, holders can anticipate a bullish price reversal.</p>
<p>However, data from IntoTheBlock's IOMAP chart reveals that approximately 52,000 investors purchased 4.5 billion MATIC at an average price of $0.95. Despite the accumulation, Polygon (MATIC) faces a significant hurdle and a key resistance at $0.95. By press time, Polygon (MATIC) is trading at $0.870897, an increase of 0.94% in the last 24 hours and a 0.15% increase over the past 7 days.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (PSEC) has issued an advisory warning the public not to invest in Gemini&rsquo;s Gemini Derivatives product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini Derivatives is available to users on the crypto exchange&rsquo;s new Foundation platform and was launched on the 1st of May, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
Philippines SEC Issues Warning
<p>In its advisory, the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Gemini&rsquo;s newly launched derivatives platform had not obtained prior regulatory authorization to operate in the country. The country&rsquo;s regulatory watchdog issued an official warning to the cryptocurrency exchange on the 18th of May. According to Philippine law, derivatives are considered as securities and must be registered with the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission. In its statement, the regulatory authority stated that Gemini did not have the necessary authority or licensing to operate in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission also outlined the punishment for breaching the rules governing the country&rsquo;s securities regulations. According to the authorities, dealers, brokers, salespeople, or agents that promote or sell unregistered securities in the country face paying a fine of 5 million pesos ($89,286). Additionally, they also face a 21-year prison sentence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange warning also mentioned the complaints against Gemini&rsquo;s Earn Program by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The SEC had filed a complaint against the Earn Program in January.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s charges build on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. [&hellip;] It&rsquo;s not optional. It&rsquo;s the law.&rdquo;</p>

New Platform, Same Headache&nbsp;
<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini launched its non-US derivatives platform, called the Gemini Foundation, at the beginning of May. The announcement featured a long list of supported regions, including the Philippines. However, now regulatory authorities have claimed that the derivatives exchange does not have any legal right to operate in the country because it failed to secure regulatory approval for its products. The Philippines SEC further stated that Gemini was marketing derivatives, which are considered as securities in the Philippines. The Philippines SEC stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gemini Trust Company LLC&rsquo;s lack of prior registration with the Commission makes their activities of offering and/or selling securities in the form of derivatives illegal in violation of the provisions of the SRC.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Authorities have also warned members of the public to avoid investing in the exchange and stop any ongoing investments until further notice. Gemini started the Gemini Foundation to avoid regulatory hurdles prevalent in the United States. However, this action by Philippine authorities shows that it could still face problems.&nbsp;</p>
Regulatory Uncertainty In The US&nbsp;
<p>Regulatory authorities in the United States of America have turned up the heat on Gemini in recent months. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has argued that current securities laws are adequate for the crypto space, and new rules are unnecessary. However, the SEC has taken various anti-crypto positions and is embroiled in legal tangles with several crypto firms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result, many crypto firms operating in the US believe that moving away from growing regulatory uncertainty and pressures is the way to go. This has led to a considerable exodus of companies from the US, with several setting up non-US entities to continue global operations. Several alternatives have also emerged, with countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Portugal positioning themselves as crypto hubs. </p>

<p>To become accredited as a digital asset service provider (DASP) OKX has initiated the regulation process with the French regulatory authority - Autorit&eacute; des March&eacute;s Financiers - requiring compliance with various demands such as anti money laundering standards and major shareholder transparency in addition to fulfilling specific criteria pertinent to running trading platforms or safeguarding crypto assets.&nbsp;</p>
Plans to scale French workforce
<p>According to a report on Bloomberg, OKX, thus far domiciled in the Seychelles, will be adding around ten employees in France within six months while aiming at scaling its workforce up to approximately 100 individuals over three years, as stated by an official representative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hong Fang, president of&nbsp; OKX, recognises France's significance in establishing operations for collaborating effectively with European regulators, while France&rsquo;s Digital Minister Jean-Noel Barrot also welcomed the move.</p>
Positive crypto stance in Europe
<p>President Emmanuel Macron's positive outlook on the sector has helped France emerge as a thriving hub for cryptocurrency startups. The UK is also seeking to gain market share of the crypto industry by also welcoming crypto companies, although exacting regulatory standards are somewhat blunting this aim, as was seen recently with the BoE&rsquo;s plans to reject a banking licence for Revolut.</p>
<p>However, both France, the UK, and Europe in general stand to gain significantly from crypto companies turning up on their shores in droves if the Biden administration continues to go ahead with its extremely negative stance towards crypto.</p>
<p>The newly passed MiCA regulation obliges crypto companies that intend to operate within the European Union to register with one of its member states beginning January 2025.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Malaysia&rsquo;s securities regulator, the Securities Commission, has ordered cryptocurrency exchange Huobi to cease all operations in the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The action came after the regulator raised compliance concerns, stating that it had failed to register its digital asset exchange before commencing operations.&nbsp;</p>
All Activity To Be Stopped&nbsp;
<p>Huobi Global seems to have fallen foul of the country&rsquo;s securities regulator. The Securities Commission Malaysia issued an official statement on the 22nd of May, stating that Huobi Global had failed to register as a cryptocurrency exchange operator in the country. As a result, the exchange must shutter all operations in the country. Furthermore, the Securities Commission also directed Huobi to disable its mobile application on Google Play Store and Apple Store and disable its website. The exchange is also expected to stop all advertising related to its services and products targeted at Malaysian users via social media and email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the regulatory authorities in Malaysia, operating a cryptocurrency exchange without a Recognised Market Operator (RMO) license counts as an offense under the country&rsquo;s Capital Markets and Services Act 2007. The authorities also issued a public reprimand against the exchange and its founder Leon Li. Li is also expected to oversee the process of Huobi winding down its operations in the country.&nbsp;</p>
Compliance Issues&nbsp;
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia, in its communication, explained that its decision was driven by concerns about Huobi&rsquo;s compliance with local regulatory requirements. With the exchange failing to get SCM registration, authorities have directed investors to stop all trading activity on the platform, withdraw their funds, and close all accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Huobi Global has been in the sights of Malaysian regulatory authorities since August 2022. At the time, the Securities Commission Malaysia had issued an investor alert sounding out users that the exchange was operating without the requisite permissions.&nbsp;</p>
Huobi Responds&nbsp;
<p>Huobi Global had recently undergone a complete rebranding in 2022 following its acquisition by About Capital Buyout Fund. Following reports of the enforcement action by the Securities Commission Malaysia, a Huobi spokesperson clarified that the current order does not pertain to the Huobi that is operational after the change in ownership.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In response to recent reports, we would like to clarify that the situation outlined pertains to the previous Huobi entity and former shareholders. This is not associated with the current Huobi platform, which adheres to strict regulatory compliance globally. &ldquo;</p>

A Difficult Space To Operate In&nbsp;
<p>Following the initial announcement, Huobi had indicated that it was locked in discussions with Malaysian authorities regarding its regional operations. In November 2020, the company launched Huobi Labuan, a brokerage firm that had a temporary window to offer users cryptocurrency spot and derivatives trading. In 2022, Binance finally managed to gain a foothold in the Malaysian crypto space by acquiring a stake in trading platform MX Global.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During its initial foray into the market, Binance had found itself in a similar predicament as Huobi, with authorities ordering the exchange to cease operations in the country. According to the authorities, Binance did not have the necessary regulatory approvals in place to carry out operations. According to the Securities Commission Malaysia website, only four companies are recognized and allowed to operate cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. These are MX Global, Sinegy, Luno Malaysia, and Tokenize Technology. However, this list has not been updated in some time, with its last update coming in August 2022.&nbsp;</p>
A Malaysian CBDC?&nbsp;
<p>In 2021, Malaysia&rsquo;s Central Bank announced that it was working on a Proof-of-Concept to help enhance its technical and policy capabilities, should it issue a CBDC in the future. It also joined a trial with the Bank for International Settlements. A CBDC, or Central Bank Digital Currency, is a digital asset issued by the central bank and gets its value from a nation&rsquo;s legal tender. In March, Zahidi Zainul, Deputy Minister of Communications and Multimedia, stated that the country must recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency exchange Gemini has revealed that Genesis parent entity DCG has missed a $630 million loan payment that was due last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exchange added that it is working with DCG, Genesis, and other creditors to provide forbearance and help DCG avoid a default.&nbsp;</p>
Another Payment Missed&nbsp;
<p>The payment is in relation to a loan made by Gemini to the now-bankrupt lender Genesis, a subsidiary of DCG. Gemini had warned earlier in the month that if DCG is unable to make the required loan repayment or restructure its debt, then the digital assets conglomerate would be at risk of defaulting on its obligations. At the beginning of the year, Cameron Winklevoss, Gemini CEO, had threatened to sue Barry Silbert and DCG relating to a $900 million loan. This was after Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy amidst a wave of allegations and ongoing disputes about loan repayments. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission had also accused the firms of selling unregistered securities through their Earn Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gemini shared an update on the company&rsquo;s website, stating that it was exploring the possibility of granting forbearance to DCG in an effort to avoid a default. A spokesperson for Genesis stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genesis and its creditors, represented by the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, the Ad Hoc Group of Genesis Lenders, and Gemini Trust, are working collaboratively to address Digital Currency Group&rsquo;s nonpayment of approximately $627 million in dollars and BTC that was due last week during the ongoing mediation period. Among other things, as part of the ongoing mediation process, the parties are discussing potential terms of forbearance, a standalone chapter 11 plan for Genesis, and other options to recover assets and maximize value to stakeholders.&rdquo;</p>

An Amended Reorganization Plan&nbsp;
<p>If a scenario arises where a resolution cannot be reached, Gemini has proposed presenting an amended reorganization plan. This plan would be proposed independently and would not require the involvement or consent of DCG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;DCG continues to be engaged with the various stakeholders in the Genesis Capital restructuring process pursuant to the 30-day mediation period entered into by all parties on the 1st of May.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gemini added in its update,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Consideration will be based in part on whether the parties believe DCG will engage in good faith negotiations on a consensual deal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Cameron Winklevoss has repeatedly accused DCG CEO Silbert of acting in bad faith and using stall tactics.&nbsp;</p>
Gemini Places Extension Request&nbsp;
<p>Gemini&rsquo;s Legal representatives also requested an extension of the deadline to file a Chapter 11 reorganization plan. The request, filed in the Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, seeks a 100-day extension to the original deadline. The reorganization plan would have &ldquo;Gemini&rsquo;s input if not outright support.&rdquo; The extension request could give all parties involved additional time to navigate through the complex bankruptcy proceedings and facilitate ongoing efforts by the debtors to achieve a value-maximizing restructuring plan without hindering any competing plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the request is granted, Genesis would have time until the 27th of August 2023 to file the restructuring plan, and Genesis would have until the 26th of October to accept it. Gemini also added that it was preparing the &ldquo;Gemini Master Claim.&rdquo; The Master Claim would go after the over $1.1 billion Gemini claims it is owed by Genesis. According to the exchange, Genesis has reportedly refused to return funds to over 232,000 users who were part of Gemini&rsquo;s Earn program and had active loans as of the 19th of January, 2023. Gemini had to freeze its Earn program after Genesis froze withdrawals in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO, a pioneering DeFi protocol, has initiated a vote on a proposal that would allow its delegates to maintain anonymity and keep their whereabouts undisclosed.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Co-founder Rune Christensen is leading the proposal, which, if approved, would make anonymity a mandatory requirement for eligible voters. The proposal includes consequences for delegates who reveal their identities publicly, with the forfeiture of their rewards as a penalty. Community members who provide evidence of such wrongdoing would also be eligible for rewards.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">Christensen believes that this measure would reduce the vulnerability of delegates to criminal targeting and prevent them from using personal relationships to influence outcomes. By keeping delegates' identities secret, the proposal aims to enhance security and minimize the risk of hacking attempts.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">On-chain data indicates that MakerDAO's Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a metric measuring supply concentration, has increased. With a current value of 0.022, the higher index suggests that funds are more concentrated in certain addresses, indicating lower competition within the network.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">However, the HHI has limitations in defining the specific market being examined. For instance, it may fail to account for situations where one company dominates a particular segment or holds a monopoly over a specific product or service, despite the overall market appearing competitive based on the HHI calculation.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Geographic factors can also impact market concentration. Companies with equal market shares operating in different geographic regions may effectively have a monopoly within their respective markets. This can lead to situations where the HHI value increases significantly in specific areas, even if the overall market appears competitive.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Despite recent fluctuations, MakerDAO's Total Value Locked (TVL) remains in second place behind Lido Finance (LDO). The TVL represents the total amount of assets locked in a protocol. At present, MakerDAO's TVL stands at $6.87 billion, reflecting a 7.30% decrease in the past 30 days, indicating a decline in liquidity and overall protocol health.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Turning to the price of MKR, data from CoinMarketCap reveals a 12.19% decrease in value over the past month-to-date cycle.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Historical Significance</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The historical relevance of MakerDAO as a pioneering DeFi protocol lies in its role as a model in terms of market concentration and how this affects the ecosystem in general. Where market dynamics and competition are at play, protocols such as MakerDAO whose decentralized stablecoins (as opposed, for example, to dollar-collateralized stablecoins such as Circle's USDC) provide a nuanced factor to liquidity provision. The protocol introduced the concept of decentralized stablecoins and played a crucial role in shaping the early DeFi ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Founded in 2014, MakerDAO sought to address the volatility and lack of stability in the cryptocurrency market by creating DAI, a decentralized stablecoin pegged to the value of the US dollar. Unlike traditional stablecoins that rely on centralized reserves, DAI achieves its stability through an innovative system of overcollateralization and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The introduction of DAI marked a significant milestone in the development of DeFi. It provided users with a stable and decentralized medium of exchange, enabling them to participate in various DeFi applications without being subject to the volatility of other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO's decentralized governance model also set a precedent for other DeFi protocols. The protocol introduced the concept of MKR tokens, which serve as both the governance token and the collateral asset for creating DAI. MKR holders have the power to vote on important decisions related to the protocol, such as changes to risk parameters and system upgrades.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO also pioneered the concept of decentralized lending and borrowing. Through the integration of smart contracts and collateralized debt positions (CDPs), users can lock their crypto assets as collateral to generate DAI loans. This innovative lending mechanism unlocked new opportunities for individuals to access liquidity without relying on traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The success and resilience of MakerDAO throughout the years have made it a cornerstone of the DeFi landscape. Its protocol has proven to be robust, providing stability during market downturns and gaining popularity among DeFi enthusiasts. MakerDAO's role as a decentralized governance platform and a provider of stablecoins has inspired the development of numerous other DeFi projects that have contributed to the growth and expansion of the ecosystem.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Recent Developments</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO recently announced the launch of the Spark Protocol, which offers competitive interest rates for users and holders of the DAI stablecoin. Spark Protocol's first product, Spark Lend, is linked to MakerDAO's Direct Deposit DAI Module (D3M), enabling users to borrow DAI at attractive rates. The protocol aims to improve DAI lending capabilities, increase liquidity options, and provide yield-bearing versions of DAI.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">As part of MakerDAO's Endgame plan, the Spark Protocol is designed to enhance stability and liquidity. MakerDAO proposes making DAI a free-floating asset collateralized by real-world assets, while maintaining its peg to the dollar for three years. The plan also involves accumulating more Ethereum (ETH) to increase the ratio of decentralized collateral supporting DAI.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO has proposed a new constitution to formalize governance processes and protect against potential threats. The constitution employs "alignment engineering" to solidify the core commitments of the community and establish different categories of participants with varying powers and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MakerDAO's initiatives into pushing for anonymous delegates while addressing supply concentration concerns are a welcome development in the DeFi space, providing further balance in the ecosystem.</p>

			  <description><![CDATA[<p class="md-end-block md-p">ConsenSys, the blockchain technology firm behind the widely used crypto wallet MetaMask, has addressed recent rumors claiming that it collects taxes from cryptocurrency users.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company took to Twitter on May 22 to clarify that the rumors were based on a misinterpretation of MetaMask's terms of service, asserting that MetaMask does not collect taxes on crypto transactions and that no changes have been made to the terms of service to enable such collection.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The misunderstanding arose from a section in MetaMask's terms of service that mentioned the company's right to collect or apply taxes where required or relevant. However, ConsenSys clarified that this section only applies to products and paid plans offered by the company and is unrelated to on-chain crypto transactions. It is crucial to understand that MetaMask does not collect taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">📢 We are aware of tweets circulating with inaccurate information about ConsenSys' terms of service. Let's clarify one thing upfront: MetaMask does NOT collect taxes on crypto transactions and we have not made any changes to our terms to do so. This claim is false.</p>
&mdash; ConsenSys (@ConsenSys) May 21, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The allegations were pointed out by a Twitter user by the name of Kashif Raza, who claimed that MetaMask, in the same way that the Ledger cold storage wallet does, allows for the deduction of taxes and sales taxes for products purchased from the company, similar to how other e-commerce platforms operate. While the misinformation gained traction within the crypto community, with discussions on platforms like Reddit and Twitter, some users quickly pointed out the misinterpretation. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For context, ConsenSys is a leading blockchain technology company founded by Joseph Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. ConsenSys focuses on developing and supporting various decentralized applications (dApps) and infrastructure projects within the blockchain ecosystem. MetaMask, one of ConsenSys' flagship products, is a popular browser extension that allows users to manage their Ethereum wallets and interact with decentralized applications seamlessly.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Examining the terms of service further, it becomes clear that they encompass various aspects of user responsibilities and rights when using the MetaMask platform and its affiliated spaces such as forums and internal media. The terms include provisions regarding acceptable use, content standards, account management, ownership of content, enforcement, disclaimers, limits on liability, termination, and dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">ConsenSys also emphasized that users retain sole responsibility for the content they submit to the MetaMask forum and that the company does not claim ownership rights over users' intellectual property. Users grant the company a license to provide their submitted content to other forum users, allowing the company to copy, publish, and analyze the content within the forum's scope.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In terms of enforcement, ConsenSys reserves the right to investigate and prosecute violations of the terms to the fullest extent permitted by law. The company may also cooperate with law enforcement authorities when necessary. Notably, ConsenSys is also able to restrict, suspend, or close user accounts on the forum based on its policies or reasonable belief of rule violations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The terms also cover the user's responsibility to maintain the security of their account, select a secure password, and promptly notify the company if they suspect any account compromise. Users must ensure that the content they submit adheres to legal requirements, respects intellectual property rights, and does not violate any agreements they have with others.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These terms of service, as such, are specific to the MetaMask forum and affiliated media spaces, and hence do not extend to MetaMask's core functionalities as a crypto wallet. MetaMask remains a widely trusted and mainstream tool among Web3 users, specifically for securely managing digital assets and interacting with decentralized applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p"> ConsenSys' clarification on the status of MetaMask, that it does not ostensibly 'collect' taxes on crypto transaction, forms an appropriate response to the rumors, which the firm claims are based on a misinterpretation of the Web3 wallet's terms of service. However, this could also be a case of failure in terms of communicating the firm's intentions: it could have been a well-meaning gesture to protect user privacy, but instead, was misinterpreted and ultimately spun off as a malicious rumor.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In this sense, ConsenSys' clarification thus asserts that the terms solely pertain to products and paid plans offered by the company. It is important for users to carefully read and understand the terms of service of any platform they use, ensuring accurate interpretation to avoid misinformation and unnecessary concerns within the crypto community.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MetaMask has been involved previously with rumors of a $10 million exploit, which it also denied. The Web3 wallet recently launched fiat-to-crypto functions for its Portfolio product. The developers behind MetaMask have also rolled out $ETH purchases through an integration with PayPal.</p>

<p class="md-end-block md-p">The company took to Twitter on May 22 to clarify that the rumors were based on a misinterpretation of MetaMask's terms of service, asserting that MetaMask does not collect taxes on crypto transactions and that no changes have been made to the terms of service to enable such collection.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The misunderstanding arose from a section in MetaMask's terms of service that mentioned the company's right to collect or apply taxes where required or relevant. However, ConsenSys clarified that this section only applies to products and paid plans offered by the company and is unrelated to on-chain crypto transactions. It is crucial to understand that MetaMask does not collect taxes on cryptocurrency transactions.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">📢 We are aware of tweets circulating with inaccurate information about ConsenSys' terms of service. Let's clarify one thing upfront: MetaMask does NOT collect taxes on crypto transactions and we have not made any changes to our terms to do so. This claim is false.</p>
&mdash; ConsenSys (@ConsenSys) May 21, 2023
<p>

</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p md-focus">The allegations were pointed out by a Twitter user by the name of Kashif Raza, who claimed that MetaMask, in the same way that the Ledger cold storage wallet does, allows for the deduction of taxes and sales taxes for products purchased from the company, similar to how other e-commerce platforms operate. While the misinformation gained traction within the crypto community, with discussions on platforms like Reddit and Twitter, some users quickly pointed out the misinterpretation. </p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">For context, ConsenSys is a leading blockchain technology company founded by Joseph Lubin, one of the co-founders of Ethereum. ConsenSys focuses on developing and supporting various decentralized applications (dApps) and infrastructure projects within the blockchain ecosystem. MetaMask, one of ConsenSys' flagship products, is a popular browser extension that allows users to manage their Ethereum wallets and interact with decentralized applications seamlessly.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">Examining the terms of service further, it becomes clear that they encompass various aspects of user responsibilities and rights when using the MetaMask platform and its affiliated spaces such as forums and internal media. The terms include provisions regarding acceptable use, content standards, account management, ownership of content, enforcement, disclaimers, limits on liability, termination, and dispute resolution.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">ConsenSys also emphasized that users retain sole responsibility for the content they submit to the MetaMask forum and that the company does not claim ownership rights over users' intellectual property. Users grant the company a license to provide their submitted content to other forum users, allowing the company to copy, publish, and analyze the content within the forum's scope.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In terms of enforcement, ConsenSys reserves the right to investigate and prosecute violations of the terms to the fullest extent permitted by law. The company may also cooperate with law enforcement authorities when necessary. Notably, ConsenSys is also able to restrict, suspend, or close user accounts on the forum based on its policies or reasonable belief of rule violations.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">The terms also cover the user's responsibility to maintain the security of their account, select a secure password, and promptly notify the company if they suspect any account compromise. Users must ensure that the content they submit adheres to legal requirements, respects intellectual property rights, and does not violate any agreements they have with others.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">These terms of service, as such, are specific to the MetaMask forum and affiliated media spaces, and hence do not extend to MetaMask's core functionalities as a crypto wallet. MetaMask remains a widely trusted and mainstream tool among Web3 users, specifically for securely managing digital assets and interacting with decentralized applications.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p"> ConsenSys' clarification on the status of MetaMask, that it does not ostensibly 'collect' taxes on crypto transaction, forms an appropriate response to the rumors, which the firm claims are based on a misinterpretation of the Web3 wallet's terms of service. However, this could also be a case of failure in terms of communicating the firm's intentions: it could have been a well-meaning gesture to protect user privacy, but instead, was misinterpreted and ultimately spun off as a malicious rumor.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">In this sense, ConsenSys' clarification thus asserts that the terms solely pertain to products and paid plans offered by the company. It is important for users to carefully read and understand the terms of service of any platform they use, ensuring accurate interpretation to avoid misinformation and unnecessary concerns within the crypto community.</p>
<p class="md-end-block md-p">MetaMask has been involved previously with rumors of a $10 million exploit, which it also denied. The Web3 wallet recently launched fiat-to-crypto functions for its Portfolio product. The developers behind MetaMask have also rolled out $ETH purchases through an integration with PayPal.</p>
