            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The regulatory tension in the United States has caused many large crypto-focused companies to look abroad, and Gemini is no exception.</p>
<p>The firm led by the Winklevoss twins <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ireland-greenlights-gemini-to-provide-crypto-services-in-the-country/" data-wpel-link="internal">has managed</a> to secure a license to operate as a Virtual Asset Service Provider in Ireland. The company said it will host its European operation in Dublin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, took the opportunity to formally <a href="https://twitter.com/LeoVaradkar/status/1661717592665358337" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">congratulate</a> Gemini.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>Gemini &#8211; the first firm registered by the Central Bank of Ireland as a Virtual Asset Service Provider. This is significant for Ireland as the Government foccuses on innovation as a driver of growth. I wish Gemini every success as they build their team in Ireland.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In addition, the PM also said that the company&#8217;s decision to base operations in Ireland &#8220;highlights&#8221; their &#8220;competitive offering for the international financial services sector.&#8221;</li>
<li>Per recent <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/2023/05/25/crypto-exchange-gemini-names-dublin-as-european-hq/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">reports</a>, Gemini has also announced plans to establish its headquarters for its EU operations in Dublin.</li>
<li>This comes ahead of the introduction of the world&#8217;s first comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency assets across the EU &#8211; MiCA.</li>

			            <description><![CDATA[The city-state's securities watchdog had unveiled new plans to enable retail investor access to virtual assets platforms.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Huobi Global announced gearing up for the launch of its Hong Kong division on June 1st for users in the city-state. The expansion comes in the backdrop of the Hong Kong securities regulator &#8211; Securities and Futures Commission&#8217;s (SFC) decision &#8211; to allow retail trading in cryptocurrencies has come after a year of turmoil in the sector.</p>
<p>The new venue in the special administrative region of China called Huobi Hong Kong will be &#8220;fully compliant with local regulations and offer a range of trading pairs and services to customers.&#8221; At launch, the users will be able to trade Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Tron (TRX), and Huobi Token (HT).</p>

<h2>Huobi Rebranding and Expansion</h2>
<p>As the first <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/ht-shots-up-7-as-huobi-announced-expansion-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">step</a> of its expansion plans, Huobi underwent a rebranding in November last year after the company&#8217;s acquisition by About Capital Buyout Fund the previous month. It sought to establish a presence in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The crypto exchange also said it will also ramp up its investments across Southeast Asia, Europe, and other regions while simultaneously exploring strategic mergers and acquisitions to expand its ecosystem, as well.</p>
<p>However, its tryst with the Malaysian regulatory agency was a setback. The Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM), in a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/malaysian-regulator-orders-huobi-to-halt-its-illegal-operations-in-the-country-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">statement</a> on May 22, said Huobi Global failed to register as a crypto exchange operator and was ordered to cease all activity. It was also directed to disable its website and mobile applications on Apple Store and Google Play.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Web3 Advancement</h2>
<p>Hong Kong <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hong-kong-confirms-crypto-commitment-at-web3-conference-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">confirmed</a> its stance of powering ahead to position itself as a regional crypto hub amidst an industry-wide clampdown in the West after Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po reiterated the city&#8217;s crypto commitments at the Hong Kong Web3 Festival in April.</p>
<p>To that extent, Hong Kong&#8217;s SFC released a <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">report</a> on the consultation on policy recommendations earlier this week, agreeing to enable licensed virtual asset providers (VASPs) to cater to retail investors, provided that operators assess an understanding of the risks involved.</p>
<p>The guidelines for the VASPs will include requirements in terms of asset custody safety, cybersecurity standards as well as the segregation of client assets. All platforms associated with the digital asset industry in Hong Kong are required to apply for licenses under the new regime, failing which would result in fines and jail terms.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world of crypto is ever-changing, with the emergence of ChatGPT transforming the way traders conduct research and analysis.</p>
<p>The analytical prowess of ChatGPT has allowed traders to gain insights into the future price trajectories of cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum – adding a valuable tool to their trading toolkit.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not just about the big players. ChatGPT is also now being used to uncover hidden gems in the market – with meme coin <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes (WSM)</a> surfacing as one of the most promising projects in the space.</p>
<h2>Crypto Market Outlook Remains Bullish According to ChatGPT</h2>
<p>Leveraging its powerful predictive capabilities, ChatGPT has been making headlines after giving its AI-powered perspective on the current state of the crypto market.</p>
<p>Big players like Bitcoin and Ethereum have taken a tumble in recent weeks, with investors unsettled by the stagnation in discussions to elevate the US debt ceiling.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ChatGPT analysis suggests that the current bearish momentum is only a blip – and that the market could bounce back in the latter half of the year.</p>
<p>Per ChatGPT, Bitcoin’s value could soar to between $40,000 and $45,000 in the next six months, which would mean an increase of between 51% and 70%, based on the current price.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252596" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-3.jpg" alt="Picture1" width="602" height="333" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-3-300x166.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture1-3-50x28.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, ChatGPT estimates that Ethereum’s price could regain the $3,000 price point by the end of the year. This price point hasn’t been touched since April 2022 and would be a 65% leap from today’s price.</p>
<p>Byeond Bitcoin and Ethereum, ChatGPT anticipates a rebound for the meme coin veteran, Dogecoin. The model projects that DOGE could hit $0.12 by the end of 2023 – a healthy 69% increase.</p>
<p>These optimistic forecasts will be warmly received by crypto bulls, who&#8217;ve recently observed a 10% or more drop in most major coins.</p>
<p>On a less positive note, there are several cryptos that ChatGPT isn&#8217;t too hot on – and Pepe Coin is the most notable one.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252597" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-4.jpg" alt="Picture2" width="602" height="255" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-4-300x127.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture2-4-50x21.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>According to ChatGPT, the PEPE price could fall back to $0.0000010 by the end of the year – and potentially even lower.</p>
<p>Should this happen, Pepe Coin would trade 77% below its all-time high from May 5.</p>
<p>Barring its skeptical take on Pepe Coin, ChatGPT suggests a promising rally for major coins in the year&#8217;s latter half – which will be welcome news to crypto investors.</p>
<h2>ChatGPT Predicts Exponential Growth for Wall Street Memes After Raising $100,000</h2>
<p>Although ChatGPT is optimistic about the crypto market’s future, many investors remain on the lookout for alternatives in case these scenarios don’t materialize.</p>
<p>One alternative gaining traction in the market is<a href="https://wallstmemes.com/en" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Wall Street Memes (WSM)</a> – a new cryptocurrency inspired by the Wall Street Bets movement.</p>
<p>Wall Street Memes seeks to leverage the momentum sparked by this movement in 2021 during the whirlwind that was the GameStop short squeeze.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-4.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252598" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-4.jpg" alt="Picture3" width="602" height="295" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-4.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-4-300x147.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture3-4-50x25.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>The Wall Street Memes project already boasts over 400,000 followers across its social media profiles, highlighting the incredible community backing it has.</p>
<p>This backing stems from the massive popularity of the<a href="https://twitter.com/wallstbullsNFT" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> Wall St Bulls NFT</a> collection, launched in 2021. The collection was an instant success, selling out within 32 minutes.</p>
<p>According to<a href="https://opensea.io/collection/wall-street-bulls" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> OpenSea</a>, 1,861 ETH worth of these NFTs have been traded since their launch – equating to over $3.3 million.</p>
<p>Now, the Wall Street Memes team has just launched its own token, WSM, allowing community members to potentially profit from the community&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-3.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252599" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-3.jpg" alt="Picture4" width="602" height="220" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-3.jpg 602w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-3-300x110.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Picture4-3-50x18.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px" /></a></p>
<p>ChatGPT is already optimistic about WSM’s prospects, believing it could explode in value once listed on major exchanges.</p>
<p>Per ChatGPT, WSM could ride a wave of excitement and enthusiasm following its exchange listing – propelling the token to the $0.15 level, a “significant increase” from its current price.</p>
<p>Such an event would signify a remarkable 500% increase from the ongoing presale price of $0.025 in stage 1, which is set to rise to $0.0337 by the final presale stage.</p>
<p>The hype is already beginning to build around Wall Street Memes’ prospects, with the project’s<a href="https://discord.com/invite/4E538pzeGX" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"> official Discord server</a> seeing a massive influx of new members.</p>
<p>Adding to the hype, the <a href="https://bs_54c27399.cryptopotato.care" data-wpel-link="exclude" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Memes</a> presale raised a staggering $100,000 within the first 24 hours of being live, indicating investors&#8217; eagerness to get involved while the token price is still low.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[With transition to Voltaire, CIP-1694 is expected to lay down the foundations for decentralized decision-making. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes the project’s decentralization would act as a &#8220;wake-up&#8221; call for the industry.</p>
<p>In a recent update to the community, Hoskinson said ADA is &#8220;substantially more decentralized&#8221; than all cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>
<ul>
<li>The exec <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfL2U2hAGWw" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="external">stressed</a> that the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP-1694) &#8211; which is a mechanism for on-chain governance that will underpin the Voltaire phase of the network &#8211; will prove to be a game-changer in the decentralization debate.</li>
<li>The proposal will enable Cardano users to submit a governance action that will be ratified by three groups &#8211; a Constitutional Committee, a group of delegation representatives (DReps), and stake pool operators (SPOs) &#8211; thereby ensuring that the community has a final say in the functioning of the Cardano ecosystem.</li>
<li>CIP-1594 is still up for discussion and is likely to be released in July this year.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, Hoskinson asserted that Cardano inching closer to more and more decentralized could potentially help the project become part of crypto regulatory frameworks.</li>
<li>He said that decentralization metrics might become a crucial part of regulatory standards while adding that regulatory agencies may eventually end up treating a crypto project with more decentralization as a protocol or a commodity.</li>
<li>Separately, the Cardano network <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-network-recovers-after-brief-outage-triggered-by-transient-anomaly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">suffered</a> a brief outage due to a &#8220;transient anomaly&#8221; in January this year that was fixed within minutes.</li>
<li>More recently, Input Output Global (IOG) &#8211; the organization behind the development of the blockchain &#8211; <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/cardano-launches-valentine-upgrade-for-secp-cryptographic-primitives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">launched</a> a valentine upgrade for its Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SECP) primitives to allow devs to use a broader range of native multi-signature designs to develop secure and cost-effective DApps.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other banks such as </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/22/goldman-sachs-experiments-with-chatgpt-like-ai-to-help-devs-write-code.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Goldman Sachs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/14/morgan-stanley-testing-openai-powered-chatbot-for-its-financial-advisors.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">Morgan Stanley</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> have already begun testing AI technology for internal use. The former is leveraging ChatGPT-style tech to help developers automatically generate and test code, while the latter is testing an OpenAI-powered chatbot to answer queries for its 16,000 financial advisors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, according to trademark attorney Josh Gerben, JP Morgan’s product may be the first GPT-like financial product designed for use by retail customers. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a real indication they might have a potential product to launch in the near future,” Gerben said. “Companies like JPMorgan don’t just file trademarks for the fun of it.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gerben added that JP Morgan’s filing includes a “sworn statement from a corporate officer” confirming that the bank intends to use the trademark. Trademarks typically take close to a year to be approved, after which the bank will have three years to actually launch IndexGPT. </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s an A.I. program to select financial securities,” Gerben said. “This sounds to me like they’re trying to put my financial advisor out of business.”</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Financial commentator and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff was less than optimistic about JP Morgan’s plans for AI-based investment advice. “I wonder if the advice given by AI will be just as bad as the advice their human advisors have been giving,” he </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1661875000960331776" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: 400">tweeted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the bank on Thursday. </span></p>
<h2>ChatGPT’s Views on Crypto</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When asked for concrete investment advice (ex. “should I buy Bitcoin”), the original ChatGPT says it “cannot provide specific investment advice” because it does not “have access to real-time market data or financial information.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the bot </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/chatgpt-predicts-what-will-happen-with-btcs-price-during-and-after-the-2024-bitcoin-halving/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">noted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> this week that Bitcoin’s price has the potential to surge after the 2024 Bitcoin halving, due to a “reduction in [BTC] supply, coupled with continued demand or increased market interest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When </span><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/we-asked-chatgpt-what-is-the-future-of-meme-coins-like-doge-shib-and-pepe-heres-the-answer/" data-wpel-link="internal"><span style="font-weight: 400">asked</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the future of memecoins like Dogecoin ($DOGE) Shiba Inu ($SHIB) and Pepe ($PEPE), the bot said their success is driven by “brand recognition, celebrity endorsements, and online trends.</span></p>

			            <description><![CDATA[This week, Bitcoin was trading mostly in a very tight range between $26K and $27K. Meanwhile, VCs continue to pour hundreds of millions in the industry. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are exciting weeks in the cryptocurrency market, and then there are weeks like the last one. It felt like the last seven days were a constant chop for Bitcoin, bouncing between $26K and $27K with absolutely no particular direction.</p>
<p>The market is trading more or less where it was last week, and it currently sits at $1.17 billion per data from CoinGecko. This comes on the back of minor movements from major coins such as Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP, Cardano, and others. In fact, Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance is also almost the same as it was last week, showing that the market has remained in equilibrium &#8211; more or less.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that interesting things didn&#8217;t happen elsewhere. The CEO of OpenAI (ChatGPT developers) &#8211; Sam Altman &#8211; managed to successfully close a series C at $115 million for his crypto-focused project called Worldcoin.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, it seems high-resolution retina scans are coming.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. Do Kwon &#8211; the infamous founder of the failed Terra ecosystem &#8211; was denied bail? Interestingly, this came following initial reports that the government of Montenegro is prepared to release him on bail worth over $400K. Later, the bail was denied. This means that he will continue staying at the local jail.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also had a few interesting conversations with ChatGPT that you might be fond of going through. For instance, we asked it what will happen to Bitcoin&#8217;s price during and after the upcoming halving in 2024, and the answer was somewhat interesting.</p>
<p>All in all, the past seven days failed to provide much of excitement, but it might as well be the calm before the storm. If one thing is for sure, it&#8217;s that crypto markets don&#8217;t like staying dormant for too long, so a huge move can be just around the corner.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;">Market Data</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Market Cap: $1,170B | 24H Vol: $34B | BTC Dominance: 44.3%</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">BTC: $26,807 (-0%) | ETH: $1,833 (+1.3%) | BNB: $307 (-0.7%)</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[Will PEPE be the next SHIB? Will any meme coin dethrone Dogecoin? Let's see what ChatGPT has to say.]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Meme coins are undoubtedly already embedded in the crypto culture as they&#8217;ve left their mark on the industry. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu (SHIB), and most recently &#8211; PEPE Coin have all taken the field by storm and continue to perform.</p>
<p>The question is &#8211; what is their future? Will they remain a prominent part of the industry or will they eventually fall into oblivion?</p>
<p>We decided to poke the artificial brain of ChatGPT &#8211; the popular AI-based language model that&#8217;s also causing ripples in the fintech industry.</p>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover.jpg" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-252582" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover.jpg" alt="memecoins_chatgpt_cover" width="1201" height="720" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover.jpg 1201w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover-300x180.jpg 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover-768x460.jpg 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/memecoins_chatgpt_cover-50x30.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1201px) 100vw, 1201px" /></a></p>
<h2>ChatGPT on the Future of Meme Coins</h2>
<p>The AI-based chatbot doesn&#8217;t like giving financial advice, and neither do we. That said, please keep in mind that none of the following should be construed as such &#8211; it&#8217;s solely for entertainment and educational purposes. After all, these are the thoughts of an AI.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking&#8221; of them, ChatGPT argued that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE gained significant popularity and attention due to their association with Internet memes and viral content. These coins often rely on community-driven initiatives and social media engagement to attract users and investors. Their success is largely driven by factors such as brand recognition, celebrity endorsements, and online trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, it seems ChatGPT has it right. DOGE has Elon Musk behind it, <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-shiba-inu-shib/" data-wpel-link="internal">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> had the power of the trend, while PEPE Coin took the world by storm by riding the popularity of the meme Pepe the Frog.</p>
<p>ChatGPT argues that their future is based on multiple factors, and predicting it is quite challenging. These include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regulatory developments</li>
<li>Market conditions</li>
<li>Investor sentiment</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s possible that some meme coins may continue to gain attention and maintain a certain level of popularity, while others may fade away or be overshadowed by new trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>If one thing is certain, though, it&#8217;s that the AI warns of the risks associated with investing in such coins. They are highly volatile, and seeking advice from a professional is advised.</p>
<p>We also decided to poke ChatGPT a bit more on PEPE since it&#8217;s the latest hit on the market.</p>
<h2>What Does ChatGPT Think of PEPE Coin?</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-pepe/" data-wpel-link="internal">PEPE Coin</a> is a meme coin that took the market by storm and, at one point, had a market cap of almost $2 billion &#8211; less than a month after it launched.</p>
<p>This created tremendous hype in the industry and beyond, and the coin became an overnight (kind of) success story for many investors.</p>
<p>ChatGPT says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The PEPE meme coin aims to capitalize on the popularity of the Pepe the Frog meme and create a community-driven cryptocurrency. Like other meme coins, it relies on social media engagement, community support, and online trends to generate interest and attract investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, there you have it. ChatGPT says that some meme coins might outlast others based on the dynamics of their developments and communities. It&#8217;s interesting to see if PEPE will outperform SHIB in the next cycle or if any meme coin will dethrone Dogecoin.</p>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we take a closer look at Ethereum, Ripple, Cardano, Tron, and Litecoin.</p>
<h2>Ethereum (ETH)</h2>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s volatility increased this past week but failed to break above the key resistance at $1,820. For this reason, the price is at a similar point to last week.</p>
<p>This consolidation under the key resistance is unlikely to last, and bulls appear eager to break away. On Tuesday, buyers briefly took the price over the key level, but sellers were quick to reverse the price action back under $1,820.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, bulls could take ETH into a renewed rally next week and turn the current resistance into support. If successful, this cryptocurrency will turn bullish and rally to $1,900 and $2,000 next.</p>
<figure id="attachment_252486" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252486" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-252486" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14.png" alt="ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14" width="1813" height="861" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14-300x142.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14-1024x486.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14-768x365.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14-1536x729.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ETHUSD_2023-05-26_15-09-14-50x24.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-252486" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Ripple (XRP)</h2>
<p>XRP found strong resistance at 47 cents and was unable to continue higher. This pushed the price lower but at a similar level to last week. Despite the pullback, buyers continue to be interested in this cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>With good support at 44 cents, bulls could attempt another breakout in the coming days, particularly if market leaders like ETH are also successful in moving higher.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, XRP seems more likely to move higher soon, with the next major resistance found at 50 cents. Despite a short break in the rally, the momentum indicators also remain bullish.</p>
<figure id="attachment_252485" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-252485" style="width: 1813px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29.png" data-wpel-link="internal"><img class="size-full wp-image-252485" src="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29.png" alt="XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29" width="1813" height="803" srcset="https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29.png 1813w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29-300x133.png 300w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29-1024x454.png 1024w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29-768x340.png 768w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29-1536x680.png 1536w, https://cryptopotato.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/XRPUSDT_2023-05-26_15-09-29-50x22.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 1813px) 100vw, 1813px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-252485" class="wp-caption-text">Chart by TradingView</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Cardano (ADA)</h2>
<p>Cardano is the exact opposite when compared to XRP. The price is found in a downtrend and fell by 3% this past week. The key support is at 34 cents, and the price could test this key level in the coming week.</p>
<p>The resistance at 38 cents did not allow ADA to move higher. Instead, the price fell, making lower highs. Today, the MACD did a bearish crossover which signals that this downtrend will continue.</p>
<p><span style="color: #2b2b2b;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead</span></span>, Cardano is found in a difficult position. The bearish momentum appears to intensify, and a relief rally seems unlikely until the price finds solid support.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Tron (TRX)</span></p>
<p>While most altcoins struggle, Tron is our best performer this week after booking an impressive 9.5% price increase. This rally also took it just under the resistance at 8 cents. The key support is at 7 cents.</p>
<p>The MACD and RSI indicators signal a bullish bias that favors a continuation of this price action. Tron also closed five days in green this past week, which shows buyers have the upper hand.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, TRX is well-positioned to continue its rally. Nevertheless, sellers could return to make a stand at the 8 cents resistance and not allow the price to move higher during its first attempt at a breakout.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Litecoin (LTC) </span></p>
<p>Litecoin is struggling to find its footing after failing to break higher for several months. Every time the price moved above $100, sellers were quick to stop it. More so, the current resistance is at $95, and bears rejected the price at this key level. This means LTC closes the week at a 5% loss.</p>
<p>The momentum is flat, and the price does not appear to be able to develop any clear trend. This long consolidation period started in early 2023 and may still continue for some time. Until the price turns the $100 level into support, it is unlikely for LTC to move higher.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the current support is at $80, and sellers may not be satisfied until this cryptocurrency reaches this level to stop their pressure. At that point, the price could bounce to continue its consolidation.</p>

			            <description><![CDATA[The mysterious whale has also been involved with the controversial PSYOP project. ]]></description>
            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency space is full of stories regarding certain investors, typically larger ones, who made fortunes with their investments in more speculative assets like memecoins. These examples tend to attract jealousy as well as some resentment from less fortunate market participants.</p>
<p>Today, however, we will take a look at the other side of this coin.</p>
<ul>
<li>A few years ago, it was Dogecoin. Then, it was Shiba Inu. This year, at least for now, the massive memecoin explosion has come from <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/what-is-pepe/" data-wpel-link="internal">PEPE</a>.</li>
<li>Shortly after its launch in April, multiple stories about overnight millionaires emerged, including <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/how-someone-turned-27-into-1-million-in-days-with-pepe-but-theres-a-catch/" data-wpel-link="internal">this one</a>. In it, one savvy investor turned $27 into $1 million after taking advantage of the PEPE mania.</li>
<li>However, it&#8217;s not all roses and rainbows. Lookonchain shared data about an NFT whale &#8211; going by the handle @sighduck &#8211; who has not been all that successful when investing in memecoins.</li>
<li>According to the on-chain analytics provider, the said whale lost in total $147,000 worth of ETH so far this month on various memecoins.</li>
<li>Perhaps even more painfully, some of them &#8211; such as TURBO and BEN &#8211; skyrocketed by up to 85x after the whale sold their portions.</li>
<li>The controversy around PSYOP has also impacted the whale. They sent 5 ETH to ben.eth, which could be a <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/hackers-breach-dj-steve-aokis-twitter-account-to-steal-170k-in-eth/" data-wpel-link="internal">blatant scam</a>, according to ZachXBT, and received 8.9M PSYOP. However, the whale &#8220;may feel scammed,&#8221; and they sold all without loss or profit.</li>
<li>Yet, PSYOP, despite being an alleged scam, jumped by 5x after @sighduck sold their position. Perhaps feeling some form of FOMO, the whale &#8220;spent 60 ETH to buy PSYOP and sold after 10 minutes without loss or profit, probably worried about being scammed again.&#8221;</li>
</ul>

            																<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[PRESS RELEASE &#8211; San Francisco, United States, May 26th, 2023]</strong></p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Bitcoin Startup Lab, an industry-leading part-time startup training program and community for founders, is enabling the advent of the sustainable Web3 Bitcoin economy with its comprehensive mentorship-guided startup program beginning on June 24th, 2023. Bitcoin Startup Lab enables talented founders to become the champions they are meant to be by training founders with the necessary tools, skills, and knowledge they need to transform their ideas into investment-ready Web3 Bitcoin startups.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Below are testimonials from previous founders who graduated from the Bitcoin Startup Lab:</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Robin Obermaier, a first-time startup founder shares his firsthand experience, &#8220;The Bitcoin Startup Lab has played a pivotal role in our development. In just eight months, we transitioned from an idea fueled by passion, to a well-funded and rapidly growing business, largely thanks to the valuable guidance from Albert and his team. Their assistance in finding our current CTO, Peter Giammanco, (a computer science graduate from the University of Penn, Elon Musk’s alma mater) through the startup program has notably strengthened our team. We greatly appreciate the Bitcoin Startup Lab for their invaluable support&#8230; Without the Bitcoin Startup Lab, I wouldn&#8217;t be where I am now!&#8221;</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Anatoly Kozlov, a former graduate of the Bitcoin Startup Lab, raved about the invaluable experience and support he received during the program. &#8220;As a founder with two exits and vast experience with various acceleration programs, I can confirm that this is the best program I have ever seen. We have successfully gotten into the accelerator and raised seed funding in a short amount of time.”</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">Trevor Owens, Managing Partner of the Bitcoin Frontier Fund, one of the most prolific early-stage investors in the Bitcoin space, emphasizes the readiness of founders who graduate from Bitcoin Startup Lab bootcamp, said: “I personally love fast-tracking entrepreneurs who graduate from the Bitcoin Startup Lab because they are ready to hit the ground running at our accelerator and raise capital.”</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The team believes that the reason why talented founders like Robin, Anatoly and top investors like Trevor praise the Bitcoin Startup Lab is that this top-notch program offers a no-nonsense curriculum that empowers founders to develop skills in applying Bitcoin tech and market advantages. The program guides you into learning and applying AI tools for Web3 startups, market-entry, customer discovery, pricing, user traction, Web3 marketing &amp; community building, developing killer features, user experience, Web3 business modeling, Tokenomics and incentive mechanisms, network effects, various technologies that enable Bitcoin applications, how to get to product-market fit, effectively pitch product value to get into an accelerator, get seed funding, and fast track their startup.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">In addition to the curriculum, the program offers mentorship, co-founder matching, live startup assignments, and tools that require teamwork to complete, so founders can battle-test new team members before taking the startup plunge together.</p>
<p class="ql-align-justify">The program mentors are a strong community of experienced Bitcoin founders and investors, who have built successful Web3, crypto, and blockchain startups themselves. “We are committed to developing talented founders into champions, so we bring together the leading Bitcoin technologies to make sure the founders who go through our program not only create the highest level of innovations in Bitcoin, but also build healthy businesses that create sustainable value for its users. Fellow founders going through our program have access to mentors, community partners, and top Bitcoin technologies that include, but are not limited to, Ordinals, Lightning, Stacks, Rootstock, DLCs, etc.” said Albert Liang, CEO of Bitcoin Startup Lab.</p>
