Founded in 2018, Conflux’s popularity mainly revolves around its prominent status as China&#8217;s only public blockchain.  Asides from its interesting price history, Conflux has also captured news headlines in 2023 due to its strategic partnerships, most notably its collaboration with China’s second-largest telecommunications company &#8211; China Telecom &#8211; to produce Blockchain-enabled SIM cards.  Could A Market Recovery Be On For Conflux?  Following CFX’s current surge, it appears the token could be attempting a market resurgence and perhaps attain the high price levels seen at the beginning of the year.  Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breaks Through Crucial Resistance Point With 10% Climb According to the prediction site Coincodex, the current sentiment surrounding the CFX token is neutral, while its Fear &#38; Greed Index is set to 59.
