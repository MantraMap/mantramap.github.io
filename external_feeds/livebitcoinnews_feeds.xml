										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ark Investment Management founder and CEO Cathie Wood – a longtime bitcoin bull – has thrown <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/cathie-wood-maintains-600000-bitcoin-forecast-defends-coinbase-shares-purchase-amid-sec-battle/ar-AA1cljnn">herself into the</a> Coinbase <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">mess involving the</a> Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is defending the exchange. She also believes bitcoin could jump into $600K territory within the next seven years.</p>
<h2>Cathie Wood on Where Bitcoin Will Go</h2>
<p>Wood mentioned she thinks the SEC is going about the situation all wrong. All the agency wants to do is persecute when the rules are either nonexistent or difficult to understand. She believes there’s a checks and balances system in the United States that will come to full effect following the culmination of the lawsuit. She also believes that Coinbase is likely to come out on top when this is all over.</p>
<p>Lastly, she mentioned that issues like this keep arising in recent weeks, and she’s confident that these sorts of situations are going to hold serious sway in the 2024 presidential election. She commented that people are tired of the government simply going after people or entities that don’t fall in line with its beliefs, and that people are likely to do something about this with their votes. She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>No, we’re actually betting on the checks and balances inherent in our government. The SEC and uncertainty around [cryptocurrencies] are chasing digital asset business away from this country. I think the legislative branch understands it. This will be an election year issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her conversation then transitioned from Coinbase to the price of bitcoin. Wood has constantly made comments that bitcoin could reach <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cathie-wood-btc-will-be-priced-at-1-5-million-in-2030/">more than $1 million</a> by the year 2030, and while she’s backtracking on that a bit in this recent interview, she did mention that the world’s number one digital currency by market cap will at least stand beyond $600,000 over the next seven years. She said:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the first global private, no government oversight, digital rule-based monetary system, and there’s a lot of discipline here.</p></blockquote>
<p>She commented that bitcoin is also gaining a lot more respect given <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analysts-provide-their-thoughts-on-latest-bitcoin-rally/">the banking debacle</a> that happened in America early in the year. She said the currency’s price rose several times while banks crashed, and she believes people see bitcoin as more of a “safe haven” than ever.</p>
<h2>The Banks Have Helped BTC</h2>
<p>She commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you all notice, the regional bank stocks were imploding, and bitcoin went from $19,000 up to roughly $30,000, so what was that? That was a flight to safety. A flight to safety, think about that. We think all innovation is going to be a flight to safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Wood is right and bitcoin is indeed on a fast track to $600K, this would mark a huge difference from where it was just last year, when the currency crashed and fell into the mid-$16K range.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Merely hours after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed lawsuits against both <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a> – two of the biggest and most popular digital currency trading platforms in the world – the agency’s head Gary Gensler <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/sec-chair-gary-gensler-us-184347676.html">made comments that the</a> entire crypto industry is “built on non-compliance” and that the U.S. doesn’t “need more digital currency.”</p>
<h2>The SEC Is Mixed Up</h2>
<p>With that latter comment, it truly becomes clear what Gensler is all about… Getting rid of crypto in America for good. He doesn’t care about rules or regulation or financial growth. He has an agenda to dismantle crypto 100 percent, and he’s clearly not going to stop until he gets what he wants.</p>
<p>This makes sense given how many companies his agency has been going after. It can’t be that <em>all</em> these firms have committed crimes or gone against present rules. <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/opinion-the-problems-between-the-sec-and-crypto-go-deep/">It’s simply impossible</a>. Coinbase executives, for example, after getting <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">a Wells notice</a> last April that informed them of impending charges from the SEC, even commented that they had met with several representatives of the financial agency over a nine-year period to ensure they always remained compliant.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simply out of the question that during those nine years and all those meetings, the SEC didn’t catch onto crimes Coinbase was engaged in. The idea that it’s taken this long suggests that Coinbase has done nothing wrong, and it’s simply the next big victim to be added to Gensler’s ongoing financial death list. It’s not fair, it’s not right, and it goes in tandem with what we’re seeing in America today.</p>
<p>Gensler has yet to have any say in the officiation of the crypto industry. He has never worked towards any regulatory matters, and now we know why… He’s not interested in the regulation of the space; he’s interested in the <em>death</em> of the space. Following his comments that the U.S. doesn’t need crypto, he mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>We already have digital currency. It’s called the U.S. dollar. It’s called [the] euro. It’s called the yen. They’re all digital now.</p></blockquote>
<p>This tells us that not only is Gensler probably a nasty person, but he’s also completely out of it. He refers to fiat assets like the U.S. dollar, the yen, and what have you as “digital.” <em>How</em>, Gary? <em>How</em> are they digital? The last time we checked, $1 was still printed out in paper form. <em>What are you talking about?</em></p>
<h2>Fiat and Digital Currency Are Very Different</h2>
<p>Is he referring to credit cards? While they may be centered around digital forms of fiat, the money in question doesn’t come from the plastic card that’s used to make purchases. Thus, the money itself is not digital. <em>What does he mean?</em></p>
<p>You know there’s a problem when the head of a financial agency doesn’t understand or comprehend the differences between financial entities or tools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just yesterday, it was announced that popular digital currency trading platform Coinbase <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">was being sued</a> by the SEC. The news came as a shock to many, and it’s clearly another step in the agency’s agenda to rid the country of crypto for good.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Gets Its Way Against the SEC</h2>
<p>The good news is that Coinbase doesn’t appear to be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/06/07/crypto-now-braced-for-another-sec-bombshell-that-could-create-chaos-for-the-price-of-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-and-xrp/?sh=38adebb43ec3">taking the abuse sitting</a> down, and it recently got a legal win in its corner. Not long ago, the exchange made headlines when it <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-sues-sec-demands-answers-regarding-months-old-petition/">filed suit against the</a> SEC for not answering a now year-old survey regarding regulatory statutes in the U.S. that could potentially surround crypto.</p>
<p>A federal judge has since ruled in favor of the exchange and says the Securities and Exchange Commission must respond to the survey within a seven-day period and provide the insight the trading company has been seeking since July of 2022.</p>
<p>While this isn’t likely to put any serious dents in the lawsuit the SEC has against Coinbase, it could hold things up for a while. In fact, it may even force the circumstances of the lawsuit to change so that things can be easier on Coinbase in the future. The idea is to garner information from the SEC about how present securities laws would or should apply to assets like BTC and ETH.</p>
<p>Paul Grewal – chief legal officer for Coinbase – said on social media:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rules of the road, from legislation or rulemaking or both, must come before enforcement actions. That is why we petitioned the SEC for rulemaking nearly a year ago in the first place. We continue to believe that the SEC could not be proceeding with litigation against our industry, like the case filed against us… if the SEC had not already decided to deny our petition for rulemaking… If the SEC’s answer to our petition for rulemaking is &#8216;no,&#8217; then they are required by law to tell us, because we have the legal right to question that &#8216;no&#8217; in court, and there are serious questions to be asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC has taken on a pattern of “regulation by enforcement” according to many crypto fans and analysts. This pertains to the idea that the SEC has not put out any rules regarding crypto, nor has it worked to clarify present regulations. All it’s done is attack and sue.</p>
<h2>Bringing Down Big Names</h2>
<p>SEC head Gary Gensler has defended this approach on several occasions. In a recent interview, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The investing public has the benefit of U.S. securities laws. Crypto should be no different, and these platforms, these intermediaries need to come into compliance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Among the many other crypto firms to fall victim to the SEC’s antics are Kraken – which was forced to part <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">with a $30 million fee</a> and end all staking services – and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a bully. This is what we’ve been saying for some time. It’s bullying crypto firms into submission whenever it can. It runs after them with an air of persecution and is working hard to ensure they don’t have a financial future in America.</p>
<h2>The SEC Is Suing So Many Companies</h2>
<p>However, upon news that the agency is going after big names like <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">Binance</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-says-it-operated-as-an-exchange-broker/">Coinbase</a>, it’s likely the problem travels much deeper. It’s easy to simply give the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">SEC</a> a bully label and move on. It’s easy to assume it’s a nasty kid on the schoolyard that hurts everyone and everything that doesn’t do what he wants, but there are more elements to this equation that need to be looked at truthfully if things are going to be fixed.</p>
<p>Binance, Coinbase, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-continues-its-crypto-wrath-files-suit-against-bittrex/">Bittrex</a>, <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">Kraken</a>… These are not small figures in the world of crypto. These are some of the largest players around, and the idea that the SEC is willing to go after them so easily suggests several things. One is that the agency just hates that crypto assets sit outside its jurisdiction. It’s power hungry and wants all financial products and tools to fall in line.</p>
<p>However, one could argue that at this stage, the lack of clear rules means something is really going wrong. The idea that all these companies could allegedly (in their minds, anyway) be operating cleanly only to be attacked out of nowhere by the nation’s biggest financial watchdog suggests that the rules in crypto are nowhere near as understandable as all these companies say they are.</p>
<p>It can’t be that all these companies that have been around for so long (Coinbase has been in business for over a decade, for example) are <em>trying</em> to commit crimes and be out of compliance, so this is a clear indication that rules need to be set in stone and, sadly, regulation is likely a necessity.</p>
<h2>Regulation Is Likely Necessary, Now</h2>
<p>We say “sadly” because regulation was initially not supposed to be an element of the crypto industry. It was supposed to be that the people (the users) were in charge, and all prying eyes and middlemen were cut out of the equation, but so long as this age of persecution exists (and it doesn’t appear to be stopping anytime soon), the time has come to realize that nationally recognized laws need to be in place for things to function.</p>
<p>It’s also disappointing that the SEC has not done anything to aid in the creation of these rules. It just wants to sue people. Perhaps rulemaking isn’t its line of work, but if there really is no end in sight for these crypto-based lawsuits, perhaps the time has come to focus on regulation once and for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reginald Fowler – age 64 and a former part owner of the Minnesota Vikings football team – has been sentenced to <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ex-vikings-part-owner-sentenced-six-years-prison-700-million-cryptocurrency-scam">six years in prison for his</a> role in a crypto-related <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/scam/">scam</a>.</p>
<h2>Reginald Fowler Heads to Jail</h2>
<p>Fowler is alleged to have defrauded the short-lived professional football organization Alliance of American Football. The scam is said to have lost investors as much as $700 million at the time of writing. Originally from Chandler, Arizona, Fowler was found guilty in a Manhattan federal court and was sentenced to six years and three months in a federal institution.</p>
<p>He will also have to pay back as much as $740 million to those who were hurt by the event, and he will pay over $50 million in restitution fees.</p>
<p>The Alliance of American Football lost all its funding in the year 2019 and was immediately closed. Fowler is believed to have told executives in charge of the league that he held bank accounts with tens of millions of dollars in them. These funds were garnered, he said, through real estate investments and government contracts, all of which could be used to boost the league and the big future that was believed to be ahead of it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, things moved in the opposite direction and the league didn’t last long. At one point, in 2005, Fowler attempted to buy the NFL’s Minnesota Vikings team and became a minority owner before departing from the position in 2014.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Damian Williams claims that Fowler engaged in hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated transactions via crypto exchanges that operated as shadow banks. He commented in a recent statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>He did so by lying to legitimate U.S. financial institutions, which exposed the U.S. financial system to serious risk. He then victimized a professional football league by lying about his net worth in exchange for a substantial portion of the league.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a statement, Edward Sapone – the attorney for Fowler – said his client was absolutely devastated by his actions and disappointed in himself that he took part in such atrocious behavior and activities. He’s not happy about the crimes he committed and feels terrible that his actions brought so much shame to his community and family. Sapone mentioned:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reggie is extremely remorseful. The American Football League didn’t benefit from the investment that Reggie had planned to make. Reggie’s bank accounts were frozen, he could not secure the investment money, and he was not able to invest the large sum of money he promised to invest.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Happens a Lot</h2>
<p>Crypto crime has been around since the industry first came to fruition roughly 14 years ago.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons behind the large amount of crime in the arena is that it’s unregulated and controlled primarily by its users.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is now <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/sec-sues-coinbase-as-feds-crack-down-on-cryptocurrency-companies/ar-AA1ccuO7">going after popular North American</a> crypto exchange Coinbase in a court of law. As if attacking Binance (as we <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/sec-sues-binance-alleges-selling-of-illegal-securities/">reported earlier</a>) wasn’t enough, the financial agency is looking to add another large firm to its victims list.</p>
<h2>The SEC Sues Coinbase</h2>
<p>Allegations against Coinbase suggest that the firm operated an illegal and unregistered exchange for the past several years (the company has been around since 2012). The move is clearly a continuation of the Wells notice that <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">Coinbase received last April</a>. The notice said that while Coinbase wasn’t being charged with anything yet, it could expect charges in the future.</p>
<p>This was something executives took issue with, as they claimed they met with representatives of the SEC multiple times over the span of nine years to ensure they were always in compliance with present financial rules. Gary Gensler – the head of the SEC – said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We allege that Coinbase, despite being subject to the securities laws, commingled and unlawfully offered exchange, broker-dealer, and clearinghouse functions. Coinbase&#8217;s alleged failures deprive investors of critical protections including rulebooks that prevent fraud and manipulation, proper disclosure, safeguards against conflicts of interest, and routine inspection by the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<p>The agency feels Coinbase has been offering the same services as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and thus since the year 2019, it’s been out of compliance as it was required to formally register with the SEC and undergo the necessary protocols. The statement from Gensler continued with:</p>
<blockquote><p>By collapsing these functions into a single platform and failing to register with the SEC as to any of the three functions, and not having qualified for any applicable exemptions from registration, Coinbase has for years defied the regulatory structures and evaded the disclosure requirements that Congress, and the SEC have constructed for the protection of the national securities markets and investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gurbir S. Grewal – director of the SEC’s division of enforcement – said that companies like Coinbase are not above the law and are not exempt from following the rules. He said:</p>
<blockquote><p>You simply can&#8217;t ignore the rules because you don&#8217;t like them or because you&#8217;d prefer different ones. The consequences for the investing public are far too great. As alleged in our complaint, Coinbase was fully aware of the applicability of the federal securities laws to its business activities, but deliberately refused to follow them.</p></blockquote>
<h2>We Didn&#8217;t Do Anything!</h2>
<p>Naturally, the trading platform is firing back and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC&#8217;s reliance on an enforcement-only approach in the absence of clear rules for the digital asset industry is hurting America&#8217;s economic competitiveness and companies like Coinbase that have a demonstrated commitment to compliance. The solution is legislation that allows fair rules for the road to be developed transparently and applied equally.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made it very clear it doesn’t care if a crypto company is big or small. It will go after any digital currency enterprise with a persecuting hand, as it demonstrated yet again last month when it <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/sec-sues-binance-alleging-it-operated-an-illegal-exchange/ar-AA1ca06y?OCID=ansmsnnews11">announced plans to sue</a> Binance, the largest and most popular digital currency exchange in the world.</p>
<h2>The SEC and Binance Go Head to Head</h2>
<p>The news caused bitcoin and Ethereum to drop to their lowest points in just over two months, with BTC – the world’s largest digital currency by market cap – falling into the mid-$25K range. That’s a loss of about $2,000 over the past few weeks alone.</p>
<p>The SEC alleges that Binance operated an illegal exchange for years and sold securities without going through the proper registration processes. In addition, the company is also facing allegations that it commingled customer funds with company revenue. If this is true, then Binance clearly took a page out of the <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/tag/ftx/">FTX playbook</a>.</p>
<p>The now dead trading platform is facing similar charges, as its former founder Sam Bankman-Fried has been accused of mixing customer and company funds and using client money to pay off loans and invest in real estate. The lawsuit from the SEC says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Defendants&#8217; purposeful efforts to evade U.S. regulatory oversight while simultaneously providing securities-related services to U.S. customers put the safety of billions of dollars of U.S. investor capital at risk and at Binance&#8217;s and Zhao&#8217;s mercy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Binance has been sitting in the hot seat for some time. Not long ago, the exchange was also sued by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/cftc-sues-binance-alleging-financial-violations/">which alleged that the</a> trading platform had, for years, violated the Commodity Exchange Act. In a statement, CFTC chair Rostin Behnam claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, Binance knew they were violating CFTC rules, working actively to both keep the money flowing and avoid compliance. This should be a warning to anyone in the digital asset world that the CFTC will not tolerate willful avoidance of U.S. law.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Company Says It Did No Wrong</h2>
<p>Representatives of Binance expressed their disappointment with the decision and said that because of the company’s size and power in the industry, they are an easy target for financial agencies looking to make names for themselves. They said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are disappointed that the SEC chose to file a complaint today against Binance seeking, among other remedies, purported emergency relief. We now join [several] other crypto projects facing similarly misguided actions from the SEC, and we will vigorously defend our business and the industry… Because of our size and global name recognition, Binance has found itself an easy target caught in the middle of a U.S. regulatory tug-of-war.</p></blockquote>
<p>The SEC has been on a rampage for some time, and has been looking to take out major crypto firms including <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/is-the-sec-trying-to-kill-crypto-for-good/">Kraken</a> and <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/coinbase-receives-wells-notice-from-the-sec/">Coinbase</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jack Dorsey – the former head of Twitter – has put out a video <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorsey-endorses-fellow-bitcoin-001943733.html">suggesting he’s endorsing</a> bitcoin-loving presidential candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. to assume nation-leading duties in the White House in 2025.</p>
<h2>Jack Dorsey is Pushing Robert Kennedy Jr.</h2>
<p>Not long ago, Dorsey put out a video on social media about the candidate and commented:</p>
<blockquote><p>Robert. F. Kennedy, Jr. argues he can beat Trump and DeSantis in 2024. He can and will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kennedy entered the presidential race a few months back and is working hard to garner the democratic nomination in 2024 and thus remove current democrat commander-in-chief Joe Biden from the ticket altogether. Kennedy has repeatedly <a href="https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/presidential-hopeful-robert-kennedy-jr-appeared-at-this-years-miami-btc-conference/">initiated comments about bitcoin</a> and crypto use and even made an appearance at this year’s Miami Bitcoin Conference where he stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>As president, I will make sure that your right to hold and use bitcoin is inviolable. You should be able to own your own private keys, the same as you own the keys to your car or own your wallet…I don’t think the government has the right to demand access to your bitcoin key or indeed any of your passwords. To say otherwise [is] to cede essential territory to [a] surveillance state.</p></blockquote>
<p>When a commenter on Twitter said there was no way Kennedy would be nominated due to likely interference from the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Dorsey responded with, “Even more reason.” He was also quick to add that the DNC is losing relevance and that its present state marks the “end of an empire.”</p>
<p>It makes sense Dorsey would be such an advocate for Kennedy. Dorsey has long been a major bitcoin fan, commenting in the year <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/21/jack-dorsey-expects-bitcoin-to-become-the-worlds-single-currency-in-about-10-years.html#:~:text=Twitter%20and%20Square%20CEO%20Jack%20Dorsey%20predicts%20bitcoin,bitcoin%2C%E2%80%9D%20Dorsey%20said%20in%20a%20report%20published%20Wednesday.">2018 that the currency</a> would ultimately become the world’s sole form of money. Thus, if Kennedy is pro bitcoin, it seems only natural that Dorsey would fall in line behind him.</p>
<p>At the same time, Dorsey needs to remain realistic about Kennedy’s chances. Right now, polls are showing that while Kennedy has <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/pro-bitcoin-candidate-robert-kennedy-093706291.html">about 20 percent of the</a> democratic vote, he is still miles behind Biden, who presently holds 60 percent, and Biden has been slipping <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/05/07/biden-polling-approval-rating-trump-00095699">heavily in the polls</a> as of late.</p>
<h2>Trump is Still the Frontrunner</h2>
<p>Thus, the idea that this man could even come near someone like Donald Trump – who <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/new-polls-show-trump-commanding-lead-2024-gop-race-rcna86232">is not only leading</a> by triple digits in republican polls, but is also leading <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4012722-trump-beats-biden-by-7-points-in-hypothetical-2024-matchup-poll/">Biden by several points</a> – is a tad ludicrous if not completely farfetched.</p>
<p>Right now, Trump is the true frontrunner for the White House in 2024, likely due to his past track record and performance as president. Biden has done so much damage in the last 2.5 years that many Americans probably don’t want to take too many chances and prefer a candidate with a solid history and a proven ability to turn things around quickly under his belt.</p>
