<p>In its latest blogpost, Choise.com, a gateway crypto platform blending CeFi and DeFi in one concept, has revealed their exclusive partnership with the ELF (European League of Football) champions Vienna Vikings. According to the official statement, this effort is intended to encourage cryptocurrency adoption among numerous fans of American football around the world.</p>
<p>The collaboration with the Vienna Vikings marks the Choise.com&rsquo;s active involvement in the sports industry. As American football is now booming across Europe, this newly forged alliance promises a global wave of interest to the ever-growing crypto ecosystem. Choise.com has already onboarded more than 1 million users in over 170 countries to its platform and keeps spreading awareness about digital assets by joining efforts with the leading brands from various sectors.&nbsp;</p>
Why the Vienna Vikings?
<p>The Vienna Vikings have dominated American football in Austria for the past two decades. The club boasts a truly rich heritage which includes winning the national Austrian Bowl 15 times in their history, as well as capturing the Eurobowl title 5 times from 2004 to 2007 and in 2013. The beginning of the Vikings&rsquo; journey in the ELF, the Europe&rsquo;s biggest American football tournament, turned out to be striking &ndash; they triumphantly won their first season in 2022, beating the Hamburg Sea Devils in the Championship Game with a score of 27-15.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, the Viennese club is committed to Running It Back and repeating their resounding success in the third season of the ELF. After a continuous streak of 4 wins over the Berlin Thunder, the Prague Lions, the Leipzig Kings, and the Fehervar Enthroners, the Vikings opened further their lead in the standings ahead of matchups against the Raiders Tirol and the Panthers Wroclaw.</p>
<p>Next to that, the Vienna Vikings, rooted in the American Football &amp; Cheerleading Club of the Vikings, have established themselves as a powerhouse program with great youth development. Among their most famous inmates are Bernhard Raimann (OL Indianapolis Colts) and Bernhard Seikovits (TE Arizona Cardinals) who are currently shining in the NFL.</p>
<p>All this coupled with a persuasive fanbase resulted in the Vienna Vikings becoming the right partner for Choise.com, making its grand entrance into the thriving American football space.</p>
The Mutually Beneficial Relationship
<p>Choise.com is assured of a beneficial association because of the Vienna Vikings&rsquo; palpable affluence within Europe. Meanwhile, by collaborating with the reigning ELF champion, the platform will enhance the club&rsquo;s branding in several aspects such as the team&rsquo;s apparel, social media presence, and stadium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of the Choise.com logo featuring prominently in all official helmets, there is another joint initiative that has been planned for execution as well. Through their partnership with the Vienna Vikings, Choise.com intends to launch a unique line of Crypterium cards with a bespoke design celebrating the club and its team members. Crypterium card is a VISA card available for order in over 30 countries. Choise.com users can issue both virtual and plastic versions of the card, replenish it from their wallets, make worldwide payments wherever VISA is accepted, as well as withdraw cash from ATMs in more than 200 countries.To date, the product already serves over 50,000 clients.</p>
<p>On June 24, the Vikings demonstrated their newly branded helmets for the first time. This happened during their inaugural matchup against the Leipzig Kings. The game started with the opening ceremony during which the CEO of Choise.com Vladimir Gorbunov together with his son did the honorary coin toss in the center of the Hohe Warte stadium. But the real cherry on the cake was the incredible victory of the Vienna Vikings who defeated their rivals 47-14 in acknowledgment of a longstanding cooperation with the crypto platform. Since that day, the team has remained unbeaten and only strengthened their positions in the standings after the latest triumph over the Fehervar Enthrodes, 41-12.</p>
