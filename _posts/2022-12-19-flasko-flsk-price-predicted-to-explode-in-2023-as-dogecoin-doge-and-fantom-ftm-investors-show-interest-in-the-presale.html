<p>Many famous cryptocurrencies suffered huge declines in 2021 and 2022, making investors nervous about choosing their crypto investments. This demonstrates the need to consider a cryptocurrency's practical applications and underlying infrastructure before committing capital to it.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) and Fantom (FTM) are promising cryptocurrencies with solid foundations. Analysts, however, recommend Flasko as a viable alternative investment option with skyrocketing returns.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE) Had A Good Run</p>
<p>The Shiba Inu is the mascot for the cryptocurrency Dogecoin (DOGE), inspired by the viral internet joke "doge." Many other tokens have followed Dogecoin (DOGE)'s lead since its meteoric rise in value and popularity a few years ago.</p>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE)'s proof-of-work mechanism, based on Scrypt technology, is one of the numerous ways it varies from Bitcoin's. Dogecoin (DOGE) rose to fame only because famous personalities started tweeting about it, and it became a sensation on Reddit. Unfortunately for Dogecoin (DOGE) and Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, that fame was short-lived when Dogecoin (DOGE) finally plummeted. It is now trading at $0.10 per coin.</p>
<p>Consistent Drop in Fantom (FTM)&nbsp;</p>
<p>After announcing many partnerships, Fantom (FTM) saw record-breaking sales and earnings last month. As time has passed, prices have dropped to the $0.2 range. There was a 14% drop in Fantom (FTM) from the previous month. The coin is presently valued at $0.24.</p>
<p>As Fantom (FTM) is consistently declining daily, there has been a significant sell-off. It might be more beneficial to shift your focus to something with more development potential. However, Fantom (FTM) investors are selling their Fantom (FTM) coins for Flasko presale coins.</p>
<p>Flasko (FLSK) Will Become The Fastest-Growing Crypto In 2023</p>
<p>NFTs backed by lucrative real-life assets are the future of the crypto trading industry, which is why Flasko has recently gained a lot of popularity. Flasko is an upcoming platform allowing investors to purchase fractionalized NFTs of wine, whiskey, and champagne bottles.</p>
<p>The Flasko team is working daily to reassure investors that their funds are safe on the NFT platform. This includes completing the audit with Solid Proof with flying colors and locking liquidity for 33 years, assuring there will be no rug pull to risk investments.</p>
<p>By January 2023, experts think Flasko will be worth $4.50 per coin. At its current price of only $0.125, it would be an opportunity missed not to purchase Flasko presale tokens right now.&nbsp;</p>
