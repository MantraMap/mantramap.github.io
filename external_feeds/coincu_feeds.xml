										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korea&#8217;s National Assembly has enacted the &#8220;Virtual Asset User Protection Act,&#8221; the country&#8217;s first domestic law specifically addressing virtual assets.</em></li>



<li><em>The law aims to regulate unfair trading practices and protect users of virtual assets like Bitcoin.</em></li>



<li><em>The act addresses unfair trading practices, introduces penalties for violations, and allows for civil liability and potential class action lawsuits.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>According to <em><a href="https://www.blockmedia.co.kr/archives/328755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockmedia</a></em>, the Korean National Assembly of South Korea plenary session today enacted the &#8220;Virtual Asset User Protection Act.&#8221;</strong></h5>

<p>It is reported that the Virtual Asset User Protection Act (Virtual Asset Use Act) aims to regulate unfair trading of virtual assets such as Bitcoin and protect users. It is the country&#8217;s first domestic law on virtual assets.</p>



<p>At a plenary session this afternoon, the National Assembly approved the Virtual Asset Use Act with 265 votes in favor, 0 votes against, and 3 abstentions out of 268 votes cast.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="667" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268.png" alt="BREAKING: South Korea Passed Important Crypto Act To Protect Users" class="wp-image-199137" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268.png 1000w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268-300x200.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268-768x512.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2268-750x500.png 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" title="BREAKING: South Korea Passed Important Crypto Act To Protect Users 2"></a></figure></div>


<p>The first section of the law defines virtual assets. Virtual assets are described as &#8220;digital tokens with economic worth that may be sold or transferred.&#8221; Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) was excluded from the definition of virtual assets.</p>



<p>The law then specifies regulations for virtual asset operators to follow in order to secure user assets. It is required to produce and maintain asset transaction records, as well as subscribe to insurance/deduction or reserve accumulation in preparation for calamities such as hacking and computer failure.</p>



<p>Moreover, unfair trade was described as the use of concealed key information, market price manipulation, and counterfeit business methods. In the event of a violation, there is not only a criminal penalty but also civil culpability and the potential of initiating a class action lawsuit.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269-1024x539.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="539" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269-1024x539.png" alt="BREAKING: South Korea Passed Important Crypto Act To Protect Users" class="wp-image-199138" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269-1024x539.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269-300x158.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269-768x404.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269-750x395.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2269.png 1140w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: South Korea Passed Important Crypto Act To Protect Users 3"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service resolved to resolve the problem of delegation of power to probe unfair virtual asset trades by a presidential decree rather than a legislative provision. The Bank of Korea has the authority to seek information on virtual asset operators. While virtual assets are not currencies, the claim that they will be required to implement monetary and financial stability measures has gained traction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>South Korean authorities are investigating WeMade and its WEMIX token market maker following allegations of fraud and breach of trust.</em></li>



<li><em>The investigation includes a search and seizure operation at WeMade&#8217;s headquarters and market makers involved in WEMIX activities.</em></li>



<li><em>The company has faced issues such as unauthorized fund liquidation and fraudulent disclosure, resulting in delisting from major South Korean crypto exchanges.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>South Korean authorities, according to <em><a href="https://www.digitalasset.works/news/articleView.html?idxno=3223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Digital Asset</a></em>, have initiated a full obligatory investigation into the country&#8217;s listed gaming company WeMade and its WEMIX token market maker, including a search.</strong></h5>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="749" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-1024x749.png" alt="BREAKING: WeMade Accused Of Fraud In The Latest Investigation Of The Korean Prosecutors" class="wp-image-199117" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-1024x749.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-300x219.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-768x562.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263-750x549.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2263.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="BREAKING: WeMade Accused Of Fraud In The Latest Investigation Of The Korean Prosecutors 4"></a></figure></div>


<p>The search and seizure were carried out in response to a complaint filed with prosecutors on May 12 by WEMIX investors, who accused the firm of fraud, embezzlement, and breach of trust.</p>



<p>This is the first time the prosecution has undertaken a search and seizure in connection with WeMade&#8217;s mandatory inquiry. On May 24, the prosecution performed a search and seizure in connection with Rep. Kim Nam-guk&#8217;s WEMIX scandal, however it was not a WeMade probe.</p>



<p>The Seoul Southern District Prosecutor&#8217;s Office Financial Investigation Division 1 has been conducting a large-scale search and seizure of WeMade headquarters in Sampyeong-dong, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, and market makers known to have been involved in WEMIX expedient market-making activities since the morning of June 30.</p>



<p>According to sources, WeMade has sparked several issues since 2021. Specifically, between November 2020 and January 2022, WeMade liquidated WEMIX 225.5 billion won without telling WEMIX users and transferred the cash to a firm, generating a great uproar. This was dubbed a &#8220;blink sale&#8221; by experts, and the occurrence emphasized the critical need for regulations governing the disclosure of virtual assets.</p>

<p>Moreover, towards the end of 2022, WEMIX&#8217;s circulation was suspected of fraudulent disclosure, and a legal arrangement with the country&#8217;s exchanges was reached. Some major South Korean crypto exchanges finally delisted WEMIX.</p>



<p>The prosecution is believed to have searched and seized not just WeMade but also WEMIX market makers. According to reports, CEO Henry Chang&#8217;s charges of breach of trust are also being investigated.</p>

<p>In December 2022, Korean tabloids revealed that CEO Henry Chang documented the circumstances around his usage of Signiel, a high-end residential facility, as a private house with corporate funds totaling 12 billion won ($9.1 million).</p>



<p>Immediately after the news, WEMIX dropped nearly 12% of its value.</p>

<p>The aim of the program is to backstop banks and other depository firms during the crisis. The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has released data showing that the Fed&#8217;s Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) has reached a record level of $103.08 billion in loans for the week ending June 28. This is the highest level of distressed asset redemptions since the program was introduced three months ago. Despite the Fed&#8217;s attempts to reassure investors that the banking crisis is over, the milestone figure shows that the Fed is still bailing out banks.</p>

<p>Market analyst Joe Consorti has also commented on the latest figures, suggesting that the &#8220;BTFP&#8217;s shadow liquidity is propping up risk-taking behavior across markets.&#8221; As a result of this, investors may be encouraged to take larger risks, as evidenced by the increases in stock markets such as the S&amp;P 500. Consorti believes that the BTFP will have to create a new facility to buy distressed commercial real estate loans and even commercial mortgage-backed securities.</p>

<p>U.S. banking regulators have been asking lenders to work with credit-worthy borrowers that are facing stress as commercial real estate lending remains under pressure. In addition, the BTFP peak has come in the same week that the Federal Reserve announced its banking stress test results, passing the top 23 lenders in the country. It is unclear what further action the Fed will take regarding the ongoing banking crisis, but the record level of loans for the week ending June 28 is a clear indication that the program is still in high demand among embattled banks.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>RBNZ intensifies supervision of stablecoins and crypto assets.</em></li>



<li><em>A regulatory approach is not needed now, but vigilance is required, according to the bank.</em></li>



<li><em>The bank monitors global regulations and studies CBDC implementation.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ</strong>) <strong><a href="https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/hub/news/2023/06/rbnz-ramps-up-monitoring-of-stablecoins-and-cryptoassets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> on Friday that it is intensifying its supervision of stablecoins and crypto assets owing to uncertainty about how the industry will evolve and the potential dangers they may pose to the financial system.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="641" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-1024x641.png" alt="New Zealand&#039;s RBNZ Will Strengthen Unregulated Crypto Surveillance" class="wp-image-199102" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-1024x641.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-300x188.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-768x481.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260-750x469.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2260.png 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="New Zealand&#039;s RBNZ Will Strengthen Unregulated Crypto Surveillance 10"></a></figure></div>


<p>The decision was made after the central bank received public feedback to better understand the possible ramifications of new forms of private money on both the financial system and monetary sovereignty. Ian Woolford, RBNZ&#8217;s money and cash director, said that the bank agreed with the majority of submitters that a regulated approach was not required at this time but that heightened vigilance was necessary.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We agree with the balance of submitters that a regulatory approach isn’t needed right now, but increased vigilance is,” said Woolford.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Woolford&#8217;s announcement was accompanied by a summary of 50 stakeholder contributions to a previous RBNZ study on crypto and decentralized finance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Respondents included BlockchainNZ, the country&#8217;s crypto advocacy group, Ripple, and institutions such as Westpac and the Bank of New Zealand.</p>



<p>Woolford said that the comments demonstrated that crypto had major dangers and prospects, as well as &#8220;uncertainties&#8221; concerning the sector&#8217;s future, necessitating more scrutiny:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p class="has-small-font-size">“We agree that caution is needed, which also reinforces the need for enhanced data and monitoring to build understanding.”</p>
</blockquote>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The RBNZ seems to be waiting to watch how other countries regulate cryptocurrency before making its own measures.</p>



<p>The RBNZ&#8217;s statement on Friday follows its announcement in December that it was developing a monitoring framework to monitor and appraise developments in new forms of &#8220;private money,&#8221; including cryptoassets. As part of its Future of Money initiative, the bank is doing a comprehensive research. This involves an ongoing study on the eventual establishment of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).</p>

<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ethereum has been experiencing a series of price fluctuations lately. After the digital currency reached a high of $1,912, it started a downside correction below the $1,865 support. </strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>Although the price even spiked below the $1,820 level, the downsides were limited, unlike Bitcoin, which has been experiencing a slump. A low was formed near $1,817 and the price is now attempting a fresh increase.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="472" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1024x472.png" alt="image 2259" class="wp-image-199091" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1024x472.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-300x138.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-768x354.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1536x707.png 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-750x345.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259-1140x525.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2259.png 1835w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Ethereum Holds Strong at $1,800: Experts Predict Further Gains 14"></a><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"> </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>There has been a break above the $1,840 resistance zone. Furthermore, a connecting bearish trend line with resistance near $1,838 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD was broken. Ethereum is now testing the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. Additionally, it is currently trading near $1,865 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</p>



<p>The immediate resistance is near the $1,875 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,912 swing high to the $1,817 low. The next major resistance is near the $1,900 level. Moreover, the first breakout level is near the $1,920 level. If there is a close above the $1,920 zone, a fresh rally could start. Subsequently, the next resistance sits near $2,000, above which the price could rise toward the $2,050 level. Any more gains could send Ethereum toward the $2,120 resistance.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-default">

<p>However, if Ethereum fails to clear the $1,875 resistance or $1,880, it could start another decline. In the event of a decline, the initial support on the downside is near the $1,860 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major support is near the $1,840 level, while the first major support is near $1,820. If there is a move below $1,820, the price could drop toward $1,790. Any more losses may perhaps send the price toward the $1,740 support.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The upcoming halving event for Litecoin has resulted in increased attention and network activity, with the hashrate reaching a new all-time high of 831.16 TH/s.</em></li>



<li><em>Despite recent price increases and outperforming other altcoins, LTC is currently facing resistance near the $100 price zone, with the Fibonacci 78.6% retracement level posing a potential challenge.</em></li>



<li><em>It is important to conduct thorough research and consider various indicators.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Litecoin (LTC) is seen as one of the most promising coins at the moment as its major halving event this year draws near. Given its incredible performance, what could be its next price zone?</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="679" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg" alt="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching" class="wp-image-199079" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1024x679.jpeg 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-300x199.jpeg 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-768x509.jpeg 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1536x1019.jpeg 1536w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-750x497.jpeg 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1-1140x756.jpeg 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1_aPnBWcqPEJ_q0jqWwB3zvQ-1.jpeg 1728w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Litecoin Is Coming Back Strong Before Halving, $100 Is Approaching 16"></a></figure></div>


<p>As the halving event approaches, the Litecoin network receives more attention. This has resulted in an increase in the network&#8217;s hashrate as additional miners join the network. The majority of June saw substantial surges in hashrate due to the increase in mining difficulty.</p>



<p>On June 23, 2023, the Litecoin hashrate hit 831.16 terahashes per second (TH/s), according to <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/litecoin/hashrate-chart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoinWarz</a> statistics. This is a new all-time high for the network, which previously had data slightly higher than 756.26 TH/ S.</p>

<p>The increase in mining difficulty makes it more difficult to locate a block, thus miners must bring more computers online to boost their chances, resulting in a surge in hashrate. When additional miners are brought online, the Litecoin hashrate has reached its peak.</p>



<p>The good news is that Litecoin on-chain statistics show that a sizable fraction of LTC holders keeps their currency. This verified that a portion of newly bought LTC coins did not move throughout the same time period.</p>



<p>The price of Litecoin, which is now trading at $95 per coin, has increased by about 15% in the previous 24 hours, with several other cryptocurrencies following suit. Although most cryptocurrencies have been trending sideways in recent days, LTC has surpassed other altcoins today. Nonetheless, Bitcoin has stayed reasonably stable in the $30,000-$31,000 price area in recent days.</p>

<p>The spike of LTC left no support, its price is at the nearest resistance, which is confluent with the Fib 78.6% level. So, a revolution can happen until LTC reaches the $100 price zone, however, at the moment, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to buy at this price zone.</p>

<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has recently experienced a significant surge in both trading volume and price, reaching its highest levels since May 12, 2021. BCH&#8217;s contract open interest has surged to an impressive $562 million, reflecting the growing interest and confidence in this digital asset. Over the past week, BCH&#8217;s price has skyrocketed by nearly 100%, capturing the attention of investors and traders alike. This surge in interest can be attributed to various factors, with South Korea emerging as a key player in the BCH market.</p>



<p>The trading volume of BCH contracts has surged by more than 10 times since June 22, with a staggering 24-hour trading volume peaking at 4.427 billion. At the time of writing, BCH is trading at $ 297 after reaching $325, which is up by nearly 30% over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>According to Wu, South Korea&#8217;s largest exchange, Upbit, has played a pivotal role in driving this momentum. In the past 24 hours alone, Upbit recorded a BCH/KRW trading volume of over $350 million, contributing to 23.58% of BCH&#8217;s total trading volume. Notably, this trading volume is three times higher than that of BTC/KRW on the same platform.</p>

<p>South Korea&#8217;s active participation in the BCH market, combined with the repayment of debts and increased interest from traders, has fueled the recent pump in BCH&#8217;s trading volume and price. This surge not only highlights the growing significance of BCH in the cryptocurrency market but also demonstrates the resilience and potential of digital currencies in general.</p>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Base is close to being deployed on the mainnet, prioritizing security.</em></li>



<li><em>The network has met crucial deployment criteria and leveraged collaboration with OP Labs.</em></li>



<li><em>Initiatives like smart contract audits and monitoring tools enhance security and attract users.</em></li>
</ul>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Base, Coinbase&#8217;s new layer 2 application-focused protocol, is only one step away from being <a href="https://twitter.com/BuildOnBase/status/1674543151388966912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ready</a> for mainnet deployment.</strong></h5>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1024x512.png" alt="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch" class="wp-image-199039" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2239.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch 21"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Base team revealed their comprehensive security procedures in a block post in anticipation of their imminent mainnet launch. The platform&#8217;s goal is to get the next million developers and billion users onto the blockchain, and security is a critical component of that mission.</p>



<p>On February 23, the exchange officially unveiled Base, which aspires to be a low-cost, secure, and developer-friendly network for creating decentralized apps.</p>



<p>The network is created in conjunction with Optimism on the OP Stack. Because of this basis, it benefits from the considerable security work done by the OP Labs team and the larger Optimism community. Coinbase&#8217;s Protocol Security team performed an internal examination to improve the security of the OP Stack.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-1024x512.png" alt="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch" class="wp-image-199042" srcset="https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-1024x512.png 1024w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-300x150.png 300w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-768x384.png 768w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-360x180.png 360w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-750x375.png 750w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240-1140x570.png 1140w, https://coincu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-2240.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" title="Coinbase Layer-2 Network Base Is Ready For Mainnet Launch 22"></a></figure></div>


<p>The Protocol Security team has worked closely with OP Labs over the last six months to strengthen the security of the layer 2 and Optimism. This involved reviewing all Optimism pre-deployments and contracts on both L1 and L2 to discover technological stack vulnerabilities and dangers.</p>



<p>On June 29, the team announced that the Optimism-powered, Ethereum-secured network had passed its second-to-last criterion for deployment.</p>



<p>A &#8220;Regolith&#8221; hard fork in testnet, a successful infrastructure assessment with OP Labs (the team behind Optimism), and Optimism&#8217;s &#8220;Bedrock&#8221; update was the other three requirements that were met.</p>



<p>Base engaged the larger community in advance of the mainnet launch by hosting a public smart contract audit contest on Code4rena. This competition challenged security researchers to identify and disclose defects in any area of the OP Stack. This challenge drew over 100 security researchers, and no notable vulnerabilities were uncovered.</p>



<p>Optimism&#8217;s node software, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalency flaws, bridge vulnerabilities, and several smart contract concerns were among the audits studied by security experts.</p>



<p>Base is also developing a smart contract security screening tool to assist developers in reducing the likelihood of inserting a security vulnerability into their contracts. This tool allows developers to rapidly and efficiently scan their contracts and get findings from numerous open-source vulnerability detection tools, including Coinbase&#8217;s proprietary secure trait analyzer.</p>

<p>In addition to safeguarding the core OP Stack codebase, the network is working on an open-source monitoring tool, Pessimism, to give timely reporting of protocol and network irregularities. This tool will be used in conjunction with current OP Labs monitoring tools, Coinbase&#8217;s in-house blockchain monitoring capabilities, and third-party solutions.</p>

<p>CME group has announced the launch of Ether/Bitcoin Ratio (EBR) futures contract. This new contract will allow market participants to efficiently execute a relative value trade between Ether futures and Bitcoin futures contracts in a single trade. The EBR futures contract will enable investors to access cryptocurrency exposure without the need to take a directional view.</p>



<p>The CME Globex ticker for the new futures contract is EBR, where the ratio is defined as Ether futures price divided by the Bitcoin futures price. The ratio will be calculated using the same expiration month for the underlying Ether and Bitcoin futures contract. The ratio will always be positive and will be available across all listed contract months. The notional value of the contract is found by multiplying the ratio by $1,000,000.</p>



<p>Ether/Bitcoin Ratio futures allow traders to efficiently express a view on the relative value of the two cryptocurrencies without a directional bias on the overall cryptocurrency market. This feature makes the EBR futures contract a promising tool for hedging and risk management purposes in the cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>The EBR Final Settlement price is found by dividing the Ether futures Final Settlement Price by the Bitcoin futures Final Settlement Price. This feature ensures the settlement of the futures contract at a fair value.</p>
