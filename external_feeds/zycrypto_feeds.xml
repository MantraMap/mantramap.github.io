<p>In a recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACidaZdlrGI"> interview with Bloomberg</a>, Cathie Wood, the CEO and CIO of Ark Invest, shared some insights on the potential impact of Bitcoin ETFs on the market. Wood stated the announcement from BlackRock regarding its filing for a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">spot Bitcoin ETF</a> in June had caused the price to move upward but has been steady since. She said it was quite remarkable that the Bitcoin price went from $19,000 to $30,000 during a regional banking crisis.</p>



<p>According to Wood, Bitcoin is attractive because of its ability to protect against inflation and asset confiscation, as well as its resilience to counterparty risk. This is why Bitcoin saw an inflow due to its decentralized and transparent characteristics, providing a safe haven among mounting counterparty anxieties.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Wood projects that the impending date of August 13th will likely pass with the SEC possibly delaying the approval of Ark’s Bitcoin ETF. She believes that if the SEC authorises a spot Bitcoin ETF, it would likely approve many at once, emphasizing the need for excellent marketing and communication tactics in separating them. <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ark-invests-spot-bitcoin-etf-to-get-ruling-in-6-days-heres-what-market-players-are-saying/">Ark Invest</a>, for its part, has been releasing monthly Bitcoin insights, as well as initiating Bitcoin brainstorming sessions to emphasize its research depth and commitment. Wood said the firm was the first asset manager to gain exposure to Bitcoin in 2015.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-the-sec-shifting-its-stance"><strong>Is the SEC shifting its stance?</strong></h2>



<p>Wood pointed out that the SEC has lost some recent court cases challenging its regulation efforts. She said that even though SEC chair Gary Gensler claims that 5 commissioners vote, “one assumes that the way that Gary votes is the way the SEC will vote” since 2 commissioners are each Republican and Democrats. His comments could highlight Gensler distancing himself a little from crypto enforcement actions, which may ultimately benefit the industry.</p>



<p>However, Wood criticized the contradicting approach by the SEC and questioned the decision-making around the approval of a Bitcoin futures ETF while remaining opposed to a spot Bitcoin ETF. She finds it perplexing how the former, which involves counterparty risk, gained approval while the latter, backed one-to-one by Bitcoin in cold storage, did not.</p>



<p>She said, “There&#8217;s counterparty risk there that you would not have with a Bitcoin ETF, which is backed one-to-one with Bitcoin in Coinbase&#8217;s cold storage, it still confounds me.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, the SEC approving a spot Bitcoin ETF may have stopped people investing in FTX, which is now in all sorts of legal trouble.</p>

<p>With a significant 24-hour trading volume of $3.3 billion, as reported by CoinGecko, a group of 48 tokens, potentially categorized as securities by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), holds a substantial combined market capitalization of $91 billion. The list features well-known coins such as Binance Coin (BNB), Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), Polygon (Matic), and Cosmos (ATOM), to name just a few. Major players like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP are absent from the list.</p>



<p>XRP is, of course, the only cryptocurrency <a href="https://zycrypto.com/ripple-to-expand-presence-in-u-s-market-after-xrp-court-win-top-executive-reveals-big-plans/">with regulatory clarity</a> backed by a Judge&#8217;s ruling. However, previous statements by the SEC revealed that, in its view, anything other than Bitcoin is a security. As the SEC chair, Gary Gensler, famously said: “Crypto financial assets have the key attributes of a security,” and <em>“the investing public is hoping for a return.”</em></p>



<p>The recent lawsuit the SEC brought against Coinbase alleged that 13 crypto assets are securities. Yet, it&#8217;s important to acknowledge that the SEC&#8217;s classification doesn&#8217;t necessarily equate to the ultimate truth. After all, the SEC is a federal agency tasked with regulating securities, not defining them. Crypto lawyer John E. Deaton highlighted that even the SEC admitted that only courts have the authority to validate the SEC&#8217;s claims.</p>



<p>Despite the apparent clarity after the XRP ruling, the distinction between securities and non-securities remains ambiguous. While other countries such as Singapore, the UK and recently the EU with MiCA provide clarity for the crypto industry, the US still believes the “rules of the road are clear”, as Gensler has put it.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, industry observers assert that these rules remain far from clear. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, emphasized the SEC&#8217;s limited role, saying that “not all roads lead to the SEC”. Alderoty said the SEC’s approach to regulating crypto was a political power play.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, stated in front of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy and Credit that regulation based on categories was the wrong approach to dealing with decentralized systems.</p>



<p>“Principles-based regulation, which is more flexible, can adapt and evolve alongside the nascent technology without strangling an industry that has only started and forcing companies abroad,” Hoskinson said.</p>



<p>In his view, many, if not most, cryptocurrencies do not fall in the category of securities or commodities but are rather a new asset class that has its own distinct features. Therefore, he believes we need first to answer what regulation needs to achieve &#8211; whether it&#8217;s safeguarding investors, ensuring market stability, or addressing matters like sanctions compliance.</p>

<p>Binance, the industry’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has scored two licenses for providing crypto-related services to residents of El Salvador. This makes the Bitcoin-friendly Latin American nation the 18<sup>th</sup> market where Binance has received a regulatory nod.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-in-el-salvador-positive-for-regulatory-pursuit"><strong>Binance In El Salvador: Positive For Regulatory Pursuit</strong></h2>



<p>Binance today has <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/binance-becomes-first-fully-licensed-crypto-exchange-in-el-salvador-348306456147004721">received </a>a Bitcoin Services Provider License (BSP) and Digital Assets Services Provider license (DASP) from El Salvador&#8217;s Central Reserve Bank and the country’s National Commission of Digital Assets.</p>



<p>These new licenses will let Binance offer custodial services, process crypto payments, provide digital wallets, and operate a crypto asset exchange platform within the Central American nation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Binance?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Binance</a> is now El Salvador’s first fully licensed crypto exchange! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f8-1f1fb.png" alt="🇸🇻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><br><br>With this, Binance has approvals and registrations in 18 markets worldwide, more than any other crypto exchange, including France, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Dubai.<a href="https://t.co/BITj9zxdcZ">https://t.co/BITj9zxdcZ</a></p>&mdash; Binance (@binance) <a href="https://twitter.com/binance/status/1688916994886959104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2023</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Daniel Acosta, Binance’s general manager for Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean, noted that the “licenses allow Binance to expand the products and services offered, including options tailored to the needs of our customers in El Salvador.&#8221; In other words, the regulatory approval means Binance can operate fully and legally in a very Bitcoin-friendly nation.</p>



<p>El Salvador has long displayed a pro-crypto stance, having been the first country in the world to <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-officially-becomes-legal-tender-in-el-salvador-country-secures-first-400-btc-purchase/">adopt Bitcoin as legal tender</a> alongside the U.S. dollar in September 2021. In January of 2023, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador passed a Digital Securities Law that created a framework for the nation to launch Bitcoin-backed government bonds, enabling El Salvador to develop its own Bitcoin city.</p>



<p>Binance has become the first crypto exchange to receive a green light from the NCDA to operate an exchange within El Salvador.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-forges-on-despite-regulatory-woes"><strong>Binance Forges On Despite Regulatory Woes</strong></h2>



<p>The positive regulatory news in El Salvador comes as Binance has found itself squarely in the regulators’ sights and the subject of high-profile lawsuits unveiled in recent months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-vs-binance-clash-of-titans-in-the-crypto-world/">sued </a>Binance and its boss Changpeng Zhao for violating federal security laws. Binance could also face fraud charges from the Justice Department, although prosecutors have concerns about the risk of an FTX-style bank run.</p>



<p>The world’s largest crypto exchange has additionally announced the termination of its operations in Austria, the Netherlands, Cyprus, and Germany after failing to secure operating licenses there.</p>



<p>Despite these hurdles, Binance continues to be ruthless in its pursuit of regulatory nods across the globe. Adding El Salvador’s licensing, the exchange has secured approval in 18 countries, including Italy, Sweden, Spain, France, Dubai, and most recently Japan.</p>

<p>Cardano, currently the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has recently witnessed a resurgence of whales as on-chain transactions reach a significant six-month peak.</p>



<p>According to data from prominent crypto analytics firm Santiment, whales and sharks holding between 100,000 to 10 million ADA accumulated back to their highest level since September 2022. Simultaneously, the firm reported on Tuesday that <a href="https://zycrypto.com/cardano-ada-network-achieves-zero-downtime-milestone-amidst-high-user-engagement/">Cardano</a> experienced a steady rise in on-chain transaction volume over the past six months, with over 67 billion ADA tokens being transacted, marking the highest volume since September 21.</p>



<p>This recent influx of such significant amounts of ADA tokens being moved has the potential to influence the ADA token&#8217;s price significantly to the highly-coveted $1 price. However, despite the substantial transaction volume, ADA&#8217;s price exhibited a rather neutral performance, displaying a mere 4% drop over the past seven days.</p>



<p>The absence of significant price fluctuations amidst the increase in transaction volume suggests large ADA holders might be moving their tokens to other addresses or converting them into different assets. Such actions frequently contribute to price stability, as buying pressure offsets selling pressure.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the whales may be solely transferring their assets without any intention to sell. They could prepare for future transactions, diversify their portfolios across multiple addresses, or safeguard their holdings.</p>



<p>The occurrence of high-value transactions underscores the trust and confidence that large investors have in the potential of the Cardano network.</p>



<p>However, despite the notable developments, Cardano&#8217;s network usage has declined, leading to heightened ADA price volatility. According to data by Messari, active users on the network decreased from over 60,208 in the first quarter to 57,821 in the second one. This decrease raises concerns for bullish investors, indicating reduced interest from mass market users in conducting transactions. </p>



<p>Consequently, the ADA price has been on a downtrend, reflecting the impact of the decreased demand. The <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-wants-sec-lawsuit-tossed-out-says-crypto-falls-outside-the-regulators-purview/">SEC&#8217;s charges</a> against Binance US and Coinbase in early June worsened the cryptocurrency&#8217;s situation, which also implicated various crypto assets, including <a href="https://zycrypto.com/far-from-securities-solana-polygon-and-cardano-issue-solid-statements-against-sec-claims/">ADA, as potential securities</a>. As a consequence of these regulatory developments, ADA experienced a significant price drop, with ADA&#8217;s value dipping on June 9 from $0.318 to $0.238 (25% decline) within a mere 24 hours. This drastic decline further triggered a series of liquidations on DeFi borrowing protocols, exacerbating the crypto market&#8217;s uncertainties.</p>



<p>ADA was trading at $0.30 at press time, after a 4.44% increase in the past twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The U.S. SEC could rule on ARK Invest’s spot Bitcoin ETF filing in less than a week. The ruling has been highly anticipated by cryptocurrency investors and traders alike, especially as market players are convinced that the ruling could have a significant impact on the entire cryptocurrency market.</p>



<p>As the SEC stated in a Federal Register filed on the 15th of June, August 13th has been set <em>“as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove the proposed rule change.”</em></p>



<p>Alternatively, the SEC could push the deadline up by 240 days and go as far as delaying its final response until January 10th, 2024, for Ark’s ETF application.</p>



<p>However, as the market awaits a response from the regulatory body, sentiments from cryptocurrency investors and prominent finance figures have remained mixed.</p>



<p>Notably, James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas, two Research Analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, are convinced that there is a <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">65% chance that the SEC will green-light a Bitcoin Spot ETF</a>. </p>



<p>They, however, went on to state that some external bodies can influence the ETF approval process. <em>“Finally, pressure from BlackRock and possibly Democrats could make denying the ETFs politically untenable for Gensler.” </em>They wrote in a tweet.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Edelman, the co-founder of Edelman Financial Engines, is uncertain about the future. However, he remains convinced that a spot Bitcoin ETF is essential for crypto investors in the market. “We would love a bitcoin ETF,” he asserted.</p>



<p>He went on to assert that a spot Bitcoin ETF is the simplest, cheapest, most liquid affordable way to invest in Bitcoin. Edelman also recognizes that there has been consistent pushback from the SEC, as the regulator has rejected every spot Bitcoin ETF application filed for the past 10 years.</p>



<p>Edelman also raised concerns about the SEC&#8217;s refusal to make its rules and regulations transparent and understandable. </p>



<p>“<em>The SEC is refusing to say what we’re allowed to do, but then when we go do things, they’re filing lawsuits saying we shouldn’t have done it’s a lousy way to run commerce and business in America.”</em> He said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding the recently filed ETFs, Edelman has taken the same stance as many other crypto investors who have remained critical of Gary Gensler’s inconsistencies.</p>



<p>For a spot Bitcoin ETF to be approved, Edelman notes that comprehensive crypto legislation has to be passed and remains critical of the SEC, Congress, and CFTCs&#8217; failure to pass the much-needed legislation. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ric Edelman, the founder of the Digital Assets Council of Financial Professionals (DACFP), maintains that the market will not “see a spot bitcoin ETF any time soon.”</p>

<p>An anonymous individual using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) pseudonym &#8220;nd4.eth&#8221; recently sent a substantial 2,500 ETH, equating to roughly $4.5 million, to a burn address. This incident, which transpired on July 26, has captivated the cryptocurrency community, prompting many to ponder the rationale behind this significant burn.</p>



<p>The occurrence came to light on August 6 when “degeneratewisdom”, a blockchain analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/degenwisdom69/status/1688216196683034624">tweeted</a> the query: <em>&#8220;Can anyone on here explain this tx to me Looks like nd4.eth sent 2500 ETH to a dead address. Doesn&#8217;t look like a noob error either. Thoughts?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This tweet thrust nd4.eth&#8217;s substantial 2500 ETH transfer to an inactive address into the spotlight, prompting speculation within the crypto community about the underlying intention behind this deliberate and seemingly calculated move.</p>



<p>The concept of &#8220;burning&#8221; tokens entails sending tokens to an address where they are rendered permanently unspendable, thereby diminishing the overall supply of the specific cryptocurrency. However, the reasoning behind nd4.eth&#8217;s decision to annihilate such a sizable sum of <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">Ethereum</a> remains veiled in obscurity.</p>



<p>Laurence Day, the innovator behind the Wildcat Protocol, infused an element of humour into the situation, tweeting, &#8220;<em>If you didn&#8217;t arise this morning and express gratitude to nd4.eth for contributing to the ultrasound money narrative, I urge you to engage in profound introspection regarding your objectives.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Delving deeper into the incident, analysts from the on-chain analysis company Lookonchain disclosed additional particulars about the persona behind nd4.eth.</p>



<p><em>“The guy who transferred 2,500 $ETH($4.58M) to a dead address on July 26th is a whale with 34,287 $GMX($1.84M) and 311,003 $GNS($1.43M). He spent 5,330 $DAI to buy $GMX and $GNS on July 29 and also transferred 34.9 $GMX ($1,989) and 600 $GNX ($2,733) to the dead address,</em>” Lookonchain wrote on Monday.</p>



<p>While the exact motives of the address owner are still unknown, accidentally sending crypto or NFTs to a burn address has occurred before, albeit occasionally. Last March, an NFT collector called Brandon Riley accidentally sent his CryptoPunk #685, purchased for 77 ETH ($129,437), to a burn address while attempting to wrap it for trading on NFTfi. The irreversible error wiped out a third of Riley&#8217;s net worth. Although unrecoverable, Riley&#8217;s CryptoPunk was &#8220;resurrected&#8221; as a Bitcoin ordinal on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Last September, cryptocurrency exchange Kucoin accidentally sent a substantial amount of Ethereum (ETH), valued at tens of millions of dollars, to the Ethereum burn address. This unexpected move, spanning over three days and involving more than 3,500 USDT and ETH transactions, left the cryptocurrency community puzzled with the exact motive behind this burn remaining unknown.</p>

<p>Global payments behemoth PayPal is bolstering its crypto game with the launch of its native dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD, in conjunction with Paxos.</p>



<p>According to the August 7 announcement, the Ethereum-based token will be “gradually” made available to PayPal users in the United States. PayPal USD is expected to become &#8220;a part of the overall payments infrastructure,&#8221; PayPal CEO Dan Schulman reportedly told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-07/paypal-launches-us-dollar-stablecoin-pyusd-for-payments-transfers"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paypal-dives-deeper-into-crypto-payments-with-pyusd-launch"><strong>PayPal Dives Deeper Into Crypto Payments With PYUSD Launch</strong></h2>



<p>PayPal has made a huge move into the stablecoin sector with the launch of its very own digital asset.</p>



<p>PayPal USD (PYUSD) is fully backed by short-term Treasuries, U.S. dollar deposits, and cash equivalents, as per the company’s <a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2023-08-07-PayPal-Launches-U-S-Dollar-Stablecoin">press release</a>. The token will be issued by New York-headquartered crypto financial services firm Paxos Trust on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC-20 token.</p>



<p>The stablecoin allows users to conduct transfers within the platform and with supported external wallets. The dollar-denominated token can also be used for purchases and swap for other assets, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash on the PayPal platform.</p>



<p>PayPal introducing a stablecoin could spur its efforts to become a crypto payment giant, an endeavor the company <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-clocks-fresh-2020-high-after-paypal-reveals-plans-to-allow-customers-buy-sell-and-hold-crypto/">began </a>in 2020 after making way for cryptocurrency payments on the platform.</p>



<p>&#8220;The shift toward digital currencies requires a stable instrument that is both digitally native and easily connected to fiat currency like the U.S. dollar,&#8221; PayPal president and CEO Dan Schulman posited in the statement. &#8220;Our track record delivering new experiences to our customers, provides the foundation necessary to contribute to the growth of digital payments through PayPal USD.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The stablecoin further offers compatibility with a wide range of developers, wallets, and Web3 applications:</p>



<p>“Most of the current volume of stablecoins is used in web3-specific environments — PayPal USD will be compatible with that ecosystem from day one and will soon be available on Venmo.”</p>



<p>While there are numerous stablecoins available in the cryptocurrency market, PayPal USD will be the first launched by a major U.S. financial institution. PayPal indicated that though services and availability of PYUSD begin today, the rollout is expected to continue in the coming weeks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paxos-to-publish-monthly-reserve-reports-for-paypal-usd"><strong>Paxos To Publish Monthly Reserve Reports For PayPal USD</strong></h2>



<p>On the transparency front, Paxos will be publishing public monthly reserve reports for PayPal USD defining the instruments comprising the stablecoin’s reserves starting September 2023.</p>



<p>Moreover, Paxos will be required to publish public third-party attestations of the value of the stablecoin’s reserve assets. This attestation will be provided by an independent third-party accounting company and executed per attestation criteria developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).</p>



<p>The news of PayPal’s stablecoin launch comes after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://zycrypto.com/stablecoin-issuer-paxos-ceases-busd-issuance-after-sec-reportedly-threatens-lawsuit/">planned </a>to launch a lawsuit against its crypto partner Paxos for breaking investor protection laws.</p>

<p>Adam Back, the CEO of the blockchain technology company, Blockstream, has placed a high-stakes bet on the future price of Bitcoin. </p>



<p>Taking to Twitter on Saturday, Back confidently stated that Bitcoin will reach and potentially surpass the $100,000 mark by the next halving event, scheduled for March 31st, 2024.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Another Bet is ON! I predict that Bitcoin will reach or surpass $100k by the next halving on March 31st, 2024.&#8221;</em> He <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1687867034158440448">wrote</a>.</p>



<p>The tweet didn&#8217;t just stand as a proclamation, it quickly escalated into a friendly wager. Another prominent figure in the crypto space, “Vikingo”, took the bait and engaged in the bet. If Adam Back&#8217;s prediction proves accurate and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/michael-saylors-plan-to-sell-additional-equity-for-bitcoin-investment-proves-ultra-bullish-for-btc/">Bitcoin</a> indeed soars to $100,000 or beyond by the next halving, Vikingo will owe Back one million satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin. Currently, the said satoshis have a market value of around $291. However, if Back&#8217;s prediction falls short, the CEO will owe Vikingo the same amount.</p>



<p>During a Twitter space discussion, Vikingo later expressed doubt about Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to exceed the $50,000 mark by year-end. </p>



<p>“<em>I don’t think we are going back to $12,000. I think we might see another chance at the bottom, so it&#8217;s $ 15,800 around there. I still believe we can shoot up now going into Christmas. We can get to like $50,000-$55,000 but we are not going higher than that and were going to go back,”</em> he said.</p>



<p>The bet generated considerable buzz on social media, with supporters and sceptics weighing in on the prospects of Bitcoin&#8217;s future value. Many were intrigued by the timing of Back&#8217;s prediction, aligning it with the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-primed-for-gargantuan-rally-ahead-of-2024-halving-says-market-analyst/">halving event</a>, which occurs approximately every four years and has historically led to significant price movements in the cryptocurrency markets.</p>



<p> The halving process reduces the reward miners receive for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. This mechanism controls the supply of new Bitcoins, theoretically contributing to price appreciation over time.</p>



<p>This is not the first time Back has made such bold predictions for Bitcoin. Back in February, the pundit <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1624844122363244544">explored</a> the &#8220;bitcoin 2x&#8217;s per year on average,&#8221; claim revealing that over the decade spanning January 2013 to December 2022, Bitcoin witnessed an annual growth of 2.036 times (a staggering 1200x increase in a decade).</p>



<p>In his view, if this trajectory persists, projections indicate that Bitcoin could surpass the remarkable milestones of $10 million per BTC and a $200 trillion market capitalization within the next two halvings, approximately over the course of nine years.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has continued to trade sideways in recent weeks, reflecting a persistent struggle to break free from established bounds.</p>



<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s repeated failures to surmount the $30,000-$31,000 resistance range since mid-July has now painted a picture of mounting tension between buyers and sellers as experts offer divergent predictions about the trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>



<p>According to Michaël van de Poppe, the CEO of Amsterdam-based MN Trading Group, most bears are currently targeting a potential crash to $12,000 while bulls are debating the possibilities of a pre-halving peak reminiscent of 2019 or even new all-time highs.</p>



<p>Sharing his perspective in a Thursday tweet, Poppe dismissed the idea of a dip to $12,000, citing the current landscape and altcoin trends. According to the pundit, altcoin investors have faced a prolonged period of downward movement, with the bear market spanning over two years, making it the longest-lasting bear cycle for cryptocurrencies.</p>



<p>“<em>Bitcoin pairs are on cycle lows, sentiment is on the ground, but that doesn’t mean that we’ll need to continue moving downwards from here. Bitcoin’s price is slowly crawling upwards from Bitcoin at $15K, after a period of severe attacks on the markets,</em>” wrote Poppe.</p>



<p>He further noted that the current market cycle phase could be likened to the &#8220;second stage of capitulation&#8221;, a period characterized by a seeming lack of action and potential disillusionment. According to Poppe, investors need to stay patient while this stage might appear uneventful. Just as the market once anticipated Bitcoin&#8217;s drop to $2,000 in 2019, that similar scepticism paved the way for a mega bull run.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/o8jHNp_tF88yyOZ-v_VkVN5SG-Ghqq3Ev4SjorquROFlPXDoQD5Fcu_0DA7eGFgVUEkzQxtJXTNxGGY6LzeLB-HnnKgamdemIDBUsoGgPfeYKVHlsbm1ykpEne6cOJ9Sr87xYGza9IfFn3i0BWbkwA" alt=""/></figure>



<p>While acknowledging that certain recent market challenges can be traced back to blockchain ecosystem attacks and regulatory pressures in 2022, Poppe also pointed out a noteworthy development: the concurrent involvement of established financial players such as BlackRock, Valkyrie, and Invesco. These entities have been actively venturing into the cryptocurrency realm through <a href="https://zycrypto.com/why-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-odds-just-shot-up-according-to-bloomberg/">proposals for ETFs</a> and creating proprietary exchanges. This concerted entry by traditional finance is anticipated to exert upward pressure on prices.</p>



<p><em>“The big institutions are jumping in, and the wisest thing you can do is to follow them</em>,” he advised.</p>



<p>BitQuant, another analyst, echoed the sentiment of a market divided between bears and bulls. According to him, while bears envision a dramatic drop to $12,000, bulls are split into two camps. One group anticipates a pre-halving peak similar to the 2019 pattern, while the other envisions new record highs for Bitcoin.</p>



<p><em>“If one (group) aligns with the notion of a 2019-like peak, it might be prudent to await a rise to $60K before persuading others to sell. This approach may not be ideal, but it would be rationale,”</em> he wrote.</p>



<p>At press time, BTC was trading just under $29,040, with its position remaining relatively unchanged in the last 24 hours and its movement confined within a narrow range of $500 for about two weeks.</p>

<p>Late Tuesday, software developer MicroStrategy filed a prospectus supplement stating intentions to sell up to $750 million worth of stock with the intention to buy more Bitcoin, among other things.</p>



<p><em>“We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and working capital, and, subject to market conditions” the filing on the SEC site read, and that MicroStrategy had “not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for any of these purposes.”</em></p>



<p>Michael Saylor, the Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin, steadily <a href="https://zycrypto.com/microstrategy-to-acquire-more-bitcoin-using-750m-stock-sale-proceeds/">increasing the company’s Bitcoin holdings</a> regardless of market conditions. Saylor firmly believes as more and more people understand the promise of BTC, the price is set to skyrocket. He has made claims in the past of Bitcoin reaching 1 million US dollars per Bitcoin. He believes that all financial value worldwide would be eventually stored in Bitcoin.</p>



<p>MicroStrategy released its Q.2 report on the same day as the filing, revealing significant developments in its Bitcoin holdings. During the quarter, the company acquired 12,800 bitcoins at an average price of $28,233 per bitcoin, totalling $361.4 million. As of July 31, 2023, their total bitcoin holdings reached 152,800 bitcoins, acquired for a total cost of $4.53 billion, with an average price of $29,672 per bitcoin.</p>



<p>Despite a 1% year-over-year decrease in Total Revenues, which amounted to $120.4 million, the company saw positive growth in some areas. Software Licenses Revenues experienced a 4% increase year-over-year, amounting to $35.4 million, while Subscription Services Revenues surged by 42% year-over-year, totalling $19.9 million.</p>



<p>In the second quarter, MicroStrategy also reported an impairment charge of $24.1 million on its bitcoin holdings, reflecting a decline in bitcoin prices compared to the price at which the bitcoins were acquired. This charge is significantly lower than the impairment charges of $917.8 million in the year-ago quarter and $18.9 million in Q1.</p>



<p>Michael Saylor, who once called Bitcoin a “bank in cyberspace”, has amassed so much of it that MicroStrategy is now one of the largest holders of the number one cryptocurrency, among other big holders like the Winklevoss twins and enigmatic Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>



<p>Bitcoin had seemingly reacted to the filing and was inching close to the $30,000 mark, touching $29,987 before retracting to $29,095 at the time of writing, according to data from CoinMarketCap, still an impressive gain of 2.3% in 24 hours.</p>

<p>The Republic of Palau and Ripple have taken a significant step toward the future of digital currency with the launch of their limited stablecoin pilot. The partnership began in 2021 and aimed to explore potential use cases for the Palau Stablecoin (PSC), linked to the U.S. Dollar, on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The XRPL is a carbon-neutral variant of a blockchain using the so-called decentralized ledger technology known for its secure and private transactions, making it an ideal platform for settling and providing liquidity to tokenized assets.</p>



<p>As per Businesswire reporting, the pilot program, which will be implemented gradually, will involve the participation of roughly 200 government workers and local business owners. Palau will use the Ripple CBDC Platform, an end-to-end solution created to assist central banks in issuing their digital currencies, as part of this regulated stablecoin trial. Thanks to the platform, Palau will also be able to control and tailor all aspects of the stablecoin&#8217;s life cycle, including distribution and transactions.</p>



<p>A stablecoin is a digital asset pegged to a commodity or currency, maintaining a stable price; in the case of PSC, it will be issued on the XRPL with a 1:1 reserve in USD. The Republic of Palau&#8217;s Ministry of Finance (MOF) will oversee the trial, closely monitor it around the clock, and remain responsible for issuing and redeeming stablecoin units.</p>



<p>Surangel S. Whipps, Jr., president of the Republic of Palau, declared his support for digitizing the local currency. He said that it would enhance financial transactions and give residents more authority.</p>



<p>He said, “We trust in Ripple’s long-standing expertise in CBDCs and blockchain technology, as well as the carbon-neutral XRP Ledger to help create our national digital currency that will offer our citizens greater financial success.”</p>



<p>The staff of the Palauan government who volunteer for the project will get an allocation of PSC for usage during the pilot during the program&#8217;s first stage. The Palau Stablecoin is expected to bring numerous benefits to citizens, merchants, and the government alike. These advantages include greater financial inclusion, reduced transaction fees for citizens, and decreased currency costs, ultimately resulting in faster transactions.</p>



<p>The controlled pilot&#8217;s Phase One must satisfy specific requirements for the PSC to succeed and win the people&#8217;s trust of Palau. The MOF must be able to create, distribute, handle incoming redemptions, and eliminate PSC while retaining complete control over its total circulation at all times on a real-time basis, 24/7. Government employees should be able to make purchases using PSC at select retailers, and these retailers should be able to safely receive, verify payments made with PSC, and convert them into funds in their local bank accounts.</p>



<p>Ripple also highlights other benefits to the trial, going beyond financial inclusion and the cost of currency and fast transactions.</p>



<p>“Palau is a Pacific Island nation comprising over 200 volcanic and coral islands, filled with unique wildlife and vegetation. Launching the Palau Stablecoin will help the island reduce their carbon footprint and vulnerability to climate change&#8217;s impacts.” James Wallis, VP of Central Bank Engagements for Ripple, said in a statement.</p>



<p>The successful implementation of Phase One will pave the way for subsequent phases of the Palau Stablecoin, which are planned to be rolled out later this year. The introduction of the PSC represents a significant advancement for Palau as it embraces the potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies, positioning itself as a pioneer in the blockchain frontier while preserving its unique natural beauty and culture as an island paradise.</p>

<p>Shannon Thorp, a renowned Wells Fargo Analyst, recently shared a bold forecast for XRP, the native digital asset of the Ripple network, on Twitter.</p>



<p>Drawing on her meticulous calculations and considering various factors, Thorp presented a conservative short-term price <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-price-to-10-by-september-market-watchers-outline-bullish-trajectory-amid-ripples-big-win/">prediction for XRP</a>, suggesting that its value could range between $100 and $500 in the near short term (the next four to seven months).</p>



<p>To arrive at this prediction, Thorp considered several key variables that could influence XRP&#8217;s future, including an analysis of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulation and adoption by banks, liquidity providers, and governments. By evaluating these aspects, she projected the potential liquidity strength (LS) of XRP, suggesting it could reach trillions of dollars if widely utilized across various financial institutions.</p>



<p>The pundit also took into account the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/xrp-verdict-ripple-chief-legal-officer-confident-in-another-win-should-sec-choose-to-appeal/">recent ruling</a> in the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit, the recent FedNow announcement, and the proposed crypto regulation bill currently under Senate consideration, which according to her, are a step in the right direction for XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Additionally, she emphasized the importance of XRP&#8217;s application in messaging and settling as crucial in determining its trajectory.</p>



<p>Thorp&#8217;s prediction wasn&#8217;t solely based on charts and technical analysis; she underscored the significance of considering XRP&#8217;s potential utility and widespread adoption. According to Thorp, XRP&#8217;s rapid settlement times and low transaction fees make it a promising candidate for cross-border transactions and various other financial applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-addressing-divisions-within-the-xrp-community"><strong>Addressing Divisions within the XRP Community</strong></h2>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the bold price prediction, Thorp expressed concerns about the XRP community’s differing approaches to predicting its future.</p>



<p><em>“In my opinion, now more than ever I see a divided XRPArmy! One side looking at only charts, taking cues from the past and trends that follow Bitcoin to draw short term price predictions. Whilst others cling to utility, believing that partnerships and the replacement of antiquated systems will drive price,”</em> she wrote. </p>



<p><em>“XRP, for those not in the know is NOT a security! Why would we continue to pretend it is and make price predictions based on “Securities” in the crypto space? This logic seems counter intuitive and holds back what the team Ripple set off to do so many years ago.”</em></p>



<p>Thorp then challenged both approaches, asserting that neither has proven fully accurate and encouraged a broader perspective to unlock the true potential of XRP.</p>



<p>That said, Thorp&#8217;s positive forecast for XRP&#8217;s future underscores the rising significance of XRP in the global financial landscape. The increasing demand for XRP from banks using it for wire transfers, coupled with the limited supply of around 50 billion out of 100 billion, is expected to drive a substantial price increase. Moreover, developments like Ripple&#8217;s recent creation of a mortgage branch on the XRP ledger add further impetus to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s upward trajectory.</p>

<p>In a bold move, Coinbase has requested the court to throw out a lawsuit lodged against it in June by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>The San Francisco-based digital asset exchange said in an August 4 court filing that the SEC’s “claims must be dismissed” because “the subject matter falls outside the agency’s delegated authority.” Coinbase noted that Judge Analisa Torres’ recent decision with Ripple bolsters their argument.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-violated-due-process"><strong>“SEC Violated Due Process”</strong></h2>



<p>Lawyers representing Coinbase have filed a motion to dismiss the SEC lawsuit. They accused the SEC of exceeding its regulatory authority and engaging in regulatory overreach.</p>



<p>The regulator in June <a href="https://zycrypto.com/coinbase-suffers-double-whammy-as-sec-and-state-regulators-act-against-exchange-for-unregistered-securities/">slapped </a>America’s largest crypto exchange with a suit, alleging that it operated for years as an unlicensed securities exchange. The SEC even went ahead to name 13 tokens as examples of coins it believed qualified as securities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coinbase is now arguing that none of the digital assets and services it offers are securities.“Because as a matter of law none of them [crypto assets] are, the claims must be dismissed,” reads the filing.</p>



<p>&#8220;The transactions over Coinbase’s platform and Prime are not, and do not involve, contractual undertakings to deliver future value reflecting the income, profits, or assets of a business. They are commodity sales, with the obligations on both sides discharged entirely the moment the digital token is delivered in exchange for payment,&#8221; the filing added.</p>



<p>Coinbase further said the SEC had “violated due process, abused its discretion, and abandoned its own earlier interpretations of the securities laws” in claiming certain regulatory control over the exchange. According to the crypto company, the SEC’s challenges to its staking program “fail as a matter of law.” Coinbase has asked the court to dismiss the case, arguing the SEC’s enforcement action was “punitive” and characterized an overreach in its statutory authority granted by Congress.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-similarity-to-xrp-lawsuit"><strong>Similarity To XRP Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>Coinbase’s motion to dismiss additionally cited last month’s verdict in the Ripple vs SEC case, indicating that the underlying facts were &#8220;substantially identical to those alleged here.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Judge Torres determined that Ripple&#8217;s sales of XRP on exchanges weren&#8217;t securities transactions, but the firm’s direct sales to institutional customers were.</p>



<p>The SEC this year has amplified its crackdown on the crypto sector. This is largely due to its chairperson Gary Gensler&#8217;s assertions that most crypto platforms are selling unregistered securities to clients. Besides Coinbase, the regulator has also taken legal action against <a href="https://zycrypto.com/us-sec-files-fresh-charges-against-binance-and-ceo-changpeng-zhao/">Binance</a>, <a href="https://zycrypto.com/secs-crackdown-on-krakens-staking-program-puts-other-players-on-notice/">Kraken</a>, and Genesis. The SEC has also gone after Tron’s <a href="https://zycrypto.com/trons-trx-plummets-11-after-u-s-sec-sues-justin-sun-for-securities-violations/">Justin Sun</a>, Terraform Labs’ <a href="https://zycrypto.com/do-kwon-terraform-labs-hit-with-sec-lawsuit-alleging-securities-fraud/">Do Kwon</a>, and <a href="https://zycrypto.com/sec-continues-its-regulation-by-enforcement-spree-charges-richard-heart-of-hex-with-1-billion-securities-fraud/">Richard Heart</a> under Gensler’s watch.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu lead developer Shytoshi Kusama has announced plans to mint the remaining BONE tokens and renounce the BONE contract before the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-run-towards-0-001-shib-price-in-play-as-ethereum-to-shibarium-bridge-goes-live-in-beta/">Shibarium launch</a>.</p>



<p>The announcement, which was made in a Thursday blog, said, “<em>With the incoming launch of Shibarium, our own Layer 2 blockchain, and much more, in the next few days you will notice that we will&nbsp;mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the bone contract&nbsp;so that no further minting will be possible.”</em></p>



<p>Kusama further shed light on the significance of the decision, emphasising that it is necessary to kickstart the blockchain, as a substantial portion of BONE will be allocated to validators in the upcoming layer two protocol. Additionally, he noted that BONE would play a crucial role as the token delegators use to claim rewards, as the gas token for Shibarium, and for technology governance within the ecosystem.</p>



<p>As <em>ZyCrypto</em> <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-monster-move-draws-near-amid-imminent-launch-of-shibarium-in-august/">reported</a>, the highly anticipated Shibarium is set to go live after a Toronto conference in August. The platform aims to address scalability and data bottlenecks by bundling off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, thereby reducing fees and data load. Since last week, developers have been actively testing the <a href="https://zycrypto.com/shiba-inu-primed-for-huge-price-outburst-after-shibarium-beta-bridge-goes-live-for-public-testing/">Ethereum Bridge</a>, a crucial part of the project.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s journey to decentralization has been remarkable, as the cryptocurrency rapidly rose to a top 15 position in the market, driven by the power of its community. With Shibarium&#8217;s launch, the ecosystem is poised for further growth, especially in the metaverse and gaming applications, focusing on the thriving NFT sector.</p>



<p>The testnet for Shibarium has already seen significant activity, with millions of transactions from numerous wallets, indicating high demand for the network. Further, to support projects on the new platform, the developers recently announced plans to introduce DoggyDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization governed by token holders.</p>



<p>Shiba Inu, which began as a meme coin, has transformed into a serious project with its blockchain network and DApp ecosystem. The launch of Shibarium is expected to strengthen the fundamentals of the SHIB token, adding to its appeal in the crypto market.</p>



<p>As the crypto world awaits the Shibarium launch, SHIB ecosystem tokens have shown mixed movements, reflecting excitement and uncertainty. Nonetheless, Shiba Inu&#8217;s dedication to decentralization has garnered worldwide attention and support from enthusiasts. Today, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1686152761505685504">tweet</a> how in July, a massive 3.30 trillion SHIB were withdrawn from established exchanges, amounting to about $28 million, which shows increased incentive to hold the cryptocurrency.</p>



<p>With the countdown to Shibarium&#8217;s launch underway, the Shiba Inu community has expressed high hopes that the event will significantly boost the ecosystem&#8217;s token price to $0.001.</p>
